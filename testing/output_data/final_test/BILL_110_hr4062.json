    "content": "The \"Federal Accountability for Nuclear Waste Storage Act of 2007\" is also known as the Dry Cask Storage of Spent Nuclear Fuel Act. It amends the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to include dry cask storage of spent nuclear fuel. In this section, a contractor is defined as a person with a contract under section 302(a) and licensed by the Commission to possess spent nuclear power reactor fuel. A spent nuclear fuel dry cask is a container approved by the Commission for storing and cooling spent nuclear fuel at an independent storage installation. A spent nuclear fuel pool is a water-filled container at a nuclear power site. A contractor must transfer spent nuclear fuel from fuel pools to dry casks at a licensed storage facility on the reactor site within 6 years of enactment. This applies to both existing and future stored fuel. A contractor must transfer spent nuclear fuel from fuel pools to dry casks at a licensed storage facility within 6 years of discharge from a reactor. If funds are insufficient or suitable dry casks are not available, the contractor can request an extension from the Commission. The transfer must be to generally licensed spent nuclear fuel dry casks. The Commission may expedite the review of an application for an independent spent fuel storage license if generally licensed spent nuclear fuel dry casks are unavailable. This expedited review must prioritize public health and safety, common defense and security, and the right to a hearing under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. The Energy Act of 1954 authorizes the Secretary to provide grants for expenses related to independent spent fuel storage, including licensing, construction, fabrication, and security. The Commission must certify safe transfer of spent nuclear fuel to the Secretary. The Energy Act of 1954 authorizes grants for independent spent fuel storage expenses. The Secretary accepts title to spent nuclear fuel dry cask upon certification. The conveyance confers full responsibility for possession, stewardship, and ultimate disposition of the fuel to the Secretary. Upon conveyance of title, the contractor's Commission license for the spent nuclear fuel dry cask will be terminated, and the Secretary will be issued a general license under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission must establish regulations for these licenses within 5 years. The Secretary must establish the capability to carry out specific tasks related to spent nuclear fuel dry cask management within 5 years, ensuring public health and safety. Contracts with licensees may be utilized for task performance, but do not exempt the Secretary from responsibilities. The Secretary must establish the capability for spent nuclear fuel dry cask management within 5 years, using contracts with licensees. The Secretary remains ultimately responsible under subsection (d)(2) and as a licensee of the Commission. Amendments to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act include the use of Waste Fund for costs related to specific sections."
