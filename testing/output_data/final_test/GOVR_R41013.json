    "content": "In 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a woman has the right to choose abortion. States can regulate abortion after fetal viability, with exceptions for the life or health of the mother. Congress responded with the Hyde Amendment in 1976, restricting federal funds for Medicaid abortions. The Hyde Amendment and similar funding restrictions were challenged after their adoption in 1977. The Court concluded that states are not obligated to fund elective abortions under Title XIX of the Social Security Act (Medicaid). States have the freedom to include coverage for elective abortions if they choose to do so. The Court ruled that states participating in the Medicaid program are not required to pay for elective abortions, even if they cover expenses related to childbirth. This decision was based on cases like Roe v. Wade and Poelker v. Doe, where the Court upheld policies favoring childbirth over abortion. In Harris v. McRae, the Court considered restrictions on public funding for abortion, showing a shift in approach from previous cases. In Harris v. McRae, the Court upheld restrictions on governmental funding for medically necessary abortions, finding that the Hyde Amendment did not violate constitutional guarantees. The Court also ruled that states participating in Medicaid can choose to fund only medically necessary abortions for which they receive federal reimbursement. In a related case, the Court determined that a state funding restriction similar to the Hyde Amendment did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. In 1992, the Court established an \"undue burden\" standard for evaluating government restrictions on abortion in Planned Parenthood v. Casey. In Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the Court defined an \"undue burden\" as a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus. The Court suggested that funding restrictions on abortion, like those in previous cases, would not be considered an undue burden. The Court emphasized that laws serving a valid purpose, even if they make it more difficult or expensive to obtain an abortion, may not be invalidated. The Court's abortion funding decisions indicate that the abortion funding provisions in the Affordable Care Act are likely to withstand constitutional challenges. The Act references the Hyde Amendment to differentiate between types of abortions that can be funded with federal HHS appropriations. Funds can be used for abortions in cases of rape, incest, or endangerment to a woman's life, but not for elective abortions. Individuals receiving premium tax credits or subsidies can choose a health plan that covers elective abortions. The Affordable Care Act allows individuals to choose a health plan that covers elective abortions, but payment and accounting requirements are in place to prevent federal funds from being used for such services. Plan issuers can decide whether to provide coverage for elective abortions or abortions funded by federal HHS appropriations. States can also prohibit abortion coverage in exchange plans. At least 20 states have laws restricting abortion coverage in their exchanges. The issuer of a qualified health plan providing coverage for elective abortions must collect separate payments from each enrollee: one for non-abortion health services and another for abortion coverage. These payments must be deposited into separate accounts and used exclusively for their specified services. State health insurance commissioners will ensure compliance with segregation requirements. The issuer of a qualified health plan must comply with segregation requirements for coverage of elective abortions, estimating the cost on an average actuarial basis. The per enrollee, per month cost cannot be less than $1 and must be for the entire covered population. The Affordable Care Act mandates that qualified health plans offering coverage for elective abortions must notify enrollees about this coverage at enrollment. The notice will detail the total cost of elective abortion services and other covered services. Additionally, the Act ensures conscience protection and upholds state and federal abortion-related laws. Exchange plans are prohibited from discriminating against healthcare providers unwilling to provide or cover abortions. State laws on abortion coverage and procedural requirements are not preempted. Federal laws on conscience protection and abortion-related antidiscrimination are unaffected. Executive Order No. 13535 established enforcement mechanisms to prevent federal funds from being used for abortions, except in specific cases. The order directed the development of segregation guidelines for state health insurance commissioners to ensure compliance with the Affordable Care Act. The Executive Order No. 13535 established enforcement mechanisms to prevent federal funds from being used for abortions, except in specific cases. The order also directed the HHS Secretary to ensure compliance with abortion restrictions imposed on community health centers by existing law. $5 billion is appropriated to the HHS Secretary for a high-risk health insurance pool program under the Affordable Care Act, with no specification on what benefits may be subsidized with federal funds. Abortion restrictions do not apply to funds for high-risk pools under Section 1101 of the Affordable Care Act. The Hyde Amendment and HHS regulations also do not seem to apply to these funds. The high-risk health insurance pool program will not be administered by the Public Health Service. Requirements for high-risk pools include those determined appropriate by the Secretary. On July 30, 2010, HHS issued a rule for the Affordable Care Act's high-risk health insurance pool program, stating that abortion services are not covered except in cases of rape, incest, or endangerment to the woman's life. This rule aligns with existing restrictions on Federal funding for abortion services. The rule for the Affordable Care Act's high-risk health insurance pool program, effective July 30, 2010, does not cover abortion services except in cases of rape, incest, or endangerment to the woman's life."
