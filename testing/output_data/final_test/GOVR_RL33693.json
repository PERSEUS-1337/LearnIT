Western Hemisphere countries supply almost half of the US crude oil imports, with Canada, Mexico, and Venezuela being the main suppliers. The region has 321 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, with Canada leading with almost 179 billion barrels. Canada leads the Western Hemisphere with almost 179 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, mainly extracted from Alberta's tar sands. Venezuela follows with 87 billion barrels, not including potentially recoverable deposits from the Orinoco Belt. Other significant oil reserves are held by the United States (21 billion barrels), Brazil and Mexico (12 billion barrels each), Ecuador (5 billion barrels), and potentially Cuba in the Gulf of Mexico. Western Hemisphere nations collectively produce about 17.2 million barrels of oil per day. In 2007, the United States, Mexico, Venezuela, and Canada were top oil producers, collectively producing 17.2 million barrels per day. Production declined in Venezuela and Mexico due to various factors, while Canada and Brazil saw an increase. Brazil is expected to significantly increase its oil reserves and production. The United States is the top consumer of natural gas globally, consuming 23.1 trillion cubic feet in 2007. The United States is the top consumer of natural gas globally, with about 23.1 trillion cubic feet consumed in 2007. Canada accounted for almost all of the 3.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas imported by pipeline, while Trinidad & Tobago supplied 0.5 trillion cubic feet of U.S. LNG imports. The Western Hemisphere has 545 trillion cubic feet of proven natural gas reserves, with the United States holding the largest share at 211 trillion cubic feet. The Western Hemisphere is a major producer of biofuels, with Brazil leading in ethanol production from sugar and the United States from corn. In 2006, the US and Brazil produced 69% of the world's ethanol, with the US being the largest producer. Brazil was the largest source of US ethanol imports in 2006. Other countries in the region also produce ethanol for domestic markets, while some have invested in biodiesel production, such as Colombia focusing on palm oil. Resource nationalism in Latin America has been on the rise due to high oil prices, leading to concerns about access to energy resources and political interference in energy production and investment. This trend is often seen in response to poverty and is strongest in countries where people feel they are not benefiting from their natural resources. Analysts argue that this nationalism is a result of higher energy prices and mirrors actions taken by energy-producing countries worldwide to capture more profits from their resources. Venezuela's government under Hugo Ch\u00e1vez has increased state control over the oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PdVSA), redirecting more profits to fund the government. Resource nationalism in Latin America has been increasing due to high oil prices, with governments like Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru asserting control over their natural resources. This includes nationalizing sectors, capturing windfall profits, and terminating contracts with foreign oil companies. The trend reflects a desire to benefit more from energy resources and address poverty concerns. In Latin America, rising resource nationalism is affecting the energy sector. Countries like Mexico are facing challenges with declining oil reserves and considering opening state-controlled oil production to private and foreign investment. Foreign oil companies in the region are experiencing increased taxes and royalties, potentially slowing down foreign investment. However, some countries like Brazil and Colombia continue to follow a capitalist model for energy investment. In Latin America, there is underinvestment in energy infrastructure, exacerbated by civil conflicts. Concerns arise about competition for energy resources from countries like China and India, with China acquiring interests in exploration and production in the region. China and Venezuela have signed energy-related agreements to increase oil supply. China and India are increasing their energy investments in Latin America. China's Sinopec signed agreements with Brazil's Petrobras for a gas pipeline and is exploring energy deals in Ecuador, Bolivia, Peru, and Colombia. India's ONGC Videsh bought stakes in Brazilian and Cuban oil fields and is discussing investments in Venezuela. Sinopec and ONGC jointly acquired a stake in Colombia's Omimex oil company in 2006. A joint bid was made for a 50% stake in the Omimex oil company of Colombia, a subsidiary of the U.S.-based Omimex Resources energy company. Venezuela is a major supplier of foreign oil to the United States, providing 11.5% of U.S. crude oil imports. There have been tensions in U.S.-Venezuela relations under President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, with concerns raised about democratic institutions and freedom of speech. Under President Ch\u00e1vez, Venezuela has benefited from rising oil prices, leading to increased government revenues and social program spending. The government approved a tax on foreign oil companies when crude oil prices exceed certain thresholds. Venezuela has also asserted greater control over its oil reserves by converting operating agreements into joint ventures with majority ownership by PdVSA. Under President Ch\u00e1vez, Venezuela has benefited from rising oil prices, leading to increased government revenues and social program spending. The government approved a tax on foreign oil companies when crude oil prices exceed certain thresholds. Venezuela has also asserted greater control over its oil reserves by converting operating agreements into joint ventures with majority ownership by PdVSA. Joint ventures with PdVSA holding a majority share of between 60-80% were established, with some agreements voluntarily turned over and others confiscated by the government. Income taxes were raised to 50% and retroactive to 2001, in compliance with a hydrocarbons law. In 2007, the government completed the conversion of four strategic associations involving extra-heavy oil Orinoco River Basin projects, with foreign companies like ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil choosing to leave. ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips left Orinoco Belt projects, while Statoil-Hydro, Total, and Eni signed agreements for potential investments. ExxonMobil had disputes with Venezuela over compensation, leading to court orders freezing Venezuelan assets. A U.S. federal court in New York upheld a freeze of $300 million in PdVSA assets due to concerns about slow foreign investment and production challenges. Despite plans to increase output, doubts remain about PdVSA's ability to operate heavy oil fields in the Orinoco. Venezuela remains a major oil supplier to the United States, with oil accounting for 96% of its exports in 2007. Venezuela heavily relies on oil exports to the United States, with 96% of its exports in 2007. Despite this dependency, President Ch\u00e1vez has threatened to stop selling oil to the U.S. on multiple occasions, citing political tensions and potential conflicts. President Ch\u00e1vez has threatened to stop oil exports to the U.S. if there is a new coup or aggression from the U.S. government. Despite these threats, many believe they are just rhetoric to boost domestic support. In February 2008, Ch\u00e1vez also threatened to cut oil exports if ExxonMobil froze Venezuela's oil assets. However, State Department officials downplayed the threat, noting that Ch\u00e1vez has made similar threats in the past without following through. Some observers question Venezuela's reliability as a major oil supplier due to President Ch\u00e1vez's threats to cut oil exports to the U.S. if attacked. There are concerns about Venezuela turning to China as a replacement market, but challenges include China's limited refining capacity for Venezuela's heavy crude oil and high freight costs. Despite this, PdVSA announced plans to buy oil tankers from China to increase exports to Asia. Venezuela plans to increase oil exports to Asia, with China being a growing market. The U.S. remains Venezuela's most important market for oil exports. A report by the Government Accountability Office warned that a disruption in Venezuelan oil supply could raise world prices and impact the U.S. economy. If Venezuela were to cut oil exports to the United States, it could lead to economic chaos as the country heavily relies on the U.S. oil market for revenue. Bolivia, on the other hand, has the second-largest natural gas reserves in Latin America but lacks the expertise and resources to develop and export them. Technical assistance and foreign direct investment are needed for Bolivia to fully exploit its natural gas reserves. Bolivia's struggle with foreign direct investment (FDI) in its oil and gas sectors, exacerbated by President Evo Morales' nationalization of the gas industry in 2006, has hindered the country's ability to meet domestic gas demand and supply commitments to Argentina and Brazil. Recent investment pledges from state-owned energy companies are expected to boost production by 2009. President Morales has had to moderate the terms of nationalization due to Bolivia's lack of technological and financial capacity. This move raised energy costs for neighboring countries and increased tax and royalty rates. Bolivia's nationalization of the gas industry in 2006 led to raised energy costs for neighboring Argentina and Brazil, causing major foreign investors like Petrobras and Repsol to halt new investments. Bolivia's state-run oil company, YPFB, faced challenges due to lack of expertise and resources, with frequent changes in leadership. Despite this, progress was made as foreign companies signed new contracts for joint ventures and new investors pledged to invest in exploration projects. President Morales authorized YPFB to form partnerships with new state-owned oil and gas companies in 2007. In 2008, state oil companies like Petrobras and Repsol pledged $1.5 billion in investments in Bolivia. Petrobras initiated a $40 million exploration project in southeastern Bolivia. Brazil, a leader in biofuels, may become a major petroleum exporter with recent oil and gas discoveries. Brazil's energy matrix includes hydroelectric power, oil and gas reserves, nuclear energy, and alternative energy programs. Petrobras, a key player in Latin America's energy sector, announced a significant oil discovery in November 2007. In November 2007, Petrobras announced the discovery of one of the world's largest oil fields. Brazil has reduced its dependency on foreign oil imports by becoming the largest consumer and producer of sugar cane ethanol, supplying 40% of the country's motor fuel. The country's ethanol is more efficient and environmentally friendly than corn-based derivatives in the US. Ethanol use has increased since 2003 with the introduction of \"flex fuel\" motors. In 2007, 86% of new vehicles sold in Brazil were flex fuel. Brazil has reduced its dependency on foreign oil imports by becoming the largest consumer and producer of sugar cane ethanol, supplying 40% of the country's motor fuel. However, the expansion of sugarcane production has led to displacement of farmers and human rights concerns. Brazil's over-reliance on natural gas from Bolivia has been a weakness in its energy sector. Petrobras halted new investments in Bolivia and focused on exploiting Brazilian natural gas reserves, leading to the discovery of a large gas field in the Santos Basin. While still investing in Bolivia for short-term needs, Petrobras may reduce investments in the long term. Ecuador's economy heavily relies on oil, with declining production levels affecting economic growth. Petroecuador's production has dropped by 50% in the last decade, leading to a financial crisis due to lack of capital. In the last decade, Petroecuador has faced a deep financial crisis due to a lack of capital, losing $200 million annually in production. President Rafael Correa aims to increase state control over the energy sector, raising the state's share of oil revenues to 99%. Foreign companies operating in Ecuador are concerned about the government's policies, hindering investments in the oil industry. President Correa supports the termination of the contract with Occidental Petroleum in 2006, leading to legal disputes. Mexico is a significant crude oil supplier to the US, with oil playing a crucial role in the Mexican economy through Pemex's contributions to the government's budget. Mexican President L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas nationalized the oil sector in 1938, creating Pemex, which contributes over a third of the federal government's budget. Pemex has faced financial difficulties, with increasing debt and annual operating losses since 1998. Despite opposition to altering government control of the oil sector, concerns arise over declining oil reserves due to insufficient funds for maintenance and exploration. The Cantarell field in the Gulf of Mexico, responsible for two-thirds of Mexico's crude oil production, is in decline. A new oil find in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Veracruz was announced in 2006, potentially holding 10 billion barrels but requiring significant investment. President Calder\u00f3n proposed limited measures to allow Pemex to contract out to foreign companies for exploration and permit private companies to build and operate in the oil sector. President Calder\u00f3n proposed limited measures to allow Pemex to contract out to foreign companies for exploration and permit private companies to build and operate in the oil sector. The proposal faced strong political opposition from the leftist opposition, led by Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who has blockaded Mexico's Congress in protest. Analysts suggest that the lack of profit-sharing in the proposal may deter foreign investment needed to address Pemex's production decline. Most Latin American and Caribbean nations are net energy importers, except for oil and gas producers like Venezuela, Mexico, Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Trinidad and Tobago. Most Caribbean and Central American nations heavily rely on energy imports, especially oil, accounting for over 90% of total energy consumption. Initiatives like Venezuela's preferential oil programs and the Mesoamerican Energy Integration Program aim to address the issue. President Ch\u00e1vez's \"oil diplomacy\" provides oil to Latin American and Caribbean nations on preferential terms, raising concerns about Venezuela's influence in the region. Venezuela's PetroCaribe program, launched in 2005, offers preferential oil supply to Caribbean Basin nations to increase its influence in the region. This program aims to establish a regional oil supply network and development fund, providing 190,000 barrels per day on preferential terms. Venezuela's PetroCaribe program offers preferential oil supply to Caribbean nations, with some exceptions. Venezuela also has agreements with Central American and Andean countries, as well as subsidized oil programs in the United States. Additionally, Venezuela is investing in energy sectors in Latin American countries, including pledging $1.5 billion in Bolivia's gas industry and signing agreements with Ecuador for joint development in oil, gas, refining, and petrochemical sectors. In 2005, PdVSA signed an agreement to build an oil refinery in northeastern Brazil, with construction starting in September 2007. Colombia and Venezuela initiated a gas pipeline project in July 2006. Argentina and Venezuela announced an alliance for cooperation on hydrocarbon exploration. PdVSA also helped refurbish an oil refinery in Cuba and signed an exploration agreement with Cupet. American presidents met in Cancun to sign the Meso-American Energy Integration Program (PIEM), which builds upon the Plan Puebla Panama (PPP) for regional development. Colombia joined the PPP in 2006 and is interested in energy integration projects. The PIEM includes initiatives like the Central American Electrical Connection System (Siepac) funded by the Inter-American Development Bank, connecting Panama to Guatemala. Efforts are also underway to connect Colombia with Panama and Guatemala with Mexico. The Meso-American Energy Integration Program (PIEM) involves constructing a new refinery in Central America, with Mexico supplying most of the crude oil. President Calder\u00f3n stated Mexico can only supply 80,000 bpd for the refinery due to declining reserves. Four companies are developing investment proposals for the project. Alternative energy sources like ethanol and biofuels are being considered to reduce dependence on imported petroleum products in Latin America. Brazil has reduced its dependence on imported petroleum products by increasing ethanol production, becoming a net energy exporter. In 2007, the US and Brazil signed an agreement to promote cooperation on ethanol and biofuels in the Western hemisphere, including technology-sharing and feasibility studies for building biofuels industries in other countries. Progress has been made on all fronts of the agreement since then. High-level visits have occurred to advance research on new biofuels feedstock and improve production and distribution processes. Feasibility studies identified short-term technical assistance opportunities in Haiti, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, and St. Kitts and Nevis, focusing on using biofuels for domestic energy needs. Eight projects will be funded through the U.S.-Brazil biofuels partnership, with support from partners like the IDB. The U.S. and Brazil are working with the International Biofuels Forum to standardize biofuels codes. However, obstacles to increased cooperation exist, such as U.S. tariffs on Brazilian ethanol imports. Some analysts debate the feasibility of ramping up biofuels production in Latin America to reduce oil dependency and promote rural development. The IDB estimates that $200 billion in investments would be needed for biofuels to provide 5% of the region's transport energy by 2020. Concerns include the high investment costs, potential negative effects on the environment and food costs, while others argue that Latin America's climate and surplus of arable land make it ideal for expanding the biofuels industry. Policy analysts recommend prioritizing energy cooperation in the hemisphere, considering energy capacities of nations, and understanding that U.S. energy security is linked to the region's energy security. They suggest exploring the role of foreign sugarcane producers in U.S. energy security by exporting sugar-based fuel ethanol. The Council of the Americas issued specific recommendations for hemispheric energy cooperation in 2005. The Council of the Americas recommended prioritizing hemispheric energy cooperation in order to boost economic development and enhance energy security. They called for increased partnerships in Latin America, improved investment climates, trilateral energy coordination among NAFTA countries, and energy diversification using renewable resources to mitigate supply shortages. The Council of the Americas recommended prioritizing hemispheric energy cooperation to boost economic development and enhance energy security in the Americas. Concerns about the impact of supply shortages and political environments in Latin America prompted studies on long-term oil production, warning against reemerging state control in countries like Venezuela and Ecuador. In Mexico, regulatory barriers and laws prohibiting foreign investment in the energy sector have dampened prospects for increasing oil reserves. The report highlights the risks to long-term energy production in Venezuela, Ecuador, and Mexico due to unfavorable investment climates. Countries like Trinidad and Tobago, which have opened their energy sectors to foreign investment, are expected to see increased reserves and production. Latin American and Caribbean countries are showing interest in biofuels development to reduce greenhouse gases and promote economic growth in rural areas. Countries with potential for biofuels development include Guatemala, Jamaica, Colombia, and Chile. The study examines biofuels production in Latin American and Caribbean countries like Colombia, Chile, and Guatemala. It suggests ways for the IDB to support development, including a biofuels development fund and regulatory frameworks. The CSIS book discusses energy cooperation in the Western Hemisphere, emphasizing the need for regulatory harmonization and improved infrastructure. There is ongoing congressional interest in energy security issues in the Western Hemisphere, focusing on ensuring reliable energy sources for the United States and promoting cooperation among Latin American countries for clean, affordable, and reliable energy sources to support regional growth and development. Members have expressed support for these initiatives. Members have expressed support for developing a cohesive regional energy security framework and have concerns about political instability and resource nationalism in the Western Hemisphere. Congressional hearings in 2006 highlighted the impact of events in Latin America on energy reliability. Senator Richard Lugar introduced the Energy Diplomacy and Security Act of 2006 to increase hemispheric cooperation on energy. At a May 16, 2006 hearing, concerns were raised about the United States being vulnerable to energy manipulation by countries like Iran, Venezuela, Russia, Nigeria, and Bolivia. Representative Stephen F. Lynch also expressed worries about potential retaliatory actions by President Ch\u00e1vez against the U.S. due to his opposition to U.S. policy. David Goldwyn, a private energy analyst, highlighted threats to U.S. interests in Latin America, including asset devaluation and declining oil and gas production. Oil and gas production in Latin America is declining due to resource nationalism, leading to a decrease in U.S. influence in the region. There is a need for improved investment climates to attract foreign investment and boost competitiveness in the energy sectors. Concerns were raised about the negative effects of unpredictable legal frameworks, resource nationalism, and lack of investment in exploration and maintenance on regional energy markets. Investment in exploration and maintenance on regional energy markets is crucial. Former PdVSA chairman Luis Giusti emphasized the need for improved investment climates in Latin America to prevent foreign investment from moving elsewhere. Senator Richard Lugar proposed the Energy Diplomacy and Security Act to promote energy partnerships. Senator Ken Salazar highlighted the importance of shared interests in the Western Hemisphere. The Energy Diplomacy and Security Act of 2007 aims to increase hemispheric cooperation on energy in the Western Hemisphere by establishing a crisis response mechanism and a ministerial forum for energy cooperation. The bill also calls for the creation of a Hemisphere Energy Industry Group. The Energy Diplomacy and Security Act of 2007 aims to enhance hemispheric energy cooperation by establishing a crisis response mechanism and a ministerial forum. It also proposes the creation of a Hemisphere Energy Industry Group to promote public-private partnerships and investment in energy projects. Another related initiative, the United States-Brazil Energy Cooperation Pact of 2007, seeks to accelerate biofuels production through partnerships with Brazil and other Western Hemisphere countries. Some Members of Congress are debating whether to lift taxes and tariffs on foreign ethanol imports to help displace gasoline consumption and address rising fuel prices. Brazil is the world's largest producer of ethanol from sugarcane, with some ethanol processed in the Caribbean for duty-free entry into the US. However, direct imports from Brazil are currently taxed at 54 cents per gallon plus a 2.5% tariff, leading to differing opinions among Members of Congress on supporting the US ethanol industry."
