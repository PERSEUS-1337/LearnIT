    "content": "The block grant of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) funds a variety of benefits and services for economically disadvantaged families, including activities to reduce out-of-wedlock pregnancies and promote two-parent families. TANF was created in the 1996 welfare reform law and has been extended through various legislative acts. The TANF program was extended through FY2010 with revised work requirements and new funding for marriage and fatherhood initiatives. Congress must decide on extending TANF supplemental grants beyond FY2008. There is interest in examining the impact of DRA's provisions on work participation standards for welfare recipients and the flexibility states have in using TANF funds. Interest in the flexibility of states to use TANF funds for various activities arose from the 1996 welfare reform law, which replaced AFDC. The law included work requirements, time limits on welfare receipt, and the end of federal entitlement to welfare for needy families. TANF cash benefits, like AFDC benefits, vary among states. In January 2005, California had a monthly cash benefit of $723 for a family of three, which is high compared to other states. The cash welfare caseload decreased from nearly 5 million to 1.9 million families between 1995 and 2006, with a significant decline in the number of children in families receiving cash welfare. Work among single mothers increased from 1995 to 2000, with some decrease in the following years. The child poverty rate fell from 1995 to 2000 but increased to 17.4% in 2006, with 12.8 million children living in poverty. The percentage of babies born out-of-wedlock in 2006 was 38.9%, a record high. Cash welfare reaches fewer disadvantaged children post-welfare reform, with TANF offering a wider range of benefits and services. States have flexibility to use TANF funds for various benefits and services to help disadvantaged families with children, aiming to achieve goals like promoting work, reducing out-of-wedlock pregnancies, and supporting two-parent families. The fixed funding allows states to use savings from welfare caseload declines for nonwelfare purposes. The TANF system includes federal block grants to states and state funds for maintenance of effort. In FY2006, TANF funds were used for various purposes beyond traditional cash welfare, such as nonwelfare benefits and services. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 ended a long debate on reauthorizing the TANF block grant. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 included a slimmed down version of TANF reauthorization, extending funding and making limited policy changes. Some proposed policy changes were not included in the DRA, leading to potential revival in the 110th Congress. Criticism of DRA's changes to TANF work participation standards may spur proposals in this Congress. The DRA extended most TANF funding through FY2010, but \"Supplemental Grants\" were only extended through FY2008, prompting consideration for further extension in the 110th Congress. The 110th Congress may consider extending TANF grants and addressing the elimination of two TANF bonus funds. The 1996 welfare reform law established work participation standards for states' welfare caseloads, with potential financial penalties for non-compliance. Work participation standards are numerical and must be met by engaging welfare recipients in work and job preparation activities. The 1996 welfare reform law established work participation standards for states' welfare caseloads, with potential financial penalties for non-compliance. States receive credit for caseload reductions measured from FY2005 forward, leading to smaller reduction credits for FY2007. The 1996 welfare reform law established work participation standards for states' welfare caseloads, with potential financial penalties for non-compliance. States receive smaller caseload reduction credits for FY2007 due to changes in the law. States are not credited for caseload declines resulting from policy changes that restrict welfare benefits eligibility. Separate state programs allowed states to provide welfare using state MOE funds without counting towards work participation standards. The 1996 welfare reform law established work participation standards for states' welfare caseloads, with potential financial penalties for non-compliance. States used separate state programs for populations like college students and the disabled. The DRA requires states to count families receiving cash welfare in separate programs for work participation rates. Federal law listed activities that count towards participation standards, but states had flexibility in defining specific activities and verifying work participation. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that the lack of clear definition for work activities led to inconsistent measurements across states. The DRA required HHS to issue regulations for a consistent definition of work activities and procedures for verification. Regulations were issued in 2006 and revised in 2008. The DRA also established new competitive grants for research within TANF. The DRA established $150 million in new competitive grants within TANF for promoting healthy marriages and responsible fatherhood. Grants include nonwelfare services like advertising campaigns and education in social skills. Funding was extended through FY2010, but supplemental grants only until FY2008, pending a decision by Congress. Without an extension, 17 states may see reduced TANF grant awards from FY2009. The 110th Congress may review TANF's contingency provisions for financing unanticipated spending increases due to a potential economic slump. TANF funding is primarily in a fixed basic block grant based on historical welfare spending levels, which have been frozen since FY1997. This has effectively \"locked-in\" funding levels reflecting pre-1996 welfare policies of states. In the mid-1990s, concerns were raised about fixed TANF funding disadvantaging states with low welfare benefits and high population growth. Supplemental grants were added to TANF to address this issue, with 17 states qualifying. The grants grew annually until reaching $319 million and have been frozen at that level since. The DRA extended the grants until FY2008. If not extended, states would lose TANF funding. The TANF and MOE funding, at $319 million per year, have a small impact on welfare funding relative to the number of poor children in a state. States are ranked by funding per poor child, ranging from $480 in Arkansas to over $5,000 in Hawaii. Some states receive supplemental grants to increase funding, while others with low funding levels do not qualify. H.R. 6331 includes a one-year extension of supplemental grants through FY2009. Extension of supplemental grants through FY2010, as proposed in S. 2820, aims to provide additional funding for states with below average TANF resources per poor child. Concerns about funding insufficiency during a recession led to provisions in the 1996 welfare reform law allowing states to save funds for such situations. During economic growth, states can save funds to cover costs during a recession, use a contingency fund if needed, and take interest-bearing loans from the federal government. TANF was tested during the 2001 recession, where single mother employment dropped and child poverty increased. Unspent TANF funds have been viewed as a lack of need indicator. The Bush Administration proposed welfare reauthorization in 2002. The Bush Administration's 2002 welfare reauthorization proposal allowed states to designate unspent funds as \"contingency\" reserves. States did not draw from the TANF contingency fund during the 2001 recession due to criteria of economic need. Some states accessed contingency funds in 2005 and 2006 based on high food stamp caseloads. The 1996 law allowed states to access contingency funds based on high food stamp caseloads, which are determined by the number of participants rather than a rate of receipt. Despite population growth, food stamp caseloads have remained historically high, leading to some states accessing contingency funds in 2005 and 2006. The 2002-2005 reauthorization proposals aimed to make changes to the TANF contingency fund, including eliminating matching requirements and making criteria for qualifying more sensitive to economic changes. The loan fund, allowing states to borrow funds, was extended through FY2010 by the DRA, despite proposals to eliminate it. No state, aside from those affected by Hurricane Katrina, has drawn a loan from the fund. The TANF loan fund was extended through FY2010 by the DRA, despite proposals to eliminate it. Most issues the 110th Congress might consider relate to families receiving welfare, specifically regarding work participation requirements and caseload reduction credits. The cash welfare caseload has been declining rapidly. The TANF/MOE cash welfare caseload has been declining at an accelerating rate, with a 10% reduction in the most recent 12-month period. States had to adjust to new rules for work participation standards, which influence state work requirements. States determine the requirements for individuals. States determine work requirements for individuals, with some families exempt. TANF work rules impact a small number of families monthly, with a focus on non-employed adult recipients. Child-only cases make up 43% of cash welfare families in FY2006. Totaling about 830,000 families. In FY2006, 43% of cash welfare families were child-only cases, totaling about 830,000 families per month. Work rules primarily target the 36% of families with non-employed adult recipients, aiming to help them transition to self-sufficiency. Policymakers are concerned about finding effective strategies for these families. The rules are likely to impact state policies for serving disadvantaged groups. States received caseload reduction credit until FY2006, reducing the work participation standard. From FY2007, credit is given for reduction from FY2005. Most states are expected to receive a caseload reduction credit for FY2007 based on data from FY2005 to FY2006. Actual credits may vary, not given for eligibility restrictions but possible for aiding cases with state funds exceeding TANF MOE. The national average effective all-family participation standard for FY2007 is 44%, higher than the 32% achieved in FY2006. States failing to meet TANF work participation standards may face penalties, but can avoid them by entering a corrective compliance plan or claiming reasonable cause. HHS may consider requests to avoid penalties for states failing to meet TANF work participation standards based on reasonable cause. Legislation such as S. 1461 and H.R. 3188 aim to address issues with work verification plans and eliminate the higher standards for two-parent welfare families. President Bush's FY2009 budget proposal also includes changes to work participation standards. In the 110th Congress, H.R. 3188 (Weller) proposed eliminating the two-parent standard for welfare. This change is also part of broader \"responsible fatherhood\" legislation in H.R. 3395 (Davis-Il) and S. 1626 (Bayh). The higher participation standard for two-parent families on welfare dates back to pre-TANF policies under the Family Support Act of 1988, which aimed to reduce welfare dependency. The welfare caseload for two-parent families remained small even after expansions in 1988 and under TANF. In FY2006, two-parent families made up 5% of the total cash welfare caseload. Work participation rates for two-parent families were low, with only 36% participating in FY2005. In FY2006, 19 states had all two-parent cash welfare families in separate state programs, avoiding the 90% two-parent standard. Failure to meet this standard may result in consequences for states. The two-parent participation standard may result in a small penalty for states, but failing both the all-family and two-parent standards incurs a heavier penalty. Some states have stopped serving two-parent families with TANF funds, potentially shifting to state-only funds. Federal law outlines 12 activities that count towards meeting TANF requirements. The federal law outlines 12 categories of activities that count towards TANF work participation standards, influencing state work programs for cash welfare recipients. These activities reflect a \"work-first\" approach, emphasizing job seeking and rapid attachment to work or activities to work off welfare benefits. Pre-employment activities, job search, readiness, education, and training are subject to various limits, including a 12-month lifetime limit for vocational educational training for adults. The \"work-first\" approach to TANF work participation standards includes a 12-month lifetime limit for vocational educational training for adults. Teen parents may be considered engaged in work through education. Advocates of the \"work-first\" approach argue that it leads to quicker results compared to education-focused programs. The impact of \"work-first\" programs is faster, with the most successful programs combining a strong work message with flexibility for education and training. A program in Portland during the 1990s saw significant increases in earnings and reductions in welfare by emphasizing job search while also allowing for education. Many adults on welfare face barriers to employment such as illness, disability, or caregiving responsibilities. The Clinton Administration allowed states to interpret TANF work activities for individuals facing barriers to work, such as illness, disability, or caregiving responsibilities. Reauthorization proposals from 2002 to 2005 varied in their approach to education and disabilities, with limitations on vocational training and educational activities countable only in combination with work. HHS reversed its policy on counting college coursework as vocational educational training, allowing it to be the main activity for cash welfare recipients for up to 12 months. After 12 months, college coursework can be combined with work for job skills training. Teen parents can meet participation standards through education. Teen parents can meet participation standards through education leading to a high school diploma or GED. 42% of TANF adults and teen heads of households lacked a high school diploma in FY2006. Participation in GED programs, adult basic education, and ESL activities can be counted within vocational education training. Individuals enrolled in vocational education programs can count remedial adult basic education or ESL classes towards TANF work participation standards. Pursuing a GED, adult basic education, and ESL activities can also be counted in participation categories, but only in combination with work. For single-parent families, these activities count after at least 20 hours of work, community service, or vocational training. Pursuing education like GED, adult basic education, or ESL classes can count for the remaining 10 hours. Single parents with a pre-school child are required to participate for 20 hours per week in work or work-related activities. TANF recipients engaged in GED, adult basic education, or ESL activities do not receive additional credit as all 20 hours of participation must come from work. Studies show that a significant portion of TANF adults have non-educational barriers to work, with at least one-third having disabilities. Studies show that a significant portion of TANF adults have disabilities, with one in four families on TANF including a child with an impairment. Cash welfare often serves as a temporary solution for those awaiting eligibility determination for federal benefits like SSI and SSDI. The process for disability determination can be lengthy, and TANF may provide benefits for those with impairments not severe enough for SSI or SSDI. Research indicates that TANF recipients with impairments are less likely to be employed and earn lower wages when they do find work. Many families on TANF include a child with a disability. Cash welfare can be a temporary solution while waiting for federal benefits like SSI or SSDI. TANF recipients with impairments are less likely to find employment and earn lower wages. HHS conducted a study in six states on employment barriers within single parent, cash welfare caseloads. The most common barriers were mental health issues, having a child with a disability, and physical health issues. Rehabilitative activities are not explicitly mentioned in federal law for TANF work participation standards. The DRA standardized the definition of work activities for TANF recipients, including rehabilitative services. States previously had inconsistent definitions, some exempting disabled recipients from work requirements. HHS regulations now categorize rehabilitative activities under job search and readiness, with a time limit of up to six weeks per year. The final HHS regulations provide states with flexibility for counting job search and readiness activities, converting weekly limits to hourly equivalents. Single-parent families with preschool children can participate for up to 120 hours per year, while other families can participate for up to 180 hours. The HHS regulations provide flexibility for states to count job search and readiness activities, with weekly limits converted to hourly equivalents. Single parents with preschool children can participate for up to 120 hours per year, while other families can participate for up to 180 hours. States can also exempt certain individuals from work participation requirements, such as those caring for a disabled child. S. 1730 (Smith) proposes creating individualized employability plans for disabled adults or those caring for disabled family members to meet TANF participation standards. The bill proposes exemptions from participation standards for SSI applicants and those temporarily meeting the disability standard. TANF cash aid is often associated with families where parents face barriers to employment or low wages. A significant portion of TANF recipients are children living with relatives, either by private arrangement or in foster care due to abuse or neglect by parents. The court may order a child to be removed from their parents' home due to abuse or neglect, placing them in foster care under the state's care. Foster children receive monthly payments for \"room and board,\" but those placed with relatives may receive a lower TANF payment instead. Relative caregivers often rely on TANF for financial support as they may not meet the requirements for federal foster care reimbursement. S. 661 (Clinton) and H.R. 2188 (Davis, IL) propose separate licensing standards for relatives to access federal foster care maintenance payments, potentially shifting families from TANF cash aid to foster care caseloads. The DRA requires cash welfare recipients to assign child support to the state to reimburse welfare costs. States can pass through some child support to families, with federal government sharing costs up to $100 per month. H.R. 896 would mandate all child support to be passed through to TANF families, leaving states to decide if it affects eligibility. The DRA incentivizes states to reduce TANF caseloads to meet work participation standards without additional spending. This could free up funds for nonwelfare activities funded through TANF. The national cash welfare caseload has recently resumed its decline, with a 10.4% decrease over the past 12 months, the largest decline since June 1999 to June 2000. Changes in eligibility rules for TANF/MOE cash welfare programs may have contributed to this decline, including shifting some families to state-only programs outside of the TANF/MOE system. The impact of this shift on the caseload reduction is currently unknown. The decline in welfare caseloads is a key indicator of the success of welfare reform. TANF aims to reduce dependency on government benefits, with lower cash welfare caseloads helping achieve this goal. While other benefits like EITC and SCHIP support families, the decrease in cash welfare raises concerns about economic security for those facing barriers to work. The TANF caseload decline has affected both work-ready individuals and those considered hard-to-serve. Despite the role of supportive programs, families with barriers to work may have a diminished safety net. Government savings from the decline remain within the TANF system for states to use. In FY2006, almost half of all TANF and MOE funding totaling $14 billion was available to states for benefits, services, and activities other than traditional cash welfare programs. TANF funds are used for various poverty-combating activities such as early childhood programs, post-secondary education support, job retention programs, and assistance for noncustodial parents, reaching a broader population than cash welfare. The \"nonwelfare\" component of TANF is less debated due to the comprehensive information required by states to describe it. The \"nonwelfare\" component of TANF includes activities such as child care and child welfare, with dedicated funding streams supplemented by TANF. These areas have their own policy debates separate from TANF discussions. The welfare reauthorization proposals from 2002 to 2005 included technical issues like the use of carry-over funds and classification of certain services. Current law allows states to reserve unused block grant funds for cash welfare benefits. The Bush Administration's 2002 plan would have allowed TANF carry-over funds for any TANF benefit or service. The Bush Administration's 2002 welfare reauthorization proposal aimed to allow TANF carry-over funds to be used for any TANF benefit or service, including child care and transportation aid for nonworking families. This proposal was not included in the final version of the DRA, which focuses on detailed reporting requirements for families receiving cash welfare. The TANF reporting requirements focus on families receiving cash welfare, with regulations dating back to the 1996 welfare reform law. The TANF caseload cited excludes families receiving only \"nonwelfare\" benefits, understating the number benefitting from TANF-funded services. States must report on all programs funded with MOE dollars in annual reports. The Bush Administration's 2002 welfare reauthorization proposal aimed to improve reporting on nonwelfare benefits and services funded by TANF dollars. Comprehensive welfare reauthorization bills considered during 2002-2005 included provisions to extend reporting requirements to cover both TANF and MOE dollars, providing a more complete picture of program expenditures and beneficiaries. The 2005 Senate Finance Committee bill aimed to improve reporting on TANF-funded programs, including child care, to track the number of families receiving benefits and their characteristics. However, no reporting changes were ultimately included in the final version of the DRA welfare reauthorization bill. Additionally, the Bush Administration's 2002 welfare reform proposals included grants to promote healthy marriages as nonwelfare initiatives. The DRA included a $150 million per year appropriation for competitive grants to promote \"healthy marriages\" and \"responsible fatherhood,\" with a focus on education in social skills and campaigns in schools and media. HHS awarded five-year grants to various organizations, a significant amount compared to other available funds for research and demonstrations under TANF. Congress may conduct oversight to assess the impact of these projects on improving the research base for evaluating programs promoting healthy marriage. In FY2005, TANF provided a large supplement for child care, totaling about $5.4 billion. Child care accounted for 19% of total TANF funding, the second largest category after cash welfare. Expenditures on child welfare activities, such as foster care and services for abused or neglected children, were not directly reported in TANF's financial system. The Urban Institute reported that in state FY2004, TANF made contributions to child welfare agencies. In FY2004, TANF contributed $3.0 billion to child welfare agency funding, making child care and child welfare services account for over half of TANF and MOE funding available for \"nonwelfare\" activities. Legislation impacting child care or child welfare financing could affect TANF funding for other activities. Proposed changes could shift some cases from TANF to foster care, potentially freeing up TANF dollars. Resolving long-standing child welfare financing issues could also impact TANF and MOE funds. Child welfare financing issues could impact TANF and MOE funds. The 110th Congress may address various TANF issues, including those stemming from policy changes in the DRA. It is a good time to reconsider TANF's role in helping disadvantaged families with children, given the changing context of welfare operations. The cash welfare caseload has decreased, and there are incentives for further declines. Non-welfare support for the working poor has increased with TANF-funded benefits and services. Support for the working poor has increased through TANF-funded benefits and services, as well as other programs like the Earned Income Tax Credit and State Children's Health Insurance Program. The \"nonwelfare\" aspect of TANF has the potential to assist disadvantaged families with children in new ways, but there is a lack of information on these activities. Shedding light on TANF's \"nonwelfare\" side could reshape future discussions about the program in light of changing circumstances."
