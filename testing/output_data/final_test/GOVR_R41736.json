    "content": "Public pension plans, also known as governmental plans, provide retirement income to employees of the U.S. government, state governments, or their agencies. A 2010 GAO report stated that around 20 million employees and 7 million retirees are covered by these plans, which are facing funding shortfalls. This has raised concerns about the fiscal stability of state and local governments. Public pension plans are facing underfunding issues, with estimates of unfunded liabilities ranging from hundreds of billions to over $3 trillion. Legislators are considering reforms to address this, with over 20 states introducing legislation to modify pension benefits. The report provides an overview of federal and state regulation of public pension plans and discusses legal issues related to changing benefits to prevent underfunding. Possible federal regulation of state and local public pension plans is also briefly addressed. Employment-based retirement benefits are governed by federal laws such as ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code, which address defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Defined benefit plans promise a specified future benefit based on average pay and years of service, funded by employer contributions. Defined contribution plans, like 401(k) plans, specify contributions but not benefits. Most public pension plans are traditional defined benefit plans. A defined contribution plan, like a 401(k) plan, provides individual accounts for participants based on contributions and investment gains. Employees bear the investment risk in this type of plan. ERISA, enacted in 1974, regulates pension and employee benefit plans offered by private-sector employers, mandating compliance with federal standards. Some state and local governments have defined contribution plans, and there are proposals to switch from defined benefit to defined contribution plans in various states. Title I of ERISA sets federal standards to protect plan participants and beneficiaries, including reporting, vesting, funding, fiduciary duty, and civil enforcement. Title IV establishes a plan termination insurance program for pension benefits. Public pension plans are generally exempt from ERISA but may be regulated under the Internal Revenue Code, which provides tax benefits for qualified retirement plans. Employer contributions to qualified plans are tax-deductible, and participants do not pay tax on contributions or benefits accrued. Public pension plans must be qualified under the Internal Revenue Code to avoid taxes on benefits until received. Governmental plans have fewer qualification requirements than private-sector plans. They also have different requirements for vesting and funding. Public pension plans are primarily regulated under state statutes, local ordinances, and state constitutions, addressing eligibility, contributions, and benefits. States have provisions for funding, protection, and governance. Federal laws like ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code set requirements for benefit accrual and vesting. Private-sector pension plans are subject to federal laws that prohibit amendments reducing accrued benefits, known as the \"anti-cutback rule.\" However, plans can freeze or adjust future benefit accruals. Governmental plans are exempt from this rule, requiring a state-by-state analysis for changes to accrued benefits. Vesting in pension plans occurs when benefits are non-forfeitable under federal law. ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code impose vesting requirements on private-sector defined benefit pension plans based on age and length of service. Governmental plans are exempt but must meet pre-ERISA vesting standards. States can impose additional vesting requirements for pension benefits. Governors and legislators in some states have proposed modifications to alleviate pension plan underfunding. States have made changes to their pension plans, including reducing benefits, increasing employee contributions, and adjusting age and service requirements. While most changes apply to future participants, some affect current employees and retirees. Legal parameters vary by state and may impact the ability of governments to amend pension plans. Courts have historically viewed public pensions as amendable gratuities, but this view has shifted in most states. Public employee pension benefits now receive greater protection under current state and constitutional law. Many state courts now view public plan pensions as deferred compensation, creating a contractual obligation between the state and plan participants. This limits the state's ability to amend pension plans, with some states having constitutional provisions protecting public pensions as contractual obligations. The system creates a contract between the state and its employees that cannot be impaired, as demonstrated in McDermott v. Regan where changes to the funding method for the state's retirement systems were found to violate the New York constitution. This case highlighted the unconstitutional impairment of pension funds, emphasizing the contractual rights of state and local government employees to their pension benefits. The Contract Clause of the U.S. Constitution protects a public employee's contractual right to an unaltered pension benefit, limiting a state's ability to amend pension plans. The clause prohibits states from impairing contracts but must be balanced with the state's police power. It applies to contracts involving private parties and the state, with instances of state impairment for its benefit facing more scrutiny. Based on Supreme Court jurisprudence, courts evaluate whether a state law violates the Contract Clause under a multi-pronged test, focusing on impairment of public contracts and legislative intent to create contractual obligations between the state and private parties. The language of the statute is crucial in determining if a law establishes a binding contract, with a presumption that it declares policy rather than creating private contractual rights. State statutes establishing retirement plans do not typically address the creation of a contract, making it challenging to determine if a contract exists for a public plan pensioner. If a contract is proven to exist, the next step is to assess if the plaintiff's contractual rights are \"substantially impaired.\" Factors considered include whether a statute applies prospectively or retroactively, disrupts reasonable expectations, or alters terms, conditions, or value of the contract. In public pension cases, changes to benefit formulas, funding sources, or cost of living payments can be considered substantial impairments of the pension contract. State laws may be constitutional if they serve an important public purpose and are reasonable and necessary. The Supreme Court emphasizes that reasonableness and necessity should be evaluated in light of the surrounding circumstances. The necessity of impairing contract obligations must consider surrounding circumstances. States must evaluate if less drastic modifications were available and if alternative means could achieve the desired end without impairing contracts. Courts differ on whether reducing spending to avoid financial crisis justifies modifying contractual rights under the Contract Clause. Some state courts, like in California, allow modifications, while others do not. Some state courts, including California, allow reasonable modifications to pension benefits as long as they are related to the pension system's purpose and provide new advantages to employees. Public employees are not guaranteed specific pension terms but rather the substance of the benefit they could reasonably expect. Courts may differ on whether a financially sound pension plan can be considered a comparable advantage. States protecting public pensions under contract principles reach varying conclusions based on the legal standard discussed above. In some states, courts have held that an employee's right to a pension cannot be changed in any way that reduces the benefit payable upon hire or the first day of plan participation, providing the most protection for pension benefits. States may alter benefits for new employees, depending on when a contract is deemed to exist. States may alter benefits for new employees, depending on when a contract is deemed to exist. In some states, reductions in pension plan benefits could be prohibited when a participant is eligible to receive a pension. This aligns with federal requirements for private sector pension benefits, where retirement benefits must be provided for service already performed. Despite variations in when a contractual right to a public plan pension benefit begins, state courts generally find that benefits must be provided for individuals who have fulfilled the plan's service requirement. Recent challenges to modifications affecting post-retirement benefits have been initiated by retired state workers in Minnesota, North Dakota, and Colorado. These challenges are based on adjustments made by state legislatures to address pension plan underfunding, particularly regarding cost of living adjustments (COLA). Plaintiffs argue they have a contractual right to specific future post-retirement increases, while state defendants contend that public employees are not entitled to a specific COLA formula. Lower courts in Colorado and Minnesota have dismissed plaintiffs' claims, finding no contractual right to a specific COLA level. Some have called for federal action to address public pension plan underfunding, with past efforts to regulate public pension plans similar to ERISA. Various proposals were introduced post-ERISA enactment, but Congress intentionally exempted public plans from ERISA due to differences in regulating private versus government-sponsored plans. Additional data and study were deemed necessary before attempting to regulate public plans, with federalism concerns raised about regulating state and local pension plans. The legal landscape has changed regarding the regulation of state and local pension plans due to Supreme Court decisions after ERISA's enactment in 1974. While no comprehensive proposals have been introduced in the 112th Congress, there has been discussion of federal legislation to allow states to declare bankruptcy to reduce financial obligations like pension obligations. The Public Employee Pension Transparency Act proposes filing plan financial data with the Treasury Secretary, including assets and liabilities. The legislation requires bonds issued by governmental entities to comply with disclosure requirements to maintain federal tax exemption. It also states that the federal government is not responsible for any shortfall in public pension plans."
