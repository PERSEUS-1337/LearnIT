The Act defines key terms such as \"Administrator,\" \"agency,\" \"resource efficient materials,\" and \"resource efficient building materials.\" The Act defines key terms such as \"Administrator,\" \"agency,\" \"resource efficient materials,\" and \"resource efficient building materials.\" The term \"solid waste\" and \"construction\" have specific definitions under the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Federal Acquisition and Use of Resource Efficient Building Materials is addressed in Section 3 of the Act. The Administrator will establish a 3-year pilot program to demonstrate the use of resource efficient building materials in Federal facilities. Selection criteria include conservation of natural resources, quality and durability similar to conventional materials, cost competitiveness, meeting environmental standards, and energy efficiency. The Administrator will give preference to resource efficient building materials that best satisfy energy efficiency standards. The Administrator will report to Congress on the pilot program's implementation, detailing the type and quantities of resource efficient building materials used, their cost and performance compared to conventional materials, potential expansion beyond the pilot program, and an assessment of how well the materials meet specified criteria. The Resource Efficient Building Material Advisory Board is established with 11 members appointed by the Administrator, including representatives from various agencies, the environmental community, construction industry, manufacturing companies, and scientific field. The Resource Efficient Building Material Advisory Board consists of 11 members appointed by the Administrator, including representatives from different sectors. The Board advises the Administrator on resource efficient building materials, makes recommendations on their use in Federal construction, and suggests ways to reduce solid waste generation. The Administrator serves as the Chairman of the Board, which meets quarterly. The Resource Efficient Building Material Advisory Board meets quarterly and follows the Federal Advisory Committee Act.

The Board will cease to exist within 1 year of submitting the report. SEC. 6. GUIDELINES TO FEDERAL AGENCIES. The Administrator must promulgate regulations with guidelines for Federal agencies on minimizing solid waste and maximizing resource efficient building materials in Federal building construction, including bid requirements and acceptable plan standards. The Administrator must consider recommendations from the Resource Efficient Building Material Advisory Board when implementing regulations for Federal agencies on minimizing solid waste and maximizing resource efficient building materials in Federal building construction. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 1994-1996: $5,000,000 for 1994, $7,000,000 for 1995, and $8,000,000 for 1996 to support the purposes of the Act."
