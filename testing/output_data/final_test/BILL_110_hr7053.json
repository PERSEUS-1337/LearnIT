    "content": "The \"Transportation Job Corps Act of 2008\" is the short title of this Act. It includes findings related to transportation. Congress finds that millions of young people aged 16-24 are not in school or the labor force, often referred to as disconnected youth, who are predominantly youth of color from poor communities at risk of permanent disengagement from the labor market. This poses a threat to their ability to break out of poverty and contribute to the economy. When these young people lack the necessary skills and support, there are financial costs borne by all. The transit industry faces challenges in attracting and retaining employees due to a lack of replacements on the horizon. New technology is rapidly changing the industry, but there are few training programs available to help workers adapt and improve efficiency. SEC. 3. WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. Amends Title 49, United States Code by adding a new section 5322 for workforce development programs. The Transportation Job Corps Act of 2008 requires the Administrator of the Federal Transit Administration to establish a workforce development council in each of its 10 regions. The council will be composed of representatives from public transit agencies and labor organizations, with a governing board elected by majority vote. The governing board for each region, composed of up to 10 members elected by the Council, is tasked with identifying skills gaps in transit agency maintenance departments, developing training programs, addressing recruitment and retention issues, and establishing relationships with nontransportation sector industries. The curr_chunk discusses collaborating with various sectors to develop best practices in training and skills development for disconnected youth, conducting research on transit workforce development issues, labor market disconnection among youth, and making recommendations to expand employment training programs. The curr_chunk discusses employment training programs, outreach programs to increase minority and female employment in public transportation, apprenticeship programs, and recommendations to address workplace quality of life issues for recruitment and retention of employees. The Administrator appoints representatives to the regional governing board, including non-voting ex-officio members from the International Transportation Learning Center for the transit career ladder training program. The Secretary establishes grant programs for transit youth opportunity, including basic skills education and pre-apprenticeship skills, with applications accepted from nonprofit organizations and public or privately funded entities. The Administrator prioritizes grants for organizations with a successful track record in providing disconnected youth with basic education and pre-apprenticeship skills in the transit industry. The Administrator accepts applications for grants to develop labor-management apprenticeship programs for transit-related jobs, prioritizing individuals who completed a pre-apprenticeship program. Additionally, grants are available for partnerships to develop education programs for transit workers. The Administrator accepts applications for grants to develop education programs in various training settings for transit employees from diverse groups to maintain job skills and advance careers. Grants are also available to assist individuals in obtaining education and training to enter and advance in the transit profession. The Administrator accepts applications for grants to develop special projects aimed at increasing education opportunities within the transit industry for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, including racial and ethnic minorities. Funding of $10,000,000 for fiscal years 2010 through 2011 is allocated for subsections (a) and (b), and $90,000,000 for fiscal years 2010 and 2011 for subsection (c). Grant requirements include student scholarships, pre-entry preparation, and retention activities. The Administrator will develop a category on 'Workforce Development' for Federal Transit Administration Assistance Programs, focusing on recruitment, retention, and training of employees. The term 'disconnected youth' refers to individuals aged 16-24 who are out of school and not employed, primarily from poor communities and at risk of disengagement. Disconnected youth, aged 16-24, are at risk of permanent disengagement from the labor market, hindering their ability to break the cycle of poverty and contribute to the economy and communities."
