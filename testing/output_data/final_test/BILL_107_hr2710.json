The Administrator will submit a program management plan outlining the program's objectives, qualifications of individuals involved, and a timeline for implementation. SEC. 201. PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP AUTHORITY. Title II of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 is amended to allow the Administrator to create public-private partnerships for leasing Federal real property and developing facilities for executive agencies. The partnerships can take various forms, with the nongovernmental person holding majority ownership and control. Each agreement made under this section must adhere to specified conditions. The Administrator can establish public-private partnerships for leasing Federal real property and developing facilities for executive agencies. Agreements must focus on enhancing efficiency, be negotiated for competition, offer a lease option to the United States, and outline responsibilities of both parties. The agreement for leasing Federal real property must include provisions stating that the United States is not liable for any actions or debts created by the agreement, and that the leasehold interests of the United States take precedence over any lender to the nongovernmental person. Paragraph (6) does not limit a public-private partnership's ability to use its leasehold interest with the United States as collateral. The Administrator can lease real property to such partnerships under specific agreements, with master leases determined by the Administrator. The Administrator can also sell equity interest in these partnerships if it benefits the United States. The Administrator can provide services to public-private partnerships created under this section and retain revenues for improving Federal real property. Real property leased under this subsection is not considered unutilized or underutilized for homeless assistance purposes. Proceeds from disposal of interests are deposited into a fund. The Administrator can delegate authority to executive agencies for public-private partnerships and master leases of real property. Net revenues from partnerships are deposited into a designated fund. Business plans for agreements with non-governmental entities must be submitted to Congress. The Administrator enters into agreements with nongovernmental persons for the use of federal real property. The business plan must identify the property, explain the agreement, and include performance measures. The projected economic performance of agreements is described in the budget submitted to Congress. The Administrator leases federal real property to a public-private partnership created under this section. The Administrator of General Services will submit a report to Congress on the effectiveness of authorities provided by the Act, including enhancing property value and reviewing performance measures. The Comptroller General of the United States will also submit a report on the use of these authorities by executive agencies."
