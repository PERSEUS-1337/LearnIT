    "content": "The President and Congress have different roles in sending U.S. troops into hostile situations. The President can use the Armed Forces to repel attacks, while Congress can declare war and support the Armed Forces. The War Powers Resolution ensures shared decisions on troop involvement, leading to controversy when troops are sent without a formal declaration of war. Congress often uses funding or policy declarations to affirm or limit presidential action. Congress has authorized military force in advance in three instances. The President has the constitutional authority to use force to protect U.S. national security interests, even without explicit congressional authorization. Congress often views defense appropriations bills as implicit authorization for military operations funded under those measures. The report discusses the congressional debate surrounding the use of U.S. military abroad, focusing on floor votes related to the War Powers Resolution. It provides a chronological list of laws, bills, and resolutions related to the deployment and funding of U.S. troops overseas. Links to roll call votes are included when available. Since 1990 in the House and 1989 in the Senate, links to roll call votes are provided for Members' yea or nay votes. Some House or Senate votes are voice votes, with no roll call vote. The final outcome of listed amendments may not be clear, as they could be incorporated into final laws, further amended, or deleted in conference. Some measures may only be voted on by one chamber, such as a House or Senate simple resolution expressing nonbinding opinions. On September 29, 1982, President Reagan deployed 1,200 marines to Lebanon to restore the sovereignty of the Lebanese government. The mission ended by March 30, 1984. President Reagan also sent troops to Grenada on October 25, 1983, to protect American lives and restore law and order. All troops were removed by December 15, 1983. President George H.W. Bush deployed 14,000 U.S. military forces to Panama on December 20, 1989, to protect American lives, restore democracy, and apprehend General Manuel Noriega. Congress did not immediately react as the session had ended. The 101st Congress, first session ended on November 22, 1989, and the second session began on January 23, 1990. 14,000 U.S. troops were removed from Panama by February 13, 1990. On August 2, 1990, Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait, leading to President Bush deploying U.S. troops to the region on August 9. Legislation in late 1990 focused on imposing sanctions against Iraq and supporting the President in carrying out UN Security Council resolutions. On January 12, 1991, the Congress authorized the \"use of force\" against Iraq in advance of hostilities on January 16. President George H.W. Bush deployed U.S. troops into Somalia on December 8, 1992, in response to UN Security Council Resolution 794. U.S. troops assisted UN Forces in Somalia throughout 1993 and 1994, ending on March 3, 1995. On October 20, 1993, President Bill Clinton enforced a UN embargo against Haiti, deploying 1,500 troops to restore democracy. Troop levels increased to over 20,000 but were reduced to under 5,300 by March 21, 1995. US troops were then incorporated into the UN Multinational Force in Haiti and further reduced to under 2,500 by September 21, 1995, ending their deployment by April 17, 1996. The civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina led to U.S. military involvement without explicit congressional authorization. In 1992, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 770 for humanitarian assistance in Sarajevo. The Senate passed S.Res. 330 urging the President to work for the resolution, while the House passed H.Res. 554 urging Security Council authorization for measures. In response to the escalating conflict in Bosnia, U.S. troops were sent to participate in NATO and UN peacekeeping missions. Calls for greater congressional involvement in decisions led to the Senate passing S. 2042 in 1994, calling for an end to the arms embargo with Bosnia. The Senate also passed an amendment stating that ground combat troops should not be deployed without congressional authorization. NATO took over ground operations in Bosnia with the signing of the Dayton Peace Agreement in 1995, leading to the deployment of over 20,000 U.S. combat troops. In late 1995, over 20,000 U.S. combat troops were sent to Bosnia as part of the NATO-led peacekeeping force. President Clinton agreed to provide up to 8,500 ground troops for the NATO-led follow-on force in Bosnia. Efforts by Congress to limit funding for Bosnia operations or bring troops home were unsuccessful. On March 18, 1998, the House defeated a resolution to remove U.S. Armed Forces from Bosnia. President Bush reported to Congress that U.S. Armed Forces had approximately 2,400 personnel in SFOR in Bosnia-Herzegovina. U.S. troops ended their mission in Bosnia when SFOR was replaced by EUFOR Althea in 2004. Legislation introduced and voted on during the 102nd Congress-105th Congresses (1992-1998) is included. President Clinton ordered U.S. military forces to begin air strikes against Yugoslavia in 1999. In 1999, NATO air strikes were conducted against Yugoslavia in response to violence against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Yugoslavia agreed to a peace plan for withdrawal of forces from Kosovo, which was completed by June 20, 1999. Congress introduced legislative measures related to U.S. military deployment in the Balkan region. In 1999, NATO conducted air strikes against Yugoslavia in response to violence in Kosovo. Congress introduced legislation related to U.S. military deployment in the Balkan region, including conflicting signals on funding, declaration of war issues, and executive and congressional roles in sending troops abroad. On September 11, 2001, terrorists attacked the United States, leading to the passing of a joint resolution by Congress authorizing the use of force against those responsible. The joint resolution passed by Congress on September 18, 2001 authorized the use of force against nations, organizations, or persons involved in the 9/11 terrorist attacks to prevent future acts of international terrorism. President George W. Bush signed the resolution into law and reported combat action in Afghanistan on October 7, 2001. On October 10, 2002, the House passed H.J.Res. 114 authorizing military force against Iraq. The Senate postponed its own measure and passed H.J.Res. 114 on October 11, 2002. The joint resolution supports enforcing UN Security Council resolutions on Iraq and authorizes the President to use military force to defend U.S. national security. The joint resolution passed by the House and Senate authorizes the President to use the U.S. Armed Forces to defend national security against the threat posed by Iraq and enforce relevant Security Council resolutions. It requires the President to notify Congress of the decision and states that this authorization is consistent with actions against international terrorists, including those responsible for the 9/11 attacks. The war with Iraq (Operation Iraqi Freedom) began on March 19, 2003, with an aerial attack against a location where Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was suspected to be meeting with top Iraqi officials. U.S. and British troops entered Iraq on March 20, 2003, and gained control of Baghdad by April 9, 2003. President George W. Bush declared that \"the regime of Saddam Hussein is no more\" on April 15, 2003. President George W. Bush declared the end of Saddam Hussein's regime. Military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq were conducted under specific authorizations. A request for funding for ongoing military operations, reconstruction in Iraq, and international assistance was made. H.R. 1559 provided $78.49 billion for these purposes. President Bush requested an additional $87 billion for military operations and reconstruction in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other areas. H.R. 3289 was enacted into law, providing $87.5 billion in funding. The House and Senate approved the conference agreement, with the Senate previously passing its own version of the measure. The 2011 uprising in Libya led to Western military intervention, resulting in the overthrow of Muammar Qadhafi's regime. US and NATO forces conducted air strikes under Operation Odyssey Dawn and Operation Unified Protector. Qadhafi was killed, leading to a power vacuum and security challenges in Libya. In Libya, militias competed after the 2011 uprising. US military operations ended in October 2011. An armed attack in Benghazi in 2012 resulted in the deaths of four Americans. In Syria, protests turned into a conflict with various factions and foreign fighters. The US accused the Asad regime of using chemical weapons in 2013. The United States has been providing nonlethal support to opposition groups in Syria, including a train-and-equip program. The Islamic State (IS) emerged as a prominent group in the conflict, known for brutal tactics and online propaganda showcasing massacres and beheadings. They have roots in al-Qaeda in Iraq and gained experience fighting American forces. The Islamic State (IS) gained significant territorial gains in Syria and Iraq, capturing refineries and banks for self-financing. President Obama authorized aid to anti-IS forces and ordered air strikes to assist Iraqi and Kurdish forces. IS has suffered territorial losses but still poses a threat with potential for terrorist acts. The Islamic State (IS) has lost more territory in Syria and Iraq but remains a threat due to potential terrorist acts by returning foreign fighters. Concerns exist for antiterrorism and police authorities. The United States has provided support against the Ansar Allah/Houthi movement and followers of the late president of Yemen, Ali Abdullah Saleh, including logistical and intelligence support. Civilian casualties and humanitarian conditions in Yemen have been a matter of concern and congressional debate. The text chunk discusses various reports and resources related to declarations of war, authorizations for the use of military force, and the War Powers Resolution. It includes references to CRS reports, the Legislative Information System of the U.S. Congress, and Congressional Quarterly publications."
