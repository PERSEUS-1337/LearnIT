    "content": "The Act titled \"National Capital Area Interest Arbitration Standards Act of 1995\" is established for the purpose of setting standards for interest arbitration in the National Capital Area. The Congress finds that affordable public transportation is essential for the economic vitality and environmental health of the national capital area. Labor costs significantly impact mass transit prices, which affect usage by residents and visitors. Labor costs for mass transit in the area have been increasing rapidly. Labor costs for public transit in the national capital area have increased rapidly, leading to operators and mechanics receiving some of the highest wages and benefits in the nation. Higher operating costs cannot be passed on to patrons without discouraging ridership, and local governments, including the District of Columbia, are struggling to offset these rising labor costs due to fiscal constraints. Arbitrators resolving arbitration disputes involving interstate compact agencies in the national capital area must ensure that wage increases are justified and do not exceed the ability of transit patrons and taxpayers to fund them. Federal legislation is needed to balance the need to lower labor costs while maintaining industrial peace. The purpose of this Act is to establish standards for arbitration in order to reduce operating costs for public transportation in the Washington metropolitan area. The curr_chunk is a section header \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" In this Act, \"arbitration\" refers to resolving disputes on employment terms under an interstate compact agency in the national capital area. An \"arbitrator\" can be a single arbitrator or a board chosen through procedures. \"Funding ability\" is the ability of an interstate compact agency or a governmental jurisdiction providing financial support to the agency. The curr_chunk discusses budgetary assistance for the interstate compact agency to cover wage and benefit increases for employees. It defines terms like \"interstate compact agency operating in the national capital area\" and \"interstate compact agency.\" Public welfare in arbitration under an interstate compact includes financial ability of participating jurisdictions to pay for transit services and average per capita tax burden. The curr_chunk discusses the average per capita tax burden of residents in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area and the impact of arbitration awards on income or property tax rates of jurisdictions providing subsidy payments to the interstate compact agency. SEC. 4. STANDARDS FOR ARBITRATORS. An arbitrator must consider various factors when making an arbitration award for employees of an interstate compact agency in the national capital area, including existing employment terms, financial resources, consumer price index data, and current wages and benefits. The arbitrator must consider factors such as wages, benefits, and working conditions of employees in similar roles in the Washington, D.C. area, the nature of the work performed by the bargaining unit, and the interests and welfare of the employees when making arbitration awards for employees of an interstate compact agency in the national capital area. An arbitrator must consider factors such as wages, benefits, and working conditions when making arbitration awards for employees of an interstate compact agency in the national capital area. The award cannot exceed the agency's funding ability, and the final decision must consider the public welfare. The arbitrator must issue a written award considering factors like wages, benefits, and working conditions for employees of an interstate compact agency in the national capital area. The award can only grant pay or benefit increases or reduce work hours if it does not negatively impact the agency's costs and public welfare, supported by substantial evidence. SEC. 5. PROCEDURES FOR ENFORCEMENT OF AWARDS. (a) Modifications and Finality of Award.--In the case of an arbitration award under section 4, the interstate compact agency and employees in the bargaining unit can agree on modifications within 10 days. The award, with any modifications, becomes binding after the 10-day period. (b) Implementation.--Parties must take necessary actions to implement the binding award. (c) Judicial Review.--Within 60 days, the interstate compact agency or employees' representative can file a civil action for judicial review.
