The Commercial Revitalization Tax Act of 1999 introduces a new Commercial Revitalization Credit under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

The Commercial Revitalization Tax Act of 1999 introduces a new Commercial Revitalization Credit under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The credit allows for a percentage of qualified revitalization expenditures on qualified buildings over a 10-year period, with an option for a lower percentage at the taxpayer's election. Rules similar to section 42(f) apply to buildings placed in service, with specific criteria for qualified revitalization buildings and expenditures. The term 'qualified rehabilitation expenditure' refers to amounts chargeable to capital account for nonresidential real property or improvements to such property in connection with the construction or substantial rehabilitation of a qualified revitalization building. The term 'qualified rehabilitation expenditure' pertains to capital amounts for nonresidential real property or improvements in connection with constructing or substantially rehabilitating a qualified revitalization building. The aggregate qualified revitalization expenditures for a building in a taxable year are limited to $10,000,000, excluding certain expenditures like straight-line depreciation. The taxpayer must use straight-line depreciation for any expenditure, excluding land acquisitions, not using this method over a recovery period determined under section 168. This does not apply if the alternative depreciation system of section 168(g) applies. Acquisition costs include acquiring buildings, interests, and land related to the building. The taxpayer must use straight-line depreciation for any expenditure, excluding land acquisitions, not using this method over a recovery period determined under section 168. This does not apply if the alternative depreciation system of section 168(g) applies. Acquisition costs include acquiring buildings, interests, and land related to the building. Eligible commercial revitalization areas are defined as empowerment zones, enterprise communities, or areas established through a consolidated planning process for Federal use. The text discusses the criteria for substantial rehabilitation or reconstruction in designated commercial revitalization districts, which must exceed 25 percent of the building's fair market value. Eligible areas include low-income census tracts or nonmetropolitan areas that are not primarily nonresidential central business districts. Qualified revitalization expenditures for a qualified revitalization building are taken into account in the taxable year when the qualified rehabilitated building is placed in service. A substantial rehabilitation or reconstruction of a building is treated as a separate building for tax purposes. Rules similar to section 47 apply for progress expenditure payments. There is a limitation on the aggregate credits allowable with respect to buildings located in a state. The commercial revitalization credit amount allocated to buildings in a state is limited and determined by a commercial revitalization credit agency. The allocation follows similar rules as outlined in section 42(h) and is subject to limitations on aggregate credits allowable. The State commercial revitalization credit agency allocates a portion of the State commercial revitalization credit ceiling for each calendar year based on the population of low-income census tracts and nonmetropolitan areas within the State. The national ceiling for the State commercial revitalization credit is $100,000,000 for 2000, $200,000,000 for 2001, and $400,000,000 for each year between 2001 and 2006. Special rules similar to section 42(h)(3) apply, and low-income areas are defined as those where at least 50% of residents earn no income. The commercial revitalization credit is available to residents earning no more than 60% of the median household income. A commercial revitalization credit agency is authorized by the State to carry out this program. The commercial revitalization credit dollar amount for a building is zero unless allocated through a qualified allocation plan approved by the commercial revitalization credit agency and the local jurisdiction's chief executive officer is notified for comment. The term 'qualified allocation plan' refers to a plan that establishes selection criteria for prioritizing projects based on local conditions, contribution to strategic plans, and increase in employment. The section outlines requirements for commercial revitalization projects, including resident and nonprofit involvement, compliance monitoring procedures, and a termination clause for buildings placed in service after December 31, 2005.
