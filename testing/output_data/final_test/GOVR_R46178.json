It aims to help policymakers understand the evolution of this tax benefit. It does not cover all changes or provide a broad overview of charitable giving. For more details, refer to other reports mentioned. The report outlines major legislative changes to the charitable deduction for individuals from 1917 to 2017, focusing on changes that impacted the amount taxpayers could deduct. Current law allows taxpayers who itemize deductions to deduct charitable donations to qualifying organizations, with certain limitations. The report excludes temporary modifications in response to disasters and changes to definitions or substantiation requirements for claiming the deduction. It will be updated to reflect future legislative changes. Charitable contributions can be carried forward for up to five years if not claimed in the current tax year. Contributions are tax deductible when made to qualifying organizations like Section 501(c)(3) organizations, governmental units, veterans' organizations, fraternal organizations, and cemetery companies. Private foundations primarily make grants to other charitable organizations and individuals, known as nonoperating foundations. Public charities, also known as operating foundations, provide charitable services directly to beneficiaries and have broad public support. Tax-deductible donations to qualifying organizations can be in the form of cash, securities, or property, which can be long-term or short-term capital gain properties. The deduction for charitable giving has limitations based on the type of property donated and the receiving organization. These limitations are a percentage of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income. The history of the charitable deduction shows that Congress has generally increased the amount eligible taxpayers can deduct over the past 100 years. The charitable deduction has evolved over time to encourage giving and protect donations from being taxed as income. Policymakers now focus on its effectiveness in increasing charitable giving and debate its role in the philanthropic sector. The charitable deduction was initially enacted to offset potential negative effects of increased income taxes on charitable giving among the wealthy. The federal income tax rates increased during World War I, leading to concerns that it would reduce individuals' income surplus for charity. As a result, the charitable deduction was offered to encourage continued private support for charitable causes. The charitable deduction was introduced to prevent a decrease in charitable giving by wealthy individuals due to higher tax rates. Policymakers were concerned that without this deduction, wealthy taxpayers would be less likely to contribute to charities or educational institutions. Senator Hollis highlighted that people typically donate to charity only after fulfilling all their personal desires and obligations, and higher taxes might lead them to cut back on charitable donations. The charitable deduction was introduced to incentivize donations to charity, limiting deductions to 20 percent of income to avoid harming the Public Treasury. Many believed charities could provide social services better than the government, leading to concerns about a drop in funding for charitable groups. The law allowed deductions for contributions to religious, charitable, scientific, educational, or animal welfare organizations. The charitable deduction was introduced to incentivize donations to charity, limiting deductions to 20 percent of income to avoid harming the Public Treasury. Congress later waived the 15% limitation for taxpayers who made consistently large charitable donations, known as the \"Philadelphia nun\" provision. In 1944, Congress changed the charitable deduction limitation from 15% of net taxable income to adjusted gross income, increasing the maximum deductible amount. This change was part of the Individual Income Tax Act of 1944, which also introduced a standard deduction. The expansion of federal income tax during World War II made it applicable to most working-age Americans, increasing the number of taxpayers. President Roosevelt's Revenue Act of 1942 introduced the Victory Tax, making about 75% of American workers pay income taxes to finance World War II expenses. The expansion of the federal income tax led to the creation of a standard deduction to simplify tax preparation for new taxpayers. Some concerns arose about a potential decrease in charitable giving among those using the standard deduction. In 1952, Congress increased the maximum amount taxpayers could deduct, arguing that the tax incentive for charitable contributions was not a significant factor for lower- and middle-income taxpayers who claimed the standard deduction. Senator Walter George stated that the $500 standard deduction would not remove the tax incentive for higher-income individuals who charities depend on for substantial contributions. Congress increased the maximum deduction limit to 30% of AGI for contributions to certain charitable organizations in 1954. This encouraged additional contributions to offset rising costs and modest returns on endowment funds. The Revenue Act of 1964 expanded the 30% charitable deduction to most organizations, with a provision for contributions exceeding AGI limits to be carried forward up to five years. The Tax Reform of 1969 made further modifications, including increasing AGI limits and phasing out certain provisions. The Tax Reform of 1969 made changes to the charitable deduction, including increasing AGI limits and phasing out the \"Philadelphia nun\" provision. Concerns were raised about wealthy taxpayers using the unlimited charitable contribution deduction to avoid income taxes. The Tax Reform Act of 1969 phased out the \"Philadelphia nun provision\" and raised the maximum AGI limitation to 50% for donations to public charities, aiming to strengthen the incentive effect of charitable contributions for middle- and upper-income taxpayers. The Tax Reform Act of 1969 increased the AGI limitation to 50% for donations to public charities, benefiting middle- and upper-income taxpayers. The Economic Recovery Act of 1981 allowed nonitemizers to deduct a percentage of contributions with a fixed dollar cap, in effect from 1982 to 1986. In 1982 and 1983, 25% of contributions could be deducted with a $100 cap. In 1984, the contribution percentage remained at 25%, but the cap increased to $300. By 1985, 50% of contributions could be deducted with no cap, and in 1986, 100% of contributions could be deducted without a cap. The Treasury Department and some economists opposed this temporary provision, arguing that lower- and moderate-income taxpayers would not benefit as much as higher-income taxpayers. The above-the-line deduction for charitable contributions was believed to benefit existing donors and result in a revenue loss for the Treasury. However, Congress argued that it would stimulate charitable giving among nonitemizers, providing more funds for nonprofit organizations. Supporters believed that people should not be taxed on money contributed to charity, regardless of their economic actions. This tax benefit expired in 1986 and was not extended. The tax benefit for charitable contributions expired in 1986 and was not extended as part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. The contribution limits on donations to private nonoperating foundations were increased under the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) temporarily increased the AGI limit for cash donations to public charities from 50% to 60% in 2018. President Trump signed this law at the end of 2017. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) temporarily increased the AGI limit for cash donations to public charities from 50% to 60% in 2018, set to expire on December 31, 2025. The House Ways and Means Committee believes in the importance of a strong charitable sector and aims to incentivize taxpayers to support charities through increased deduction limits. This change may encourage more charitable giving, although other provisions in the law could lead to an overall reduction in donations. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) increased the AGI limit for cash donations to public charities from 50% to 60% until 2025. Despite this change, the TCJA could still result in a 5% decrease in charitable donations. Noncash donations are valued based on either the property's basis or fair market value. When property appreciates or depreciates in value, its fair market value when sold will be greater or less than its basis, respectively. Deducting the fair market value of an appreciated (depreciated) property results in a larger (smaller) deduction for the taxpayer than the basis value of that same property."
