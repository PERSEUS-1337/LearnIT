    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Strategic and Critical Minerals Production Act of 2015\". Congress acknowledges the importance of minerals for various industries and national security. The United States has abundant mineral resources but is increasingly reliant on foreign sources. The United States was previously dependent on foreign sources for 45 nonfuel mineral materials, with 8 imported at 100% and 19 at over 50% of the nation's needs. By 2014, this dependence increased to 65 commodities, with 19 at 100% and 24 at over 50%. The US share of worldwide mineral exploration dollars decreased from 19% in the early 1990s to 7% in 2014. In the 2014 Ranking of Countries for Mining Investment, it was found that 7- to 10-year permitting delays are the most significant risk to mining projects in the United States. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines \"strategic and critical minerals\" as minerals essential for national defense, energy infrastructure, domestic manufacturing, and economic security. The term \"agency\" refers to any government entity at the federal, state, local, or tribal level. The term \"mineral exploration or mine permit\" includes authorizations for pre-mining activities that require environmental analyses under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, and plans of operation issued by the Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service. SEC. 101. Domestic mines for strategic and critical minerals classified as \"infrastructure projects\" under Presidential order. SEC. 102. Lead agency responsibilities outlined. The lead agency responsible for issuing mineral exploration or mine permits appoints a project lead to coordinate with other agencies, project proponents, and contractors to minimize delays and adhere to timelines. The National Environmental Policy Act requirements are satisfied if the lead agency determines that State and/or Federal agencies have met the necessary procedures. The lead agency appoints a project lead to coordinate with other agencies, project proponents, and contractors to minimize delays and adhere to timelines for issuing mineral exploration or mine permits. The agency determines that State and/or Federal agencies have addressed factors such as environmental impact, adverse effects, alternatives, resource commitment, and public participation for the proposed action. The lead agency must ensure public participation in the decision-making process for authorizing actions under the permit. Within 90 days of receiving the permit application, the agency must provide a written record of decision explaining the rationale, stating facts, and demonstrating that a reasonable person could reach the same determination. Coordination is required for issuing mineral exploration or mine permits. The lead agency responsible for issuing mineral exploration or mine permits must coordinate with other agencies and stakeholders to streamline the permitting process. This includes deferring to baseline data from State agencies and conducting consultations concurrently to expedite decisions. If requested, the lead agency can enter into a Memorandum of Agency Agreement with State or local planning agencies. The lead agency issuing mineral exploration or mine permits can establish agreements with project sponsors, State, and local governments for early coordination activities. If the lead agency cannot make a determination, they can set time limits for each part of the permitting process, including the decision on preparing documents required under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The curr_chunk discusses the various steps involved in the process of preparing documents required under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, including determining scope, conducting baseline studies, preparing draft and final documents, consultations, submission and review of comments, publication of public notices, and making final decisions. The lead agency must determine financial assurance for reclamation of mining sites, covering estimated costs for reclamation according to the plan, including treatment facilities to meet environmental standards. The total review process for permitting should not exceed 30 months, and public comments not submitted during designated periods need not be addressed. The lead agency must ensure financial assurance for reclamation of mining sites, including treatment facilities to meet environmental standards. For existing permit applications, the lead agency must implement this section upon request from the applicant. Strategic and critical minerals within National Forests must be exempted from certain land use designations. The Act exempts strategic and critical minerals within National Forests from certain land use designations, allowing for construction, operation, maintenance, and restoration of mineral resource areas. The exemptions continue even after approval of the Minerals Plan of Operations. In evaluating mineral exploration permits, the lead agency's priority is to maximize mineral resource development while mitigating environmental impacts. The Federal Register process is established for mineral exploration and mining projects. The preparation of Federal Register notices for mineral exploration and mine development projects is delegated to the agency responsible for issuing permits. All notices regarding document availability, meetings, or actions must originate from the office where the activity is initiated. Each notice must undergo departmental review unless specified by Congress or under extraordinary circumstances. The preparation of Federal Register notices for mineral exploration and mine development projects is delegated to the agency responsible for issuing permits. Notices must undergo required reviews within the Department of the Interior or the Department of Agriculture and be published in the Federal Register within 30 days. TITLE II--JUDICIAL REVIEW OF AGENCY ACTIONS RELATING TO EXPLORATION AND MINE PERMITS\n\nDefines \"covered civil action\" as a claim under section 702 of title 5, United States Code, regarding agency action affecting mineral exploration or mine permits. A covered civil action must be filed within 60 days of the final Federal agency action. Holders of mineral exploration or mine permits have the right to intervene in such actions. Courts are required to expedite the hearing and determination of covered civil actions. SEC. 205. LIMITATION ON PROSPECTIVE RELIEF. The court in a covered civil action can only grant relief that is narrowly drawn, necessary to correct a legal violation, and least intrusive. SEC. 206. LIMITATION ON ATTORNEYS' FEES. The Equal Access to Justice Act does not apply to covered civil actions, and parties cannot receive payment from the Federal Government for attorneys' fees. TITLE III--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS. This Act does not apply to minerals described in Secretarial Order No. 3324. The House of Representatives passed the order on October 22, 2015. Clerk Karen L. Haas attested to it on December 3, 2012."
