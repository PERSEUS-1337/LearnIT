Subsequent election cycles also saw administrative problems, such as voter registration issues in 2016 and 2018. Responses to these challenges include the Help America Vote Act of 2002, which sets standards for voting systems, and proposed bills to reform voter registration processes. The decentralized nature of election administration in the US means that states and local systems play a key role in implementing election rules. The decentralized nature of election administration in the United States involves state and local systems, which can impact federal actions on election administration. Congress has tools to influence election policy and can require changes in state and local election systems. This report aims to provide insight on how federal actions interact with state and local systems in administering elections. This report aims to help Congress understand the state and local systems that administer federal elections and how they interact with federal activity. It describes the distribution of election administration duties and structures at the state and local levels, using examples from past federal actions. The focus is on the administration of federal elections in the states by executive and legislative branches of government. The report focuses on the administration of federal elections, specifically voter registration, vote casting, and vote counting. It does not cover nonfederal elections, election administration in U.S. territories, law enforcement and court roles, or constitutional/legal interpretation. The variations in how federal elections are administered within states are briefly discussed with examples provided in text boxes. Election administration involves decisions about election rules, conducting elections, and funding. States primarily make decisions on election administration, with input from governors and legislatures. State laws and constitutions delegate responsibility for election administration decisions to state or local officials and voters. The U.S. Constitution allows for federal involvement in election decision-making, with Congress exercising such powers. Federal laws govern the conduct of federal elections, with examples of policymaking approaches illustrated in voter registration processes. State and local officials, as well as voters, have decision-making authority over election administration measures. This includes setting guidelines for voting technology and ballot design, with voters able to propose their own election administration statutes through citizen initiatives or popular referendums. State and local officials, along with voters, have the authority to set election administration laws. Some states allow citizens to propose statutes through initiatives or referendums. Examples include Nevada's automatic voter registration initiative and North Carolina's voter ID requirement referendum. Some states conduct elections at different levels, like Alaska above the borough level and Delaware at the state level. Congress has also made changes to election administration. In Delaware, elections are conducted at the state level. Congress has delegated some election responsibilities to the states, such as designating a single state office for absentee voting information. The day-to-day implementation of election administration policy is mainly handled by localities. Localities, primarily counties, handle most election tasks such as adding voters to rolls, printing ballots, and counting results. Some states assign responsibilities to municipalities or split duties between counties and municipalities. In about one-third of states, election administration is divided between multiple offices or agencies at the same local government level. Election administration involves intermittent and ongoing costs, including acquiring voting equipment and recurring expenses like printing ballots and paying poll workers. The federal government does not provide ongoing funding for elections, except for the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) which authorized $3.65 billion for state and local election administration. HAVA authorized $3.65 billion for formula-based payments to states for election administration. States and localities are responsible for most election costs, with states providing matching funds to receive federal HAVA funds. All states, except North Dakota, have contributed to establishing and maintaining statewide voter registration lists required by HAVA. States used HAVA funding to replace or update voting technology, with some states also contributing additional funds. State contributions to acquiring and maintaining voting equipment are detailed in tables provided by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) in 2018. Operation costs include poll worker labor, postage, paper supplies, and electricity, while maintenance costs cover hardware maintenance between elections. Some states cover or contribute to the costs of training local election officials, printing ballots, and transporting voting equipment for federal elections. The structures of state and local election systems conducting federal elections vary in leadership, relationships between officials, and population size served. The leadership of state and local election systems conducting federal elections can be led by individuals or groups, chosen by voters or appointed by authorities. Federal law requires states to designate a chief election official, with various methods of selection. The leadership types and selection methods of local election systems can vary within a state, as illustrated by examples from Florida and Wisconsin. Changes in leadership structures can occur over time, with states making various changes through voter-approved ballot measures or legislative actions. Variations in the relationship between local election officials and the state also exist, with some operating independently and others relying on state resources. States may provide training for local election officials, especially in smaller or rural jurisdictions. The method used to select leadership in local election systems can vary, with some states allowing state officials to appoint or remove local officials. State influence over local election officials can differ, with some states having the power to initiate legal action against them. Local election officials may have less control over their duties compared to state officials, who can take legal action, provide funding, or certify voting systems. Structural variations in election systems stem from differences in population size and density of jurisdictions served. For example, some jurisdictions serve fewer than 100 voters, while others like Los Angeles County serve millions. Popularly elected local officials are primarily accountable to voters rather than the state. Los Angeles County, with 6.8 million served, has more eligible registered voters than 40 other states. Election jurisdictions vary in population density, with urban centers like Los Angeles facing different challenges than rural areas. Small jurisdictions have simpler voter registration list maintenance due to shorter lists and personal connections with registrants. Larger jurisdictions have more resources and tax bases. These differences are reflected in the internal structures of election systems, such as staff size and specialization. One example of structural differences in election systems is the size and specialization of the staff. Larger jurisdictions have more personnel with specialized expertise in-house, while smaller jurisdictions rely more on outside expertise. For instance, smaller jurisdictions in Illinois seek election law expertise from state attorneys and technical support from voting equipment vendors. Another difference is the allocation of resources, with rural jurisdictions more likely to use paid print advertising for voter outreach compared to urban counterparts. Small jurisdictions may allocate a larger share of resources to meeting state and federal requirements due to fixed start-up costs. Political scientists note that there is a minimum cost to acquiring and maintaining voting technology, regardless of district size. State and local election systems can impact the implementation of federal election laws, leading Congress to specify distribution of election duties. Changes to the duties and structures of state and local election systems can be influenced by federal activity. Examples include federal efforts through requirements, funding, and information sharing to regulate how elections are administered at different levels. Compliance with federal requirements by states and localities can impact the implementation of federal election laws. The duties and structures of state and local election systems can be influenced by federal activity, such as requirements, funding, and information sharing. Compliance with federal requirements by states and localities can impact the implementation of federal election laws. The officials responsible for compliance with UOCAVA requirements may differ from those who handle the tasks needed for compliance. Funding from the federal government for election administration may be conditional on adopting certain policies or practices. The timely and well-tailored federal funding for state and local election systems, as authorized by HAVA, may impact how effectively it serves federal objectives. State election officials oversee the disbursement and usage of HAVA funding, with most states assigning implementation and funding duties to local officials. This can lead to differences in decision-making regarding the use of federal funds. HAVA funding oversight by state and local officials can lead to delays and misallocation of funds. Congress can improve information sharing to address these issues. The effectiveness of federal information sharing depends on timely communication with state and local officials, influenced by the distribution of election administration duties. Federal laws establish responsibilities for election administration at the state level, such as designating chief state election officials to coordinate state responsibilities under the NVRA and implementing a statewide voter registration system under HAVA. Federal regulation has unintentionally impacted state and local election systems. Federal regulation, including laws like HAVA and the NVRA, has shifted voter registration responsibilities between traditional election offices and other agencies. States have granted more rule-making power to their chief election officials in response to the complexity of federal laws. Congress has considered legislation to change election rules and systems at the state and local levels. The duties and structures of state and local election systems interact with past federal actions, raising considerations for future congressional proposals affecting federal elections. Members should consider how proposed changes would interact with state and local systems, if they would be difficult to implement, and if adjustments are needed for variations between states. Congress should determine the best policy tools to achieve the purpose of any proposed changes. When considering proposed changes to federal elections, it is important to evaluate whether to implement them through federal requirements or incentivize them with federal funding. Questions to consider include who is responsible for compliance and distribution of funds, and how changes may impact state and local election systems. Additionally, potential complications unrelated to election administration, such as federalism-related issues, should be taken into account. Federalism-related issues may arise when intervening in the relationships between states and their political subdivisions."
