Life or disability insurers must provide written reports of medical test results to applicants within 30 days of receiving them. If the report contains abnormal findings, the insurer must include a document highlighting the abnormality in understandable language and advise the applicant to consult with a health professional.

The insurer must supply distinct election and waiver forms at the same time as the application. The insurer must provide applicants with a copy of the election or waiver form submitted, and applicants can revoke their election or waiver at any time by notifying the insurer in writing or orally.
