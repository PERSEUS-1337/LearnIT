    "content": "Most analysts agree that Russia's democratic progress was uneven during the 1990s. The legislative and presidential elections under President Vladimir Putin in 1999-2000 and 2003-2004 showed setbacks for democratization. After the United Russia Party gained dominance in the State Duma in 2003, the Kremlin made it harder for smaller parties to win seats by raising the minimum votes needed to 7%. Independent candidates and small opposition parties lost the opportunity to win seats in constituency races, as all Duma members were to be elected via party lists. Changes in campaign and media laws also hindered smaller parties. Changes in campaign and media laws made it difficult for small parties and opposition groups to gain publicity in the lead-up to the December 2, 2007, Duma election. Out of 16 registered political parties, eleven were approved to run, including United Russia, A Fair Russia, the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, the Communist Party, Union of Right Forces, and Yabloko. A Fair Russia is seen as a centrist party linked to the Putin administration, while the Liberal Democratic Party usually supports Putin's initiatives in the Duma. The 2007 Duma election saw opposition bloc Other Russia, led by Garry Kasparov, denied permission to field candidates due to election laws. President Putin announced he would lead United Russia's candidate list but not join the party. Prominent figures often decline Duma seats if their party wins. Putin hinted at becoming prime minister after his presidency. The speaker mentioned the possibility of becoming prime minister after his presidency ends, but it is premature to discuss this as certain conditions need to be met first. The State Duma election on December 2 and the election of a capable president by the voters are crucial. The Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) was unable to send electoral observers to Russia, despite claims by the Central Election Commission (CEC) that visas were issued. President Putin expressed concerns about this situation. President Putin accused the U.S. State Department of influencing the ODIHR decision not to send electoral observers to Russia. Despite this, over one hundred observers from various organizations still attended. United Russia did not participate in political debates but approved a platform to continue Putin's policies. Free media access was provided to all parties, and candidate debates were informative. United Russia and the Nashi youth group emphasized Russian nationalism. The Russia Party and the Putin administration-supported Nashi youth group promoted Russian nationalism and anti-Western sentiments to prevent potential \"color revolutions\" funded by Western countries. They aimed to stop the United States from using individuals like Kasparov to incite such movements. However, these tactics could also lead to an increase in ethnic and religious hate crimes. Putin, in a speech to his supporters, warned of dangers like fueling hate crimes and an isolationist foreign policy. He stated that Russia's stability is threatened by groups supporting Soviet-era politicians, Boris Yeltsin, and those with foreign ties seeking a weak state. Some groups are campaigning for seats in the Duma and staging demonstrations to restore the oligarchs' regime. Four parties won enough votes to pass the 7% hurdle and win seats in the Duma, with United Russia increasing its seats. The losing parties garnered about 7% of the vote, with a relatively high turnout of 63.7% of 109 million voters. In the 2003 election, United Russia won the majority of votes with high voter turnouts reported in some regions. Observers criticized the election for not being free and fair, citing abuse of power, government resources supporting United Russia, and harassment of opposition parties. The president's active role turned the election into a referendum. Observers criticized the 2007 Duma election for lack of balanced media coverage, with some dismissing the assessment as influenced by foreign entities. Regional organizations viewed the election as democratic, similar to the 2003 election, seen as a mandate on Putin's rule. Putin's endorsement of the United Russia Party in 2007 was perceived as a popular endorsement of him. Putin viewed the election results as a popular endorsement of himself, indicating that voters wanted him to remain in a leadership position. He announced the convening of the new Duma to work with the government, emphasizing the legitimacy of the incoming Duma due to higher voter turnout. Putin praised voters for rejecting a destructive shift in the country's development and expressed concern about the upcoming presidential election. Some observers speculated that the new Duma might consider delaying the presidential election to extend Putin's term, similar to Uzbek President Islam Karimov in 2002. United Russia, with its strong hold on the Duma, emphasized continuing to support Putin's policies without major changes. The Communist Party, now the only opposition, will have limited influence due to United Russia's dominance in legislative offices. The Communist Party in the last Duma played a role of \"constructive opposition\" by working with United Russia on legislative issues. United Russia is expected to choose Putin's preferred successor at a convention on December 17. Potential candidates include Dmitriy Medvedev, Sergey Ivanov, or Viktor Zubkov. The chosen candidate may serve as a \"placeholder\" president until Putin can constitutionally run in the future. In the lead-up to Putin's supposed succession, intra-elite conflicts are increasing as pro-Putin groups protect their interests. Opposition leaders criticize the election for eroding democratic freedoms. Putin's former advisor predicts he will have to stay in office to suppress dissent against the authoritarian system. Putin is planning to use United Russia to rule as a single party. Putin's plan to use United Russia for single-party rule has raised concerns about the erosion of democratic freedoms in Russia. Opposition leaders are calling for support behind a single presidential candidate to challenge the Kremlin's candidate. Parties that receive low votes face heavy penalties, potentially leading to a political system with fewer choices for voters. The Bush Administration has expressed worries about anti-democratic trends and human rights issues in Russia. The Bush Administration expressed concerns about anti-democratic trends and human rights issues in Russia, particularly focusing on issues like the detention of Garry Kasparov and limitations on freedom of speech and assembly. The United States may face challenges in convincing Russia to democratize or not use its energy for political leverage, despite cooperation on global terrorism and nuclear threats. The United States expressed concerns about the legitimacy of the Duma election in Russia on December 3, urging Russian authorities to address alleged electoral irregularities. Members of Congress have been increasingly focused on democratization and human rights progress in Russia, with calls for added attention to Russian democratization in legislation and hearings. Senator Barack Obama also criticized the Russian government for the election violations. Senator Barack Obama criticized the Russian government for restricting media coverage, breaking up opposition rallies, and vote-counting irregularities during the Duma election. Despite these issues, he emphasized the importance of continued cooperation with Russia on various global issues. The victory of United Russia was seen as a sign of a stable economic climate and progressive macroeconomic policies by Moody's."
