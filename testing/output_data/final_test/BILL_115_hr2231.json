Congress finds that preventing North Korea from proliferating illegal nuclear weapons is a top priority for the United States and regional partners. Presidential transitions in Washington, DC, and Seoul create opportunities for instability that North Korea could exploit. North Korea is already violating UN Security Council resolutions and allegedly test-fired a ballistic missile on February 11, 2017. Strengthening dialogue on North Korean nuclear proliferation is crucial. The United States and its regional partners, including China, need a comprehensive strategy to prevent North Korea from acquiring nuclear weapons and achieve a denuclearized Korean Peninsula. A senior-level dialogue is necessary to coordinate sanctions enforcement, detect proliferation activities, and prepare for potential provocations. The United States, along with allies, has capable military experts to respond to North Korea threats. The trilateral relationship with Japan and South Korea is crucial for sharing information on the North Korean threat. It is important for the US to remain the security partner of choice in the Indo-Asia Pacific region. The United States should expand the trilateral mechanism with Japan and South Korea for regional cooperation regarding North Korea, in line with the liberal international order that has maintained peace since World War II. The United States should expand trilateral cooperation with Japan and South Korea regarding North Korea to maintain peace in the region. This includes establishing a Joint Commission on North Korea. The President may establish a joint commission with countries in the Indo-Asia Pacific region to address North Korean violations and nuclear proliferation. The Commission can support professional dialogues, coordinate political discussions, and develop responses to violations of UN Security Council resolutions. The Commission, chaired by the President, facilitates technical discussions among relevant departments and intelligence services in the Indo-Asia Pacific region to address North Korean violations and nuclear proliferation. It also coordinates information sharing and creates guidelines for multilateral direct action against shared threats. The Commission, chaired by the Secretary of State, includes members such as the Secretary of the Treasury, Energy, Defense, and the Director of National Intelligence. The Secretary of State is responsible for encouraging the participation of relevant counterparts from participating countries. Authorization of appropriations is provided for necessary activities of the Commission. SEC. 3. COORDINATION OF MILITARY AND DIPLOMATIC PLANNING. The policy of the United States in the Indo-Asia Pacific region includes robust diplomatic engagement, promotion of US values and economic interests, and a strong military posture. Diplomacy, development, and defense are critical tools for national security, promoting US interests, reassuring allies, deterring aggression, and responding to crises. Congress supports comprehensive regional and global diplomacy by the Secretary of State in coordination with US allies in the region. The Secretary of Defense is authorized to conduct routine and enhanced ports of call with key allies in the Indo-Asia Pacific region to coordinate responses to North Korean provocations and enhance enforcement of United Nations Security Council resolutions."
