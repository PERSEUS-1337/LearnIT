    "content": "The \"Superstorm Sandy Unemployment Relief Act of 2013\" extends disaster unemployment benefits for individuals affected by Hurricane Sandy for 39 weeks after the disaster declaration. The Act also includes Tropical Storm Sandy in its references. Payments shall be made to States equal to 100 percent of unemployment compensation paid under State law to individuals affected by Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Appropriated funds from the Treasury are not required to be repaid for this purpose. The Secretary of the Treasury will transfer funds from the General Fund to the extended unemployment compensation account and the employment security administration account to make payments to States for unemployment compensation related to Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Payments to States for unemployment compensation related to Hurricane Sandy in 2012 will be made by the Secretary of Labor through advance or reimbursement, with limitations on payments if the State is already compensated under other Federal laws. These payments are applicable for unemployment compensation from October 28, 2012, to July 28, 2013. The Senate defines terms related to unemployment compensation for individuals affected by Hurricane Sandy in 2012, ending on or before July 28, 2013. The Senate suggests that states should reverse charges to employer accounts for unemployment compensation paid to affected individuals upon receiving reimbursement. Additionally, states should reimburse entities that elected to reimburse the state for such compensation costs. The Senate recommends that states reimburse affected individuals who received waiting period credit instead of unemployment compensation for their initial week of unemployment. States may also receive reimbursement for retroactive payments made to these individuals. The Secretary of Labor may issue regulations to implement the Act."
