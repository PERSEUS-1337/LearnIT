    "content": "The national debt growth is a central issue in federal policymaking. The report explores ways to reduce budget deficits and control the debt long-term by examining historical spending trends and revenue policies. Choices include limiting defense and public goods, reducing entitlements, cutting support for governments, and raising taxes. Deficit reduction in one area puts pressure on others as the government incurs a deficit when spending exceeds revenues. The federal government incurs a budget deficit when spending exceeds revenues. Budget deficits have averaged 2.9% of GDP over the past 50 years, fluctuating from a surplus to a deficit. Economic conditions and policy choices impact budget outcomes. Deficits rise during recessions and fall during economic expansions. Policy choices, like changes in defense spending, can affect the budget situation. The accumulation of deficits over time results in the federal debt. The federal budget deficit has led to the growth of the federal debt, which was 78% of GDP in 2018. The debt can increase without raising the debt-to-GDP ratio if it grows at a rate equal to or less than GDP growth. However, the FY2018 deficit of 4% of GDP is considered unsustainable by most economists. Addressing this unsustainable deficit involves strategic choices on government goods, services, and transfers worth paying taxes for. In 2007, nondefense federal government services accounted for 10% of federal spending and 2% of GDP, while transfers made up around 70% of the federal budget. By 2018, transfers accounted for 76% of the federal budget, with defense spending making up about 15% of federal spending. Addressing budget shortfalls requires strategic choices on government goods, services, and transfers. To address budget shortfalls, transfer payments like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid may need to be reduced, along with transfers to state and local governments. Taxes may also need to be raised. The report examines government spending allocation, financing methods, and the recent surge in debt due to the recession. The growth in transfers to the elderly and healthcare spending contributes to unsustainable deficits. Different deficit reduction approaches will impact available choices, with potential cutbacks in Social Security and Medicare if taxes are not raised. Federal spending is mostly on transfers and payments rather than direct provision of government goods and services. Federal spending primarily consists of transfers and payments to individuals and state/local governments, accounting for about 75% of all spending. Defense spending, around 15% of the total, has decreased relative to the economy. The future challenge lies in the growth of spending on health and Social Security, leading to increased debt and interest payments. Preserving entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare is crucial for future fiscal sustainability. Preserving entitlements like Social Security and Medicare would require significant tax increases or cuts in mandatory spending. Limiting taxes or government size would likely lead to cuts in entitlement programs. Cutbacks in federal transfers to state and local governments may shift the burden of providing services to subnational governments. Government spending and taxes aim to provide public goods, correct market failures, achieve distributive justice, and manage business cycles. Defense is a significant public good funded by the federal government. State and local governments also provide public goods and income-support programs, with federal grants contributing to their funding. Intergovernmental transfers play a role in distributing funds among different levels of government. Intergovernmental transfers are crucial for evaluating budget proposals, as a reduction in transfers to state and local governments may shift the financial burden to them. Government spending can be categorized into providing public goods, transfers, discretionary or mandatory spending, and by function. This approach helps address concerns about potential deficits. The federal government divides spending into discretionary and mandatory categories, as well as by function such as defense, education, and health. Trends in federal taxes and trust funds are also discussed. Examining government spending involves looking at actual consumption or production versus transfers and subsidies. Government spending as a percentage of GDP remained around 20% between 1973 and 2007, with a decrease in direct provision of public goods. Transfers to persons increased by over 40%, while transfers to state and local governments rose by less than 5%. By 2018, spending increased by nearly 2% of GDP, mainly due to transfers to persons. Figure 2 illustrates the shift in federal spending forms since 1968, with 28% categorized as consumption in 2007. In 2007, federal government spending involved the direct provision of goods and services, with transfers to persons, state and local governments, interest payments, and subsidies making up the remaining amount. By 2018, government consumption spending had declined to 5% of output, while transfers had increased. Nondefense goods and services spending was 1.9% of GDP, and defense spending was 3.2% of GDP. Discretionary spending in FY2017 was 6.3% of GDP, with defense at 3.1% and nondefense at 3.2% of GDP. In 2007, government spending was 31.5% of output, with state and local spending at 14% and federal transfers netted out. State and local spending consisted of 69% in goods and services, 21% in transfers, and 9% in interest payments. In 2018, state and local spending net of federal transfers was 14%, totaling 32.5% for all government spending. Goods and services accounted for 64%, transfers for 26%, and interest for 9%. In 2007, government production of goods and services was 15.2% of output, with the federal government share at 5.5%. By 2018, the federal share of nondefense provision of goods and services was 11%, increasing to 14% with the federal share remaining at 5%. Total government civilian employment in 2007 was 16% of total nonagricultural employment, with the federal government accounting for 2%, state government for 3.7%, and local government for 10.4%. By September 2018, the employment share remained at about 15%, with each level of government maintaining similar shares. Government spending on the direct provision of public goods has declined over time, from 7.2% of GDP in 1980 to 5.5% in 2007. Despite total spending fluctuating around 20% of GDP between 1973 and 2007, government involvement in the economy has fallen by a third. Transfers to persons increased by over 40%, while transfers to state and local governments increased by less than 5%. By 2018, spending rose nearly 2% of GDP primarily due to these factors. Government spending increased by nearly 2% of GDP by 2018, with transfers to persons rising and consumption declining. Budget accounts classify spending as mandatory or discretionary, with discretionary spending controlled by annual appropriations and divided into defense and nondefense categories. Mandatory spending, such as Social Security and Medicare, is governed by permanent statutory provisions. Defense spending has fluctuated over the years, declining after the Vietnam War, rising in the 1980s, and then falling again before increasing due to the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. Nondefense discretionary spending has remained more stable, with fluctuations in the late 1970s. This suggests that defense spending is influenced by economic growth and international conflicts, while nondefense discretionary funding is more consistent and associated with the direct provision of goods. Mandatory spending, particularly on health care, has increased as a share of the economy since the 1960s. Discretionary spending has declined over time, with defense and nondefense discretionary spending both decreasing. Health spending, driven by Medicare and Medicaid, has significantly increased since FY1980. Since FY1980, mandatory spending has increased by 223.5%, primarily driven by changes in demographics and medical cost growth. Social Security spending also rose by 16.7% due to an increase in beneficiaries and life expectancies. Other mandatory programs have remained constant or declined. Federal spending by budget function has been relatively stable since 1969. In FY1980 to FY2018, federal spending has shifted towards health and programs for the elderly, with declining shares in other categories. In FY2007, 64% of spending was for human resources, 20% for defense, 9% for interest, and 5% for other functions. By FY2018, spending on human resources had increased while spending on national defense had decreased. The subcategories for government goods and services are small as a percentage of GDP. The section discusses tax revenue sources, their growth over time, differences in structure and distribution, and the overall size. The federal income tax system has several components, with individual income tax generating the largest revenue at $1.7 trillion in FY2018. Corporate income tax contributed $218 billion, while social insurance taxes generated $1.2 trillion. Other revenue sources included excise taxes and miscellaneous sources. The relative importance of these components can change over time. The individual income tax is the largest revenue source, fluctuating over time due to tax cuts and economic performance. Total taxes also varied, dropping to 17.1% in FY1977 and rising to 20.6% in FY2001. During the 2007-2009 recession, taxes fell to less than 15% of GDP. Corporate taxes fluctuated due to economic conditions, while payroll taxes peaked at 6.8% in 2001 and have since slightly declined. Excise taxes decreased by two-thirds, with the exception of tobacco taxes. Individual income taxes are progressive and the main revenue source for the federal government. Income taxes are the main source of revenue for federal spending, with corporate income taxes levied at a flat rate. Estate taxes are progressive but contribute a small share of government revenues. Payroll taxes, the next-largest revenue source, tend to fall more heavily on middle- and lower-income individuals and have flat rates with an earnings cap for Social Security. Increasing revenues from payroll taxes can be achieved by raising rates or eliminating the earnings cap. Revenues from Social Security payroll taxes are increasing by raising or eliminating the earnings cap. Medicare payroll taxes qualify individuals for Medicare HI coverage, while excise taxes, like those on alcohol and tobacco, tend to be regressive. Transportation fuel taxes are a major source of finance for transportation needs. Tax expenditures result in revenue losses due to special tax provisions. Tax expenditures are special tax credits and deductions that can be seen as a form of spending through the tax code. They averaged 7.5% of GDP from FY1974-FY2004 and were about 7.2% of GDP in FY2007 and FY2018. They make up about 36% and 35% of total government direct spending, respectively. Tax expenditures are considered transfers and subsidies that go to individuals, similar to mandatory spending. Tax expenditures, similar to mandatory spending, make up a significant portion of total government direct spending. The largest share of tax expenditures is for physical resources, with a focus on commerce and housing. This reflects special benefits for capital income, mortgage interest, property tax deductions, and exemptions from capital gains tax. The general government's tax-exempt bonds and itemized deductions for state and local taxes benefit education, highways, health, and income security. Trust funds and special federal funds finance specific services, with only a few significant trust funds. Some trust funds raise concerns about addressing the deficit. Trust funds, including Social Security and Medicare HI, are primarily funded by payroll taxes. Social Security has two main components - Old Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) and Disability Insurance (DI), while Medicare has Hospital Insurance Part A and Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) Parts B and D. These programs are financed through trust funds that can hold assets and earn interest. Medicare SMI is funded by premiums and general revenues. Table 6 displays revenue inflow and benefit payments for the three trust funds financed by payroll taxes. The table shows revenue and benefit payments for the trust funds financed by payroll taxes. OASI payroll tax revenue has decreased over the past 11 years, while DI and HI revenues have remained steady or increased. Payments for Social Security and Medicare benefits now exceed payroll tax collections due to factors like increasing longevity and an aging population. The SMI trust fund is mainly financed by general revenues, with premiums playing a smaller role. Medicare Part B premiums are set at 25% of the cost, while Part D premiums are set at 25.5%. SMI has grown faster than HI, with general revenue contributions increasing at a similar pace. SMI now accounts for over half of Medicare's costs. The Social Security (OASI) trust fund is projected to run out of accumulated assets in 2034, and the Medicare HI trust fund is predicted to run out in 2026. The future benefits of both programs are expected to outstrip future receipts, leading to a depletion of assets. Maintaining the historic source of financing for Social Security and Medicare HI from payroll taxes is a key question in long-run budget policy. If these programs are to be kept separate, they must be brought into balance separately. The federal debt is divided into debt held by the public and intragovernmental debt. As of February 28, 2019, the total federal debt outstanding was $22.116 trillion, with 73.5% held by the public and 26.5% held as intragovernmental debt. Individuals, firms, the Federal Reserve, state and local governments, and foreign governments can purchase publicly held debt through auctions. The total amount of publicly held debt outstanding as of February 28, 2019, was $16.251 trillion. This debt is acquired through auctions or on the secondary market if deemed \"marketable.\" It includes Treasury notes, bonds, bills, TIPS, and FRNs. Nonmarketable debt held by the public includes U.S. savings bonds and SLGS. As of February 28, 2019, 96.6% of publicly held debt, totaling $15.741 trillion, was marketable. Intragovernmental debt, totaling $5.865 trillion, is mostly nonmarketable, with only $0.029 trillion (0.5%) being marketable. Trust funds like Social Security hold nonmarketable debt, while marketable debt is held by the Federal Financing Bank. Intragovernmental debt has decreased as trust funds finance benefits from assets, and this debt is inaccessible to outside institutions. The federal government's publicly held debt, which totals $15.741 trillion, is mostly marketable. In contrast, intragovernmental debt of $5.865 trillion is mostly nonmarketable. Trust funds like Social Security hold nonmarketable debt, while marketable debt is held by the Federal Financing Bank. Intragovernmental debt has decreased as trust funds finance benefits from assets, and this debt is inaccessible to outside institutions. Public debt issues may compete for assets in private and financial markets, with deficits projected to average 4.4% of GDP over the next 10 years. Most economists agree that deficits are sustainable as long as they are less than the growth rate of the economy, which is projected to be just under 1.8% over the next 10 years. The budget deficit is projected to be an average of 8.4% of GDP from FY2039 to FY2048, with total spending growing significantly in various categories such as Social Security, health programs, and interest payments over the next 30 years. The projected federal budget deficit is expected to be 8.4% of GDP from FY2039 to FY2048, with significant growth in spending on Social Security, health programs, and interest payments over the next 30 years. Social Security and major health care programs are projected to account for 52.9% of the federal budget in FY2048, while federal revenue is expected to grow above its 50-year average. The CBO projects federal revenue to grow above its 50-year average of 17.4% of GDP, with increasing reliance on personal income taxes. By FY2048, individual income taxes are estimated to account for 55.1% of federal revenue. The debate on addressing budget issues and the strength of the U.S. economy are key considerations. The current U.S. economy's strength supports addressing the deficit quickly to prevent growing debt-to-GDP ratio. CBO projects a sustained deficit reduction of 1.9% of GDP to stabilize debt at 78% of GDP. Delaying reduction increases required cuts. However, addressing the deficit too quickly may temporarily dampen economic activity and not allow sufficient time for adjustment. Balancing the speed of deficit reduction is crucial for optimal outcomes. The need for optimal approaches to deficit reduction is crucial, balancing the speed of change is important. Changing entitlements for the elderly like Social Security and Medicare is difficult due to limited leeway for adjustments. Benefit changes should be adopted in the near term but applicable to the future. Discretionary spending or tax increases can be implemented more quickly, but the long-term spending and tax gap is too large for discretionary revisions alone. CBO regularly analyzes budgetary effects of different alternative baselines. The current policy baseline, presented in Table 8, maintains existing policies. It differs from the standard extended baseline in terms of lower revenues and higher noninterest spending. Deficit reduction becomes more challenging under the alternative baseline due to faster growth in debt and interest payments. The Peter G. Peterson Foundation's 2015 Fiscal Summit brought together various organizations to address fiscal issues. Various organizations, including the Action Forum, American Enterprise Institute, Bipartisan Budget Center, Center for American Progress, and Economic Policy Institute, collaborated to develop policy proposals to reduce budget deficits and stabilize the debt. Plans differed in details but aimed to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio. Spending-to-GDP ratios ranged from 17.8% to 24.3%, taxes-to-GDP ratios varied from 21.2% to 23.5%, and fiscal outcomes ranged from a surplus of 4.5% to a deficit of 1.9%. Sustainable debt levels can still exist with some deficit as long as it does not grow faster than GDP. The proposed plans aim to increase revenue collections and reduce spending relative to CBO projections. Discussions on reducing the budget deficit often start narrowly and expand to broader proposals. Discretionary spending, whether for defense or nondefense purposes, historically remains relatively constant or in decline as a percentage of GDP. Discretionary spending, targeted for budget savings, may provide initial savings as it is easier to change in the short run. Caps on discretionary spending were a key source of deficit reduction in the Budget Control Act of 2011. The CBO baseline includes these reductions through FY2021, with discretionary spending projected to grow at the rate of inflation thereafter. Cuts to defense and nondefense discretionary spending could result in lower government services than previously seen. The Solutions Initiative III proposed cuts to discretionary spending without specifying details, potentially impacting programs like prisons, grants, military, and highways. These cuts were around 19% below the CBO baseline but may not fully address the deficit gap. The Solutions Initiative III proposed cuts in discretionary spending to address the deficit gap, aiming to reduce overall spending by 1.4% of GDP. However, CBO estimates show a growing gap between spending and taxes, now at 7.6% of GDP by FY2040. Closing this gap may require cuts in entitlements, tax increases, or a combination of both. CBO's 2018 study suggested specific options for cuts in discretionary spending, with the 10 largest options potentially reducing spending by $148.1 billion per year. Social Security has been financed through a trust fund mechanism since the 1930s, with benefits funded by payroll tax contributions. Payroll taxes are imposed at a fixed rate with a cap on income covered, which has fallen lower in the income distribution due to increasing income disparities. Benefits are progressive, linked to contributions, and the replacement rate for wages decreases as wages rise. To address the deficit gap, proposed cuts in discretionary spending aim to reduce overall spending by 1.4% of GDP, potentially saving $148.1 billion per year. The Social Security trust fund is facing financial challenges as benefits outpace payroll taxes, leading to a projected insolvency by 2034. Currently, the trust fund is using its assets to cover the shortfall, but will only be able to pay about three-fourths of benefits at that time. The Social Security trust fund is projected to face insolvency by 2034 as benefits exceed payroll taxes. To address this, options include increasing payroll taxes on higher earners and reducing benefits by roughly 25%. CBO's 2018 report suggests lowering initial benefit amounts and slowing benefit growth to reduce Social Security spending by up to 0.2% of GDP per year over the next 10 years. The Solutions Initiative III presents various options to address the challenges facing the Medicare HI trust fund, including increasing payroll tax rates and cost containment measures. These options aim to reduce Medicare spending by up to 0.05% of GDP per year over the next 10 years. The Solutions Initiative III presents options to address challenges with the Medicare HI trust fund, including raising revenue by up to 1.0% of GDP per year through payroll tax rate increases and higher Medicare premiums. Limiting revenues could constrain the federal government's scope, but evidence does not strongly support the idea that tax increases would hinder economic activity. If revenues are limited, pressure would be placed on major entitlements like Social Security and health spending. With revenues around 19.4% of GDP in FY2040, only 0.2% of GDP is left for other expenses. Major reductions in Social Security and health spending would be required to keep tax levels at current percentages of GDP. The Solutions Initiative III proposals aim to raise additional revenue to reduce the necessary cutbacks in entitlement programs. The Solutions Initiative III proposals aim to increase taxes to 22.0% of GDP to reduce Social Security and health spending by 0.9% of GDP. Major changes to government programs for health care and entitlements would be necessary to address the long-run deficit. Protecting entitlements would require maintaining the social safety net for lower-income persons and the elderly. The Social Security trust funds and Medicare HI have accumulated surpluses to support future benefits, but current formulations are unsustainable. Increasing taxes may be necessary to maintain these programs, as discretionary spending alone may not address the deficit. Social Security benefits are expected to rise to 6.29% of output by FY2035 due to demographic changes. Unlike health care, Social Security benefits are projected to stabilize over time, with a range of tax increases and benefit cuts needed to achieve permanent balance. Social Security benefits are projected to stabilize with a mix of tax increases and benefit cuts to achieve permanent balance. Increasing the retirement age could be a mixed option, but it may disproportionately affect low-income workers. Tax increases shift the burden to younger generations, and similar arguments could apply to other elderly programs like Medicare. The rising costs of elderly programs like Medicare and nursing home care are mainly financed by payroll taxes and general revenues collected during working years. Health care cost increases are a different matter, reflecting better medical care and inefficiencies in the system. Individuals with higher incomes may choose to spend more on health care, but inefficiencies in resource allocation and consumption by patients and physicians contribute to rising costs. Failure to allocate resources efficiently in healthcare may lead to excessive consumption and inefficiencies. To address this issue, options such as raising income tax rates, broadening the tax base, increasing other taxes, and introducing new taxes like a value-added tax or carbon tax are being considered. Political barriers, rather than technical ones, may hinder rate increases, but historical tax rates have been higher. Tax expenditures are also being scrutinized for potential reductions. Tax rates in the past have been higher than today, and eliminating tax expenditures faces political and technical challenges. Some expenditures are difficult to eliminate, valued for social safety nets, or politically popular. For example, Solutions Initiative III proposals aimed to limit the exclusion of employer health insurance, a significant tax expenditure. The tax expenditure associated with defined benefit pension plans, accounting for 7.2% of total revenue forgone, poses challenges in valuation due to future work history dependency. Solutions Initiative III proposes eliminating various tax expenditures to generate additional revenue. One study suggests that a realistic appraisal of tax expenditure options could increase income-tax revenues by about 15%. Alterations to payroll and excise taxes, such as raising rates and expanding the base, could also generate additional revenue. Options to extend solvency to the Social Security trust fund include taxing Social Security benefits like pensions. Revenue could be raised by taxing Social Security benefits like pensions, increasing gasoline and alcohol taxes, and implementing value-added and carbon taxes. These new tax sources could generate significant additional revenues over 10 years, according to the CBO. The proposed changes in tax policy aim to increase progressivity by impacting high-income individuals more than others. Payroll rate changes would be proportional, but raising the wage cap would affect higher-income workers. Consumption taxes like value-added and carbon taxes are regressive. Overall, a combination of changes could maintain the current revenue distribution. Details on reduced transfers to state and local governments were not specified due to the high level of aggregation in discretionary spending. Some reductions in federal transfers to state and local governments were not specified in discretionary spending, potentially affecting areas like education and Medicaid. State and local governments benefit from tax expenditures and federal transfers, which make up a significant portion of their receipts. Restrictions on state and local transfers could shift spending burden from federal to subnational governments."
