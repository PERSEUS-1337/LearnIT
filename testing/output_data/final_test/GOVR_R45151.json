    "content": "The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) governs U.S. immigration laws, unifying them under one framework since 1952. Various federal agencies, including the Department of Justice, State Department, and Department of Homeland Security, have roles in immigration administration. Before the Homeland Security Act of 2002, the Attorney General oversaw immigration laws, delegating power to agencies like the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR). The Homeland Security Act of 2002 dismantled the INS, created DHS, and transferred immigration administration responsibilities to the DHS Secretary. DHS components like CBP, ICE, and USCIS now carry out major functions of the former INS, with ICE being the primary investigative arm of immigration enforcement in the U.S. ICE enforces immigration laws in the U.S. interior by apprehending aliens who violate the laws, while CBP is responsible for enforcing immigration laws at the border. DHS, through USCIS, determines eligibility for relief and benefits. Removal proceedings are primarily conducted by EOIR within DOJ. Removal proceedings are primarily conducted by EOIR within DOJ. An IJ assesses an alien's removability and eligibility for relief from removal. Aliens have a right to legal counsel at their own expense. Appeals can be made to the BIA, and the Attorney General can review these appeals. Federal circuit courts of appeals have exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate petitions for review of final removal orders. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) limits federal courts' jurisdiction over cases involving aliens ordered removed based on criminal activity, unless a constitutional claim or question of law is raised. The State Department processes visas for aliens traveling to the United States, with immigrant visas for permanent residency and nonimmigrant visas for temporary admission. Aliens must submit documentation and interview with a consular official for visa approval. Certain criminal activity may make an alien ineligible for a visa to enter the United States. Inadmissible aliens are generally ineligible for visas or lawful admission, while deportable aliens have engaged in activities that make them removable from the country. The criminal grounds for inadmissibility are outlined in the INA. The criminal grounds for deportation, outlined in INA \u00a7 237(a)(2), require the alien to have been convicted of specific crimes. Both inadmissibility and deportability grounds reference a \"crime of moral turpitude\" as a basis for denial of admission or deportation from the United States. The term \"crime involving moral turpitude\" is a basis for denying admission or deporting an alien from the United States. The term is not clearly defined in immigration law, but it generally refers to conduct that is inherently base, vile, or depraved, and contrary to accepted rules of morality. It involves malicious intention and actions contrary to justice, honesty, principle, or good morals. The federal courts generally agree that a crime involving moral turpitude is one that is inherently fraudulent or involves an intent to defraud. Attorney General Michael Mukasey's 2008 opinion in Matter of Silva-Trevino established a standard that a crime involving moral turpitude must involve reprehensible conduct and a culpable mental state. This ruling has been adopted as the standard for determining whether a crime involves moral turpitude. The BIA has adopted a standard for determining crimes involving moral turpitude, as defined in INA \u00a7 101(a)(43) which lists aggravated felonies for immigration purposes. This definition includes specific offenses and broad categories, not limited to felonies but also encompassing certain misdemeanors. The term aggravated felony designates certain crimes and categories as such, including violations of state or federal law and foreign law with a term of imprisonment. An aggravated felony conviction can lead to serious immigration consequences, including deportation and inadmissibility. Good moral character is required for relief from removal and naturalization, with specific criminal activities disqualifying an alien. The table below lists major criminal bars to finding good moral character for aliens, with some criminal activities permanently barring a finding of good moral character. The INA provides grounds for relief from exclusion or removal, such as adjustment of status and waivers of certain grounds of inadmissibility. The INA provides relief from exclusion or removal through various forms such as cancellation of removal, voluntary departure, withholding of removal, and asylum. Immigration authorities have discretion to waive certain grounds of inadmissibility, including criminal activities, depending on the circumstances. The Attorney General and DHS Secretary have the authority to adjudicate applications for relief and immigration benefits. INA \u00a7 212(h) grants discretion to waive criminal grounds for inadmissibility for aliens seeking admission as LPRs. The Attorney General or DHS Secretary may waive inadmissibility grounds for crimes involving moral turpitude, multiple criminal convictions, prostitution, serious criminal activity, or drug crimes involving possession of 30 grams or less of marijuana. The alien must establish inadmissibility solely on prostitution-related crimes or related activities for the discretion to be exercised. INA \u00a7 212(h) allows for waivers of criminal grounds for inadmissibility for aliens seeking admission as LPRs, based on certain criteria such as the time elapsed since the crime, rehabilitation, and extreme hardship to qualifying family members. Waivers are not available for aliens convicted of murder or criminal acts involving torture. Additionally, discretion may be granted for crimes involving moral turpitude, multiple criminal convictions, serious criminal activity, or drug crimes involving possession of 30 grams or less of marijuana. INA \u00a7 212(h) bars waivers for aliens convicted of murder or criminal acts involving torture. A waiver may not be granted to an alien previously admitted as an LPR if convicted of an aggravated felony or not lawfully resided continuously in the US for at least seven years before removal proceedings. For nonimmigrants, DHS may authorize a visa despite criminal grounds for inadmissibility if recommended by the Secretary of State or consular officer, except for espionage or sabotage. INA \u00a7 240A authorizes cancellation of removal for certain LPRs and nonimmigrants in removal proceedings, allowing the Attorney General to cancel the removal of qualifying individuals. This relief is available to up to 4,000 non-LPRs each year. Cancellation of removal under INA \u00a7 240A allows the Attorney General to cancel the removal of qualifying individuals, including LPRs and non-LPRs, who meet specific criteria such as years of residency and criminal history. Eligibility differs for LPRs and non-LPRs, with LPRs requiring five years of LPR status and seven years of continuous residency, while non-LPRs need ten years of physical presence and good moral character. LPRs convicted of an aggravated felony are ineligible for cancellation of removal, but the Attorney General can still cancel removal for LPRs convicted of other offenses. Non-LPRs may be disqualified for cancellation of removal by committing certain crimes. The INA allows relevant immigration authorities to grant voluntary departure to an otherwise removable alien within 60 to 120 days, instead of formal removal. This option benefits the government by avoiding removal costs, and the alien can depart to any country of choice within the statutory period, avoiding reentry bars. The INA allows immigration authorities to grant voluntary departure to removable aliens, avoiding formal removal proceedings and reentry bars. There are two forms of voluntary departure, one granted instead of removal proceedings and one granted at the conclusion of proceedings. Certain criteria must be met, including good moral character and no aggravated felony convictions. DHS is barred from removing an alien to a country where their life or freedom would be threatened. Withholding of removal is mandatory if an immigration judge determines that the alien is eligible based on a clear probability of threat to life or freedom in their home country. Certain conduct, including participation in Nazi persecution or genocide, renders an alien ineligible for this relief. An alien may be ineligible for withholding of removal if they participated in Nazi persecution, genocide, or committed acts of torture or extrajudicial killing. They could also be considered a danger to the community or security of the United States if convicted of a particularly serious crime, regardless of the length of the sentence imposed. An alien convicted of a serious crime can apply for protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT), which includes withholding of removal and deferral of removal. To qualify, the alien must show it is likely they would be tortured in the country of removal. If eligible for CAT protection, the alien may not be removed to the country of removal but could be sent to a different country. Criminal-related grounds can bar eligibility for withholding of removal under CAT. Deferral of removal under CAT is available to all aliens likely to face torture if removed to a specific country, regardless of criminal convictions. It is a temporary form of protection that can be terminated if evidence shows no torture risk or assurances are obtained from the country of removal. INA \u00a7 208 allows aliens to apply for asylum within a year of entering the US, regardless of immigration status. An alien in the United States can apply for asylum with USCIS or defensively during removal proceedings if they fear persecution based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or social group membership. The well-founded fear standard for asylum is less strict than for withholding of removal, but criminal activity may affect eligibility. Asylum may be denied to an alien for various reasons, including being a danger to the US community due to a serious crime conviction, involvement in terrorist activities, or posing a security threat. Unlike withholding of removal, any aggravated felony is considered a serious crime for asylum purposes. Additionally, an alien can apply for refugee status from outside the US under INA \u00a7 207, requiring proof of past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution based on race, religion, or other factors. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has the discretion to admit a refugee based on humanitarian concerns and admissibility criteria. Certain grounds of inadmissibility may be waived for refugees, including those related to criminal offenses. Refugees can adjust to Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR) status after one year in the US. The DHS has the authority to waive certain criminal grounds of inadmissibility for refugees seeking adjustment of status under INA \u00a7 245. However, most criminal grounds listed in INA \u00a7 212(a)(2) preclude aliens from adjusting status, except for waivers granted under INA \u00a7 212(h). Under INA \u00a7 212(h), the Attorney General and DHS Secretary have discretion to waive specified criminal inadmissibility grounds for adjusting status. Criminal activity can affect eligibility for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) relief under INA \u00a7 244. The relevant immigration authorities have discretion to waive most inadmissibility grounds for TPS relief, except for specific criminal offenses such as crimes involving moral turpitude, drug violations, drug trafficking, and multiple felony convictions. Additionally, TPS relief may not be granted to individuals with certain criminal backgrounds, including felony convictions or multiple misdemeanors committed in the United States. LPRs may naturalize as U.S. citizens after residing continuously in the United States for five years and meeting other requirements, including demonstrating good moral character. Certain criminal activities, such as aggravated felonies, can permanently prevent an alien from showing good moral character and thus bar them from naturalizing. Criminal proceedings involving aliens may have immigration consequences, potentially leading to removal from the country. While immigration proceedings are civil, aliens facing criminal charges have a constitutional right to effective counsel. Aliens facing criminal charges have a constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel, including during pretrial stages when crucial decisions like pleading guilty are made. In Padilla v. Kentucky, the Supreme Court ruled that lawyers must advise alien clients if pleading guilty could lead to removal from the United States, as removal is nearly automatic for many noncitizen offenders. Accurate legal advice for noncitizens accused of crimes is crucial due to the complexity of immigration law. The Court emphasized the importance of criminal defense attorneys providing accurate advice to noncitizen clients regarding potential immigration consequences of pending criminal charges. INA defines a conviction as a formal judgment of guilt entered by a court, with specific criteria for applicability in cases of inadmissibility and deportability. The final judgment ordered by the district judge contains the formal judgment of guilt, or a state court's written judgment and sentence. A conviction may not qualify if vacated due to defects in criminal proceedings, but may still qualify if vacated for rehabilitative purposes or to avoid immigration consequences. Expunged convictions are generally excluded unless expunged for rehabilitative purposes. Additionally, a conviction exists if adjudication of guilt has been withheld. A conviction for immigration consequences can occur if a judge or jury finds the alien guilty, the alien pleads guilty, or sufficient facts are admitted. Punishment or restraint on liberty is required for a conviction, which can include probation or restitution. The INA sometimes specifies criminal conduct leading to removal, but in many cases, it refers to general criminal behavior with immigration consequences. Reviewing courts and immigration authorities must determine the conduct covered. Courts and immigration authorities use a \"categorical approach\" to determine if an alien's criminal conviction aligns with the federal definition of the crime. They analyze the statutory elements of the offense, presuming the conviction is based on the least culpable conduct. If the conviction extends beyond the generic offense for removal, it cannot be used for immigration consequences. The courts may use the \"modified categorical approach\" to determine an alien's removal based on a criminal conviction when a statute lists multiple elements of a crime. This approach allows them to examine underlying conviction documents to compare with the federal generic offense. However, the Supreme Court has set limits on when this approach can be applied, particularly when a statute covers a broader range of conduct than the generic offense. The modified categorical approach allows courts to determine which specific element of a divisible statute formed the basis of a defendant's conviction. This approach can be used when comparing a criminal statute to a generic offense, especially when considering the particular circumstances of the crime. Reviewing courts have applied a \"circumstance-specific\" exception, allowing them to consider evidence outside the conviction record, such as meeting a monetary threshold for a fraud offense to constitute an aggravated felony under the INA. The BIA uses categorical and modified categorical approaches to determine if a criminal conviction qualifies as a predicate offense for immigration purposes. They focus on statutory elements rather than specific facts, only considering the record of conviction in cases with a divisible statute. The BIA uses categorical and modified categorical approaches to determine if a criminal conviction qualifies as a predicate offense for immigration purposes. Previously, the BIA adopted a less restrictive form of the categorical approach, but after several reviewing courts rejected this formulation, the BIA ruled that the categorical and modified categorical approaches are the proper methods for determining whether an alien was convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude. The BIA announced it would use the categorical and modified categorical approaches to determine if an alien was convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude. The BIA clarified that the modified categorical approach applies when the statute is divisible, and adjudicators can only consider the record of conviction to determine the basis of the conviction. Congress often does not provide a statutory definition for predicate offenses with immigration consequences, leaving it to the courts to establish a generic definition. The courts have been tasked with defining undefined predicate offenses with immigration consequences, such as theft and violent crimes like murder, rape, or sexual abuse of a minor. The courts have adopted a broad and modern construction for defining these offenses, moving away from restrictive common law definitions. In Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions, there was disagreement over the scope of \"sexual abuse of a minor\" under the INA, with the Supreme Court ruling that the term requires the victim to be under 16 for statutory rape offenses. Courts have struggled to interpret INA provisions consistently, including defining \"crime of violence\" as an aggravated felony. The term \"crime of violence\" is defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16 as an offense involving physical force against another person or property, or any felony with a substantial risk of using force. Courts debated the mens rea required for a crime of violence, with some requiring gross negligence while others demanded recklessness or specific intent. In 2004, clarity was sought on this issue. In 2004, the Supreme Court clarified that a crime of violence requires an \"active employment\" of force with a higher degree of intent than negligent conduct. Recently, the Supreme Court addressed the constitutionality of the definition of a crime of violence in Session v. Dimaya. Congress frequently amends the INA to modify immigration consequences of criminal conduct. Congress has the authority to adjust criminal grounds for inadmissibility and deportability, expand or limit aggravated felonies, clarify terms like moral turpitude, and modify standards for determining immigration consequences of criminal activity. This includes altering the number of crimes that make an alien ineligible for relief from removal or lacking good moral character. Congress may consider legislative options to change the criteria used by courts and immigration authorities in deciding whether an alien can be excluded or deported due to criminal behavior."
