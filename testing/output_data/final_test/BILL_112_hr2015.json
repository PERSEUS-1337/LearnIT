Congress finds that the Federal Government spent $147.4 billion in fiscal year 2010 on research and development, leading to new products and processes like antibiotics, plastics, airplanes, computers, microwaves, and bioengineered drugs. The Federal laboratory system has generated technologies with market value that could be further developed by the industrial community. Technological progress drives economic growth and increases our standard of living. Commercialization in the private sector is crucial for stimulating economic growth. Royalties from intellectual property rights support further research in academia and provide a return on investment for the business sector. SEC. 4. DUTIES OF COMMISSION.

A report on the study's results must be submitted to Congress within one year of the Commission's first meeting.
