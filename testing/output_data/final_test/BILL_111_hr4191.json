    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Let Wall Street Pay for the Restoration of Main Street Act of 2009\". The findings are also included in the Act. Congress finds that the nation is struggling with a recession, high unemployment rate, and record deficits. Despite Wall Street's bailout and resurgence in profits, a robust economy requires good paying jobs for all Americans, not just bankers. The Federal Government must address the jobless recovery and deficit to restore Main Street America. A securities transaction tax on Wall Street could raise $150 billion annually by imposing a 0.25 percent tax on financial transactions. This tax was previously in place from 1914 to 1966, with Congress doubling it in 1932 to aid in financial recovery during the Great Depression. A securities transaction tax on Wall Street could raise $150 billion annually by imposing a 0.25 percent tax on financial transactions. Half of the revenue will be used to reduce the deficit, while the other half will fund the creation of good paying jobs to help Americans get back to work. The Job Creation Reserve for investments in middle-class jobs is outlined in Section 3. The Job Creation Reserve, established for budgetary purposes, will hold half of the additional Federal receipts from the enactment of the Act. It is available to offset costs from the Surface Transportation Authorization Act of 2009 and subsequent legislation promoting job creation in the United States. Criteria for the subsequent legislation include promoting jobs at the median wage, supporting manufacturing jobs, and prohibiting Troubled Asset Relief Program recipients from benefiting directly. Adjustments to bills or amendments are subject to the budget committee chairman's procedure. When a bill or joint resolution provides funding exceeding 2010 levels, the Budget Committee chairman must adjust discretionary spending limits and allocations accordingly. The Budget Committee chairman must adjust discretionary spending limits and allocations accordingly based on the appropriate concurrent resolution on the budget as required by the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. Adjustments shall not exceed half the receipts estimated by the Congressional Budget Office attributable to the Act for the fiscal year. SEC. 4.
