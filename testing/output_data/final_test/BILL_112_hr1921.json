    "content": "The \"Build the Fence Now Act of 2011\" mandates the construction of two-layered reinforced fencing along the entire United States-Mexico border. The \"Build the Fence Now Act of 2011\" requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to construct two layers of reinforced fencing along the entire US-Mexico border and install additional physical barriers and roads. The \"Build the Fence Now Act of 2011\" mandates the construction of two layers of reinforced fencing, along with additional physical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, radars, and sensors along the US-Mexico and US-Canada borders to gain operational control. The Secretary of Homeland Security must also add a second layer of fencing in areas with only one layer currently. The Secretary must ensure the completion of two-layered reinforced fencing and additional physical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, radars, and sensors along the US-Mexico border within two years of enactment. The subparagraph regarding the international land border between the United States and Canada is enacted, while the consultation requirement in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 is repealed. Additionally, the installation of two-layered reinforced fencing is required along the border. If topographically impractical, alternative measures must be reported to Congress for achieving and maintaining operational control over the international border. The installation of two-layered reinforced fencing is not required in locations specified in the report. The report must detail alternative measures for achieving border control if certain locations are exempt from the fencing requirement. Additionally, a clerical amendment removes a specific border reference, and appropriations are authorized for the amendment's implementation. The Tunnel Task Force, comprised of ICE, CBP, and DEA personnel, will receive a 100% budget increase in fiscal year 2012 to combat drug and human trafficking through tunnels. The increase will be used for personnel, technology upgrades, and rewards for information on tunnel locations. The Secretary of Homeland Security is authorized to develop a program integrating aerial surveillance technologies for border security with Mexico and Canada. This includes unmanned aerial vehicles, sensors, satellite command, and other necessary equipment. Appropriations are authorized for this purpose."
