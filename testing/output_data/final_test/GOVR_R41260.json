The case established the legal framework for deference to federal agencies in interpreting statutes, leading to confusion and challenges in its application by federal judges. Despite efforts to clarify the Chevron doctrine, questions persist as Justice Stevens departs the Court. Justice Stevens spent the last quarter century clarifying the Chevron doctrine. As he leaves the Court, he may be in the minority on a key aspect of the test's application. The Chevron decision established a two-part test for agency deference, with unresolved questions on its proper application. The case revolved around the \"bubble concept\" in the 1977 Clean Air Act amendments. In 1981, the EPA allowed states to adopt the \"bubble concept\" for stationary sources, calculating plant emissions as a whole. The Natural Resources Defense Council challenged this interpretation in court, arguing it went against the Clean Air Act's goal of improving air quality. The D.C. Circuit set aside the EPA regulation as contrary to the Clean Air Act's purpose of improving air quality. The Supreme Court reversed this decision, ruling that the regulation was a permissible exercise of authority under the CAA. Justice Stevens outlined a two-part test for reviewing agency construction of statutory authority, emphasizing the importance of Congress's clear intent in interpreting statutes. The court must give effect to Congress's intent when interpreting statutes. If Congress has not directly addressed an issue, the court defers to the agency's permissible construction of the statute. Stevens's Chevron analysis established a deferential judicial role in reviewing agency interpretations. At step one, the court determines if Congress has spoken clearly on the issue and gives effect to any unambiguous intent expressed. Congress's intent must be followed when interpreting statutes. If Congress has not clearly expressed a position, the court defers to the agency's interpretation. Justice Stevens applied the Chevron \"two-step\" analysis to determine that the EPA's \"plantwide\" regulation was a reasonable construction of the Clean Air Act. Justice Stevens identified three key rationales for according deference to an agency's statutory interpretation: congressional delegation, agency expertise, and political accountability. Once Congress delegates authority to an agency, the agency's authority to fill gaps in statutory uncertainty precludes a court from substituting its own judgment. Chevron allows resolving statutory uncertainty by choosing between reasonable interpretations to be a policy decision better answered by the agency than by a court. Deference to an agency's interpretation of statutes is justified by congressional delegation, agency expertise, and political accountability, as noted by Justice Stevens. Judges lack expertise in the field and should respect the agency's interpretation due to their substantive knowledge. Political accountability supports granting deference to agency interpretations over judicial decisions. Justice Stevens emphasized the Chief Executive's role in making policy choices, as outlined in the Chevron decision. Despite initially viewing his opinion as a restatement of the law, Chevron has become a cornerstone in administrative law. However, the application of Chevron remains inconsistent, leading to ongoing debates on its usage in interpreting statutes for over 25 years. The Chevron decision by Justice Stevens has been influential in administrative law for over 25 years, with ongoing debates on its application. The opinion is regularly cited, and the Chevron test continues to evolve, serving as an authority in delineating interpretive roles of courts and agencies. Whenever an agency interprets its authorizing statute or a statute it administers, the Chevron framework is typically considered by courts. Agencies use these interpretations to justify significant actions, despite some concerns about appropriateness. The Chevron decision by Justice Stevens has been influential in administrative law for over 25 years, with ongoing debates on its application. The opinion has played a large role in landmark cases on agency overreaching. However, Chevron's influence is arguably waning, with the Court less frequently turning to it for agency statutory interpretation. The Court has also restricted the circumstances in which Chevron potentially applies. The Chevron decision by Justice Stevens has been influential in administrative law for over 25 years, with ongoing debates on its application. Major questions remain about when and how to properly apply the Chevron test, including what agency interpretations qualify for Chevron deference and what tools of statutory construction should be used. The 2009 Supreme Court case Entergy Corp. v. Riverkeeper, Inc. exemplifies the confusion surrounding the Chevron test despite thousands of judicial citations. The Supreme Court is still debating the order of steps in the Chevron test, as seen in the Entergy case where the majority upheld EPA's interpretation of \"best technology available\" including cost consideration. Justice Scalia deemed EPA's position reasonable, while Justice Stevens criticized the majority for skipping step one and assuming ambiguity. In 2001, the Supreme Court added a new threshold requirement to the Chevron analysis in U.S. v. Mead Corp. Justice Souter determined that agency interpretations qualify for Chevron deference when Congress delegated authority to make rules with the force of law. Mead and Christensen v. Harris established that Chevron deference depends on the formality of the agency's interpretation process. The Supreme Court in U.S. v. Mead Corp. added a new requirement to Chevron deference, stating that agency interpretations must be made with delegated authority to have the force of law. Policy statements and interpretive letters do not warrant Chevron deference, while formal rules and interpretations with the force of law qualify. Interpretations not meeting Chevron deference may still receive Skidmore deference, where courts defer to persuasive agency interpretations. The \"force of law\" standard from Mead has not been clearly defined. The Supreme Court in U.S. v. Mead Corp. added a new requirement to Chevron deference, stating that agency interpretations must be made with delegated authority to have the force of law. In Barnhart v. Walton, the Court introduced factors to determine Chevron deference eligibility, including the interstitial nature of the legal question, agency expertise, and the importance of the question to statute administration. Justice Scalia criticized the Mead standard, predicting ongoing confusion over its implications. Justice Stevens has been influential in these debates. Justice Stevens has played a prominent role in the ongoing dispute over the application of the Chevron test, emphasizing the importance of legislative history and purpose in determining Congress's intent. This contrasts with Justice Scalia's opposition to using legislative history, advocating for a more textualist approach. The ongoing dispute over the Chevron test involves Justice Stevens advocating for legislative history and purpose, while Justice Scalia opposes it, preferring a purely textualist approach. The Court seems to lean towards Scalia's position, with Stevens continuing to assert his intentionalist stance. The 2007 case Zuni Public School District No. 89 v. Department of Education exemplifies this interpretive divide. District No. 89 v. Department of Education in Zuni involved a dispute over the interpretation of the Impact Aid Act's \"equalization requirement\" for aid expenditures to public school districts. The majority initially favored a textualist approach but considered legislative history and purpose due to technical language in the statute. This case exemplified the interpretive divide between Justice Stevens advocating for legislative history and purpose, and Justice Scalia preferring a purely textualist approach. The majority in District No. 89 v. Department of Education in Zuni found that Congress's intent was unclear regarding the Impact Aid Act's \"equalization requirement.\" Justice Stevens emphasized the importance of legislative history in the Chevron analysis, stating that the agency had followed Congress's intent based on the clarity of the provision's legislative history. Stevens highlighted the use of traditional tools of statutory construction, including analysis of legislative history, to determine intent. In District No. 89 v. Department of Education in Zuni, Justice Stevens emphasized the importance of statutory text over legislative history in determining congressional intent. Justice Scalia, in dissent, focused solely on the plain language of the statute and criticized reliance on legislative history. Scalia believed that the agency's interpretation should align with the \"crystal-clear text\" of the statute, without the need for resorting to legislative history. The new Court's resolution of ambiguities in applying the Chevron test will impact its legacy. A narrow interpretation of Chevron deference may reduce deference to agency interpretations. A textualist approach may diminish the role of legislative history in discerning Congress's intentions. The impending departure of Justice Stevens, a leader in the intentionalist camp, could have significant consequences for the future of Chevron doctrine. The legal framework laid out by Justice Stevens in his Chevron opinion is widely cited but its proper application remains unsettled. As the Court prepares for his departure, the Chevron test will continue to play a role in balancing interpretive roles of courts and administrative agencies."
