    "content": "We introduce JAUNE, a new metric for evaluating reference summaries against hypothesis summaries, addressing the limitations of BLEU and ROUGE. This metric is based on recent Transformers-based Language Models. Evaluation metrics like BLEU and ROUGE are commonly used in machine translation and summarization to measure similarity between candidate and reference texts. However, these metrics have limitations and have been criticized by the academic community. In response, a new metric called JAUNE has been introduced to address these shortcomings by incorporating recent advances in NLP. Advances in NLP have led to the development of data-driven metrics to improve upon BLEU and ROUGE for evaluating NLP tasks. Criticisms of BLEU and ROUGE include low correlation with human judgment, especially in machine translation contexts. New metric JAUNE aims to address these limitations by incorporating recent NLP advancements. BLEU does not correlate with human judgment on adequacy or fluency. Sulem et al. found a low correlation with human judgment in the context of text simplification. Using neural networks for natural language evaluation is a promising approach. Language modeling with RNNs and Transformers is crucial for various NLP tasks. BERTscore and Sentence Mover's Similarity are new evaluation metrics that outperform BLEU and ROUGE in measuring similarity between sentences. They use word embeddings and different similarity measures to achieve stronger correlations with human judgment. The curr_chunk discusses various methods for evaluating sentence embeddings, including BLEND, RUSE, and the GLUE Benchmark. These methods aim to go beyond just architecture specifications and provide a framework for determining the success of evaluators in language evaluation. The GLUE Benchmark is a tool for evaluating models across a diverse range of NLU tasks. The GLUE Benchmark has led to the development of architectures performing well on various tasks in NLP. Models like Transformers are pre-trained on a large corpus and fine-tuned for specific tasks in the benchmark. Limitations of BLEU and ROUGE are discussed, with ways to manipulate n-gram based metrics. In analyzing failure cases of BLEU and ROUGE metrics, 100 examples from the STS-B dataset were examined to identify instances where the metrics failed to assess similarity accurately. Recurring real-life examples of failure were observed, including issues with idioms and additional details in sentences. Higher order n-grams were found to mitigate some shortcomings but introduced new problems. BLEU and ROUGE metrics often fail to accurately assess similarity in sentences, especially in cases involving idioms or additional details. Human judges are better at recognizing the core meaning of sentences, unlike BLEU and ROUGE. For example, changing a few important words in a sentence can drastically affect the similarity score given by BLEU-1. BLEU and ROUGE metrics struggle to accurately measure sentence similarity, particularly in cases involving paraphrasing, sentence reordering, and verb tense changes. These metrics tend to under score sentence pairs rather than over score them, making them more useful for identifying bad models rather than good ones. BLEU/ROUGE metrics are useful for identifying bad models but not good ones. Examples of failure cases are provided in the appendix. The BLEU* and ROUGE* scores are scaled with 5 for better understanding. RoBERTa-STS model scores are compared to gold labels in figure 1. The text discusses the need for a framework to assess and improve metrics comparing reference summaries/translations. Criteria for a good evaluator are outlined, including correlation with human judgement, ability to distinguish logical relationships, and sensitivity to semantic similarity. The implementation of a scorecard is also explained. The text explains how to implement a scorecard for evaluating metrics like BLEU and ROUGE, along with a neural evaluator RoBERTa-STS. It compares these metrics on benchmarks like STS-B and MNLI dataset for assessing semantic similarity and logical relationships. The text discusses evaluating metrics like BLEU and ROUGE, along with the RoBERTa-STS model, using Spearman's ranked correlation and Kendall's \u03c4. It also introduces random corruptions to sentence pairs from the MNLI dataset to assess metric performance. In the previous section, evaluation metrics like BLEU and ROUGE were compared with RoBERTa-STS using Spearman's ranked correlation and Kendall's \u03c4. Results showed RoBERTa-STS outperformed the other metrics. In the following section, correlation of BLEU, ROUGE, and RoBERTa-STS with human judgement in machine translation was analyzed using WMT2015 and WMT2016 datasets. The study included 5360 sentence pairs, with scores computed for BLEU, ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, and RoBERTa-STS predicted semantic similarity. Transformers-based models were found to outperform BLEU and ROUGE. The study compared RoBERTa-STS with BLEU and ROUGE metrics, showing the former outperformed the latter. Results highlighted the potential to replace traditional metrics with data-driven models like RoBERTa-STS. The appendix discusses failure cases of the metrics in detail to provide a better understanding of their limitations in language evaluation. The study compared RoBERTa-STS with BLEU and ROUGE metrics, demonstrating RoBERTa-STS outperformed traditional metrics. The appendix delves into various failure cases of BLEU and ROUGE, showcasing instances where the metrics struggle due to factors like reordering of sub-sentences, spelling errors, and introduction of new words. The RoBERTa-STS model aligns closely with the label in these cases, indicating its potential as a more reliable evaluation tool. The RoBERTa-STS model performs similarly to the label in various examples, highlighting the limitations of BLEU and ROUGE metrics in capturing subtle changes in language. These traditional metrics may overlook simple modifications like synonyms or additional descriptive phrases, whereas language models like RoBERTa-STS can better understand the context and meaning of words in a sentence. The RoBERTa-STS model shows differences from BLEU/ROUGE metrics in capturing language nuances. It struggles with understanding context and meaning due to a lack of general knowledge. Adding specific phrases can help improve recognition of related topics. The RoBERTa-STS model struggles with understanding context and meaning, lacking general knowledge. Adding specific phrases can improve recognition of related topics. The neural network sometimes lacks context not explicitly given in the sentence, affecting its performance. Further development is needed in recognizing nuances and idioms. The RoBERTa-STS model struggles with understanding context and meaning, lacking general knowledge. Further development is needed in recognizing nuances and idioms, especially in detecting whether the core argument/message in a sentence is the same. The language inference task is included in the scorecard to address this issue. Additionally, RoBERTa-STS outperforms BLEU/ROUGE in error cases, as shown in Table 8. The RoBERTa-STS model outperforms BLEU* in error cases, showing remarkable improvement. Neural evaluators have room for enhancement but are surpassing classical methods, indicating progress in NLP research."
