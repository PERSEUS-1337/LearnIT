    "content": "The 114th Congress may show interest in U.S. ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), an international treaty addressing children's rights globally. The CRC calls for special rights for children, including healthcare, education, and protection from exploitation. The United States has signed but not ratified the Convention, unlike 195 other countries. The Reagan and Bush Administrations had concerns about the effectiveness of the CRC in addressing children's rights. The Clinton Administration supported the CRC but faced opposition from Congress. The George W. Bush Administration did not support ratification of the CRC. The George W. Bush Administration did not support ratification of the CRC due to political and legal concerns, questioning its impact on U.S. laws and emphasizing parental duties. President Obama's election led to a review of the treaty, with ongoing discussions on U.S. ratification. The report provides a history of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), U.S. policy towards the CRC, and potential policy issues for Congress to consider if ratifying the treaty. It discusses the treaty's impact on U.S. sovereignty, laws, and parental rights, as well as its effectiveness in protecting children's rights and its role in U.S. foreign policy. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognized children's rights in 1948, stating that all children are entitled to special care and protection. The Declaration on the Rights of the Child in 1959 further emphasized the importance of ensuring children's rights, including legal protections, healthcare, and protection from abuse. The international community also acknowledged children's rights in various covenants. The Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) was adopted by the U.N. General Assembly on November 20, 1989, and entered into force on September 2, 1990. It defines a child as \"every human being below the age of eighteen years\" and emphasizes the best interest of the child in all actions concerning children. The Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) emphasizes that the best interest of the child should be the primary consideration in all actions concerning children. Countries that are party to CRC agree to ensure that all children have rights such as life, development, healthcare, education, protection from abuse, and freedom of expression. CRC also calls for protection from exploitation, torture, and capital punishment for offenses committed before the age of 18, as well as special protections for orphans, refugees, and the disabled. The Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) emphasizes the rights and duties of parents to provide appropriate direction and guidance to children. The Committee on the Rights of the Child (the Committee) was established to examine progress made by States Parties in meeting their obligations under the Convention. Committee members are elected by States Parties for four-year terms, meeting in Geneva for three sessions per year. The Committee on the Rights of the Child meets in Geneva, Switzerland for three sessions per year, including a plenary and a working group. Special sessions can be held upon request. Committee members elect a chairperson, vice-chairpersons, and a rapporteur for two-year terms. The chairperson leads discussions and ensures rules are followed. The Committee reports to the U.N. General Assembly every two years on monitoring States Parties' implementation of the CRC. Initial reports are required within two years of ratification. States Parties are required to submit an initial report to the Committee within two years of ratifying or acceding to the CRC, followed by regular reports every five years. These reports should address any \"factors and difficulties\" affecting the fulfillment of obligations under the Convention. Committee meetings involve open dialogues with States Parties to discuss progress, challenges, priorities, and future goals. Concluding observations with suggestions and observations are adopted, along with general comments on various issues such as juvenile justice, protection from corporal punishment, and HIV/AIDS prevention. The Optional Protocols under the Convention on the Rights of the Child provide specific protections for children, including limits on recruitment for armed conflict and requirements for rehabilitation. The Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children criminalizes child pornography and prostitution. The Convention on the Rights of the Child aims to criminalize child pornography and prostitution, close related establishments, and seize proceeds. It has been ratified by 169 countries, but the United States has only signed it. The Optional Protocols on Children in Armed Conflict and the Sale of Children were ratified by the US in 2002. The Obama Administration supports the Convention but has not submitted it to the Senate for ratification. The Obama Administration, under then-U.S. permanent representative to the United Nations, committed to reviewing the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) in January 2009. The Administration acknowledged the complexity of the treaty, particularly in relation to U.S. federalism, and emphasized the need for a close examination of domestic implementation challenges and potential reservations or understandings during ratification. As of November 2009, an interagency policy review of CRC and other human rights treaties not yet ratified by the U.S. was underway. The Obama Administration committed to reviewing the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) in January 2009. The Administration supports the objectives of the Convention and is undertaking a thorough review of it. The Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush Administrations played a leading role in drafting the CRC but did not support U.S. ratification due to concerns about its impact on laws and sovereignty. The current status of the Administration's review of the treaty remains unclear. The Clinton Administration signed the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) in 1995 but did not submit it to the Senate for ratification due to opposition, including from Senator Jesse Helms. The George W. Bush Administration also opposed the treaty. The George W. Bush Administration opposed the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) due to concerns about U.S. sovereignty and parental rights. Congressional perspectives on U.S. ratification varied, with supporters believing it would reaffirm commitment to children's rights and opponents questioning its necessity. Opponents of U.S. ratification of the CRC argue that it would undermine U.S. sovereignty, particularly in policy areas traditionally addressed by states. Concerns have been raised about the impact on parental rights and responsibilities, with some Members of Congress proposing amendments to protect these rights. The CRC, a treaty addressing children's rights, has sparked debate in the U.S. over concerns about sovereignty and parental rights. The Obama Administration may seek Senate approval during the 114th Congress. Key policy issues have emerged, with differences between federal and state laws needing resolution. Key differences within the executive branch need resolution before the CRC is sent to the Senate for ratification. Areas of potential conflict between state and federal laws include juvenile justice, child labor, education, welfare, custody, visitation, and adoption. Concerns exist about applying federal laws to traditionally state-handled issues, potentially undermining federalism. Advocates suggest addressing conflicts through reservations, understandings, and declarations accompanying treaty ratifications. The use of reservations, understandings, and declarations (RUDs) may be necessary for treaty ratifications to address potential conflicts with U.S. laws. Some argue that including RUDs shows unwillingness to fully implement the Convention, while others believe U.S. law should align with international standards. Support for ratification emphasizes fulfilling treaty obligations at the federal level and ensuring compliance at state and local levels. Supporters of ratification argue that countries with federalism systems like the US, such as Canada and Australia, have ratified the Convention. Opponents fear that ratifying the CRC could undermine US sovereignty as it could supersede national and local laws. They are concerned that the CRC Committee could have authority over US government and citizens' actions towards children, leading to disputes over parental rights, abortion, and the role of national governments in raising children. Supporters of U.S. ratification argue that federal and state laws already align with the Convention, minimizing threats to sovereignty. They suggest using RUDs to address any concerns and highlight the limited authority of the CRC Committee. Critics raise concerns about parental rights and enforcement mechanisms, suggesting that CRC's impact may be weaker compared to other human rights treaties ratified by the U.S. Some critics are concerned that the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) could impact parental rights, giving outside parties authority over family structure and parenting choices. They argue that parental responsibility under the CRC may only exist to further children's independent choices, potentially leading to children disregarding parental authority and undermining parental rights. Critics fear that U.S. ratification of the CRC could empower children to file complaints or lawsuits against their parents, giving them inappropriate influence over their own lives. Some opponents of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) are worried about how the CRC Committee may interpret provisions related to the \"best interest of the child,\" which could undermine parental rights. They also have concerns about other CRC provisions that could be seen as infringing on parental rights, such as privacy and freedom of expression for children. Article 13(1) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child grants children the right to freedom of expression, including seeking, receiving, and imparting information. Some argue this could allow children to express themselves without parental authority. Article 14(1) protects children's freedom of thought, conscience, and religion, potentially allowing them to object to their parents' beliefs. Article 17 ensures children have access to diverse information sources, which some interpret as giving children the right to access information regardless of parental preferences. Critics raise concerns about potential government interference in parents' choices regarding education, including homeschooling and private schooling, as outlined in Articles 28(1) and 29(1) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. There are also worries about restrictions on corporal punishment, with Article 19(1) possibly prohibiting parents from using physical discipline. Additionally, some fear limitations on children's freedom of association. Some concerns are raised about children's freedom of association under Article 15(1) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, with worries that it could allow children to associate with individuals disapproved by their parents. Supporters argue that the Convention aims to protect children from government intrusion and abuse, not to undermine parental authority. They emphasize that provisions like Article 16 on privacy and Article 13 on freedom of expression are meant to safeguard children from state interference, not parental control. Some supporters argue that the Convention on the Rights of the Child is meant to protect children from government interference in areas such as religion, education, access to information, and freedom of association. They believe that these provisions are not intended to challenge parental authority but to safeguard children from state intrusion and abuse. Examples such as the experiences of Jewish children during the Holocaust and Christian children in China are cited to emphasize the importance of protecting children from government actions regarding religion. Supporters of the CRC argue that it aims to protect children's rights in countries with poor educational systems, ensuring equal access to education for both girls and boys. They emphasize the Convention's support for parents and family structure, balancing provisions on education and corporal punishment with the importance of parental roles in raising children. The CRC emphasizes the important role of parents in raising children, citing various articles and the preamble that highlight the family's significance in a child's well-being and development. There is no provision in the Convention for prosecutions or lawsuits related to parental responsibilities. Some argue that the CRC does not allow for prosecutions or investigations of parents, suggesting that any such actions would be based on existing U.S. laws rather than CRC provisions. To address concerns about parental rights, it has been proposed to include reservations or understandings if the U.S. were to ratify the CRC. The debate over U.S. ratification of the CRC revolves around concerns about its impact on domestic abortion policy, particularly regarding parental notification laws. Critics fear that Article 16(1) could allow children to have abortions without parental involvement, raising questions about the right to privacy. The CRC debate revolves around concerns that it could allow children to have abortions without parental involvement. Supporters argue that the treaty does not take a position on abortion and allows countries to interpret it according to their national policies. Countries with strict anti-abortion laws have ratified the Convention. The CRC Convention has been ratified by countries like the Philippines and Ireland. Proponents argue that the Convention does not promote abortion, citing statements from the CRC Committee criticizing high abortion rates. The drafting history shows that the Convention is \"abortion neutral,\" as the issue was debated but not addressed in the main articles to allow for different interpretations by ratifying countries. Some countries interpret CRC provisions based on their own laws and policies on abortion. The Convention intentionally leaves ambiguity on the age limit of a child, allowing States Parties to decide when life begins. Some countries like China, France, Luxembourg, and Tunisia have reservations on Article 6 of CRC regarding abortion. The preamble of CRC has also raised questions about its stance on abortion. CRC has raised questions about its stance on abortion, with some experts debating whether the preamble implies protection for the rights of the \"unborn.\" However, the legislative history indicates that the drafters did not intend for this to be the case. Some countries interpret CRC provisions based on their own laws and policies on abortion, with ambiguity on the age limit of a child. Countries like China, France, Luxembourg, and Tunisia have reservations on Article 6 of CRC regarding abortion. The preamble of the CRC raised concerns about protecting the rights of the \"unborn\" during negotiations, with the U.S. delegation emphasizing the need for neutrality on abortion to ensure acceptance by all countries. Some CRC opponents fear that Article 24 of the Convention could lead to family planning choices conflicting with parental values. They are concerned about provisions for preventive health care, family planning education, and services that could involve contraceptive distribution or explicit sex education in schools. Supporters of U.S. ratification argue that States Parties can interpret and decide on family planning education independently. Supporters of the Convention on the Rights of the Child emphasize that individual countries can interpret and implement family planning education and services according to their national policies. They argue that concerns about the Convention's stance on family planning should be balanced with its recognition of parental roles in raising children. The effectiveness of the Convention is a significant point of debate among supporters and critics, especially in countries that have already ratified it. Some critics question the effectiveness of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, pointing out that countries known for abusing children's rights are party to the treaty. They argue that ratification may be a facade for such governments and that reservations attached to the Convention, particularly by Islamic countries, could undermine its intent and effectiveness. Some countries have reservations to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, particularly regarding Islamic Shari'a law. Concerns exist about broad interpretations, especially regarding child marriage and girls' education. The Holy See and other countries have reservations to apply the Convention only when compatible with domestic laws. Some countries, like Sweden and Norway, object to these reservations, stating they may cast doubts on the commitment to the Convention. Supporters argue that the CRC has improved children's rights in many ratifying countries. The Convention on the Rights of the Child has enhanced children's rights in many countries that have ratified it. Human Rights Watch and UNICEF have reported that several countries have used the CRC to improve existing legislation and children's rights. Over half of the 62 States Parties reviewed by UNICEF incorporated Convention provisions into their domestic laws, with nearly one-third including them in their national constitutions. Additionally, CRC has helped establish over 60 independent human rights institutions for children in 38 countries. Despite progress, there is still a long way to go in implementing the Convention. The high-level political commitment to the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) is crucial for developing new laws to protect children's rights. However, social change will only occur when this commitment is accompanied by effective law enforcement, adequate resource allocation, and engagement from all levels of society. Supporters of the CRC argue that ratification would enhance U.S. credibility abroad and provide additional opportunities to advocate for children's rights. Non-ratification by the U.S. is seen as hindering diplomatic efforts to promote child rights in countries with poor human rights records, leading to perceptions of hypocrisy. Some argue that U.S. ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) would allow the country to influence international laws and standards in children's rights. Opponents believe that the U.S. is already a leader in advancing children's rights and that non-ratification does not impact its advocacy efforts. Some critics argue against ratifying the Optional Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) in the United States, stating that U.S. laws already exceed international standards and that ratification may lead to unfounded political criticisms in international forums."
