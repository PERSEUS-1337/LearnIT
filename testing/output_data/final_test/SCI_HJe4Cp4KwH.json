    "content": "This paper introduces a new Graph Neural Network (GNN) called GNN-FiLM, which utilizes feature-wise linear modulation to allow for modulation of passed information based on the representation of the target node in addition to the source node. Results of experiments comparing different GNN architectures on three tasks show that GNN-FiLM outperforms baseline methods on a regression task with molecular graphs and performs well on other tasks. Hyperparameters were optimized through extensive search, revealing smaller differences between models than previously reported in the literature. Learning from graph-structured data has grown significantly in recent years, with graphs being used to model various types of data. Graph construction involves complex feature engineering, where domain knowledge is transformed into a graph structure for neural network models to utilize. Neural graph learning methods often involve neural message passing, where nodes exchange information with their neighbors in the graph. Neural graph learning methods involve nodes exchanging information with neighbors in the graph. Messages are aggregated at each node to update its representation. Graph Attention Networks consider the agreement between source and target representations to determine message weight. Linear layers used for message computation limit interactions between source and target nodes. Recent trends in neural network design involve the use of hypernetworks to compute the weights of other networks, enabling interaction between different signal sources. While this approach is intellectually appealing, predicting weights for complex neural networks can be computationally expensive. Mitigation methods exist, such as restricting the structure of the computed network, but they are often domain-specific. Hypernetworks are used to compute weights for other networks, allowing interaction between different signal sources. A mitigation method involves restricting the structure of the computed network. \"Feature-wise linear modulations\" (FiLM) have been effective in visual question answering and can be adapted to the graph message passing domain. This article explores the use of hypernetworks in learning on graphs, showing promising results. The article introduces two new formalisms for handling graphs with different types of edges: Relational Graph Dynamic Convolutional Networks (RGDCN) and Graph Neural Networks with Feature-wise Linear Modulation (GNN-FiLM). Extensive experiments comparing baselines on various tasks show promising results. The new FiLM model performs well on various tasks involving graph neural networks, which propagate information along edges in a graph. The model updates node representations using information from neighboring nodes, showing promising results in experiments. In GNNs, representations can be updated through time by applying the same update function or stacking multiple GNN layers. GGNN uses edge-type-dependent weights and recurrent units, while R-GCN replaces the gated unit with a non-linearity. In Graph Attention Networks (GAT), new node representations are computed from neighboring node representations using edge-type-dependent weights. The model can be generalized to support different edge types with learnable parameters for edge-type-dependent weights. Graph Attention Networks (GAT) compute new node representations using edge-type-dependent weights. GATs employ multiple attention heads with separate learnable parameters. Recent research by Xu et al. (2019) introduced Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) as powerful as the Weisfeiler-Lehman test. The R-GIN definition integrates different edge types using functions f, allowing for the unification of node representations and neighboring node representations. This approach can be approximated by a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for the final R-GIN definition. The R-GIN definition integrates various edge types using functions f, unifying node and neighboring node representations. The learnable parameters are edge-specific weights \u03b8, similar to R-GCNs but with linear layers replaced by an MLP. Information transfer between nodes is based on learned weights and edge source representation, while the edge target representation is updated, treated as an incoming message, or used to weigh edge relevance in different GNN variants. In the experiments, GNN-MLP replaces linear layers with MLPs to compute messages for each edge. Hypernetworks have been successfully applied in various tasks, raising the question of their applicability in the graph domain. A hypernetwork can be seen as a function computing another function, suggesting the use of the target of a message propagation step to compute the function. A natural idea in relational graph dynamic convolutional networks is to use the target of a message propagation step to compute the function for updating the node representation. However, the challenge lies in the large number of parameters required for this approach, which can be mitigated by splitting node representations and tying the value of some instances of the function. The update function for a chunk in a graph neural network can be computed using the corresponding chunk of the node representation. Learnable parameters are only the hypernetwork parameters. Graph Neural Networks with Feature-wise Linear Modulation focus on separate chunks of the node representation at a time. In the visual question answering setting, Perez et al. (2017) propose using element-wise affine transformations to modulate feature maps based on a natural language question. In the graph setting, each node's representation can determine an element-wise affine transformation of incoming messages, allowing for dynamic feature weighting. The update rule involves a learnable function g to compute the parameters of the affine transformation, with the model's learnable parameters being the hypernetwork parameters \u03b8 g and the weights W. Implementing g as a single linear layer is effective, resulting in a bilinear message passing function. In the graph setting, each node's representation can determine an element-wise affine transformation of incoming messages, allowing for dynamic feature weighting. The message passing function is bilinear in source and target node representation, with the core difference being the interaction of source and target node representations. GNN-FiLM can solve tasks efficiently by learning to ignore graph edges based on node representations. GNN-FiLM can learn to ignore graph edges based on node representations, allowing for a fine-grained gating mechanism. An implementation bug highlighted the challenge of applying non-linearity after message aggregation in tasks like counting neighbors with specific features. In experiments, applying non-linearity before aggregation improved performance but can lead to instability during training. Adding an additional layer after message passing can help control this instability. GNN modelling formalism is versatile, with different tasks having varying requirements and results not always transferring between tasks. The curr_chunk discusses different tasks in graph-based learning, including document classification, protein-protein interaction, and molecule property prediction. State of the art performance on these tasks involves multiple propagation steps along graph edges. The curr_chunk discusses tasks in graph-based learning involving molecules and program fragments. It highlights the complexity of edges, graph sizes, dataset sizes, and the importance of node-level vs. graph-level representations in achieving state-of-the-art performance. The article discusses the importance of node-level vs. graph-level representations in graph-based learning tasks involving molecules and program fragments. Results on PPI, QM9, and VarMisuse tasks are included, with preliminary experiments showing fluctuations in results on citation network data. The implementation of GNN-FiLM is compared with baseline methods like GGNN, R-GCN, R-GAT, and R-GIN. The article discusses the implementation of GNNs like GNN-FiLM, GGNN, R-GCN, R-GAT, and R-GIN in graph-based learning tasks. The code for these implementations is available online for reproducibility. However, the RGDCN approach was found to be infeasible due to its sensitivity. The RGDCN approach was deemed infeasible due to its sensitivity to parameter initialization, leading to erratic changes in target metrics. Despite this, it was included in the article to showcase the development of GNN-FiLM. GNN-FiLM, formulated in Eq. (8), outperformed other variants in experiments. Moving the non-linearity before message aggregation only benefited GNN-FiLM. Using each layer for a single propagation step yielded better results than fewer layers with multiple steps. Models were trained until target metrics plateaued, with additional epochs for refinement. The models were trained until the target metric plateaued, with additional epochs for refinement. Results on the held-out test data were averaged across multiple training runs with different parameter initializations. Hyperparameters were selected based on earlier papers and a small grid search. The models were evaluated on the node-level classification PPI task using a set of 20 graphs for training and two separate graphs for validation and testing. After training models with different layers and node representation sizes, all models were evaluated on a classification task using test graphs. Results show improved performance compared to previous models, attributed to generalization to different edge types and the use of dropout between layers. The new GNN-FiLM model improves over previous baselines by converging faster in fewer training steps, outperforming models with larger node representation sizes. Additionally, all models were evaluated on graph-level regression tasks on the QM9 molecule dataset, showing improved performance on thirteen different quantum chemical properties. The evaluation process involved using a test set for hyperparameter search with five edge types in the graphs. No additional molecular information was encoded as edge features, and hyperparameters were found through a staged search process. 500 configurations were sampled and run on three tasks, with the top three configurations then tested on all thirteen tasks to choose the final configuration with the lowest average mean absolute error. The evaluation process involved testing models on various properties using different configurations. The new GNN-FiLM model outperformed standard baselines and GNN-MLP variants on most tasks. Models were also evaluated on the VarMisuse task. The experiments involved processing graphs representing program fragments to select candidate nodes based on the location to use a variable. The dataset included training, validation, and test sets from open source projects. A limited hyperparameter grid search was conducted with 30 candidate configurations for each model. The best configuration for each model was selected based on validation results. The experiments involved processing graphs representing program fragments to select candidate nodes based on the location to use a variable. A limited hyperparameter grid search was conducted with 30 candidate configurations for each model. The best configuration for each model was selected based on validation results, leading to different numbers of layers and hidden sizes for each model. The results showed a different ranking of model architectures compared to previous studies, with R-GCN performing the best. All re-implemented baselines outperformed previous results, despite using a simpler implementation of the task. The re-implementation of the task incorporates insights from Cvitkovic et al. (2019) using character CNNs for node labels and introducing extra nodes for subtokens. However, complex models show significant overfitting, with no improvement from more aggressive regularization methods. The large variance in validation results suggests that the hyperparameter grid search may not have found the best configuration. After reviewing existing graph neural network architectures, two models were introduced: Graph Dynamic Convolutional Networks and GNNs with feature-wise linear modulation. While GDCNs are challenging to train, experiments show that GNN-FiLM is competitive with or outperforms baseline models on various tasks. The results suggest that more extensive hyperparameter search is needed, as some findings in the literature may benefit from additional comparisons to obvious baselines. The results in Tab. 3 show that R-GCNs outperform GGNNs on the VarMisuse task, contradicting previous findings. GNN-MLP models, not typically considered baseline models, have shown superior performance across all tasks without significant runtime penalties. Independent reproducibility efforts and comparisons with \"obvious\" baselines are valuable, as seen in earlier work on GNNs. The study explored various parameters such as hidden size, number of layers, dropout probabilities, layer normalization, dense layers, and residual connections in different models. 500 configurations were considered, sampling hyperparameter settings uniformly from different options. The study considered various parameters for different models, including hidden size, number of layers, dropout probabilities, layer normalization, dense layers, and residual connections. A full grid search was performed for all models, exploring combinations of parameters such as activation functions, optimizers, learning rates, cell types, number of attention heads, and other model-specific settings. The study explored different parameters for models like hidden size, layers, dropout, normalization, dense layers, and residuals. A grid search was done for activation functions, optimizers, learning rates, cell types, and attention heads. Cell types included GRU and LSTM for GGNN, and attention heads were 4 or 8 for R-GAT."
