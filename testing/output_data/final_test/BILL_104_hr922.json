    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Colon Cancer Screening and Prevention Act\". Medicare coverage of colorectal screening is included in the Act. The \"Colon Cancer Screening and Prevention Act\" amends the Social Security Act to include frequency and payment limits for screening fecal-occult blood tests, flexible sigmoidoscopies, and colonoscopies for early detection of colon cancer. Payment limits for screening fecal-occult blood tests are set at $5 in 1996 and are subject to annual limits thereafter. The payment amount for screening fecal-occult blood tests cannot exceed the established limit for the preceding year. No payment can be made for a screening fecal-occult blood test for individuals under 50 years of age or within 11 months after a previous test. The Secretary establishes payment amounts for screening flexible sigmoidoscopies for early detection of colon cancer, without regard to certain subsections. Payment is limited and subject to revision, with restrictions on frequency. Payment amounts for screening colonoscopy for individuals at high risk for colorectal cancer are established by the Secretary for early detection of colon cancer, consistent with payment amounts for similar services. Payment amounts for screening colonoscopy for individuals at high risk for colorectal cancer are established without regard to certain subsections, with a frequency limit set by the Secretary to prevent payment for repeat procedures within 23 months. An individual at high risk is defined by family history or prior cancer experience. Individuals with a history of cancer, neoplastic polyps, chronic digestive diseases, gene markers for colorectal cancer, or other predisposing factors are at high risk for colorectal cancer. The Secretary may review and reduce payment limits for screening fecal-occult blood tests. The Secretary may periodically review and adjust the frequency of screening fecal-occult blood tests, flexible sigmoidoscopies, and colonoscopies based on age and other relevant factors to ensure the availability of quality tests. The Secretary may revise the frequency of tests and procedures paid for under this subsection, with no revision applying to tests before January 1, 1999. Limiting charges of nonparticipating physicians for screening flexible sigmoidoscopies and colonoscopies for early detection of colon cancer. Nonparticipating physicians providing colon cancer detection procedures under this part must not charge more than the limiting charge. Sanctions may be imposed by the Secretary for willful violations. Conforming amendments are made to section 1833(a) of the Act. The text chunk discusses amendments to various sections of the Act related to Medicare coverage for colon cancer detection procedures. Amendments include changes to subsections, clauses, and paragraphs to specify conditions for coverage and services provided. The text chunk outlines amendments to Medicare coverage for colon cancer detection procedures, specifying conditions for coverage of screening tests and procedures performed more frequently than usual. The amendments made by section 2 will apply to screening fecal-occult blood tests, flexible sigmoidoscopies, and colonoscopies performed on or after January 1, 1996."
