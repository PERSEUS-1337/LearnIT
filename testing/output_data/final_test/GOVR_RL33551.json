    "content": "On February 14, 2007, Congress passed H.J.Res. 20, the Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution for FY2007, signed into law on February 15, 2007 (P.L. 110-5). P.L. 110-5 provided funding for most federal agencies for the remainder of FY2007 at FY2006 levels. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended a net funding level of $141.2 billion for various departments and agencies. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended a net funding level of $141.2 billion for various departments and agencies, including performance requirements for Amtrak, a 2.7% pay raise for federal civilian workers, easing of restrictions on agricultural exports to Cuba, and a prohibition on foreign control of U.S. airlines. The House of Representatives passed H.R. 5576 with an overall funding level of $139.6 billion, a $2 billion increase over the FY2006 Act. The House approved amendments to the bill, including increased funding for Amtrak and selected programs in the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and easing restrictions on U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba. The President's FY2007 request for the appropriations bill was $138.5 billion, $2.3 billion over FY2006. The request included cuts from the FY2006 funding level for grants to airports. The FY2007 budget request included cuts for grants to airports, Amtrak, and housing programs for the elderly and disabled. The Executive Office of the President saw a $225 million reduction primarily due to transferring the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas Program to the Department of Justice. Funding for Amtrak was reduced to $900 million from $1.3 billion in FY2006, and the FAA's Airport Improvement Program was reduced to $2.8 billion. The proposed level of appropriations in the FY2007 bill was below the AIP formula threshold, potentially halving most AIP formula distributions. This would result in reductions in funding for community and economic development programs under HUD, housing for elderly and disabled persons, and the annual payment to the United States Postal Service. The House did not support most of these proposed changes in the House-passed version of H.R. 5576. The Treasury, Housing and Urban Development, The Judiciary, District of Columbia, and Independent Agencies Appropriations bill provided $139.6 billion, slightly over the Administration's request. The House approved amendments for increased funding for Amtrak and programs within HUD. The White House objected to certain provisions, including easing sanctions on Cuba. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $141.2 billion, $3.3 billion over the Administration request. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended a total of $3.3 billion over the Administration request for various programs, including aviation, Amtrak, housing, the Internal Revenue Service, and drug control programs. One provision eased restrictions on agricultural trade with Cuba, similar to a previous veto threat. H.R. 5576 did not reach the Senate floor, and a continuing resolution was passed to fund federal agencies for the remainder of FY2007. The FY2007 appropriations legislation provided funding levels similar to FY2006 for most agencies, with increases for DOT and HUD. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations reorganized their subcommittee structures in early 2005. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reorganized its subcommittees, reducing them to 12 and adding jurisdiction over appropriations for the Departments of Housing and Urban Development and the Judiciary to the Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies subcommittee. The House and Senate subcommittees' coverage of the appropriations bill is almost identical, with the main difference being that the Senate handles appropriations for the District of Columbia in a separate bill. Tables provide details on the status and funding of the FY2007 Transportation et al. appropriations bill. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reorganized its subcommittees, reducing them to 12 and adding jurisdiction over appropriations for the Departments of Housing and Urban Development and the Judiciary to the Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies subcommittee. The House and Senate subcommittees' coverage of the appropriations bill is almost identical, with the main difference being that the Senate handles appropriations for the District of Columbia in a separate bill. Tables provide details on the status and funding of the FY2007 Transportation et al. appropriations bill. The President's budget proposed $64.4 billion for the Department of Transportation (DOT), which was $2.1 billion more than the previous year. Funding trends over the five-year period FY2002-FY2006 are also shown, with agencies generally experiencing funding increases during this time. The Administration's budget for DOT under the Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act identified three agency-specific goals influencing the budget request: improving aviation and surface transportation safety, improving transportation mobility, and restraining spending. This included increased funding for safety programs, investments in infrastructure and technology, and restructuring federal intercity passenger rail policy. The budget also included a decrease in funding for Amtrak and the Federal Aviation Administration's Airport Improvement Program. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $64.7 billion for DOT, with additional funding for the Federal Aviation Administration and the Federal Transit Administration's Capital Grants Program. The House also voted to add more funding for Amtrak and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Operations and Research Program. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $65.0 billion for DOT, with increased funding for airport grants-in-aid, Essential Air Services program, and Amtrak. P.L. 110-5 provided $63.1 billion in net budgetary resources for DOT, representing a 6% increase over FY2006 appropriations. In FY2006, appropriations increased for the federal-aid highway program, federal transit program, and Amtrak, a quasi-governmental corporation operating rail infrastructure. Amtrak operates at a deficit and requires federal support. Reauthorization efforts for Amtrak have been stalled due to disagreements between Congress and the Administration over intercity passenger rail policy. The Administration has requested less funding for Amtrak than needed, leading to bipartisan criticism in Congress. Despite this, Congress has provided more funding for Amtrak than requested, with conditions attached. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $900 million for grants to Amtrak for FY2007. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $900 million for grants to Amtrak for FY2007. The committee also recommended requirements for Amtrak to submit a comprehensive business plan, cut system overhead expenses by 10% annually, and achieve savings in its services. The House approved an amendment to increase Amtrak's FY2007 appropriation by $214 million, totaling $1.114 billion. This was less than the funding received in FY2006 and below the amount recommended by the DOT IG for FY2007. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $1.4 billion for Amtrak in FY2007, divided into capital grants, debt service, and efficiency incentive grants. Funding would not go directly to Amtrak, and they would need to apply to the Secretary of DOT for grants. The committee imposed requirements on Amtrak to reduce cost deficits and forbade outsourcing work to foreign entities. The FY2007 Continuing Resolution (P.L. 110-5) provided $1.3 billion for Amtrak, with provisions to forbid outsourcing work to foreign countries and create a pilot program for state-operated passenger rail service. The Federal Aviation Administration's budget included funding for air traffic control and airport grants, with a requested net funding of $12.8 billion for FY2007. The President's request for FY2007 included $18 million to hire 1,136 air traffic controllers, resulting in a net gain of around 132 controllers. The House Committee recommended $15.2 billion for FY2007, $1.4 billion over the previous year and $2.4 billion over the Administration request. The House also adopted an amendment restricting foreign control over U.S. airlines' business decisions in response to national security concerns. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $14.2 billion for FY2007, more than the Administration requested but less than the House provided. The FY2007 Continuing Resolution provided $14.5 billion for the Federal Aviation Administration, $1.7 billion more than requested and $770 million more than enacted for FY2006. The proposed rule to increase foreign ownership of U.S. airlines was withdrawn. The President's budget proposed a cut to the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) from $3.5 billion in FY2006 to $2.8 billion for FY2007. However, as a result of P.L. 110-5, the AIP received $3.5 billion, the same amount as in FY2006. AIP funds are used for airport planning, development, and capacity expansion projects. Some Members of Congress have expressed concern over proposed cuts in the AIP program despite forecasts of increased aviation traffic. Additionally, the President's budget proposed a 54% reduction in funding for the Essential Air Service program, from $109 million in FY2006 to $50 million. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $117 million for the program. The Essential Air Service program received $109 million in FY2006 and was recommended $117 million by the House Committee on Appropriations. The program aims to preserve air service to small airports in rural communities. Supporters argue that maintaining airline service in rural areas was part of the agreement made when airline service was deregulated in 1978. Concerns were raised that cutting funding for the program could reduce transportation connections for rural communities. The President's budget requested $39.8 billion for federal highway programs for FY2007, an increase of $3.5 billion (10%) over the previous year. Additionally, $8.8 billion was requested for federal transit programs, reflecting the authorized level of funding provided by SAFETEA. The House approved the budget request. The House approved the requested $37.0 billion for highway programs and added $100 million to the transit program. The Senate recommended the same level for highways and transit, with the FY2007 Continuing Resolution providing $39.8 billion for highways and $9.0 billion for transit. Additionally, $3.5 billion was rescinded from unobligated balances for highways, resulting in a net level of $36.3 billion. The Administration requested a 6% increase for the Federal Motor Carrier Administration. The House and Senate approved funding for transportation agencies, with a 6% increase for the Federal Motor Carrier Administration and a 1% increase for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The House recommended additional funding for NHTSA, while the Senate recommended less. FMCSA received $517 million and NHTSA received $821 million for FY2007. The Administration requested $299 million for the Maritime Administration for FY2007. The House and Senate approved funding for transportation agencies, with increases for the Federal Motor Carrier Administration and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The Administration requested $299 million for the Maritime Administration for FY2007. The House provided $300 million for MARAD, while the Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $344 million, including additional funding for subsidies and small shipyards. The FY2007 Continuing Resolution provided $291 million for MARAD. The FY2007 Continuing Resolution (P.L. 110-5) provided $291 million for MARAD, rescinding $74 million from the National Defense Tanker Vessel Construction Program. This program aims to reduce the Department of Defense's reliance on foreign-flag oil tankers by supporting the construction of up to five privately-owned product-tanker vessels in the United States. It would provide up to $50 million per vessel for the construction in U.S. shipyards. The Treasury Department performs various governmental functions, including protecting the financial system, collecting tax revenue, enforcing tax laws, managing federal debt, regulating financial institutions, and producing currency. It consists of departmental offices and operating bureaus, with the bureaus mainly carrying out specific duties assigned by statutory mandates. The Treasury Department's bureaus account for over 95% of the agency's funding and workforce, divided into financial management/regulation and law enforcement tasks. Financial bureaus include the Comptroller of the Currency, U.S. Mint, and Bureau of Engraving and Printing, while law enforcement bureaus include ATF, Secret Service, and Customs Service. The Treasury Department's involvement in law enforcement has decreased since the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security in 2002. The IRS is an exception, as it is responsible for tax collection and enforcement. Most bureaus rely on annual appropriations for funding, with some exceptions such as the Treasury Franchise Fund and the U.S. Mint, which finance their operations through fees. In FY2007, the Treasury Department is receiving $11.624 billion in appropriated funds, with most going to finance the operations of the IRS. The remaining funds are distributed among various bureaus and departmental offices within the Treasury. The federal government finances its operations through various taxes and fees collected by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In FY2006, the IRS collected $2.537 trillion before refunds, with individual income taxes being the largest component. The IRS collected $2.537 trillion before refunds in FY2006, with individual income tax revenue totaling $1.236 trillion. The agency receives funding from appropriated funds, user fees, and reimbursables. Appropriated funds accounted for 98% of the IRS's operating budget in FY2006, with user fees and reimbursables each contributing 1%. Starting in FY2007, appropriated funds are allocated to taxpayer services, enforcement, and operations support accounts. In FY2007, the IRS is receiving $10.597 billion in appropriated funds, with allocations for taxpayer services, enforcement, operations support, business systems modernization, and health insurance tax credit administration. In FY2007, the IRS is funded under a continuing resolution, with restrictions on workforce reorganization and taxpayer service reductions. The IRS is also prohibited from entering the tax return software market until a report on taxpayer compliance effects is completed. The President's FY2007 budget proposed funding HUD at $34.1 billion, slightly less than the previous year due to decreased offsetting receipts. The House passed its version of the FY2007 TTHUD Appropriations bill on June 14, 2006. The TTHUD Appropriations bill (H.R. 5576) proposed $35.3 billion for HUD, with Senate approving $36.6 billion. Continuing resolutions (P.L. 109-289, P.L. 109-369, P.L. 109-383) funded HUD programs until final appropriations bills were enacted. President Bush signed a year-long continuing resolution into law (P.L. 110-5) on February 15, 2007. In 2007, President Bush signed a year-long continuing resolution into law (P.L. 110-5) that funded accounts at FY2006 levels. The Community Development Fund (CDF) supports the Community Development Block Grant program (CDBG) and Economic Development and Neighborhood Initiatives (EDI and NI). CDBG provides formula grant funding for community development, while EDIs and NIs are congressionally directed projects. The CDBG formula grant was proposed at just under $3 billion for FY2007, compared to $3.7 billion in FY2006. The President suggested no new funding for EDIs and NIs, and requested Congress to rescind funds from FY2006. In FY2007, Congress rescinded funds for various community development programs, including Brownfields redevelopment and Section 108 loan guarantees. The House-passed bill included $4.2 billion for the Community Development Fund, with $3.9 billion for the CDBG formula program. Additional funding was allocated for Indian tribes, Economic Development Initiative earmarks, and Neighborhood Initiative earmarks. Floor amendments provided funding for Brownfields redevelopment and Section 108 loan guarantees. No funding was included for Rural Housing and Economic Development. The Senate committee-passed version of H.R. 5576 recommended funding of about $4.2 billion for the Community Development Fund, with $3.9 billion for the CDBG formula program. Additional funding was allocated for Indian tribes, Economic Development Initiative earmarks, and Neighborhood Initiative earmarks. The Rural Housing and Economic Development program would have been funded at $20 million, and Section 108 loan guarantees would have received $3 million. No funding was provided for the Brownfields Redevelopment program. The CR provided almost $3.8 billion for the Community Development Fund, a decrease from the FY2006 funding level of $4.2 billion. The CDBG formula program is funded at just over $3.7 billion, about equal to the amount provided in FY2006. The FY2007 budget allocated funding for various programs including the Rural Housing and Economic Development program, Section 108 loan guarantees program, and Brownfields Redevelopment program. The Section 202 housing for the elderly program faced proposed budget cuts, with the House-passed bill providing slightly more funding than FY2006 levels. The Senate committee recommended $750 million for Section 202. The FY2007 Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution did not specify funding for elderly housing, maintaining the FY2006 level. The FY2007 budget did not specify funding for elderly housing, maintaining the FY2006 level of $734.6 million. The Administration proposed to halve funding for the Section 811 housing for the disabled program, but the House and Senate recommended increased funding. The federal public housing program is funded through the Operating Fund, Capital Fund, and HOPE VI program. The President proposed $3.5 billion for the Operating Fund and almost $2.2 billion for the public housing Capital Fund in FY2007. The House Appropriations committee-funded all three programs at the President's request, with a floor amendment adding $30 million to the Capital Fund. The Senate committee-passed bill would have funded the Operating Fund at $3.6 billion. The Senate committee-passed bill for FY2006 HOPE VI funds included $3.6 billion for the Operating Fund, $2.4 billion for the Capital Fund, and $100 million for HOPE VI. The Continuing Resolution (CR) maintained FY2006 funding levels for the Capital Fund and HOPE VI, while increasing the Operating Fund to $3.8 million. The judiciary presents its budget to the President, who then transmits it to Congress unaltered. The judiciary received an increase in funding for FY2007 to maintain staffing levels and address immigration-related caseloads. Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. expressed concern about a possible year-long continuing resolution, stating that funding at FY2006 levels would severely impact court operations and U.S. citizens. Over 2,400 court staff could be lost if funding remained at FY2006 levels. The Chief Justice requested that the Judiciary not be subject to a budget freeze and revised the FY2007 judiciary budget request to $6.029 billion, which was $231 million less than the original request but $309 million more than the FY2006 enacted amount. He emphasized that public safety would be at risk due to potential staff reductions, impacting supervision for felons and defendants. In FY2007, Congress approved $5.98 billion in appropriations for the judiciary, which is 4.5% more than the FY2006 amount. Chief Justice Roberts highlighted the high cost of rent paid by the judiciary to the GSA, constituting 20% of the total budget, and requested rent relief from Congress. Legislation was introduced to address this issue. Legislation was introduced in both the House and Senate to direct GSA to establish rental fees not exceeding actual operating costs for judiciary space. H.R. 4710, the \"Judiciary Rent Reform Act of 2006,\" was introduced by Rep. Sensenbrenner, while a similar measure, S. 2292, was introduced by Sen. Specter. Introduced S. 2292, a bill referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Chief Justice Roberts highlighted concerns about judicial pay not keeping up with inflation, leading to judges leaving the bench. Senator Feinstein introduced S. 2276, aiming to increase federal judges' salaries by 16.5% and decouple them from congressional salaries. The \"Federal Judicial Fairness Act\" was introduced as a companion bill to S. 2276, addressing judicial security concerns and appropriations for the judiciary. Chief Justice emphasized the need to protect judges from violence while highlighting the budget allocation for the judiciary. The federal budget allocates funds for the Supreme Court and lower federal courts, with the largest portion going towards salaries and expenses for the U.S. Courts of Appeals, District Courts, and Other Judicial Services. The Architect of the Capitol is responsible for the care of the Supreme Court building and grounds. The judiciary budget funds salaries and expenses for various federal court personnel, excluding special courts like the U.S. Tax Court. The FY2007 budget request included funding for additional positions to restore lost positions from previous years. The FY2007 judiciary budget request included a $540.1 million increase, with $461.8 million for pay adjustments and inflation-related increases, and $78.3 million for workload changes and program enhancements. The FY2007 enacted amount was $5.98 billion, a 4.5% increase over the previous year. Hearings were held on the Supreme Court and overall judiciary budget requests. The House Appropriations Committee approved a $6.1 billion funding level for the judiciary, which was a $342.8 million increase over the previous year. H.R. 5576 was passed by the House to provide the judiciary with the approved funding level. The House committee approved $6.1 billion in funding for the judiciary, expressing concerns over budget practices. The Senate Appropriations Subcommittee and Committee also approved the same funding level, with a $378 million increase over FY2006 but $162.1 million less than the FY2007 request. Staffing issues were highlighted in the committee report. The committee recommended that the Judicial Conference prioritize retaining personnel and address staffing needs, particularly along the U.S. southwest border due to increased immigration funding. A hiring plan for magistrate judges and staff positions was requested, along with a review of staffing formulas. The committee also urged careful consideration of courthouse construction needs and rent payments to GSA, emphasizing the need for checks and balances in future construction requests. The committee recommended prioritizing personnel retention and addressing staffing needs, especially along the U.S. southwest border. It also called for checks and balances in future construction requests and efficient use of space in district and circuit courts. The AOUSC was directed to report on steps taken for space efficiency and encouraged to work with GSA on fair rent charges. Carryover funds should be used for current needs before enhancing programs, with detailed plans for their use to be submitted for approval. Highlights of the FY2007 judiciary budget were also provided. The Supreme Court requested $76.4 million for FY2007, a 16.2% increase from the previous year. This included $63.4 million for Salaries and Expenses and $13.0 million for Care of the Building and Grounds. The increase in salaries and expenses was mainly for salary and benefit costs, inflationary fixed costs, and new positions. The Buildings and Grounds account saw a $7.4 million increase for repairs, maintenance, and modernization. Both the House and Senate committee approved the full amount requested. The FY2007 enacted amount for this account was $74.0 million, a 12.6% increase over the FY2006 appropriation. The FY2007 request was $26.3 million, including pay adjustments, health benefit costs, rental costs, and technology upgrades.

This budget group includes 12 courts of appeals and 94 district judicial courts. The judiciary budget for FY2007 includes four main accounts that fund daily operations of federal courts. The Salaries and Expenses request was $4,691.2 million, with most of the increase going towards pay raises and maintaining current services. Additional funds were allocated for rent, technology support, and equipment. The judiciary budget for FY2007 included an increase of $22.1 million to fund additional support staff for anticipated workload increase due to immigration-related cases.

In FY2007, decreased appropriations were requested for all accounts under the Executive Office of the President except for Compensation of the President. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) had the largest reductions in funding. Funds were moved from these accounts to the Office of Administration for centralization of services, resulting in OMB losing 11 full-time equivalent employees. The budget proposed transferring the HIDTAP program to the Department of Justice and funding it at $207.6 million. In FY2007, the President's budget proposed consolidating salaries and expenses accounts supporting the President into a single annual appropriation of $184.252 million, a 7.0% increase from the previous year. This consolidation included nine accounts such as Compensation of the President, White House Office, and National Security Council. The EOP budget submission proposed consolidating resources and staff to realign priorities. Separate appropriations for EOP accounts were maintained for congressional oversight. The FY2007 budget requested authority to transfer funds among EOP accounts. The EOP budget submission proposed consolidating resources and staff to realign priorities, with the OMB Director having the authority to transfer up to 10% of any appropriation to another appropriation after notifying the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. This transfer authority would allow the President to address emerging priorities and shifting demands. The President has the authority to transfer up to 10% of appropriated funds among accounts for the White House Office, OMB, ONDCP, and Special Assistance to the President. This flexibility is meant to address emerging priorities and improve efficiency within the EOP, without creating new missions or programs. The President has the authority to transfer up to 10% of appropriated funds among accounts for the White House Office, OMB, ONDCP, and Special Assistance to the President. An enterprise services initiative in the FY2007 budget request aims to streamline services like burn bag pickup costs and employee transportation subsidies. Budgets for various services in different EOP components would be consolidated into the OA for efficiency. The FY2007 TTHUD appropriations bill continued separate appropriations for the EOP accounts, including funding for the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board and the OA. The House recommended up to $1.5 million for the Board and $91.4 million for the OA, with reduced funding compared to the budget request. Funding for OMB and ONDCP rental payments was also continued. An appropriation of $26.9 million was provided for ONDCP, with an increase of $3.6 million over the FY2007 budget request to continue funding rental payments to GSA. Additionally, $19.6 million was provided for the CTAC, $10 million more than the FY2007 budget request, with increased funding for the Technology Transfer Program. The House committee recommended $227 million for the HIDTAP program, with increased funding for specific HIDTAs under the EOP. The HIDTAP program received increased funding of $8 million through an amendment by Representative Darlene Hooley. Other federal drug control programs saw a decrease in funding, with Drug Free Communities receiving $80 million, National Drug Court Institute and National Alliance for Model State Drug Laws each receiving $1 million, and the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign receiving $100 million. The Appropriations Committee expressed serious concerns about the E-Gov initiative, stating that many aspects of the initiative are flawed and contradict statutory requirements. The FY2007 bill included a provision precluding the use of funds for the initiative without prior consultation with the committee. The House-passed bill and Senate bill included a provision precluding the use of funds for the ONDCP without prior consultation with the committee. The committee expressed concerns about the ONDCP's focus on domestic methamphetamine issues and directed the ONDCP Director to submit a financial plan for FY2007 and include recommendations for counterdrug technology research in the budget submission for FY2008. The House and Senate bills included provisions for funding approval and oversight. The Administration requested consolidation of White House accounts and expansion of budgetary transfer authority. Concerns were raised about reduced funding for the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign. The Senate Committee on Appropriations continued separate appropriations for EOP accounts with a provision allowing transfer of up to 10% of funds. The committee rejected a single, consolidated account to maintain Congress's oversight of fund expenditure. The Office of Policy Development's responsibilities were merged into the White House Office salaries and expenses account.

The House Appropriations Committee raised the amount for data systems to $6.5 million and authorized the agency to collect registration fees for conferences. The House committee commended the FEC on its Administrative Fine Program but expressed concern about its authorization beyond December 31, 2008. The Senate Appropriations Committee matched the House appropriation of $57.1 million for FY2007, but did not comment on the Administrative Fine Program or provide additional instructions to the FEC. Despite proposed increases in FEC appropriations, funding remained at $54.5 million for FY2007. The FLRA aims to implement cost-saving measures under the strategic management of human capital goal. The FLRA plans to implement cost-saving measures to address workload changes due to BRAC decisions and reforms at DOD and DHS. Regional workload declined by 32% between 2001 and 2004. The agency will streamline training functions and implement workforce flexibilities through OPM. FLRA received $25 million for FY2007. The General Services Administration (GSA) manages federal buildings, property disposal, and records. It oversees funding for former Presidents and transitions.

In FY2007, OPM prioritized reforms to position classification, pay, and performance management systems. They also focused on recruitment, hiring, training, and benefits options. The Inspector General worked on a prescription drug audit program to recover inappropriate expenses. The House bill provided the same appropriation for OPM salaries and expenses as requested by the President. In FY2007, OPM focused on reforms to position classification, pay, and performance management systems. The House bill allocated funding differently, denying an increase for pay and performance modernization. The bill also did not fund an increase for the retirement systems modernization project, directing the GAO to monitor progress in converting paper personnel files to digital systems. The Departments of Homeland Security and Defense must submit an operating plan for FY2007 within 60 days of the act's enactment. The plan should include funding levels, changes in dollars requested, and clear information on how programs will be funded and measured.

The USPS generates its funding through mail services but receives appropriations for certain services like free mailing privileges for the blind and bio-terrorism detection. Congress has allocated funds for bio-terrorism detection post-anthrax events in 2001. The Revenue Forgone Reform Act of 1993 authorizes reimbursement to USPS until 2035 for services provided below cost to non-profit organizations in the 1990s. The FY2007 Budget proposed an appropriation of $79.9 million, including $60.7 million for revenue forgone and a reconciliation adjustment for underestimated mail volume.

The Administration's FY2007 budget proposed a lower usage figure for mail for the blind and suggested eliminating the usual $29 million annual payment. The Postal Service requested $152.7 million for FY2007, including $80.1 million for revenue forgone and $29 million for the annual payment under the Revenue Forgone Reform Act of 1993. The Administration's budget proposed to eliminate the $29 million annual payment and delay the availability of $79.9 million until FY2008. The House and Senate Committees approved $108.9 million for the Postal Service Fund in FY2007, with $79.9 million in advanced appropriations for revenue forgone and $29 million for past revenue forgone expenditures. The Senate directed the Postal Service to hold off on mail processing center consolidations in certain states until a GAO report is issued on decision-making criteria. The Transportation, Treasury, et al., Appropriations Act includes general provisions for government-wide or specific agencies/programs. The Administration's proposed language for general provisions was in the FY2007 Budget. Congress prefers reiterating language rather than making provisions permanent. Some government-wide general provisions proposed for elimination in the FY2007 budget. The FY2007 budget proposed eliminating certain government-wide general provisions, including sections in H.R. 5576 that were not enacted. These provisions included prohibiting payment to political appointees filling nominated but unconfirmed positions, and prohibiting the use of funds for employee training that does not meet specific criteria. Section 919 of the House bill and Section 819 of the Senate bill include provisions related to prohibiting certain content associated with belief systems. Section 820 prohibits the use of funds for employee non-disclosure agreements without whistleblower protection clauses. Section 823 requires approval from Committees on Appropriations for releasing non-public information. Section 834 recognizes the United States Anti-Doping Agency as the official anti-doping agency for Olympic and Pan events.

Section 845 of the bill precludes contravention of the Privacy Act. New government-wide provisions in H.R. 5576 include a 2.7% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees and a limit on sending more than 50 employees to a single conference outside the United States. This provision was added by an amendment and agreed to by the House. The House approved a 2.7% pay adjustment for federal employees in H.R. 5576, despite opposition from the Statement of Administration Policy. Provisions in the annual Treasury Department appropriations bill since 2000 have aimed to ease U.S. economic sanctions on Cuba, but none have been enacted. In 2006, H.R. 5576 included a provision to prevent Treasury Department funds from implementing a Cuba embargo regulation amendment. The Administration threatened to veto any bill weakening sanctions on Cuba. The bill was not completed by the end of the 109th Congress, and Treasury Department appropriations for FY2007 were funded by continuing resolutions without any provision on Cuba sanctions. In June and July 2006, amendments related to Cuba were added to H.R. 5576. The House approved one amendment prohibiting funds for the Cuba embargo, while two other amendments were rejected. In the Senate version, a provision regarding Cuba was added by Senator Dorgan. Senator Dorgan added an amendment to the bill during the committee's markup, which was subsequently reported with the Cuba provision. U.S. policy towards Cuba has focused on isolating the country through economic sanctions, including restrictions on financial transactions and travel. In 2004, the Bush Administration tightened travel restrictions, sparking backlash. The US has imposed restrictions on family visits and educational travel to Cuba, while allowing some agricultural exports since 2001 under TSRA. Transactions must be in cash or financed by third countries. Cuba has purchased $1.2 billion in agricultural products from the US since 2001. Overall US exports to Cuba have increased over the years, with the majority being agricultural products. In 2005, the US tightened economic sanctions against Cuba. The US tightened economic sanctions against Cuba in 2005 by further restricting how U.S. agricultural exporters may be paid for their sales, clarifying that payment must be received before shipment of goods. This action was met with objections from exporters and some Members of Congress, who argued it violated the intent of TSRA and could impact millions of dollars in agricultural sales to Cuba. OFAC Director Robert Werner defended the clarification, stating it aligns with international trade practices. In July 2005, OFAC clarified that vessels can leave U.S. ports for the commercial sale of U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba as soon as a foreign bank confirms receipt of payment from Cuba, to prevent goods from being seized for unrelated claims. Supporters of overturning OFAC's February 2005 amendment were pleased with the clarification but still aimed to overturn the rule.
