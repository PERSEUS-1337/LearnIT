    "content": "The \"Access to Postal Services Act\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. Modified procedures are outlined in the Act. The \"Access to Postal Services Act\" requires the Postal Service to conduct an investigation and provide notice before closing or consolidating a postal facility. The community's impact is considered in the decision-making process. The \"Access to Postal Services Act\" mandates an investigation and notice before closing or consolidating a postal facility. Factors considered include the impact on the community, employees, and adherence to government policy on providing postal services to rural areas. Compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 is not a consideration in the decision-making process. The decision to close or consolidate a postal facility must be made in writing and include findings on specified considerations. Notice of the decision must be prominently posted in the facility and mailed to affected persons at least 90 days before a final determination is made, allowing for comments to be submitted. The notice of a final determination to close or consolidate a postal facility must include instructions for submitting comments, a summary of findings, and estimated cost savings in the first year. The Postal Service must wait 60 days after posting a final determination before closing or consolidating a facility. Appeals can be made within this period, and suspension of closure is mandatory pending appeal. The Postal Service can close or consolidate a facility in case of an emergency suspension, defined by regulations, without the usual waiting period. SEC. 3. ACTUAL COST SAVINGS. The Inspector General of the United States Postal Service will determine and report the cost savings from closing or consolidating postal facilities within 2 years. The report will include the amount of cost savings, comparison with estimates, and methodologies used. The Inspector General will report on cost savings from closing postal facilities within 2 years, comparing their determination with Postal Service estimates and providing recommendations for more accurate estimates. The definition of \"postal facility\" is expanded to include offices, branches, stations, or other facilities operated by the Postal Service that provide services to postal patrons, residents within the ZIP code served, patrons with post office boxes, and relevant local government officials."
