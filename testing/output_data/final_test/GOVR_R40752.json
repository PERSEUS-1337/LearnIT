    "content": "President Bush issued a Military Order authorizing trial by military commission of non-citizens suspected of terrorist acts after 9/11. 20 detainees at Guant\u00e1namo Bay were designated under the order, with 10 eventually charged for trial. The Supreme Court invalidated the provision denying recourse to the U.S. court system in 2004. Military commissions are courts set up by military commanders to try offenses during war. Military commissions are established by military commanders in the field to try persons accused of certain offenses during war or in cases of martial law. They historically apply international law of war and procedural rules similar to courts-martial. These commissions have been used in various conflicts and military occupations, including the war with Mexico, the Civil War, the Philippine Insurrection, and post-World War II Germany and Japan. President Bush's Military Order established military commissions to try suspected terrorists, sparking intense debate over potential violations of rights under the Constitution and international law. The rules for the tribunals were seen as an improvement but criticized for not going far enough, particularly in addressing indefinite detention without charge. The Department of Defense was noted for potentially detaining individuals cleared by the tribunals. The Pentagon's Inspector General investigated allegations of rigged military commission proceedings but did not find evidence to support the claims. Congress passed the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005, which revoked judicial jurisdiction over habeas claims by \"enemy combatants\" and created jurisdiction in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for appeals of military commission decisions. The Supreme Court invalidated the military commission system in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld. The Supreme Court invalidated the military commission system in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, leading to the passage of the Military Commissions Act of 2006. This act authorized military commissions with procedural rules modeled after the Uniform Code of Military Justice. David Matthew Hicks and Salim Hamdan were both convicted of material support for terrorism through military commissions. Ali Hamza Ahmad Suliman al Bahlul of Yemen was found guilty of multiple counts of conspiracy and solicitation to commit war crimes and providing material support for terrorism as al Qaeda's \"propaganda chief.\" He was sentenced to life imprisonment. President Barack Obama issued an Executive Order to close the Guantanamo detention facility within a year, requiring officials to review all detentions for possible transfer, release, or prosecution. During the review period, the Secretary of Defense is required to halt proceedings before military commissions and the United States Court of Military Commission Review. Fifteen detainees are charged under the MCA, while charges were dismissed against five others. The Obama Administration considered restarting the military commission system with procedural rule changes. The Department of Defense informed Congress about modifications to the Manual for Military Commissions. President Obama's Detention Policy Task Force issued a preliminary report reaffirming the White House's stance on military commissions. The White House reaffirmed that military commissions are suitable for some cases involving violations of war laws, with federal criminal court preferred for detainee trials. Cases will be handled by a team of DOJ and DOD personnel, with criteria including factors like offense severity, victim identity, and investigation conduct. The Military Commissions Act of 2006 grants the Secretary of Defense authority to convene military commissions to prosecute alien unlawful enemy combatants. Prosecution considerations include protection of intelligence sources, venue, number of defendants, foreign policy concerns, and efficiency. Federal prosecutors evaluate cases based on traditional principles of federal prosecution. The Military Commissions Act of 2006 grants the Secretary of Defense authority to convene military commissions for trials, approving requests for expert witnesses, plea agreements, and post-trial reviews. The Act establishes chapter 47A in title 10, U.S. Code, exempting military commissions from certain requirements under article 36, UCMJ. It specifies that the UCMJ applies to trial by military commissions only as provided in this chapter. The Military Commissions Act of 2006 establishes chapter 47A in title 10, U.S. Code, granting the Secretary of Defense authority to convene military commissions for trials. It exempts military commissions from certain UCMJ articles and amends others to apply only to the extent provided. The Act narrows the jurisdiction for military commissions compared to President Bush's M.O. The Military Commissions Act of 2006 validated the President's jurisdictional scheme for military commissions, authorizing trials for \"unlawful enemy combatants\" who have engaged in hostilities against the United States or its co-belligerents. This includes individuals associated with the Taliban, Al Qaeda, or related forces. The Military Commissions Act of 2006 allows for the trial of individuals deemed \"unlawful enemy combatants\" who support hostilities against the United States. The Act does not clearly define what constitutes supporting hostilities, raising concerns about trying civilians before military tribunals. The Military Commissions Act of 2006 raises concerns about trying civilians before military tribunals, especially regarding aliens captured and detained overseas. It is unclear if permanent resident aliens in the US could be subject to military jurisdiction, potentially raising constitutional questions. No resident aliens have been charged for trial before a military commission under the MCA. The Military Commissions Act of 2006 raises concerns about trying civilians before military tribunals, especially regarding aliens captured and detained overseas. The Act does not specify who determines if defendants are \"unlawful enemy combatants.\" Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRTs) were set up by the Pentagon to determine detainee status, but they cannot determine if combatants are lawful or unlawful. Two military commission judges found CSRT determinations inadequate for establishing jurisdiction. One judge ruled the military commission itself cannot make the determination, while the other judge found the government's allegations insufficient to conclude the defendant, Salim Hamdan, was an unlawful enemy combatant. The Court of Military Commission Review (CMCR) reversed the decision that Salim Hamdan was an unlawful enemy combatant, stating that more than just membership in Al Qaeda or the Taliban is required to establish jurisdiction. The CMCR found that the Military Commissions Act did not create a comprehensive system to automatically label individuals as enemy combatants based on prior CSRT determinations. The Court of Military Commission Review reversed the decision that Salim Hamdan was an unlawful enemy combatant, stating that more than just membership in Al Qaeda or the Taliban is required to establish jurisdiction. The parenthetical language in the Military Commissions Act does not automatically label individuals as enemy combatants based on prior CSRT determinations. The language simply elaborates that individuals who have engaged in hostilities against the United States or its co-belligerents will qualify as unlawful enemy combatants. The Court of Military Commission Review reversed the decision that Salim Hamdan was an unlawful enemy combatant, stating that more than just membership in Al Qaeda or the Taliban is required to establish jurisdiction. The Military Commissions Act does not automatically label individuals as enemy combatants based on prior CSRT determinations. Individuals who have engaged in hostilities against the United States or its co-belligerents will qualify as unlawful enemy combatants under the M.C.A. Congress carefully defined status for the purpose of specifying the criminal jurisdiction of military commission trials, prescribing serious criminal sanctions for those convicted. The use of CSRT determinations to subject detainees to military commission jurisdiction was not known to them during their reviews. The Court of Military Commission Review reversed a decision regarding Salim Hamdan's status as an unlawful enemy combatant, emphasizing that mere membership in Al Qaeda or the Taliban is not sufficient for jurisdiction. The Military Commissions Act requires proof of engagement in hostilities against the US or its allies to qualify as an unlawful enemy combatant. The Manual for Military Commissions was amended in 2009 to reflect the burden of proving jurisdiction over each person charged for trial by a military commission. The MCA grants jurisdiction to military commissions for offenses punishable under the law of war when committed by an alien unlawful enemy combatant. The Military Commissions Act (MCA) lists various offenses punishable under the law of war, including murder, attacking civilians, torture, rape, terrorism, and more. Conspiracy, attempts, and solicitation to commit these acts are also punishable. The MCA adopted the list of offenses authorized by the Department of Defense. The Military Commissions Act (MCA) adopted a list of offenses authorized by the Department of Defense for trial by military commission. The list is not exhaustive but serves as an illustration of acts punishable under the law of war. Some crimes defined in the MCA may be new, such as conspiracy and \"murder in violation of the law of war.\" The Department of Defense argues that the element \"in violation of the law of war\" is established by showing the perpetrator is an unprivileged belligerent. It is unclear if a civilian killing a lawful combatant constitutes a violation of the law of war. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia found war crimes in non-international armed conflict include murder of protected persons, but killing a combatant may not necessarily be a war crime. Prison guards at Omarska and other detention camps were found guilty of murder as a violation of the laws or customs of war. The International Criminal Court defines murder in the context of non-international armed conflict as the killing of a protected person, while killing a combatant adversary is considered a war crime only if done treacherously. The Guantanamo military commission judges have differing views on what constitutes murder in violation of the law of war, with one judge emphasizing the perpetrator being an unlawful enemy combatant and the method used violating the law of war. The offense of murder in violation of the laws of war has historical support related to means and methods of killing. Military commissions in the U.S. Civil War and the Philippine Insurrection charged individuals with this offense, often involving the killing of unarmed civilians or prisoners. The distinction between murder and murder in violation of the laws of war sometimes depended on the status of the victim or the circumstances of the killing. The determination of murder in violation of the laws of war can be influenced by the status of the victim or the authority under which the act was carried out. Historical precedent does not fully support defining \"material support for terrorism\" as a war crime. Congress's determination in the MCA that \"material support for terrorism\" is a traditional offense against the law of war, citing Civil War precedents. The Supreme Court's decision in Ex parte Milligan may limit trying such crimes by military commissions without martial law. Charges related to aiding guerrillas often specified the accused as a U.S. citizen, suggesting a violation of martial law rather than international law of war. The Obama Administration has concerns about the crime of \"material support for terrorism\" in the context of military commissions. Most detainees facing charges have been accused of this crime, but there are debates about its legality and whether it should be eliminated from the Military Commissions Act. The Manual for Military Commissions outlines the elements of crimes defined by the Act. The Manual for Military Commissions (M.M.C.) defines crimes under the Military Commissions Act, with some changes to previous DOD regulations. \"Aiding the Enemy\" now requires allegiance to the U.S. \"Mutilation or maiming\" and \"causing serious injury\" no longer require victim custody. \"Murder in violation of the law of war\" now includes deaths from the accused's actions with intent to kill. The law of war traditionally applies within armed conflicts between belligerents, not on neutral territory or before hostilities. The conflict related to the September 11 attacks lacks clear boundaries in time or space. President Bush's military commissions faced criticism for exceeding customary law, despite DOD regulations. The Military Commissions Act (MCA) broadened jurisdiction to include conduct subject to ordinary criminal law. The Military Commissions Act (MCA) provides jurisdiction to military commissions over offenses committed by alien unlawful enemy combatants before or after September 11, 2001. The Manual for Military Commissions outlines elements of crimes with a nexus to armed conflict, but lacks a clear definition. Congress enacted the MCA to address objections regarding subject matter jurisdiction of military commissions, but questions remain about the necessity for conduct to occur within an armed conflict for trial by military commission. The Military Commissions Act (MCA) does not explicitly require a nexus to armed conflict for trials by military commissions. In the Hamdan case, membership in a conspiracy related to the September 11th attacks was deemed a violation of the law of war. The DOD regulations for military commissions allowed for panels of three to seven military officers, including reserve personnel on active duty. The Military Commissions Act (MCA) allows for the appointment of personnel by the President during a national emergency. A qualified military judge presides over panels of military officers, with a minimum of five members, or twelve in cases seeking the death penalty. The Secretary of Defense determines procedures for assigning military judges and their duties, with restrictions on consulting with panel members outside the presence of the accused and counsel. The Military Commissions Act empowers military judges to decide on evidence admissibility and maintain decorum during proceedings. The presiding officer can discipline individuals for contempt or breaches of commission rules. Military commissions are authorized to punish individuals for violations. The Military Commissions Act authorizes military commissions to punish individuals for contempt, including civilians, with fines and confinement. There is no limit on punishment for contempt, and military commissions have the power to compel witnesses to appear. The Military Commissions Act grants military commissions the power to compel witnesses to appear, similar to US courts with criminal jurisdiction. The defense is given a \"reasonable opportunity\" to obtain witnesses and evidence, with the trial counsel responsible for producing requested witnesses unless deemed unnecessary. A duly subpoenaed witness who refuses to appear before a military commission may be prosecuted in federal court under article 47 of the UCMJ. The Military Commissions Act allows military commissions to compel witnesses to appear. Witnesses who refuse to comply may be prosecuted in federal court. The M.M.C. grants authority to issue subpoenas to compel witness testimony or document production. Video transmission testimony may be allowed for civilian witnesses who cannot travel to Cuba. The M.O. addressed concerns about command influence over commission personnel. The Military Commissions Act addresses the issue of command influence over commission personnel by providing procedural rules to guard against it. The Act prohibits unlawful influence and concentrates authority in the Appointing Authority, which Justice Kennedy noted as a departure from the usual structural safeguards in the military justice system. The Military Commissions Act prohibits unlawful influence on military commissions, ensuring fair proceedings. Rules for Military Commissions prevent command influence, but concerns remain about the convening authority's multiple roles potentially leading to unfairness. The Military Commissions Act aims to prevent unfairness in military commissions by prohibiting unlawful influence. Concerns have been raised about the convening authority's multiple roles potentially leading to unfairness, including improper influence by legal advisors and executive branch control over military judges. The Act guarantees certain rights to the accused and allows for appeals based on specified standards and procedures. The Military Commissions Act (MCA) ensures fairness in military commissions by informing the accused of charges promptly and presuming innocence until proven guilty. The accused has the right to refuse to testify, present evidence, and cross-examine witnesses. The public's right to access trials by military commission may be challenged by media representatives under the First Amendment. The First Amendment right of public access extends to trials by court-martial, but is not absolute. The reporters' right to gather information does not include an absolute right to gain access to areas not open to the public. Trials may be closed only under specific conditions outlined in the MCA to protect national security. The M.M.C. provides guidelines for closing court-martial proceedings to protect national security or ensure physical safety, which may implicate First Amendment rights of the press and public. The military judge can only close proceedings to protect designated information or individuals' safety, but may also limit access for other reasons. The military judge may limit spectators and access to the courtroom, exclude specific persons, and employ a time-delay on the audio feed to protect classified information during court-martial proceedings. Such measures must be supported by written findings. The accused at a court-martial has the right to be present at all proceedings, except for panel deliberations. The Military Commissions Act (MCA) does not allow the accused to be excluded from any part of the trial, and classified information must be disclosed to the accused. The accused can only be excluded from trial proceedings if they engage in disruptive or dangerous conduct, but may be excluded from in camera discussions on classified information. The accused cannot waive the right to be present at trial, but may forfeit it through disruptive behavior. The accused at a court-martial has the right to be present at all proceedings, except for panel deliberations. In military courts-martial, an accused has the right to have military counsel assigned free of charge. The accused may also hire a civilian attorney who meets specific criteria. The accused at a court-martial has the right to have military counsel assigned free of charge or hire a civilian attorney. The MCA allows for self-representation and the accused can request a replacement counsel if dissatisfied with the assigned counsel. The MCA allows for self-representation and the accused can request a replacement counsel if dissatisfied. Civilian attorneys defending an accused before military commission must meet strict qualifications. The Chief Defense Counsel determines eligibility of civilian defense counsel and may reconsider based on new information. The MCA does not address monitoring of communications between accused and attorney, and does not provide attorney-client privilege. Rule 502 of Military Commission Rules of Evidence provides lawyer-client privilege. The previous DOD rules for military commissions required civilian counsel to agree to monitoring of attorney-client communications, later modified to allow prior notification. Lack of attorney-client privilege could hinder communication effectiveness. Civilian attorneys must inform military counsel of pending crimes that threaten national security. The Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to confront witnesses and obtain witnesses in favor. In courts-martial, all relevant evidence is admissible unless outweighed by other factors. The accused has the right to view prosecution documents related to charges and evidence that could negate guilt or reduce punishment. Military commissions may use different evidentiary standards than federal or military courts. The Supreme Court found previous DOD rules inadequate under international law. The accused must be present for trial, privy to evidence, and allowed to present a defense in military commissions. There may be issues regarding the exclusion of evidence relevant to credibility or authenticity. Defense counsel should have a reasonable opportunity to obtain witnesses and evidence. The accused in military commissions is entitled to obtain witnesses and evidence, including exculpatory information known to the prosecution, with procedures for security concerns. The MCA provides for the protection of national security information during the discovery phase of a trial. The military judge authorizes discovery in accordance with rules to redact classified information or provide an unclassified summary. The MCA allows the government to withhold properly classified information for national security reasons. Defense counsel does not have access to classified information. The Military Commissions Act (MCA) does not allow defense counsel access to classified information, but permits the production of exculpatory information. The military judge can authorize substitute information when classified details are involved, allowing trial counsel to protect sources and methods. Defense and commission members may be allowed to view an unclassified summary in some cases. Members may view an unclassified summary of sources, methods, or activities, subject to national security constraints. Trial counsel must provide exculpatory evidence, with exceptions for national security privilege. The military judge can issue protective orders, but the defense is entitled to adequate substitutes for classified information. This may involve deleting specified items, providing summaries, or admitting relevant facts. If the proposed substitute is deemed inadequate, the defense must receive suitable information. The military judge must issue any order necessary for the interests of justice if the government's proposed substitute for evidence is inadequate or impracticable. This order may include striking testimony, declaring a mistrial, ruling against the government, or dismissing charges with or without prejudice. Evidence at military commissions must have probative value. The MCA allows the exclusion of evidence if its probative value is outweighed by unfair prejudice or other factors. Torture-obtained statements are not admissible, except as proof of torture. Coerced statements have different admissibility standards based on timing. Statements obtained after the passage of the DTA are admissible if the military judge deems them reliable and in the interest of justice, and if the interrogation methods used were not in violation of constitutional rights. Accused individuals can motion to suppress statements obtained through torture. The military judge must preclude evidence obtained through cruel treatment, regardless of when it was made. The defense must object to the use of any statements before entering a plea, or the objection will be waived. The government bears the burden of proving the evidence's admissibility, and the defense can present evidence on the statement's voluntariness. The military judge must instruct the members to consider the voluntariness of a statement in weighing the evidence. Testimony by the accused denying a statement's validity can only be used in perjury or false statement prosecutions. Mil. Comm. R. Evid. 304 mirrors Mil. R. Evid. 304 for admitting confessions and admissions in courts-martial, requiring voluntary statements. Involuntary statements obtained through coercion violate due process and are inadmissible as evidence of guilt. The military judge may suppress statements made by the accused if they were obtained under coercive circumstances, such as death threats. This treatment is considered torture under the Military Commission Rules of Evidence. Additionally, the judge ruled that statements made to U.S. interrogators must also be suppressed if they were taken under coercive conditions. The government dropped charges against a detainee after winning a habeas petition. Hearsay evidence is an out-of-court statement used to prove the truth of the matter asserted. The MCA allows hearsay evidence if the adverse party is notified in advance. The May, 2009 changes to the regulations regarding hearsay evidence in military commissions now place the burden of demonstrating reliability on the proponent of the evidence. Hearsay is admissible in military commissions on the same basis as any other form of evidence, with no specific prohibitions outlined in the rules. Hearsay may be admitted if it would be admissible at courts-martial or if the party proffering it notifies the adverse party thirty days in advance. The admissibility of hearsay in military commissions now requires the proponent to demonstrate reliability and provide advance notice to the opposing party. Classified information is privileged from disclosure for national security reasons, and its release is determined by the original classification authority. The military judge can authorize deletion, substitution, or summary of classified information to protect national security. Privileged information is not disclosed to the accused, and intelligence sources are protected during trial proceedings. The Military Commissions Act allows for the presentation of classified evidence with a summary if deemed necessary by the military judge. However, it may not provide the accused with sufficient opportunity to contest the evidence, potentially raising constitutional concerns regarding the Sixth Amendment. The Military Commissions Act allows for the presentation of classified evidence with limited opportunity for the accused to contest its reliability, potentially raising constitutional concerns. Classified evidence may be admissible if it contains guarantees of trustworthiness and adversarial testing would not significantly add to its reliability. The military judge must consider a broad range of potential objections as the defense has not had the opportunity to evaluate the evidence. Trial counsel can object to questions that may disclose classified information, with the judge taking appropriate action such as reviewing in camera or allowing a delay for consultation. Defense counsel must notify trial counsel and the judge if classified information will be disclosed at trial. The Military Commissions Act (MCA) allows military commissions to adjudge punishments, including death penalty, with specific prohibitions on cruel punishments. A two-thirds vote is needed for sentences up to 10 years, while longer sentences require three-fourths concurrence. Defense counsel must notify trial counsel and the judge if classified information will be disclosed at trial. The Military Commissions Act allows military commissions to adjudge punishments, including the death penalty. A unanimous vote is required for the death penalty, with a panel of 12 members needed for the decision. The death sentence can only be carried out after all legal proceedings and appeals are exhausted, and the President approves the sentence. The President has the authority to commute, remit, or suspend a death sentence. The President has the authority to commute, remit, or suspend a death sentence, as stated in the Military Commissions Act. Chapter X of the Rules for Military Commissions covers sentencing, including the presentation of aggravating factors by the trial counsel. Unlike courts-martial rules, there is no opportunity for the trial counsel to present evidence of the accused's rehabilitative potential. The accused can present mitigating or extenuating circumstances in a sworn or unsworn statement. The death penalty can only be imposed if authorized for the offense or under the law of war, and if all twelve commission members vote to convict the accused and agree on aggravating factors outweighing mitigating circumstances. Aggravating factors include offenses violating the law of war, resulting in death or endangering lives, committed for monetary gain, involving torture, or other specified crimes. The Military Commissions Act (MCA) allows for the death penalty in cases where the victim is under fifteen, or a protected person, and for specific law-of-war violations. The MCA establishes post-trial procedures and appeals, including a review by the Court of Military Commission Review (CMCR) comprised of appellate military judges. Accused individuals can appeal final decisions of the military commission to the CMCR on issues of law. The Military Commissions Act (MCA) prohibits the invalidation of a verdict or sentence due to an error of law unless it materially prejudices the accused's substantial rights. The CMCR can approve the verdict, allowing the accused to appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Post-trial procedures for military commissions are outlined in Chapter XI of the Rules for Military Commissions, allowing for corrections of errors without material prejudice to the accused. The accused has 20 days to submit relevant matters to the convening authority after the record is authenticated. The convening authority must consider written submissions and recommendations from the legal advisor if a guilty finding is made. The convening authority cannot disapprove a not guilty finding, except in cases of lack of mental responsibility where the accused may be committed for treatment. Rehearings of guilty findings are allowed. Rehearings of guilty findings may be ordered by the convening authority under stringent circumstances. Any part of a sentence served counts toward any resentencing. The record is forwarded to the CMCR for review, unless the accused waives it. The CMCR can only grant relief if an error of law prejudiced the accused's trial rights. The accused has 20 days to submit a petition for review with the U.S. Court of Appeals after receiving notification of the CMCR decision. The Military Commissions Act (MCA) allows an accused to petition for a new trial within two years of a military commission conviction becoming final. The MCA prohibits double jeopardy, stating that no person can be tried a second time for the same offense without consent. Jeopardy attaches when a guilty finding becomes final after a full case review. The Military Commissions Act (MCA) prevents double jeopardy by ensuring that a verdict of not guilty cannot be reversed. The severity of a sentence adjudged by the military commission cannot be increased unless the offense carries a mandatory sentence. These protections are outlined in Chapter XI of the Rules for Military Commission. Proceedings cannot reconsider a ruling of not guilty, except in certain circumstances. The Military Commissions Act (MCA) ensures that a proper sentence is adjudged, and double jeopardy concerns may arise if an indictment is inadequate in specifying charges. The MCA requires charges to be signed under oath and served in a language understood by the accused. The Rules for Military Commission state that charges must specify the offense and the accused's violation. The Rules for Military Commissions require charges to be signed under oath and served in a language understood by the accused. The accused must be served a copy of the charges in English and another language they understand. Minor changes in charges can be permitted before findings are announced, but major changes require a new referral. President Bush's 2001 Military Order allowed for the transfer of individuals for trial by military commission. Double jeopardy concerns may arise if an indictment is inadequate in specifying charges. The Military Commissions Act does not address transfers or prohibit trials in another forum, potentially leading to double jeopardy concerns. Legislation has been introduced to amend the MCA, and additional bills regarding detainees and habeas corpus have been proposed. The proposed amendment to the Military Commissions Act of 2006 would make key changes, including defining jurisdiction over \"alien unprivileged enemy belligerents\" differently from current law. Military commissions would have the authority to determine their own jurisdiction and offenses must be related to armed conflict. Prosecution of crimes prior to the bill's enactment would be limited to traditional military commission triable offenses. The proposed amendment to the Military Commissions Act of 2006 includes changes such as prohibiting confessions obtained through cruel treatment, shifting the burden of proof for hearsay evidence, and changing the appellate court to the Court of Appeals of the Armed Services. The proposed amendment to the Military Commissions Act of 2006 would establish the Commission Review as the exclusive appellate court, with the CAAF having the authority to review guilty verdicts and order charges dismissed. The Supreme Court would retain discretionary jurisdiction, and the obligation to disclose exculpatory information would extend to all relevant evidence known to government officials involved in the case. The Obama Administration has proposed amendments to section 1031 of S. 1390, suggesting excluding all involuntarily given statements by the accused, considering the challenges of the battlefield. There is no requirement for battlefield captives to be warned about the use of their statements against them. The Obama Administration proposes amendments to U.S. military tribunals, including eliminating the material support charge, adjusting standards for hearsay evidence, modifying the role of the Court of Military Commissions Review, and adding a five-year sunset provision for the Military Commissions Act. The comparison charts analyze military tribunals under different regulations, including the Military Commissions Act of 2006. Chart 1 details legal authorities, jurisdiction, and tribunal structures. Chart 2 compares procedural safeguards in the MCA to court-martial procedures and proposed amendments, following a format for easy comparison with federal court and international tribunals. The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of ad hoc tribunals by the UN Security Council to try crimes in Yugoslavia and Rwanda, comparing them to previous rules under President Bush's Military Order.
