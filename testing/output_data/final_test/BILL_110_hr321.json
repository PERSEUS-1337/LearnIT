    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Currency Harmonization Initiative Through Neutralizing Action Act of 2005\". The Congress finds that misalignments in currency caused by government policies can nullify trade concessions, violating GATT 1994 and IMF agreements that prohibit currency manipulation for unfair trade advantage. The Trade Act of 1974 allows the US to take retaliatory action against countries with unjustifiable trade practices. Economists estimate the Chinese RMB is undervalued by 40%, leading to a significant impact on import tariffs. The President should take action against China for currency manipulation under various trade laws and agreements, and improve WTO rules on currency manipulation to reflect modern monetary policies. The current rules adopted in 1947 need to be updated to increase oversight and input opportunities for Congress in the United States' interaction with the World Trade Organization. SEC. 3. ANALYSIS OF AND REPORT ON EXCHANGE RATE POLICIES OF CHINA. The Secretary of the Treasury will analyze China's exchange rate policies to determine if they manipulate the exchange rate with the US dollar. If manipulation is found, the Secretary will calculate the manipulation rate as a percentage and report the findings to Congress. The Secretary of the Treasury will analyze China's exchange rate policies for manipulation with the US dollar. The report on the manipulation rate will be submitted within 60 days of the Act's enactment and annually thereafter. SEC. 4. ADDITIONAL TARIFFS.\n\nIf the Secretary of the Treasury's report shows manipulation of rates by China, a tariff equal to the manipulation rate will be imposed on all Chinese products entering the US. This tariff will be adjusted annually based on the latest report.\n\nSEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. \"In this Act, the terms ``GATT 1994'' and ``WTO member'' are defined as per the Uruguay Round Agreements Act.\""
