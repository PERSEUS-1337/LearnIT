    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Educational Reform and Flexibility Act of 1993\" or \"Ed-Flex\". It states the findings and purpose of the Act. The Congress finds that historically, Federal education programs have provided categorical assistance with detailed requirements, but some requirements may hinder educational achievement. Schools and teachers face diverse needs that current program structures may not address, limiting teachers' ability to respond to individual student needs. To compete in the global economy, the Federal Government must support flexible programs. The purpose of this national demonstration program is to support education reform that improves achievement for all students, especially those in affected programs, by promoting coordination of services, enabling teachers to respond to diverse student needs, providing flexibility, and emphasizing program results over resource tracking. The national demonstration program supports education reform to improve student achievement, especially in affected programs, by promoting collaboration among stakeholders and providing flexibility in resource use for better educational outcomes.

The Secretary can grant waivers for projects to states and local educational agencies, with the authority to terminate if goals are not met. Projects involving elementary or secondary schools must include a local educational agency and at least two schools, with participation from each grade and academic program. Applications for projects must be submitted by the local educational agency to the State. The State educational agency must approve applications for projects under this section, which are then transmitted to the Secretary. Each application must be submitted within two years of enactment and include a plan describing project purposes, expected outcomes, impediments to improved educational outcomes, Federal programs to be included, waivers of Federal requirements, and waivers of State and local requirements. The application for projects under this section must include a plan with project purposes, expected outcomes, impediments, Federal programs, waivers of requirements, and educational improvement goals for each school or site. The application for projects under this section must include a plan with project purposes, expected outcomes, impediments, Federal programs, waivers of requirements, and educational improvement goals for each school or site. It should also include how progress will be measured, incorporate Governor's comments, and identify schools and student populations, including achievement data for disadvantaged students. The curr_chunk states that eligible students must meet criteria such as being children with disabilities, currently or formerly migratory, educationally deprived, and eligible for free or reduced-price school lunch. The curr_chunk describes specific goals for enhancing coordination between regular education programs and programs serving disadvantaged students, including involvement of school administrators, teachers, staff, and parents in planning and implementation. It also outlines expected educational outcomes for disadvantaged students in schools that do not participate in the project. The curr_chunk outlines the approval process for projects in states and local educational agencies that have implemented comprehensive regulatory reform. It considers the comprehensiveness of the project, types of students, schools, programs, and activities to be included, as well as the extent to which waivers impede educational improvement. The approval process for projects in states and local educational agencies that have implemented comprehensive regulatory reform includes considerations such as the waivers sought, the requirements to be waived, the goals of the proposed project, accountability measures, and consultation with other federal agencies. The Secretary ensures the distribution of projects. The Secretary ensures geographically and equitably distributed projects under this section, with federal funds allocated according to program requirements. Extensions and continuations may be provided for project purposes. The Secretary may extend and provide continuation funding to projects chosen on a competitive basis by participating agencies. Waivers of statutory or regulatory requirements are restricted for grants awarded to service providers within local educational agencies. Under various civil rights acts and education laws, projects must submit annual reports to the Secretary within ninety days of the project year's end. The project must submit an annual report to the Secretary summarizing its activities, including data on meeting goals for improving achievement, describing impact on disadvantaged children in non-participating schools, and evaluating effectiveness of efforts. The project must submit an annual report to the Secretary summarizing activities, coordinating programs and services for children and families, providing information on achievement levels of students served, and analyzing project reports every two years. At the end of the six-year period, evaluation reports will be submitted. The Secretary shall provide Congress with independent evaluations of projects assisted under this title, including recommendations for statutory amendments based on successful educational achievement. The term \"disadvantaged students\" includes those with limited English proficiency, disabilities, migratory backgrounds, and educational deprivation. The amendment allows for budget neutrality and includes a sunset provision effective for six years."
