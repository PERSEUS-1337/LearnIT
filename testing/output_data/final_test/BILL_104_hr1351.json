The Missouri River system is crucial for transportation and economic growth in the Midwest, connecting to the Mississippi River. Interruptions to this system could have significant adverse effects on transportation and agriculture. The floods of 1993 caused delays in cargo transportation, impacting billions of dollars worth of goods. The floods of 1993 resulted in over 1,000 barges stranded on the Missouri, Upper Mississippi, and Illinois Rivers, costing the towing industry $700,000 per day. Shifting transportation modes from barges to truck and rail will increase costs for industries reliant on the barge industry. The Corps of Engineers did not evaluate gross revenues for navigation or industries supported by the Missouri River. Instituting a spring rise through increased flows on the Missouri River would disrupt crop planting, production, and harvesting dates, leading to potential flooding and risks to millions of Americans' health, safety, and livelihood. The purpose of the section is to outline the objectives or goals of the document. The Act aims to preserve commerce, navigation, flood control on the Missouri River system, recognize it as vital for food supply and transportation, prioritize flood control, navigation, hydropower, and water supply, combine navigation and flood control for the entire Inland Waterway System, and oppose changes to the Master Water Control Manual. The Act aims to preserve commerce, navigation, flood control on the Missouri River system, prioritize flood control, navigation, hydropower, and water supply, and provide safeguards for emergency flood control and water supply levels. The Act prioritizes flood control, navigation, hydropower, and water supply on the Missouri River system, with safeguards for emergency flood control and water supply levels. SEC. 4 addresses permanent pool levels. The Secretary of the Army must maintain Missouri River system pool levels above 18,000,000 acre feet unless necessary for emergency flood control, navigation, hydropower, or water supply. Navigation levels must be maintained at 36,000 cubic feet per second at Sioux City, Iowa from April to November. The Secretary of the Army must maintain Missouri River system pool levels above 18,000,000 acre feet unless necessary for emergency flood control, navigation, hydropower, or water supply. Navigation levels must be maintained at specific cubic feet per second at various locations along the river to ensure the permanent pool level is above 41,000,000 acre feet. Conservation measures will be implemented to maintain navigation levels at lower cubic feet per second during certain periods. The Secretary of the Army has discretionary management over reservoir levels on the Missouri River, ensuring they do not jeopardize the discharge level of the Gavins Point Reservoir needed for navigation levels. The Secretary of the Army, in collaboration with the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior, will gradually extend the navigation season on the Missouri River by 15 days each year until it is increased by 1 month from the 1995 season length. This extension will start in 1996, with the season running from March 15 to December 15. Navigation levels will also be adjusted accordingly. SEC. 6. WATER CONTROL POLICIES AFFECTING NAVIGATION CHANNELS. The Secretary of the Army must adhere to the water control policy of the Corps of Engineers in effect on January 1, 1995, to avoid reducing the number of days vessels can use navigation channels or causing significant flood damage without specific authorization from a post-1995 law. SEC. 7. ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT EVALUATION. Federal departments must conduct cost benefit analysis for proposed changes in Missouri River management alongside environmental impact statements."
