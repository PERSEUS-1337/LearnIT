Congress finds that the Internet is crucial for global competitiveness, with high youth usage rates and prevalent social media presence. Bullying through various online platforms is a significant concern. In a recent survey, 1 in 5 teenagers admitted to sending explicit photos via cell phones, known as \"sexting\", which can lead to felony charges and registration as a sex offender. The Internet has fueled a multibillion dollar market for child pornography, overwhelming law enforcement. Internet safety education and technology tools are crucial in preventing these crimes. According to a study of fourth-grade students in Virginia, Internet safety education programs led to improvements in responses to safety scenarios, particularly in dealing with uncomfortable content and cyberbullying. The Children's Internet Protection Act mandates schools to implement safety policies and technology measures to receive discounts for Internet access. Schools have developed acceptable use policies and implemented filtering to protect students. Less than 25 percent of educators feel comfortable teaching students about online safety, with 90 percent receiving less than 6 hours of professional development on the topic in the past year. This lack of education leaves many students uninformed about safe Internet use despite the widespread use of electronic devices by children. Research suggests that focusing on education rather than just acceptable use policies and filtering is crucial for addressing Internet safety concerns among children. Parents rank Internet safety as a top health concern for children, yet many feel uninformed about how to protect their children online. Educating parents about Internet safety is essential for empowering them to understand risks and protect their children from online harassment or cyberbullying. Online harassment can harm children emotionally, starting in third and fourth grade and peaking in seventh and eighth grade. Gang members use the Internet for recruitment and intimidation. Research is needed for preventing minor-to-minor solicitation and problematic content creation by youths. The Act aims to protect vulnerable youth, address socioeconomic factors, and study the impact of digital devices on harassment. It also focuses on internet safety education for youth, parents, and educators.

Entities must submit annual reports on program activities, including implementation details.
