    "content": "The \"Opportunities for Success Act of 2013\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. Congress acknowledges the importance of internships for college students in gaining skills and professional connections. Many students struggle financially, with a significant portion working outside jobs that limit their ability to participate in internships due to time and financial constraints. Participating in internships can be financially challenging for students, especially those with low and middle incomes. Despite the costs, internships significantly increase job opportunities, with employers valuing relevant experience when hiring. University officials and employers recognize the importance of internships for securing meaningful employment in today's job market. The Opportunities for Success Program (SEC. 3) aims to address financial challenges for students participating in internships, especially those with low and middle incomes. Employers value relevant experience, making internships crucial for securing meaningful employment in today's job market. The Opportunities for Success Program authorizes the Secretary of Education to establish a grant program for qualifying educational institutions to support eligible students during internships. Institutions must apply for grants and use funds to provide internship awards to enrolled students. The internship awards from the grant are administered by the financial aid office and may involve the career development office. Receiving an internship award does not affect a student's financial aid eligibility. Funds for this program should supplement existing resources, not replace them. The section emphasizes that funds should supplement, not replace, other available Federal and State funds for activities. Institutions must award summer internships by June 30 preceding the internship. The Secretary determines grant amounts for educational institutions based on available funds for the fiscal year. The Secretary determines grant amounts for educational institutions based on the number of eligible students enrolled, reallocating funds if necessary. The Secretary reallocates unused grant funds to other qualifying educational institutions based on enrollment numbers, potentially awarding less than the full grant amount to institutions in the following fiscal year. The grant funds awarded to qualifying educational institutions for internships are limited to $5,000 for full-time internships and $2,500 for part-time internships. Student awards for unpaid internships are subject to these limits. The award amount for internships at qualifying educational institutions is based on the higher of the applicable Federal or State minimum wage per hour. Awards for students during summer and winter terms are also determined using this criteria. During summer and winter terms, students receiving awards for unpaid internships during nonattendance at their educational institution may receive an amount covering reasonable living expenses. The reasonable cost of living expenses for unpaid internships during nonattendance at educational institutions includes considerations of various factors. The internship details include location, length, travel costs, housing costs, and meal costs. The internship details include location, length, travel costs, housing costs, and meal costs. Whether the internship is full-time or part-time. (i) Paid internships: The award amount for a paid internship is determined by subtracting the income the student will receive from what they would get for an unpaid internship. \n(e) Awards Non-Taxable: Awards received by students under this section are not taxable income.\n(f) Carry-Back Authorized: Educational institutions can use grant funds to make internship awards before the fiscal year begins.\n(g) Reports: Reports must be submitted within one year of the enactment date. The Secretary must submit annual reports to Congress detailing the outcomes of grants for the previous academic year, including the percentage of students hired in related fields, the number and categories of educational institutions receiving grants. The annual reports to Congress must include information on the outcomes of grants, such as the number of students receiving internship funds, types of internships funded, locations of internships, and students completing internships more than 60 miles from their educational institution. The Secretary will prescribe regulations for internships funded by grants, including guidance for educational institutions. An eligible student is defined as one who is full-time or half-time and eligible for a Federal Pell Grant. The Higher Education Act of 1965 outlines eligibility criteria for students enrolled in programs leading to an associate's or bachelor's degree, including requirements for re-enrollment after accepting an internship during a period of nonattendance at a qualifying educational institution. The Higher Education Act of 1965 sets eligibility criteria for students pursuing a degree, including receiving a Federal Pell Grant, not previously receiving funds for the same degree, and having an official internship offer within the U.S. as defined by the Secretary. The internship must comply with the Fair Labor Standards Act and be either full-time or part-time, lasting between 4 weeks and the length of a standard academic period at the educational institution. The internship must be unpaid or paid based on the determination of the educational institution, lasting 10 weeks or 12 weeks if it occurs during a period of attendance at the institution. The term \"full-time\" for an internship will be defined by the Secretary in regulations. The term \"qualifying educational institution\" is defined as an institution that determines the internship to be of good quality, provides educational opportunities, and is related to the student's course of study. The term \"qualifying educational institution\" refers to an institution of higher education as defined in the Higher Education Act of 1965. The term \"part-time\" for an internship will be defined by the Secretary, and \"period of nonattendance\" means a period when a student is not enrolled at a qualifying educational institution. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Education."
