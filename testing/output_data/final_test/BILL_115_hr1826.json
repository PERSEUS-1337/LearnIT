The \"Medicaid Expansion Incentive Act of 2017\" provides a bonus for states that elect to meet ACA Medicaid expansion requirements using funds from non-participating states. This allows participating states to receive increased payments under their State plan based on the estimated reduction in federal expenditures for nonparticipating states. The \"Medicaid Expansion Incentive Act of 2017\" incentivizes states to meet ACA Medicaid expansion requirements using funds from non-participating states. States are requested to inform the Secretary annually if they will apply their State plan in accordance with the expansion requirements. The \"Medicaid Expansion Incentive Act of 2017\" requires states to meet ACA Medicaid expansion requirements annually by informing the Secretary of their participation status. The Secretary will determine participating and nonparticipating states based on the information submitted. The \"Medicaid Expansion Incentive Act of 2017\" mandates states to inform the Secretary annually about their ACA Medicaid expansion status.

Additionally, the Secretary will publish information on the estimated impact of nonparticipation for each nonparticipating State. The Secretary estimates the forgone Federal funds and additional beneficiaries if a State does not participate in the program."
