    "content": "The \"Kids Vision Care Act of 2006\" may be cited as such. Key findings are outlined in the Act. Congress finds that good vision is crucial for children's physical and educational development. Early detection of ocular conditions is key for effective treatment and can have long-lasting benefits for vision. Various methods of identification, such as vision screening or comprehensive eye exams, are necessary to identify children in need of services. Children identified should receive appropriate treatment. Children identified as needing services should have access to subsequent treatment as needed. Grants for vision care for children are addressed in Section 3. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may award grants to States for providing comprehensive eye examinations and treatment for children with vision problems, prioritizing those under 9 years old. The Secretary will develop criteria for the grant program and coordinate with other relevant programs to provide educational materials on recognizing signs of visual impairment in children. The grant program under section 330 of the Public Health Service Act, title XIX of the Social Security Act, and title XXI of the same Act, along with other Federal or State programs, provides services to children. States must submit an application to the Secretary to be eligible for the grant, including information on existing children's vision programs and a plan for fund use to complement State efforts. The grant program requires States to submit an application detailing how funds will complement existing efforts, identify eligible children, and use funds as a secondary payer. States must also agree to evaluations within a year of receiving the grant. The State must submit evaluations annually to the Secretary detailing the utilization of vision services for children, data collection, and expenditure limitations of the grant. The term \"comprehensive eye examination\" includes history, observation, examination, visual acuity, alignment, refraction, and binocular vision or visual fields. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2007 through 2011."
