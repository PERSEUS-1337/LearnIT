    "content": "The House PAYGO rule for the 116th Congress prohibits legislation affecting direct spending and revenues that would increase the deficit or reduce the surplus over a 6-year or 11-year period. Direct spending, also known as mandatory spending, includes programs like Medicare and unemployment compensation, funded through authorizing legislation without annual action. Revenues are funds collected by the government. Revenues collected by the federal government come from various sources like taxes and duties. The Committee on Ways and Means in the House oversees revenues. Discretionary spending, controlled through annual appropriations, is not subject to the House PAYGO rule. This rule aims to prevent legislation from increasing the deficit over specified time periods. The House PAYGO rule requires measures to include offsetting provisions to reduce direct spending or increase revenues by equivalent amounts. Deficit reduction from a previous measure cannot offset deficit increases from current measures, except when special rules combine measures upon engrossment. The Committee on the Budget provides estimates on the effect of legislation on the deficit or surplus. The House PAYGO rule, based on estimates by the Committee on the Budget and the CBO, requires offsetting provisions for direct spending or revenue increases. It exempts certain provisions, like emergencies, from compliance. Under House Rule XXI, legislation's impact on the deficit or surplus must exclude provisions designated as emergencies for PAYGO principles. The chair must seek House approval before considering such legislation, with a vote determining its consideration. A point of order enforces the House PAYGO rule to prevent non-compliant legislation. The House PAYGO rule enforces legislation's impact on the deficit or surplus. A point of order can be raised if a bill violates the rule, but it can be waived under certain circumstances. The rule is effective for the current Congress and was first established in the 110th Congress. The PAYGO rule was reinstated at the beginning of the 116th Congress, covering both mandatory spending and revenues with modifications. The House adopted its own PAYGO rule to enforce legislation's impact on the deficit or surplus. The House reinstated the PAYGO rule at the start of the 116th Congress to enforce legislation's impact on the deficit or surplus. The rule prohibits legislation affecting direct spending and revenues that would increase the deficit or reduce the surplus over specific periods. It includes on-budget and off-budget entities in determining the effect on the deficit and directs the Budget Committee to use specific baseline estimates from the CBO. The Budget Committee in the 111th Congress adopted the House PAYGO rule with amendments, requiring the use of CBO baseline estimates and allowing for exceptions to measure-by-measure application. The House PAYGO rule was amended in the 111th Congress to align with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, focusing on budgetary effects and scoring issues for determining deficit increases or surplus reductions. The House PAYGO rule was amended in the 111th Congress to focus on the \"on-budget deficit\" and align with the Statutory PAYGO Act. Scoring requirements were incorporated, including budgetary effects from outyear modifications of direct spending laws. Excluded were budgetary effects from timing shifts and legislation extending current policies in specific areas. At the beginning of the 112th Congress, the House replaced the PAYGO rule with the CUTGO rule, focusing on the net effect of new legislation on mandatory spending only. This rule excluded any effects on revenues and prohibited legislation increasing mandatory spending without offsetting it with an increase in revenues. The CUTGO rule, implemented in the 112th Congress, focused on the net effect of new legislation on mandatory spending only. It did not continue the adjustments for current policies provided in the Statutory PAYGO Act, which expired in 2011. The CUTGO rule retained procedures related to the operation of the previous PAYGO rule, excluding budgetary effects designated as emergency requirements. It was renewed in each subsequent Congress until the 115th Congress. The new House PAYGO rule, reinstated by the Democratic majority, incorporates projected revenue effects into violation evaluations. It includes off-budget effects like those impacting Social Security trust funds. While similar to previous rules, it allows combining budgetary effects of measures and excluding emergency effects. The House PAYGO rule, along with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, aims to prevent legislative actions increasing the on-budget deficit. The Statutory PAYGO Act focuses only on on-budget effects, excluding off-budget impacts like Social Security trust funds. The House rule is enforced during legislation consideration on the House floor, differing from statutory requirements. The House PAYGO rule prohibits legislation on the House floor that doesn't comply with the requirement. The Statutory PAYGO Act applies the requirement to legislation after enactment, ensuring that the net effect of all bills enacted during a session of Congress does not increase the deficit over a 5 or 10-year period. The House PAYGO rule enforces deficit reduction on legislation considered on the House floor, while the Statutory PAYGO Act applies the requirement to legislation after enactment, using sequestration to cancel budgetary resources to prevent deficit increases. The Statutory PAYGO rule involves actions by the President and the Office of Management and Budget to cut budgetary resources in certain direct spending programs if legislation increases the deficit. The PAYGO requirement applies to 5-year and 10-year scorecards, with a sequestration order issued if there is a positive balance, requiring cancellation of budgetary resources in non-exempt direct spending programs. The Statutory PAYGO Act requires budget cuts in direct spending programs if legislation increases the deficit. The rule applies to 5-year and 10-year scorecards, with sequestration orders issued for positive balances, leading to cancellation of budgetary resources. The House PAYGO rule must be renewed at the start of each new Congress, while the Statutory PAYGO Act has no expiration date. The evaluation of budget surplus or deficit is determined by the Committee on the Budget based on estimates provided by the Congressional Budget Office. If a separate measure is added to a bill or resolution, it will be included in the evaluation. Certain emergency provisions may be excluded from the evaluation under specific circumstances. The evaluation of budget surplus or deficit is determined by the Committee on the Budget based on estimates provided by the Congressional Budget Office. If a separate measure is added to a bill or resolution, it will be included in the evaluation. Emergency provisions may be excluded from the evaluation under specific circumstances, with terms like \"budget year\" and \"current year\" defined according to the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. The term \"direct spending\" is defined in the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, including provisions in appropriations Acts that make outyear modifications to substantive law."
