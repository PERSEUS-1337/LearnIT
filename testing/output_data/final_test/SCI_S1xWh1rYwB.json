    "content": "In this work, attribution methods are used to analyze the decision-making process of machine learning models like artificial neural networks. By adapting the information bottleneck concept, the flow of information in image regions is quantified in bits. The method outperforms ten baselines in various settings, providing an absolute frame of reference for attribution values."
