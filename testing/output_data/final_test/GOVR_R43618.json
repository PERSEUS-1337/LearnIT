    "content": "The national defense strategy of the United States is adapting to global changes, with Congress overseeing the aging C-130 tactical airlift fleet. These aircraft are crucial for achieving national goals by rapidly deploying forces for deterrence and humanitarian aid. However, the fleet faces challenges due to aging, reduced reliability, obsolescence, and changing aviation rules. The C-130 fleet, including various models like the C-130J, plays a vital role in tactical airlift operations, delivering passengers and cargo to remote areas. Recapitalization efforts are underway to replace or modernize older aircraft, with decisions on force structure and basing to be considered by Congress for the future fleet. The C-130 fleet, including models like the C-130J, supports joint commands and combatant commands in ongoing operations. Air Force C-130s may be temporarily stationed within a combatant command's area of responsibility to execute missions in support of the defense strategy, such as providing aid during crises like the super typhoon Haiyan in 2013. The U.S. military must protect the homeland, deter attacks, support civil authorities, build global security, project power, and win decisively. President Obama's guidance emphasizes maintaining a broad portfolio to ensure mission success. Maintaining the correct mix of intra- and inter-theater airlift is crucial for rapid deployment and sustaining capabilities worldwide. The U.S. military must maintain a broad portfolio of military capabilities for mission success, including tactical airlift for versatility in transitioning between missions. This involves differentiating between immediate and deferred investments, reducing costs, adjusting force size, and investing in science and technology. The report will examine factors in deciding C-130 investments today or deferred, review the acquisition strategy to reduce procurement costs, and analyze the Active Duty/Reserve Component mix for the versatile capabilities of the fleet. The report will review congressional issues related to managing an aging C-130 fleet, including the number of aircraft needed, fleet recapitalization, modernization, force structure, and the Active Duty/Reserve Component mix. The C-130 Hercules is a versatile tactical transport aircraft used by various branches of the U.S. military for a wide range of missions. The C-130 Hercules aircraft is utilized for various missions by the U.S. military, including combat delivery, evacuation, aerial spraying, and humanitarian relief. It is versatile, able to operate in hostile environments and all weather conditions. The majority of the U.S. government fleet consists of 667 aircraft, with a focus on the USAF, USN, USMC, and USCG. The USAF C-130 fleet mainly comprises C-130H and J models for combat delivery missions, with 362 aircraft assigned to this mission as of February 2014. The C-130 Hercules aircraft is used for various missions by the U.S. military, including combat delivery, evacuation, aerial spraying, and humanitarian relief. Different versions of the C-130, such as the AC-130, MC-130, HC-130, and EC-130, support special missions flown by various branches like AFSOC, ACC, and the Air National Guard. The Naval Air Systems Command manages a fleet of 94 C-130 aircraft, while the Naval Reserves fly 20 C-130T aircraft for logistics support. The active duty and Marine Corps Reserve operate 74 USMC KC-130T/J aircraft for logistic support, air-to-air refueling, and close air support. The Coast Guard manages a fleet of 28 HC-130s. The Coast Guard manages a fleet of 28 HC-130s, including six new J model aircraft. These aircraft provide long-range surveillance, search and rescue capabilities, command and control, and air-to-air refueling. They cover both the Atlantic and Pacific areas. The C-130 fleet is divided into smaller groupings within the Air Force, Navy, and Coast Guard. The Coast Guard fleet includes 28 HC-130s for surveillance, search and rescue, and air-to-air refueling. The USAF combat delivery group, which includes Air National Guard and Reserve aircraft, has received attention from Congress. The fleet is managed dynamically with aircraft entering and retiring, affecting the numbers assigned. Congress must determine the future need for C-130s to maintain desired capability. The Air Force must determine the future need for C-130s to maintain desired capability. An analyst may focus on how much capability is needed rather than specific aircraft numbers. The Total Force Proposal (TFP) submitted to Congress in November 2012 offered modifications to the FY2013 Budget, indicating desired capability through aircraft numbers. The Total Force Proposal (TFP) requested 326 intra-theater aircraft and made changes to the FY2013 Budget, including reversing the elimination of C-130 squadrons. The fleet size was increased to 358 in the FY2013 NDAA, with adjustments made to retire only one Active component C-130H squadron. The current plan is to inactivate the 53rd Airlift Squadron at Little Rock and retire their C-130Hs. The Air Force plans to inactivate the 53rd Airlift Squadron at Little Rock and retire their C-130Hs, leaving a fleet of 318 C-130s to meet defense strategic guidance requirements. This decision is based on an excess in intra-theater airlift identified in the Air Force analysis. The Air Force plans to retire excess C-130H aircraft to meet defense strategic guidance requirements. The Department of Defense conducted a Mobility Capabilities Assessment (MCA-18) to evaluate the mobility system's ability to support current and future challenges. The Mobility Capabilities Assessment found that a fleet of 358 C-130s is not needed for surge scenarios. The Air Force plans to maintain a minimum of 358 C-130 aircraft for FY2013 and FY2014, with a question for Congress on setting the future \"floor\" for combat delivery intra-theater airlift. Approximately 152 C-130s have been modified for special operations. The Air Force plans to recapitalize the fleet of AC, MC, and HC-130 special operations aircraft by purchasing 37 HC-130Js and 94 MC-130Js. Some MC-130Js will be converted to AC-130Js. The Navy Program of Record includes 104 aircraft, with plans to retire C-130T models as new KC-130J models enter service. This will create a homogenous fleet of KC-130J aircraft. The Harvest Hawk kit allows aircraft to deliver air-to-ground Hellfire missiles, precision-guided bombs, and 30mm auto-cannon rounds. Congress is debating whether to authorize these capabilities. The Coast Guard's fleet mix may change with the transfer of C-27J aircraft, potentially affecting the requirement for HC-130s. Aging C-130H models in the fleet pose a significant issue due to years of flight in austere environments and advancing technologies. The aging C-130H fleet faces obsolescence issues, fatigue on aircraft structure, and changing aviation regulations. Aircraft fleet managers must decide whether to modernize or recapitalize the fleet. Recapitalization costs for 79 C-130J aircraft are estimated at $5.8B. The cost for 79 C-130J aircraft is $5.8B, with potential cost savings over time due to increased cargo capacity, longer range, and lower maintenance costs compared to older C-130H models. Modernization over recapitalization raises questions about which components to upgrade, such as the center wing box structure and avionics capability to comply with upcoming flight rules changes. Upgrading avionics is crucial to avoid non-compliance issues in the future. The avionics upgrades for C-130H aircraft are essential to comply with future flight rules changes. The costs of upgrades vary depending on the level of enhancement, with significant overhauls likely to be more expensive. Decisions regarding the C-130 fleet are complex, with considerations for future requirements and potential obsolescence issues. Older model aircraft may need to be replaced with new ones to maintain capability. The aging C-130 fleet requires modernization to address obsolescence issues such as parts, avionics, and structural fatigue. Military planners must consider Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) when analyzing options for recapitalization or modernization. The C-130H fleet faces challenges due to outdated avionics, with 22% already obsolete according to the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center. The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center reports that 22% of the avionics in the C-130 fleet are already obsolete. The cancellation of the C-130 Avionics Modernization Program has exacerbated the issue, with 75% of avionic pieces-parts expected to be obsolete by FY2023. DMS issues also affect structural components like the C-130H outer wing box, which is no longer in production. The C-130 fleet may face restrictions in European airspace by 2017 due to lacking avionics capabilities. Concerns are raised for units near busy U.S. airports, especially Air National Guard and Reserve units. The fleet is expected to include 53 J models and 41 H models by FY2018, prompting a decision on modernization steps. The USAF combat delivery fleet is expected to have approximately 250 H models by FY2018, which may face restrictions in certain airspace due to changing avionics regulations. The C-130H Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) began in 2001 but faced funding instability and integration issues. The C-130H Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) faced a Nunn-McCurdy unit cost breach in 2007, leading to a program restructuring with fewer aircraft at a higher cost. The Air Force tried to cancel the program in 2012 due to budget concerns. Development and testing were completed with five aircraft modified and delivered, but they remain idle at Little Rock Air Force Base awaiting a decision on the program. The C-130H Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) faced cost breaches and restructuring in 2007. The Air Force considered canceling the program in 2012 due to budget concerns. The avionics systems are incompatible with current training, limiting pilot qualifications to one aircraft model. A study compared continuing the AMP program with upgrading avionics and mission planning systems. Three alternatives were considered: continuing AMP, option A with full cockpit upgrades, and option B with fewer upgrades. Option A and option B guarantee compliance with regulations for flying in the U.S. and international airspaces. They differ in navigation performance details, potentially imposing restrictions on aircraft in the future. Option B does not replace the current SCNS, which may need replacement in the future. The report estimated remaining acquisition costs for each alternative, including research, development, test, evaluation, and procurement costs. Time to field a new system is also an issue to consider, as the AMP took over 40 months to deliver the first aircraft from contract award. The AMP took over 40 months to deliver the first aircraft from contract award. The FY2014 National Defense Authorization Act prohibits the Air Force from canceling or modifying the avionics modernization program for C\u2013130 aircraft. The Comptroller General of the United States is conducting a cost-benefit analysis review. The USAF FY2015 budget submission requests to address C-130H modernization. The USAF FY2015 budget requests a reduced scope program for C-130H modernization, saving over $1 billion compared to the C-130 AMP. The Air Force plans to modernize avionics for 14 EC-130H Compass Call aircraft at Davis-Monthan AFB, with Rockwell Collins selected as the avionics provider for a CNS/ATM upgrade to meet international airspace standards by 2020. Additionally, a proposal was submitted to divest 7 EC-130H aircraft. The USAF proposed divesting 7 EC-130H aircraft in FY2016, impacting future upgrade requirements. The USN is upgrading its C-130T fleet with new avionics for compliance with aviation regulations and enhanced capabilities. BAE Systems completed the first upgrade, replacing analog gauges with digital displays, preparing for the Avionics Obsolescence Upgrade (AOU) program. Lockheed Martin is contracted for software development and hardware integration, aiming to reduce life cycle costs through modernization programs and proven technology. The USN is upgrading its C-130T fleet with new avionics to comply with future regulations. The Coast Guard is also upgrading older HC-130 aircraft with the Avionic 1 Upgrade (A1U) to meet CNS/ATM requirements. Rockwell Collins is the primary contractor for the modifications, with plans to complete up to four A1U installations on HC-130H aircraft in FY2014. The overall strategy may change with the addition of new C-27Js and continued procurement of C-130J models. The C-130J fleet is undergoing avionics upgrades in a phased approach, with Block 7.0 and 8.1 upgrades including new systems like GPS and Link 16. The USAF is combining these upgrades to better manage the fleet and avoid simultaneous modifications. Development costs are shared among several countries through a global Project Arrangement. Funding for Block 7.0 was merged with 8.1 in FY2014. The C-130J fleet is undergoing upgrades to comply with aviation regulations, including the replacement of the center wing box to extend the structural service life. The center wing on Special Operations Forces (SOF) aircraft and combat delivery fleet had historical fatigue cracking issues in the 1990s and 2000-2005. This led to strict service life limits being implemented in 2005, resulting in many aircraft being grounded or restricted. The center wing replacement modification replaces C-130H center wings with Extended Service Life (ESL) or standard center wings. The ESL wing has been the production wing on C-130Js since 2009, with 128 center wings replaced on USAF aircraft to date. Fifty center wings were replaced with ESL center wings on special mission aircraft from 1993-2000, and 77 center wings have been modified on special mission and combat delivery aircraft since 2007. The FY2015 USAF budget requested funding from Congress to continue the center wing replacement program for special mission and combat delivery aircraft. The Coast Guard has identified six aircraft for center wing box replacement, with the first completed in August 2012. The Navy plans to retire H model aircraft before needing center wing box replacements, as current estimates show at least 20 years of life remaining for all center wing boxes on Navy KC-130T and C-130T. The approximate cost per airframe for the replacement is $7 million. The approximate cost per airframe for the center wing replacement program is $7 million at Robins Air Force Base in Georgia. Current recapitalization efforts focus on the C-130J model, the newest and only version in production with advanced features. Deliveries of over 200 aircraft have been made to the U.S. Government since 1999. The USAF has delivered over 200 C-130J aircraft to the U.S. Government. The procurement strategy includes multi-year contracts, providing substantial savings and stability in requirements and funding. The C-130J aircraft has been tested and certified by the FAA and USAF. Previous procurement supports realistic pricing. Investments in DOD's theater capabilities include ongoing procurement of C-130J aircraft. Multi-year procurement has been used before, with commitments for 62 aircraft over six years. The FY2014 multi-year procurement covers FY2014 through FY2018, including 79 C-130J variant aircraft. The procurement for 79 C-130J variant aircraft from FY2014 to FY2018 costs approximately $5.8 billion. The Air Force plans to recapitalize the active duty fleet with 100 C-130Js by FY2018. The 2005 DOD Operational Requirements Document listed the requirement for combat delivery C-130Js at 155. The Operational Requirements Document (ORD) stated the need for 155 combat delivery C-130Js. The current plan falls short of this number, but there may be justification to continue procurement beyond the current 136 models. The decision to extend C-130J procurement is a significant issue for Congress. If the USAF's plans are met, there will be 136 C-130J combat delivery aircraft by FY2019. This would leave the Air National Guard with 24 J models and the Air Force Reserve with 10 J models. If procurement stops at this point, there may be interest in the capabilities of the future Guard and Reserve C-130H fleets. The Air Force plans to recapitalize the fleet of AC, MC, and HC-130 special operations aircraft by purchasing 37 HC-130Js and 94 MC-130Js, with 37 MC-130Js becoming AC-130Js. The Navy plans to replace its fleet with KC-130J aircraft, with 104 aircraft in the Program of Record. As of February 2013, 46 KC-130Js had been delivered to the USMC. The Coast Guard plans to recapitalize its fleet with HC-130J aircraft due to the aging HC-130Hs. The current program of record is for 22 HC-130Js, with six already delivered. The FY2014 NDAA may change this requirement with the transfer of 14 C-27J aircraft. In the current debate over strategy and budget limitations, opportunities may arise to analyze the force structure and determine the necessary tactical airlift for national goals. The MCA-18 analysis found a surplus of capability in the C-130 fleet, with a potential reduction of around 40 aircraft suggested by General Paul Selva. He proposed adjusting the Air Mobility Command force structure to achieve savings by changing how the fleet is operated, including potentially transferring some aircraft to the Guard. The MCA-18 report suggests adjusting the Air Force fleet size by potentially divesting or transferring aircraft to the Guard and Reserve. Considerations include maintaining the proper capabilities mix and dwell rates. The rate of aircraft retirement is a key variable in determining future force structure, with recent declines due to congressional limits. Maintaining the right mix is crucial for meeting future requirements. The Air Force may face challenges with maintaining its aging fleet due to limits on force structure. C-130 basing is a contentious issue, with over half of the states having a C-130 unit. Balancing roles and missions of units directly influences basing decisions. Force structure concerns could potentially be addressed by creating or growing associate units, but the Air Force does not seem to be moving in that direction. Unit associations aim to combine strengths and increase overall capabilities. The Air Force aims to combine unit strengths by associating component units with active duty units, enhancing overall effectiveness. This can lead to synergies in pilot training, with young pilots in active duty units and experienced pilots in Reserve component units. There are three types of unit associations: Classic associate, where a regular Air Force unit retains principal responsibility for a weapon system; Active associate, where a reserve component unit has principal responsibility for a weapon system; and Traditional associate, where active-duty and reserve units maintain separate organizational structures and chains of command. The Air Force established Active Associations between Active and Reserve units to enhance cooperation and effectiveness. This initiative, in response to the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Directive, led to the formation of associations at various bases such as Keesler AFB, Little Rock AFB, Cheyenne ANGB, and Peterson AFB. Each unit retains separate organizational structures and chains of command within the association. The USAF is proposing closure of Active Associations at Peterson and Cheyenne, drawing down units by 4 C-130H each in FY2015. Retirement of C-130H aircraft at Pope Field in FY2014 is requested, with C-130J aircraft moving to Little Rock. The active association concept in the C-130 fleet may change significantly. The rate of recapitalization of the active duty C-130H force may result in no C-130H aircraft assigned to active duty by FY2018. Pilots are currently required to qualify in either the H model or J model C-130s, not both, potentially reducing H model aircraft availability. The Air Force FY2015 budget proposal impacts Guard and Reserve basing by closing Active Associates and reducing aircraft at bases. Transition to an all C-130J fleet may affect Reserve Component training, maintenance, and manning. Congressional hearings focus on combat delivery C-130 distribution among active duty, Air National Guard, and Air Force Reserves. Operational mix is crucial for achieving military mission goals. In fleet management, the distribution of different aircraft variants among components affects overall mission support. The Air Force transitioned from C-130E to C-130H models in the 1980s-90s, mainly assigning new aircraft to Reserve units. With the introduction of C-130J, a disparity emerged between Active and Reserve fleets. The Air Force transitioned from C-130E to C-130H models in the 1980s-90s, mainly assigning new aircraft to Reserve units, leading to a disparity between the Active and Reserve fleets. Current plans may exacerbate this disparity. A 2013 Rand study suggested that in situations where capacity exceeds demand, a more cost-effective force mix favors the Reserve Component for the C-130 combat delivery fleet. The study suggests that a cost-effective force mix favors the Reserve Component when capacity exceeds demand, while a larger Active Component force is favored when demand exceeds capacity. RC units provide mission-ready aircraft at a lower cost, but AC units offer agility and responsiveness. The report recommends a sustained Active Component/Reserve Component mix for the nation. Congress faces the challenge of balancing the agility of the Active force with the capacity of the Reserve force. The challenge for Congress is balancing the agility of the Active force with the depth and cost of the Reserve Components. The USAF Mobility Capabilities Study (MCA-18) did not recommend changes to force structure but suggested adjusting the Active Component/Reserve Component mix to increase capability during long-term steady state operations. This involves increasing the ratio of active duty aircraft and flight crews. The availability of Reserve Components (RC) on short notice could become an issue, making a case for more Active Component (AC) forces. Creating more associate units where AC flight crews fly RC aircraft could increase access to RC aircraft without altering the current AC/RC mix. This would address the challenge of balancing agility and depth in the force structure. The National Commission on the Structure of the Air Force recommended increased utilization of the Air Reserve Component and integration of units to reduce redundant organizational overhead. This could lead to integrating Active and Reserve component members under one organization for C-130 units. The National Commission on the Structure of the Air Force recommended integrating Active and Reserve component members under one organization, with legal and policy revisions to positively impact this change. They suggested changes to 10 U.S.C. regarding roles and responsibilities, and recommended that the Active Component force structure should comprise at least 55% of the Total Air Force end strength. Additionally, they advised the Air Force to consider closing or warm basing some installations. The National Commission on the Structure of the Air Force recommended integrating Active and Reserve component members under one organization, with legal and policy revisions to positively impact this change. They suggested changes to 10 U.S.C. regarding roles and responsibilities, and recommended that the Active Component force structure should comprise at least 55% of the Total Air Force end strength. Additionally, they advised the Air Force to consider closing or warm basing some installations. Congress should allow DOD increased flexibility in applying budget cuts across categories, including installations. The Air Force should plan for increased reliance on the Reserve Components in its FY2016 Program Objective Memorandum. The commission recommends specific funding for operational support by the Air Reserve Component and programming for approximately 15,000 man years of operational support annually. The Air Force should integrate Air Reserve Component for operational support, monitor program execution, and eliminate redundant organizational overhead. Modernization decisions will impact manpower, with C-130J models having a crew size of three. Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company has been the primary contractor for the C-130 since 1952. The C-130J models have a crew size of three, while the C-130H models have a minimum crew of five. Modernization options like AMP can eliminate the need for navigators on C-130H models. Recapitalizing with C-130Js would also reduce the need for engineers and navigators, impacting base manning requirements. The assembly of all C-130s takes place at Air Force Plant #6 in Marietta, Georgia. The C-130 program, led by Lockheed Martin, faces challenges due to long lead times for production parts. The multi-year procurement process aims to stabilize annual deliveries and provide a predictable schedule. Over 750 part numbers have lead times exceeding 24 months, impacting production stability. Lockheed Martin is working to stabilize C-130 production at 24 aircraft per year, including US and foreign deliveries. The program has orders from 15 foreign countries, ensuring a steady production schedule. The C-130 fleet has been crucial for US national objectives, and Congress must oversee funding to maintain capabilities for the aging fleet. The C-130 fleet is crucial for US national objectives, and Congress must oversee funding to maintain capabilities for the aging fleet. The decision for Congress is whether to continue C-130 recapitalization beyond the current Multi-Year Procurement (MYP) program. The current request falls short of replacing all combat delivery aircraft, potentially leading to obsolescence issues for the USAF. Lockheed Martin aims to produce 24 aircraft per year, but historical data suggests a higher production rate. This could result in approximately 15 aircraft delivered to the U.S. government annually. If the production rate of 24 aircraft per year is maintained, approximately 80 H models will remain in the fleet by 2028. The aging C-130H fleet faces obsolescence issues and compliance challenges with aviation regulations. The AMP was proposed as a solution to these issues. The AMP was planned to address obsolescence in the C-130H fleet before being cancelled by the USAF. Congress faces the challenge of sustaining the fleet's future capability. An IDA study analyzed the cost of modernization options, suggesting that AMP may not be the most cost-effective program. However, addressing the future obsolescence of the avionics suite in C-130H aircraft remains a priority. Individual waivers may be requested for retiring aircraft by 2025, but a large number of aircraft will still require modernization to maintain capability. The issue for Congress is how to develop the way forward in regards to C-130 avionics modernization. If the AMP is cancelled and avionics modernization is a priority, another program may need to take its place. Perhaps a scaled-down version of the AMP program or an entirely new program with an emphasis on timely upgrades to essential equipment could be considered. The USAF has been recapitalizing the C-130 fleet with Lockheed Martin as the primary contractor, driven by technical and programmatic risk assessments. The future of tactical airlift may change with technological advances, leading to potential new requirements and alternatives. The next generation tactical airlifter (C-X) could offer expanded capabilities, impacting how the military views tactical airlift. Each USAF flying unit is authorized a Primary Assigned Aircraft (PAA) number, with aircraft above this number classified as Backup Aircraft Inventory (BAI). The BAI aircraft are available to fly but do not receive resources. The FY2013 NDAA directed an inter-theater airlift \"floor\" of 358 C-130 aircraft, with approximately 27 C-130Hs and six C-130Js classified as BAI. The Air Force intends to maintain the fleet at 358 through FY2014, but 33 aircraft are currently without allocated resources. There may be an opportunity to retire BAI aircraft without severely impacting unit missions as early as FY2015, although this could lead to a loss of capacity at bases. The USAF is requesting modifications as part of the FY2015 Budget Request. The USAF is requesting modifications in the FY2015 Budget Request to retire or replace the C-130H fleet with C-130J aircraft, creating two separate combat delivery fleets. This raises concerns about aircrew training, maintenance, and operations, as well as potential impacts on Reserve Component recruitment. Congress faces the challenge of maintaining desired capabilities within a shrinking DOD budget. The USAF FY2015 force structure proposals may reduce fleet size to match requirements, impacting Reserve Component units. The C-130 combat delivery fleet, especially in the Reserve Component, is a significant debate in Congress. Adjustments due to budget constraints may lead to debates on maintaining the operational mix and aging fleet recapitalization. The recently approved multi-year procurement sets the framework for future recapitalization, but production levels may still be a concern. The fleet may need significant funding for modernization efforts to remain relevant in future environments. Modernization should be approached with an informed opinion and viewed in the context of future force structure requirements. Legislative Activity FY2014 National Defense Authorization Act allows for multi-year procurement of C-130J aircraft for the Air Force and Navy. The FY2014 National Defense Authorization Act allows for multi-year procurement of C-130J aircraft for the Air Force and Navy, with conditions for out-year contract payments and a prohibition on canceling or modifying the avionics modernization program for C-130 aircraft. The Comptroller General of the United States will submit a review of the cost-benefit analysis for aircraft upgrades under the National Defense Authorization Act. The Secretary of the Air Force will consider upgrades to C-130H aircraft as part of the tactical airlift fleet recapitalization. The Secretary of the Air Force will ensure upgrades to the C-130H aircraft fleet are proportional to the number of aircraft in the force structure, in line with fuel efficiency goals. This includes retention of upgraded aircraft in the tactical airlift fleet. The Secretary of the Air Force will maintain a total aircraft inventory of strategic airlift aircraft of at least 275 aircraft, as per the National Defense Authorization Act. This includes modifying the certification requirement from 316 to 275 strategic airlift aircraft. Additionally, a study will be conducted to assess mobility requirements and capabilities. A study will be conducted to assess end-to-end mobility requirements for the National Military Strategy, including air mobility, sealift, surface movements, and infrastructure capabilities to meet operational risks. An analysis will be conducted on various factors such as aircraft usage rates, aircrew ratios, and infrastructure requirements to support deployment and distribution. This includes identifying operational risks and considering the availability of commercial airlift and sealift capabilities. An assessment will be conducted on metrics from recent operational availability and joint forcible entry operations assessments, evaluating requirements and capabilities for various military operations. This includes analyzing alternative modes and sources of strategic and theater lift, forward basing, seabasing, prepositioning, air-refueling capability, logistics concepts, and destination theater austerity. The study will identify mobility capability gaps, shortfalls, overlaps, or excesses, assess associated risks, recommend mitigation strategies, and explore alternative mobility capabilities to address traditional, non-traditional, irregular, catastrophic, and disruptive challenges. Key assumptions made in the study will be articulated regarding risk, programmed forces, infrastructure, readiness, manning, and spares. The curr_chunk discusses factors such as risk, programmed forces, infrastructure, readiness, manning, spares, scenario guidance, concurrency of operations, global presence strategy, host nation support, and use of weapons of mass destruction. It also includes a description of logistics operations and assumptions for supporting deployed and combat forces. The Director of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff must submit a report to the congressional defense committees regarding a study on avionics systems for C-130 aircraft. The report must be in unclassified form but may include a classified annex. The Secretary of the Air Force is restricted from canceling or modifying the avionics modernization program for C-130 aircraft until a cost-benefit analysis is submitted to the committees. The Secretary must wait 90 days after submitting a cost-benefit analysis to Congress before taking action on an alternative program for C-130 aircraft to meet international standards or replace the current avionics modernization program. The analysis compares upgrading the legacy C-130 airlift fleet using the C-130 avionics modernization program or a reduced scope program. It considers life-cycle costs, supporting non-upgraded C-130 aircraft, and potential upgrades for mission effectiveness. SEC. 1059 imposes limitations on retiring fixed-wing intra-theater airlift aircraft for general support and time. During fiscal year 2013, the Secretary of the Air Force must retain an additional 32 fixed-wing intra-theater airlift aircraft beyond the proposed number. In March 2014, the USAF submitted a budget request for 13 C-130Js, while in February 2014, Rolls-Royce Corp. received a contract for depot level repair of 50 KC-130 aircraft engines. Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Co. received a $12.2 million contract modification to provide spare parts for U.S. SOCOM's HC/MC-130Js. The work will be performed in Marietta, GA and is expected to be completed by February 16, 2016. The contract was not competitively procured and all funds were committed immediately. Lockheed Martin and Rolls-Royce have a long-term agreement worth up to $1 billion to deliver approximately 600 AE2100 turboprop engines for American and international contracts from 2014 through 2018. The USAF flew a fully-converted AC-130J gunship for the first time in January 2014. A $105.3 million contract modification was made for the USAF's C-130J Long Term Sustainment Program, with work to be performed in Marietta, GA. Lockheed Martin in Marietta, GA received an $11,060,628 firm-fixed-price contract. Rolls Royce in Indianapolis, IN received a $182.7 million contract modification for AE2100-D3 engine logistics support. Lockheed Martin in Marietta, GA received an $11,060,628 contract for logistics and engineering services in support of the C/KC-130J Aircraft for the U.S. Marine Corps/Marine Corps Reserve, U.S. Coast Guard, and the Kuwait Air Force.
