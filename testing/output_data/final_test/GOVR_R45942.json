    "content": "Amtrak, created in 1971, took over intercity passenger service from private railroad companies. It operates as a private company with the President appointing its Board of Directors. The U.S. Department of Transportation is its primary stockholder. Amtrak serves over 500 stations in 46 states and the District of Columbia, running 300 trains daily on a 22,000-mile network. Services are grouped into three business lines since 2008. Amtrak operates three main service categories: the Washington-New York-Boston Northeast Corridor, short-distance corridors under 750 miles with state support, and long-distance trains serving destinations over 750 miles apart. These routes were combined into the National Network under the FAST Act of 2015. Amtrak's Thruway network provides bus feeder services for trips originating or terminating in cities off the rail system. In 2018, over 31 million trips were taken on Amtrak, with ridership consistently exceeding 30 million trips annually since 2011. The company has seen a 26% increase in ridership over the last 15 years, driven largely by growth in state-supported short-distance corridors. State-supported routes accounted for 48% of Amtrak trips in 2018, with growth attributed to new routes and daily trains. Despite record ridership levels, trains are consistently full, but Amtrak passengers make up a small fraction of intercity travel. In 2017, Amtrak generated 6.5 billion passenger-miles, while domestic air travel generated more. Amtrak passenger-miles have increased since 2004, surpassing domestic air travel in percentage growth from 2008 to 2015. However, passenger-miles have declined slightly since 2013, indicating more shorter trips. Amtrak serves a larger proportion of intercity trips in the NEC market compared to airlines, but both lag behind highway travel due to equipment and track capacity limitations. Amtrak's expenses exceed revenues each year, with a net loss of $868 million in FY2018 covered by federal grants. Revenues covered 79% of expenses, the highest ratio in 15 years. Amtrak has reduced reliance on federal subsidies but still had net losses of roughly $900 million in FY2017 and FY2018. The reason for the improvement in Amtrak's financial performance is a doubling of revenue from commuter railroads using the NEC post-2016, due to higher payments required by PRIIA and enforceable by the STB. Annual operating losses have been reduced to under $250 million in the past five fiscal years, a significant decrease from pre-2007 levels. This improvement is even more pronounced when adjusted for inflation, with the adjusted operating result showing a fourfold decrease from 2007 to 2018. Amtrak's financial performance has improved significantly, with operating losses reduced to under $250 million in the past five fiscal years. This improvement is attributed to higher revenue from commuter railroads using the NEC post-2016, driven by PRIIA requirements. The adjusted operating result has shown a fourfold decrease from 2007 to 2018, reflecting a more accurate measure of federal operating support needs. Additionally, Amtrak has been able to recover at least 96% of operating costs annually since 2014, with a passenger load factor of 51%. Amtrak's current load factor is 51%, near the record in FY1988. Load factor varies by business line, with NEC and Long Distance trains at 58% and 57% in FY2018, while state-supported routes lag at 40%. Improving load factor can boost revenue without increasing costs, but uneven passenger traffic distribution can make this challenging. Stations with high originating and terminating traffic may have low load factors in some segments but higher in peak segments. Accommodating passengers on sold-out routes can impact load factor. Amtrak's funding requests are made annually to cover operating and capital expenses, with Congress addressing the subsidy in the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act. The grant is divided into operating and capital grants, with the former covering annual cash loss and the latter for asset depreciation and debt repayments. Amtrak's funding structure was changed by Congress in the FAST Act, dividing appropriations between the NEC and National Network. This was done to increase transparency and eliminate cross-subsidization. Operating profits from the NEC will be reinvested in that corridor, while revenue from the National Network will be used for that account. Amtrak's reliance on annual appropriations has made it challenging to fund long-term capital. Amtrak's funding structure was changed by Congress in the FAST Act to increase transparency and eliminate cross-subsidization. Operating profits from the NEC will be reinvested in that corridor, while revenue from the National Network will be used for that account. The lack of long-term funding has significantly affected Amtrak's ability to maintain safe and reliable infrastructure and equipment. Amtrak's FY2020 budget request suggests a multiyear appropriation to provide additional stability without fundamentally altering the mechanism by which Amtrak receives federal funding. There have been proposals to create a trust fund for Amtrak to provide greater financial stability and support long-term projects. Amtrak faces challenges in securing long-term funding for capital projects, with objections from some Members of Congress. Identifying a revenue source for an Amtrak trust fund is a practical challenge, as the Highway Trust Fund is not authorized for intercity rail services. Funding a passenger rail trust fund solely from a tax on passengers could increase ticket prices and potentially reduce ridership. Amtrak struggles to secure funding for capital projects due to a $28.1 billion backlog on the NEC. Private investors may not be willing to fund in exchange for operating profits, as obstacles mirror those faced by Amtrak. Revenue growth is limited without major capital improvements, such as a new tunnel under the Hudson River. Amtrak's challenges with securing funding for capital projects on the NEC, including a new tunnel under the Hudson River, persist despite proposals for private entities to operate the corridor. The FAST Act required proposals for high-speed rail systems on designated corridors, but none were submitted for the NEC. Plans to create a separate entity to own or operate the NEC have been proposed but not fully adopted. The Amtrak Reform Council recommended restructuring the national rail system in 2002, but these recommendations have not been fully implemented. The Amtrak Reform Council endorsed organizing NEC infrastructure assets under a separate government corporation to manage rail operations and capital improvements, suggesting continued federal funding and a dedicated funding source within the region served by the NEC. The NEC may benefit from a regional funding source to reduce dependence on federal resources. Interstate agreement needed for funding allocation. Debate over the necessity of long-distance trains due to high operating subsidies. Amtrak defends accounting practices for route profitability. Amtrak defends its accounting practices for route profitability, emphasizing the cost differences between long-distance and regional trains. They propose focusing on shorter corridors supported by states instead of maintaining all 15 long-distance routes. Amtrak faces pressure to balance its role as a national passenger railroad with the need to reduce operating costs. Amtrak operates a national passenger railroad system with long-distance routes over 750 miles. The Trump Administration proposed reducing funding for long-distance routes in FY2020, leading to potential route discontinuations. The Trump Administration proposed reducing funding for long-distance routes in FY2020, potentially leading to route discontinuations. Amtrak requested a $550 million appropriation for a new grant program to offset the reduction and gradually ramp up state contributions over five years. Amtrak also expressed support for modernizing the National Network with enhanced federal funding. Amtrak's request for federal funding to maintain long-distance routes is crucial for efficient passenger service. Without federal support, routes could be at risk of discontinuation if states do not contribute to operating costs. Supporters highlight the high load factor on long-distance trains, indicating efficient use of passenger space, but the efficiency of engines and engineers may vary depending on train length. The Chicago-Indianapolis Hoosier State route, created in 1980, faced discontinuation in 2019 due to lack of state funding. PRIIA Section 209 required Indiana to cover operating losses, leading to political support decline. After a private company withdrew from operating the route, Indiana declined further funding, resulting in the route's discontinuation on June 30, 2019. In 2019, Indiana declined further funding for the Chicago-Indianapolis Hoosier State route. PRIIA Section 210 required Amtrak to create improvement plans for its long-distance routes, focusing on the 5 worst-performing routes. Some routes have shown improvement in Customer Satisfaction Index, on-time performance, and cost recovery rates, but the impact of the improvement plans is unclear. Freight train interference is a significant factor in poor performance. The on-time performance of Amtrak routes is affected by freight train interference. Amtrak is supposed to have preference over other railroad traffic on tracks it does not own, but enforcing this has been challenging. PRIIA directed FRA, Amtrak, and STB to develop on-time performance standards, which were suspended in 2012 but can now be reformulated. Amtrak, FRA, and STB can create new on-time performance standards. Amtrak CEO suggested completion in under 90 days. DOJ can enforce Amtrak's track preference but has rarely done so. Amtrak seeks statutory power to sue host railroads. States could receive funding to buy tracks from freight railroads, as Michigan has done. Michigan used federal grant funds to purchase a 135-mile rail corridor from Kalamazoo to Dearborn to improve Amtrak's on-time performance on the Chicago-Detroit route. After repairs and construction, on-time performance increased from 53% to nearly 70% in FY2016. North Carolina also supports passenger trains between Raleigh and Charlotte on tracks owned by the North Carolina Railroad. The North Carolina Railroad owns tracks between Raleigh and Charlotte, leasing them to Norfolk Southern for increased passenger service. The state-supported Piedmont service has improved on-time performance, exceeding standards in five of the past seven years. Public ownership of rail infrastructure can benefit passenger trains by prioritizing them over freight traffic. The affected freight railroads may demand protection for their services in public-sector purchases of busy freight lines. Congressional efforts to encourage competition in passenger rail service have been hindered by freight railroads' statutory obligation to carry passenger trains only for Amtrak. States with state-supported routes have contracted with Amtrak as the operator, potentially requiring legislation for other operators to compete equally. Amtrak has provided food and beverages since its inception in 1971. Amtrak, operating since 1971, is required by law to ensure that revenues from food and beverage services cover the costs. This includes expenses for items and commissary operations but excludes labor costs of employees providing onboard service. Amtrak has made efforts to reduce costs for food and beverage service, including outsourcing activities and discontinuing traditional dining car service on some routes. A House proposal suggested contracting out onboard service, but acknowledged potential losses. The FAST Act requires Amtrak to develop a plan to eliminate food and beverage service losses within five years, without affecting employee jobs. Amtrak can eliminate food and beverage service losses through ticket revenue allocation. Positive train control (PTC) is a safety system to prevent train collisions and derailments. The Railway Safety Improvement Act of 2008 requires all passenger train tracks to have PTC by December 31, 2020. Amtrak has implemented PTC on most of its tracks, but full compliance requires interoperability with other railroads. Only two commuter railroads have achieved full PTC operation and interoperability. Amtrak must achieve full interoperability with host railroads to meet the PTC mandate deadline, or face suspension of rail service or financial penalties."
