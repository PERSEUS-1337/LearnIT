The map and legal description have the same effect as if included in the Act, with the Secretary able to correct errors. The boundaries of the Targhee National Forest were adjusted in 1991 and are considered to be the boundaries of the Forest as of January 1, 1965. SEC. 3. CLARK FORK LAND EXCHANGE. The University of Idaho has utilized the Clark Fork Ranger Station as the Clark Fork Field Campus, making substantial improvements. In a land exchange, the Secretary will convey all right, title, and interest to the State of Idaho for public and administrative access. The United States will convey Parcel A, approximately 35.27 acres of the Clark Fork Ranger Station, to Idaho. In exchange, Idaho will convey Parcel B to the Secretary. Parcel B, approximately 40 acres, is defined as depicted on the map entitled \"Clark Fork Land Exchange--Parcel B\" dated July 1, 1991. Maps and legal descriptions of the lands will be available for public inspection. Technical corrections can be made to the maps and legal descriptions. Land valuation is also addressed. Upon acquisition of Parcel B by the United States, the boundaries of the Kaniksu National Forest will be adjusted to include Parcel B. If lands exchanged between the United States and Idaho are not of equal value, they will be equalized according to the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. The value of improvements made by the University of Idaho on Parcel A will be excluded from the valuation. The boundaries of the Kaniksu National Forest will be adjusted to include Parcel B, as per the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965."
