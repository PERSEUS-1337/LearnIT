    "content": "Throughout U.S. history, Congress has utilized advisory commissions to aid in policy development, especially in crisis situations like the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks and the 2008 financial crisis. These commissions offer expertise, examine complex policy issues, and provide bipartisan credibility. Considering the response to the coronavirus pandemic, establishing congressional advisory commissions could help evaluate pandemic-related policy issues effectively. Past commissions have evaluated policy responses, gathered diverse experts, and offered valuable recommendations. This report compares five proposed congressional advisory commissions for investigating various aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The commissions are outlined in H.R. 6429, H.R. 6431, H.R. 6440, H.R. 6455, and H.R. 6548, sponsored by different representatives. The COVID-19 Commission Act (H.R. 6455) and the National Commission on the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States Act (H.R. 6548) propose temporary advisory commissions to report findings, conclusions, and recommendations. Each commission has unique elements in membership, appointment structure, and reporting timeline. The proposed COVID-19 commissions focus on duties, powers, staffing, and funding. Membership structure considerations include size, qualifications, compensation, and partisan balance. Previous congressional commissions had varying sizes, with the median being 12 members. The membership structure of the proposed commissions is similar to past advisory entities created by Congress. The proposed COVID-19 commissions created by Congress would consist of 10 or 25 members with specific expertise in public health and administration. The legislation emphasizes the need for commissioners to be prominent U.S. citizens and nationally recognized experts in relevant fields. The proposed COVID-19 commissions created by Congress would consist of 10 or 25 members with expertise in public health and administration. H.R. 6429, H.R. 6431, H.R. 6440, and H.R. 6548 prohibit the appointment of government employees. H.R. 6455 would prohibit federal employees from being commission members. Congressional commissions like the 9/11 Commission have compensated members for their service and travel expenses. The five proposals suggest compensating commission members at a rate not exceeding the daily equivalent of level IV of the Executive Schedule. Members of proposed commissions would receive travel expenses and a per diem, with limits on the number of members from the same political party. H.R. 6455 allows up to 13 out of 25 members from the same party, while H.R. 6429, H.R. 6431, H.R. 6440, and H.R. 6548 allow up to 5 out of 10 members. Past advisory entities by Congress typically do not have formal partisan restrictions, achieving balance through appointment structures. Past advisory commissions usually achieve partisan balance through the appointment structure, which can involve equal appointments from congressional leaders of each party. Various appointment structures are used, considering factors like partisan balance, filling vacancies, and the timeline for appointments. The statutory scheme may designate commission members directly, have selected leaders appoint members with party balance, or have leaders recommend candidates for appointment. These recommendations can be made to other congressional leaders. The commission proposals delegate appointment authority to congressional leaders, with some allowing for presidential appointments. H.R. 6455 has its members appointed by designated House and Senate committee chairs, without any executive branch appointments. The balance between appointments by congressional leaders and other individuals is a key consideration. The appointment scheme for commissions, including the involvement of congressional leaders and other individuals, can impact the commission's ability to fulfill its duties and produce a diverse final work product. The lack of technical expertise or diversity in appointees may hinder the commission's effectiveness. The proposed COVID-19 commissions do not specify if Members of Congress can serve on the panel. COVID-19 commissions determine if Members of Congress can serve, typically structured to be bipartisan for credibility and acceptance of recommendations. Bipartisanship can hinder or facilitate a commission's ability to address divisive issues effectively. The appointment of an equal number of majority and minority commissioners in COVID-19 commissions may promote partisanship, leading to deadlock. Different proposals suggest various structures for appointments, with some including equal representation from both parties and others involving appointments by committee chairs and ranking members. Five proposals have been made for the appointment of commissioners to a COVID-19 commission, with specific deadlines outlined in three bills. H.R. 6429 and H.R. 6548 suggest appointments between specific dates in January or February 2021, while H.R. 6440 requires appointments by December 15, 2020, and H.R. 6455 mandates appointments within 45 days after enactment. The commission's work is expected to begin in early 2021 according to H.R. 6429, H.R. 6440, and H.R. 6548. The appointment deadlines for the COVID-19 commission proposed in H.R. 6429, H.R. 6440, and H.R. 6548 range from October 31, 2020, to early 2021. H.R. 6431 does not specify a deadline for appointments, which can vary from weeks to months based on past commissions. The COVID-19 commission proposals lack detailed procedures for conducting business, with no direction on adopting rules of procedure. Each bill specifies the selection of a chair and/or vice chair, with variations in appointment methods. H.R. 6455 proposes the chair and vice chair of the commission to be chosen by a majority vote of the commission members, with a requirement for them to have significant experience in relevant areas. The bill also sets a timeline for the commission's first meeting to take place within 45 days after all members are appointed, effectively within 90 days of enactment. H.R. 6548, H.R. 6431, H.R. 6440, H.R. 6429, and H.R. 6455 propose commission meetings to be held within specific timelines, with quorum requirements set at 6 or 18 members. All bills mandate public access to meetings and reports. Advisory entities vary in adopting rules of procedure, with three models: formal written rules, informal rules, and reliance on norms. Factors influencing the choice include entity size, meeting frequency, member preferences, collegiality, and statutory guidance. Regardless of the approach, decision-making protocols on operational issues like voting eligibility and staff hiring are crucial for advisory entities to consider. The curr_chunk discusses the structural and operational requirements for federal advisory bodies, including the exemption of certain proposals from the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA). It highlights the lack of specification regarding written rules in COVID-19 commission proposals. The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of a commission in H.R. 6440 within the legislative branch, with a majority of members appointed by Congress. The commission's duties involve investigating aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic and submitting reports to Congress and the President. H.R. 6440 establishes a commission in the legislative branch to investigate the COVID-19 pandemic and provide reports with findings and recommendations. The commission must avoid duplicating work done by other entities and can submit interim reports with majority approval. H.R. 6429, H.R. 6431, H.R. 6440, and H.R. 6548 require reports on pandemic actions and essential resources, with approval by a majority of commission members. H.R. 6455 does not specify a voting threshold. Minority viewpoints may be included at the commission's discretion. Past advisory bodies have varied rules for report adoption, but simple-majority rules are common. H.R. 6429, H.R. 6431, H.R. 6440, and H.R. 6548 require final reports within specific timeframes, with the possibility of extensions. The deadlines range from one year to October 15, 2021, with provisions for extensions up to three times. This approach aims to provide a defined period for report completion but may pose unintended time constraints. The length of time a congressional commission has to complete its work is crucial, as any delay in legislation or appointments could impact the quality of work or timely production of expert advice. A short deadline may also affect the process of setting up a new commission. The expedited action may be required for staff, office space, and logistical matters to meet short deadlines. Four proposed commissions must submit reports to Congress and the President, while one requires the report to be made public. Most congressional advisory commissions must submit reports to Congress and sometimes the President or an executive agency head. Congressional commissions usually have termination dates linked to specific timeframes or report submissions. The five commission proposals would each terminate within a specific period after submitting their final report, with termination timelines ranging from 60 to 90 days. The proposed commissions would have powers to carry out their missions, with the issue of who can execute these powers being a general concern. Some commissions decide internally on rules and procedures, while others may delegate discretionary power to subcommittees or individuals. The proposed commissions would have powers to hold hearings, take testimony, receive evidence, administer oaths to witnesses, and issue subpoenas. Subpoena power varies among the bills, with some requiring agreement of the chair and vice chair or an affirmative vote of commission members. The five bills under consideration would provide subpoena power to the commission with similar judicial methods of enforcement. They also outline administrative support from the General Services Administration (GSA) and reimbursement for their services. Federal agencies are directed to provide information upon request. The proposed bills would allow the commission to use the U.S. mails, enter into contracts, and accept gifts or donations. COVID-19 commissions typically have staffing provisions for hiring staff, including a lead staffer, additional personnel as needed, consultants, and intermittent services. The bills authorize the commission to hire staff, consultants, and request federal agency personnel. Staff salaries would be limited to level V of the executive schedule, and federal employees could be detailed to the commission. Four bills propose allowing federal employees to be detailed to the commission without reimbursement to their home agency, while H.R. 6440 would allow detailees on a reimbursable basis. All bills grant the commission authority to hire experts and consultants, with four bills limiting consultant pay to level IV of the Executive Schedule. Cooperation from federal agencies and departments for security clearances is required by four bills, while H.R. 6440 lacks this provision. Funding mechanisms are specified in four of the five proposals to ensure the commission can meet its statutory goals. The funding mechanisms for congressional commissions vary, with factors like staff hiring costs, consultant contracts, and travel expenses contributing to overall costs. Commissions can last from months to years, with budgets ranging from hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars annually. It is challenging to estimate the total cost of a commission due to various factors influencing expenses. Expenses for advisory entities depend on factors like staff numbers, commission duration, and scope. Some commissions have few staff, while others, like the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, have nearly 80 full-time paid staff. Other factors affecting costs include the number of commissioners, meeting frequency, travel, and publications. Bills like H.R. 6429, H.R. 6440, and H.R. 6548 would authorize necessary funds for commissions, sourced equally from the Senate's contingent fund and House accounts. H.R. 6429, H.R. 6548, and H.R. 6455 propose funding for a commission until its termination. H.R. 6455 authorizes $4 million for the commission. H.R. 6431 does not specify funding. Table 1 compares key provisions of the five proposals, including membership, duties, powers, staffing, and funding."
