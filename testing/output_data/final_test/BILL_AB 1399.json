Article 2 adds Section 18711 to Chapter 3 of Part 10.2 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, establishing the California Domestic Violence Victims Fund. Individuals can voluntarily contribute to this fund on their tax returns in full dollar amounts. Individuals can designate contributions on their tax returns to specific accounts or funds listed. If the total amount designated exceeds the available funds, the contribution will be allocated among the designees on a pro rata basis. Designations made on the original return are irrevocable, and if the total liability is not met, the return will be treated as if no designation was made. If no designee is specified, the contribution will be transferred to the General Fund after covering the Franchise Tax Board's collection and administration costs. The Franchise Tax Board will update the tax return form to include a section for the \"California Domestic Violence Victims Fund\" contribution. The contribution can be one dollar or more and will support services for domestic violence victims. A deduction is allowed for contributions made. Contributions will only be added if space is available or another designation is removed.
