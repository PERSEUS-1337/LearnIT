    "content": "Since the 1970s, Saudi individuals, government ministries, charitable committees, and international Islamic charity organizations have provided financial and relief assistance to Muslims globally, including those affected by conflicts. These efforts have also funded religious education and proselytization programs in numerous Muslim-majority and minority countries, with some activities potentially supporting terrorism or armed violence. In 2007, the U.S. Department of State highlighted concerns about Saudi donors and unregulated funding. The U.S. Department of State reported in 2007 that Saudi donors and charities have financed extremist and terrorist groups for the past 25 years. Critics accuse the Saudi government of supporting terrorism and creating a permissive environment for funding terrorists. The 9/11 Commission found no evidence of direct Saudi government funding for Al Qaeda, but highlighted concerns about Saudi Arabia's role in terrorism. The report highlights Saudi Arabia's role in funding terrorism, with individuals and charities linked to Al Qaeda. The Bush Administration acknowledges Saudi efforts to combat terrorist financing but raises concerns about funding diversion. Treasury official Stuart Levey commends Saudi actions against Al Qaeda within the kingdom but questions their vigilance in preventing funds from leaving. Saudi Arabia is a major source of funding for Sunni terror groups and the Taliban. The report discusses allegations of Saudi involvement in terrorist financing, their efforts to counter it, and implications for U.S. counterterrorism policy. After 9/11, Saudi Arabia and prominent citizens faced accusations of supporting international terrorist groups. The allegations fault the Saudi government for failing to act decisively to close down channels of financial support, with some critics accusing Saudi officials of responsibility for the September 11 attacks. Despite some progress in combating terrorist financing, concerns remain about wealthy donors in Saudi Arabia funding violent extremists globally. The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States found no evidence of direct Saudi government involvement in the attacks. The United States Commission found no evidence of direct Saudi government funding for Al Qaeda, but noted that individuals and charities in Saudi Arabia may have provided support. Bin Laden used the \"Golden Chain\" network of Saudi and Gulf individuals to fund Al Qaeda through charities and NGOs. The Commission's report highlighted how Saudi individuals and financiers associated with the Golden Chain supported bin Laden and Al Qaeda, enabling them to establish a base in Afghanistan. The report credited the Saudi government for assisting U.S. officials in interviewing members of the bin Laden family, which was crucial in understanding bin Laden's personal role. The U.S. learned from Saudi government assistance that bin Laden lost his share of family wealth in the 1990s, leading Al Qaeda to rely on financial facilitators in the Persian Gulf, particularly in Saudi Arabia. Saudi actions post-2003 bombings in Riyadh reduced funds for Al Qaeda. An independent task force criticized Saudi financial support for terrorist groups. The report highlighted Saudi Arabia as a significant source of funds for Al Qaeda, with Saudi officials turning a blind eye to the issue. The connection between Saudi donors and Al Qaeda was deemed logical due to Saudi Arabia's wealth concentration, previous funding for mujahideen, high percentage of Al Qaeda members being Saudi nationals, and Al Qaeda's focus on issues of interest to disenchanted Saudis. The report accused Saudi Arabia of being a source and transit country for terrorist financing, prompting a strong denial from the Saudi government. A Treasury Department spokesperson criticized the report for not highlighting new initiatives to combat terrorist financing. In response, a second report in June 2004 detailed the steps taken by the Saudi government to strengthen its financial, legal, and regulatory systems in combating terrorist financing since late 2002. The report praised Saudi Arabia for enacting new laws and regulations to combat terrorist financing, stating that they had taken more decisive action than many other Muslim states. However, it also identified areas where more could be done due to the significant role individuals and organizations in Saudi Arabia have played in financing militant Islamist groups globally. The report questioned Saudi Arabia's commitment to implementing new terrorist financing laws due to a lack of publicly available enforcement information. Saudi authorities claimed to have prosecuted individuals for terror financing but were criticized for not punishing charity leaders funneling money to militant groups. Adel Al Jubeir criticized the report as politically motivated. Treasury Department spokesperson agreed that Saudi Arabia should take further steps to combat terrorism. In mid-August 2002, families of 600 September 11 victims sued Saudi royal family members and others for $1 trillion, alleging they financed the attacks. Judge ruled two defendants had foreign sovereign immunity. Families of victims in terrorist attacks filed civil lawsuits against Arab Bank PLC seeking $2 billion in damages. The complaints allege the Saudi Committee for the Support of the Al Quds Intifada used Arab Bank accounts to fund terrorist entities in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The Saudi Committee used Arab Bank accounts to provide financial support to families of suicide bombers and others affected by violence in Palestine, totaling over $90 million. The funds were used for various purposes such as supporting unemployed Palestinians, hospital expenses, and infrastructure development. Bishara denies allegations of Arab Bank's involvement in promoting Palestinian suicide terrorism, stating they had no prior knowledge of payments to families of suicide bombers. In response to lawsuits, a Saudi Committee official claimed they were unaware some recipients were relatives of bombers. The Committee has previously supported families of Palestinian martyrs without differentiation. In February 2005, the U.S. OCC ordered Arab Bank PLC's New York branch to halt banking activities due to control deficiencies. A $24 million fine was imposed in August 2005 for compliance issues. Lawsuits against the bank proceeded to trial, allowing Israelis and foreign nationals to pursue claims in U.S. court. In response to court rulings allowing Israelis and foreign nationals to pursue claims under the Alien Tort Claims Act, Arab Bank expressed confidence in prevailing at trial and condemned terrorism. Legislation was introduced to hold Arab Bank accountable, including releasing information, blocking property, and revoking its banking charter. The declassification of a report in 2003 highlighted alleged Saudi support for terrorism, with a chapter on foreign support for the 9/11 hijackers heavily redacted. The Administration refused to release a crucial chapter on foreign support for the 9/11 hijackers due to national security concerns. Speculation suggests the redacted pages may implicate Saudi involvement in the attacks. The Saudi foreign minister requested the release of the censored pages to refute suspicions, but President Bush declined citing ongoing investigations. French investigator Jean-Charles Brisard's report alleged prominent Saudi nationals' financing of international terrorism. French investigator Jean-Charles Brisard's report alleged that prominent Saudi nationals financed international terrorist organizations, including Al Qaeda, with amounts ranging from $300 million to $500 million by exploiting charitable donations and the Saudi regulatory vacuum. The report faced a lawsuit in the UK for defamation, with a court ruling in July 2004 that the allegations were \"untrue.\" Since 2004, U.S. officials and sources have accused private individuals and organizations in Saudi Arabia of financially supporting insurgent operations in Iraq. Insurgent recruiters prefer Saudi young men who personally finance operations. A U.S. Treasury official stated Saudis may be a significant source of financing for the Iraq insurgency. The Iraq Study Group report mentioned funding for the Sunni insurgency coming from private individuals in Saudi Arabia and Gulf States. Iraqi officials urge neighboring countries to restrict financial networks operating within their borders. Saudi authorities have acknowledged that citizens have supported insurgents in Iraq, taking action against suspected financiers. The Saudi government administers aid programs in Iraq through the Saudi Committee for the Relief of the Iraqi People and the Saudi Red Crescent Society. Prince Nayef bin Abd Al Aziz oversees the Committee's operations, with a government bank account established for donations. Numerous shipments of food aid and medical supplies are sent to Iraq. The Committee and the Red Crescent Society have delivered food aid and medical supplies to Iraq, including Fallujah in 2004. Saudi charities like the IIRO have also provided aid to Iraq, with concerns raised about their operations. Saudi support for Palestinian causes is a key aspect of their foreign policy. Saudi Arabia strongly supports Palestinian causes, viewing it as a religious, cultural, and political obligation. Allegations of Saudi support for Palestinian terrorist groups exist, but no conclusive evidence has linked official Saudi government support to these organizations. Hamas reportedly fundraises in Saudi Arabia. The country recognizes the PLO as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people and has provided significant aid, totaling $2.61 billion in 2002. Current government support to Palestinian causes is around $80 million to $100 million. Government support for Palestinian causes, approximately $80 million to $100 million per year, is directed solely to the Palestinian Authority established under the first Oslo Accord. Saudi Arabia promised $20 million in immediate aid to the Palestinian Authority after Hamas won the majority in the 2006 elections. Prince Saud al Faisal emphasized that humanitarian assistance is for the people, not the government. Saudi Arabia made efforts to support a Palestinian unity government before the 2007 intra-Palestinian violence. Saudi Arabia pledged between $500 and $750 million to the Palestinian Authority over three years in December 2007. Two official charitable committees in Saudi Arabia provided aid to Palestinian institutions and individuals after the second Palestinian intifada in October 2000. Prince Salman bin Abd Al Aziz established the Popular Committee, which gave approximately $8.8 million to the PLO from October 2000 to April 2003. The Saudi Committee for the Support of the Al Quds Intifada also assisted Palestinian causes. The Saudi Committee for the Support of the Al Quds Intifada provided significant financial aid to the Palestinian territories from October 2000 to April 2003, totaling over $194 million by December 2003. The Al Quds Intifada Committee provided financial aid, food, medicine, and housing to Palestinians during the uprising. Palestinian officials praised the Committee's support. In June 2004, the Saudi government announced monitoring of all Saudi charitable committees sending aid abroad. The Saudi Nongovernmental National Commission for Relief and Charity Work Abroad will monitor and direct aid abroad, including the Palestinian committees. The National Commission was not operational as of June 2008. The Al Quds Intifada Committee operates independently as the Saudi Committee for the Relief of the Palestinian People, providing humanitarian relief and assistance through partnerships with U.N. agencies. The Al Quds Intifada Committee in Saudi Arabia has organized fundraising efforts to support Palestinian causes, including a telethon sponsored by King Fahd that raised over $110 million. The proceeds were funneled through non-governmental organizations to provide humanitarian support to needy Palestinian families. Unified accounts were established in Saudi banks to consolidate funds from public and private donations for Palestinian causes. Saudi officials have assured the U.S. that Account 98 no longer exists, despite reports urging donations to the account. Funds collected by the Al Quds Intifada Committee were delivered to Palestinians through various means, including material aid like food and clothing. The Al Quds Intifada Committee, in collaboration with organizations like the Jordanian Red Crescent Society and UNRWA, provided aid such as food, clothing, and financial assistance to Palestinians. Lists of beneficiaries were prepared based on information from welfare societies and official sources, including the wounded, families of martyrs, prisoners, disabled persons, and those affected by the uprising. The Al Quds Intifada Committee, in collaboration with organizations like the Jordanian Red Crescent Society and UNRWA, provided aid to Palestinians affected by the uprising. A \"central committee\" verified beneficiary information and opened bank accounts for them to receive financial assistance. The Saudi Committee for the Support of the Al Quds Intifada allocated funds for families of martyrs and prisoners. Israeli officials accused the committee of transferring money to families of Palestinians involved in violent events, but Saudi officials denied the allegations, stating they do not support terrorism. Saudi Arabia denies providing financial support to suicide bombers or their families, with Saudi officials questioning the claim that Palestinian suicide attacks are financially motivated. The Al Quds Intifada Committee's support for families of suicide bombers and terrorism has been inconsistent, with the Saudi government ruling out any quid pro quo arrangement. The Committee's website once contained transaction records of individuals receiving humanitarian aid and financial support. The Al Quds Intifada Committee provided humanitarian aid and financial support to Palestinian families who lost their primary breadwinners in violent circumstances. The program included fixed donations transferred to the families through Arab Bank branches. Payments of 20,000 SR were given to the families of deceased individuals. The Committee's website contained records of recipients, transaction numbers, dates of death, hometowns, and circumstances of their deaths. The Al Quds Intifada Committee provided financial support to Palestinian families who lost breadwinners in violent circumstances. Over 60 names in the records matched or resembled those of Palestinian militants involved in attacks from 2000 to 2002. The Committee's website contained records of recipients, including details of their deaths. The Committee removed all records from its website in 2005. Since the early 1990s, there have been reports of Saudi assistance to Hamas, designated as a terrorist organization by the US government. While Saudi Arabia has not officially labeled Hamas as a terrorist group, private benefactors in Saudi Arabia and other Arab states have been cited as primary sources of funding for Hamas according to State Department reports. The 2007 report highlighted that Hamas fundraising occurs in Gulf countries, particularly in Saudi Arabia. Wealthy Saudis donate a significant portion of their income to charitable causes, with estimates of $3-4 billion annually, of which 10-20% is sent abroad. Saudi charities are now restricted from sending funds overseas to combat potential terrorist financing activities. The Saudi government has implemented measures to oversee charitable giving in response to concerns about terrorist financing. The High Commission for Oversight of Charities was established in 2002 to assist charities in reforming operations. Additionally, the Saudi Nongovernmental Commission on Relief and Charity was created in 2004 by royal decree. The Saudi Nongovernmental Commission on Relief and Charity Work Abroad was established by royal decree to oversee charitable donations for international distribution. All future overseas charitable contributions were mandated to go through the Commission by the Council of Ministers. However, as of June 2008, the Commission was not operational, pending a decision from the Saudi royal court. New banking regulations in May 2003 prohibited private charities from sending funds overseas until measures were in place to prevent funding going to terrorist organizations. The new banking regulations in Saudi Arabia do not restrict \"multilateral\" charitable organizations like the Muslim World League, International Islamic Relief Organization, and World Assembly of Muslim Youth from raising funds. However, officials are concerned about these charities and believe they should be included in oversight. In late-2004, the Saudi government dissolved the Al Haramain Islamic Foundation due to sustained criticism. The Al Haramain Islamic Foundation, a large charity with royal family links, faced criticism and joint U.S.-Saudi actions over alleged terrorist financing. U.S. investigators tied a former employee to the 1998 embassy bombing in Tanzania. The U.S. and Saudi Arabia designated 12 Al Haramain branches as front organizations for terrorism. They requested the U.N. to add these branches to the list of terrorists linked to Al Qaeda and the Taliban. The Committee's consolidated list of terrorists linked to Al Qaeda and the Taliban includes individuals associated with Al Haramain's U.S. branch in Oregon. Charges were dropped against the branch, but prosecutors are pursuing charges against its founders and corporate officers, including Suliman Al Buthe, a designated terrorist financier. Al Haramain's founder, Aqeel Abdulaziz Al Aqil, was designated as a terrorism supporter in 2004 and stepped down from his position. The organization's international operations were to be absorbed by a new Nongovernmental entity. The Treasury Department designated the Philippine and Indonesian branches of IIRO, along with the Saudi executive director of the IIRO's branch in the kingdom's Eastern Province, Abd al Hamid Sulaiman al Mujil, for supporting Islamic militant groups and providing donor funds directly to Al Qaeda. Saudi authorities have not prosecuted Al Mujil, claiming to work closely with the United States to combat terrorism. After the September 11 attacks, the Saudi Government announced implementation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1373 to freeze terrorist-related funds. Saudi Arabia has taken steps to combat terrorist financing, including legislation, regulations, and cooperation with the United States. Despite past frustrations, Saudi officials have shown increased seriousness in addressing the terrorist threat and its financing. The increased Saudi concern over terrorist financing was attributed to the Al Qaeda terrorist campaign in the kingdom from 2003 to 2006. A joint U.S.-Saudi intelligence task force was established after the May 2003 attacks in Riyadh, leading to a more permanent bilateral group with a broader mission. Senior U.S. counter-terrorism officials met with Saudi leaders in August 2003 to urge more action to cut off terrorist funding. U.S. officials met with Saudi leaders to address terrorist financing through Saudi businesses. A joint task force was set up to investigate and focus on bank accounts and financial data. FBI and IRS agents provided training on terrorism financing to Saudi officials. This marked the first time U.S. law enforcement officials were stationed in Saudi Arabia for intelligence and financing issues. In March 2005, Saudi Ministry of Interior officials reported that U.S.-Saudi Joint Task Force on Terrorist Financing operations had investigated 1,098 Saudi bank accounts for terrorism financing since September 11, 2001. Saudi Arabia enacted laws criminalizing money laundering and terrorist financing after Al Qaeda attacks in May 2003. New banking regulations were introduced to prevent funds from being channeled to terrorist organizations. New financial regulations in Saudi Arabia require charitable organizations to have single disbursement bank accounts and approved officials with signatory authority to control charity accounts and transactions. The Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) is the chief regulatory body for banks and financial institutions, implementing oversight mechanisms such as banning cash collections at mosques and regulating the insurance sector and capital markets. Unlicensed money exchange houses were closed, and supervision was increased on traditional money transfer mechanisms like the hawala system. Religious authorities now vet clerics and supervise money given by congregations. The Saudi government has implemented stricter regulations on financial oversight for charitable organizations and religious clerics, including suspending over 1,000 clerics for negligence in financial accounting. Measures include restricting donations, conducting official financial audits for domestic charities, and establishing a Permanent Committee on Combating the Financing of Terrorism. The SA-FIU, designated as Saudi Arabia's financial intelligence unit, began operations in September 2005. The U.S. Treasury Department officials and FinCEN support the SA-FIU's membership in the Egmont Group. Saudi Arabia's legal and regulatory system was found to be compliant with most of the FATF 40+8 Recommendations on terrorist financing in the FATF 2004 annual report. The FATF report found that Saudi Arabia's legal definition of terrorist financing does not meet international standards. Saudi Arabia joined MENAFATF in 2004 to implement anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing standards. The State Department's 2007 report noted little money laundering in Saudi Arabia related to traditional crimes. The Saudi government has taken enforcement actions since 2003. Since 2003, the Saudi government has taken enforcement actions in response to international concerns about terrorist financing, including freezing suspect accounts and designating individuals and organizations as Specially Designated Global Terrorists. Security forces seized $4.5 million through raids on terrorist safe houses and operatives, along with $6.5 million in bank accounts. Saudi security forces have also killed Al Qaeda financiers, aiding in the arrest of 16 individuals with U.S. cooperation. Saudi Arabia has cooperated with the United States to arrest 16 terrorism financiers. The Saudi government has implemented significant administrative reforms to combat terrorist financing, with new regulations on charities being praised. However, there are concerns about the effectiveness of these measures and delays in taking action against organizations involved in terrorist financing. The Saudi government has improved cooperation with the U.S. on combating terrorist financing, but there are concerns about delays in taking action against terrorist financiers. U.S. officials urge Saudi Arabia to hold individuals accountable for financing terrorism and to crack down on those who support such activities. The 9/11 Commission terrorist financing monograph highlighted Saudi Arabia's failure to punish high-profile donors involved in terrorist financing. Some suspects have had their assets frozen and travel restricted within Saudi Arabia, but many individuals believed to be involved in terrorist financing have not faced charges in any jurisdiction. The U.S. State Department and Treasury Department have called on Saudi Arabia to hold elites accountable for money laundering and terrorist financing offenses. Saudi authorities face challenges in prosecuting alleged terrorist financiers due to limited evidence availability and information classification. Despite stricter financial customer information requirements for international transfers, loopholes may still exist. The FATF report urges Saudi officials to enhance information requirements for foreign currency conversion transactions at money remittance centers. Saudi customs have implemented a declaration system for currency and precious items at border crossings since 2006 for amounts under $16,000. The use of cash couriers is a primary mechanism for transferring insurgency funds into Iraq, with U.S. Treasury Department officials urging Iraq's neighbors to prevent large cash transfers to insurgent organizations. There are concerns about cash being ferried from Saudi Arabia into Iraq, as some insurgent groups prefer Saudi recruits who bring personal funding in cash. Saudi Arabia has heightened efforts to counter terrorism financing since mid-2003 due to security challenges and terrorist incidents. In mid-2003, terrorists targeted Saudi government and western presence in Saudi Arabia with attacks on residential and office compounds. Saudi authorities have implemented measures to stem funds for terrorist groups, but effectiveness depends on enforcement. US officials approve of Saudi policy changes but are disappointed with enforcement, especially lack of public prosecutions for terrorism financing. Committees in the 108th and 109th Congresses have shown interest in these issues. In the 108th and 109th Congresses, there was interest in U.S.-Saudi cooperation in fighting terrorism. Legislation was introduced, including a provision in the FY2005 Omnibus Appropriations Bill that required Saudi Arabia to cooperate in combating terrorism to receive aid from the U.S. The President waived this requirement in 2005 and provided $200,000 in terrorism financing assistance to Saudi authorities. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act mandated the President to submit a strategy for collaboration with Saudi Arabia to Congress within 180 days. In the 110th Congress, a strategy for collaboration with Saudi Arabia on combating terrorist financing was required by the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act. The report submitted in January 2008 did not outline a future strategy but reviewed Saudi actions to improve counter-terrorist financing. The 110th Congress required a strategy for collaboration with Saudi Arabia on combating terrorist financing. The report submitted in January 2008 reviewed Saudi actions to improve their counter-terrorist financing measures. Members of Congress may seek to support executive branch efforts to encourage implementation of new Saudi laws and regulations, while intelligence considerations may limit public discussion on terrorist financing threats and responses. Domestic political considerations and information security requirements may also limit the Saudi government's willingness to enforce existing regulations."
