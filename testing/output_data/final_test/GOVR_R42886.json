It oversees the transfer of radio frequencies from federal to commercial use, with proceeds going to the U.S. Treasury. In 2013, the NTIA focused on supporting the innovation economy. In 2013, the NTIA focused on promoting broadband infrastructure, advocating a multi-stakeholder approach to Internet policymaking, and supporting the push for more spectrum for wireless technologies as part of President Obama's Wireless Initiative. The NTIA is tasked with identifying spectrum for commercial wireless use to add 500 MHz for wireless broadband. The NTIA is releasing 500 MHz of spectrum for wireless broadband and administering grants programs like BTOP. A $135 million grant program is being initiated to help states plan for a nationwide public safety broadband network. FirstNet, funded through the Public Safety Trust Fund, is established to support the deployment of the new network. FirstNet, funded by Congress, has access to $2 billion from the U.S. Treasury and expects $5 billion from the Public Safety Trust Fund. The NTIA's budget request for FY2014 was $52.1 million, with $45.1 million provided for FY2013. Funding for the Public Telecommunications Facilities Program was transferred to administrative expenses and salaries in FY2011. The NTIA's budget for FY2014 included $24.7 million for broadband grant program oversight, with funding also coming from spectrum management fees from federal agencies. Reimbursable funding for FY2014 was estimated at $37.5 million, with spectrum management fees projected to be $28.9 million. The FY2014 budget request includes $7.5 million and staff increases of eight FTEs for a new program to develop a spectrum monitoring system and assess technologies for sharing radio frequency spectrum. Pilot projects over two years in ten major metropolitan areas are planned. Funding of $1.25 million and five FTEs are requested for the Office of Spectrum Management for Wireless Broadband Access. Staffing increases for some programs are offset by a reduction of four FTEs for administering broadband programs. The NTIA's FY2014 budget request includes staff increases for a new spectrum monitoring program and pilot projects in major metropolitan areas. The agency collaborates with the FCC and Department of State on spectrum management and international negotiations. They also participate in developing Internet policy. The NTIA collaborates with NIST, FCC, and DHS to provide expertise and guidance for grant recipients using BTOP funds to build new wireless networks. The Office of Spectrum Management administers NTIA's policies and programs to ensure effective spectrum use nationally and internationally. The Office of Spectrum Management (OSM) addresses federal government spectrum requirements, including public safety operations and federal government satellite networks. It also handles frequency assignment needs and provides spectrum certification for new federal agency radio communication systems. The Office of Policy Analysis and Development (OPAD) supports NTIA's role as adviser on telecommunications policies. The Office of International Affairs (OIA) develops policies to enhance U.S. companies' global competitiveness in ICT sectors. The Office of International Affairs (OIA) in the ICT sectors collaborates with U.S. agencies and the private sector to promote open ICT markets. The Institute for Telecommunication Sciences (ITS) supports NTIA in advancing telecommunications infrastructure and radio spectrum use. The Office of Telecommunications and Information Applications (OTIA) administers grant programs for technology deployment and national priorities. OTIA previously managed the Public Telecommunications Facilities Program until its termination in FY2011. The Public Telecommunications Facilities Program (PTFP) was terminated by Congress in FY2011. It supported new construction for public broadcasting stations and other organizations. The Office of Public Safety Communications, created by the NTIA in 2012, administers provisions of the Spectrum Act. Salaries and expenses are organized into four sub-activities for budget purposes. Grant funding for PTFP was terminated in FY2011, with $20 million in funding received in FY2010 for broadcast and non-broadcast projects. The Public Broadcasting Service received grant funds to replace equipment, expand services to underserved communities, and convert to digital broadcasting. These grants supported the maintenance of the Emergency Alert system and initiatives for Wireless Emergency Alerts. Public television and radio stations play a crucial role in providing emergency alerts and information to communities. Legislative actions have also been taken to provide more spectrum for commercial services. The Spectrum Act, part of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, gives NTIA responsibilities to support FirstNet in building a nationwide broadband network for public safety communications. NTIA manages the Public Safety Trust Fund and oversees the State and Local Implementation Fund grant process through the Office of Public Safety Communications. FirstNet operates autonomously with broad powers. FirstNet is an autonomous organization with broad powers to carry out its mandate, including selecting program managers and agents in a fair manner. The NTIA, while a supporting agency, has possibly overstepped its role by setting its own requirements for FirstNet. Current funding practices may hinder long-term investments, such as establishing regional outreach centers. The act establishes regional centers for state outreach programs and re-establishes the federal 9-1-1 Implementation Coordination Office (ICO) to plan for next-generation systems (NG 9-1-1) and administer a grant program. ICO will provide matching grants for improvements in 911 emergency services from a $115 million grant program, funded after $27.635 billion of auction revenue is used for other purposes. NTIA will ensure cost analysis and technical assessments for NG 9-1-1 services. The NTIA is responsible for managing auction revenues for the Public Safety Trust Fund and the Network Construction Fund. The funds are used for construction, maintenance, and related expenses for the nationwide network. The FY2014 budget estimates $1.908 billion in the Trust Fund, with $257 million designated for the Network Construction Fund. The NTIA also facilitates payments to states participating in network deployment. The NTIA established a State and Local Implementation Fund for grants to support planning, consultation, data collection, education, and outreach activities related to broadband communications for public safety. Expenditures from the fund were $300,000 in FY2012 and estimated at $124,958,000 for FY2013. Grants totaling over $116 million were awarded to 54 states and territories in FY2013, including projects under the BTOP program. Funding to these projects was partly suspended after the Spectrum Act passage for coordination with FirstNet. The Spectrum Act assigned FirstNet the national license for public safety broadband, requiring separate lease agreements for spectrum access. The NTIA and FCC collaborate to identify bands for commercial use, addressing spectrum reallocation and compensation for reassignment. Four BTOP grant recipients have reached leasing agreements, enabling them to receive their grants. The Spectrum Act requires the NTIA to prioritize exclusive, non-federal spectrum allocation through competitive bidding. It also mandates the establishment of a Technical Panel to review federal agencies' transition plans. The Panel must consist of three members with radio engineering expertise appointed by key officials. The NTIA has published details on technical panel and procedural requirements related to the Spectrum Act. Steps have been taken to increase radio frequency spectrum for mobile services like Internet access. Policy proposals include clearing federal spectrum for commercial use, sharing frequencies, improving spectrum efficiency, and utilizing emerging technologies for network management. The NTIA supports the Administration's policy. The NTIA supports the Administration's goal of increasing spectrum capacity for mobile broadband by 500 MHz. A 10-year plan has been developed to identify bands of spectrum available for commercial wireless broadband service, including recommendations to make 15 MHz available between 1695 MHz and 1710 MHz, and 100 MHz available between 3550 MHz and 3650 MHz. Additionally, two 20 MHz bands within 4200-4400 MHz are being studied for possible repurposing. The World Radio Conference (WRC-2015) is a key forum for negotiating international treaties on spectrum use. The Interdepartmental Radio Access Committee (IRAC) makes decisions on federal spectrum use, with members from the U.S. military and federal agencies. The Commerce Spectrum Advisory Committee (CSMAC) advises the NTIA on spectrum policy, while the Office of Management and Budget influences agency spectrum management through budget planning. The NTIA studied federal spectrum use by over 20 agencies through the PPSG. The NTIA studied federal spectrum use by over 20 agencies with 3,100 frequency assignments in the 1755-1850 MHz band, estimating an $18 billion cost to clear federal users. Recommendations included sharing frequencies between federal and commercial users, with some frequencies earmarked for auction. The GAO testified on undeveloped spectrum sharing technology and policies at a House Committee hearing. The GAO identified options to encourage spectrum sharing, such as spectrum usage fees, more unlicensed spectrum, technology development, and regulatory process improvements. Further study by the NTIA and FCC was deemed necessary. The Department of Defense offered to release frequencies in the 1755-1780 MHz band for cost control, retaining access to other bands for relocation. The DOD estimated that relocating users in the 1755-1850 MHz band would cost $12 billion if fully cleared, but only $3.5 billion if shared. The NTIA endorsed the DOD proposal for releasing frequencies in this band, but their cost estimates were challenged in a congressional hearing. The GAO presented preliminary findings on this issue before the Senate Committee on Armed Services. The GAO presented preliminary findings on DOD estimates of reallocation costs for radio frequencies at 1755 MHz-1850 MHz. The GAO noted variable assumptions for costs and revenues, such as spectrum characteristics and market demand. The NTIA leads interagency efforts on Internet policy and collaborates with international organizations. The NTIA, along with other government agencies, plays a key role in Internet policy and the coordination of the Domain Name System (DNS). It leads efforts on mobile application transparency and supports a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure the Internet's long-term viability for innovation and economic growth. The Institute for Telecommunication Sciences in Boulder, CO, conducts research and engineering for the NTIA to promote competition, technology deployment, and foreign trade opportunities. The NTIA's principal activities for FY2014 include evaluating options for repurposing federal spectrum for commercial wireless broadband use, overseeing FirstNet, leading the formation of domestic and international Internet policies, and monitoring broadband grants awarded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The agency's role as a liaison may lead to overlapping responsibilities and duplication of effort across departments and agencies, while rapid advances in communications technology have changed its mission in areas such as spectrum policy. The NTIA's mission has been impacted by advancements in communications technology, particularly in spectrum policy. The 113th Congress may need to consider transferring some shared obligations to partners to allow the NTIA to focus on key communications policies for economic growth. Oversight may include evaluating the agency's spectrum management activities and compliance with the Spectrum Act."
