    "content": "Authorization of additional appropriations for fiscal year 2000 for disaster relief for victims of Hurricane Floyd. Hurricane Dennis caused extensive damage in North Carolina in 1999, bringing 20 inches of rain, wiping out highways, and flooding homes and businesses. Hurricane Floyd also posed a threat to the southeastern seaboard, leading to a large evacuation in several states. Hurricane Floyd made landfall at Cape Fear River on September 16, 1999, causing record flooding in North Carolina and moving up the eastern seaboard, resulting in flooding and tornadoes in several states. The storm led to 54 known deaths, with the majority in North Carolina. Hurricane Floyd caused devastation in several states, with significant impacts on farmers and fishermen. North Carolina alone suffered agricultural losses estimated at $1.3 billion, as it is a major producer of various crops and livestock. The total commodities sold in North Carolina last year exceeded $7 billion, while Virginia generated $2.4 billion in cash receipts. The death toll is expected to rise as flood waters recede. Hurricane Floyd caused devastation in North Carolina, with over 100,000 hogs drowned and 3,000,000 poultry killed by flooding. 120,000,000 gallons of hog waste spilled into the environment, polluting rivers and groundwater. Millions of animals are at risk of starvation. Significant crop losses are expected, including 80% of the cotton crop, 75-80% of the soybean crop, and potential complete loss of the sweet potato crop. The aftermath of Hurricane Floyd in North Carolina includes complete loss of the sweet potato crop, destruction of seed crops and farming equipment, overwhelming debris cleanup, potential soil contamination, and fishermen losing their boats. $3 billion is authorized for agricultural disaster relief in fiscal year 2000. Disaster relief for agricultural producers affected by Hurricane Floyd includes assistance through various programs such as the flooded land reserve program, Wetlands Reserve Program, Environmental Quality Incentives Program, and Emergency Conservation Program. The Emergency Conservation Program, rural housing insurance fund, low-income housing repair grants program, and other disaster relief programs are authorized for funding. The Department of Commerce is allocated $50,000,000 for emergency disaster assistance in fiscal year 2000. In addition to existing disaster relief programs, $250,000,000 is authorized for FEMA in fiscal year 2000 for emergency expenses related to Hurricane Floyd. This funding is separate from allocations for the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Commerce. The appropriation of funds for emergency expenses related to Hurricane Floyd in fiscal year 2000 shall be designated as emergency spending and made available on an emergency basis."
