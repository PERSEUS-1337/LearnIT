    "content": "The report discusses disputes in the World Trade Organization (WTO) between the United States and the European Union (EU), including issues of non-compliance and potential retaliation against U.S. exports. The 108th Congress faces challenges with U.S.-EU disputes where U.S. laws violate world trade obligations, with the EU considering retaliatory measures. The United States faced disputes with the European Union in the World Trade Organization, including issues with the Antidumping Act of 1916, copyright violations, and trademark disputes. The EU has not complied with a case regarding beef hormone directives, leading to retaliatory tariffs. Legislation in Congress has been introduced to address WTO decisions, with ongoing discussions in the 108th Congress on compliance legislation. The World Trade Organization (WTO) serves as a forum for international trade negotiations and dispute settlement. The US and EU, major WTO members, have introduced legislation to address trade disputes, including the repeal of the 1916 Antidumping Act and trademark provisions. Recent actions include funds for music licensing settlement and compliance measures for countervailing duty methodology. Cooperation between the US and EU is crucial for global trade liberalization efforts. Efforts to liberalize world trade have been hindered by trade disputes between the US and EU, affecting their ability to lead the global economy. Disputes over beef hormones, bananas, and export tax benefits have led to non-compliance with WTO rulings, making it challenging to complete the current WTO Doha Development Round. The WTO dispute settlement system is crucial for maintaining security and predictability in the multilateral trading system. Non-compliance with WTO rulings weakens credibility and authority of the multilateral trading system, raising questions about the value of new trade agreements and enforcement mechanisms. Understanding the underlying causes of non-compliance can reveal limitations in the dispute process. Settlement of trade disputes in the predecessor organization to the WTO was based on a blend of diplomatic and legal approaches. The WTO's Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) leans towards a judicial model, with U.S. negotiators pushing for this approach during the GATT Uruguay Round. The DSU, effective since January 1, 1995, enhances the rigor and automation of the dispute resolution system compared to the old GATT system. The DSU, effective since January 1, 1995, enhances the rigor and automation of the dispute resolution system compared to the old GATT system. Panels are established and reports adopted unless there is a consensus against it. Deadlines are set for each stage of the dispute process, and the process is administered by the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB). Members must determine if invoking DSU procedures would be fruitful. The DSU procedures aim to secure a positive solution to a dispute, with the preferred outcome being a mutually acceptable solution. Compensation and retaliation are last resort measures, with compliance being the primary objective. Compliance panels may be established to determine if actions fulfill WTO obligations. The WTO dispute process involves consultations, panel establishment, and potential retaliatory measures if compliance is not achieved within a reasonable time frame. Members are discouraged from unilateral actions and must resolve disputes using DSU procedures. The WTO dispute process includes unsuccessful consultations leading to the establishment of a Dispute Panel. The panel is composed of 3 persons, with panelists proposed by the Secretariat and appointed by the WTO Director if no agreement is reached. The panel issues a descriptive report to the disputing parties, followed by findings and conclusions in an interim report. The WTO dispute process involves the establishment of a Dispute Panel composed of 3 persons. The panel issues an interim report to the disputing parties within 6 months, which must be adopted within 60 days at a DSB meeting. If there is an appeal, the Appellate Body must issue a report within 60 days (extendable to 90 days) that is adopted by the DSB unless decided otherwise by consensus. The WTO dispute process involves the establishment of a Dispute Panel composed of 3 persons. The panel issues an interim report within 6 months, to be adopted within 60 days at a DSB meeting. The period from panel establishment to DSB adoption of the report should not exceed 9 months (12 months if appealed) unless otherwise agreed. After adoption, the Member must inform the DSB of implementation plans within 30 days, with a reasonable period granted if immediate compliance is impracticable. The Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) outlines the process for resolving disputes in the WTO. If there is disagreement on compliance, a panel may be convened to resolve the issue within 90 days. The compliance period should not exceed 15 months from the date of adoption, with a possible extension to 18 months in exceptional circumstances. Compliance Panels have 90 days to issue a report, which can be appealed. The compliance panel has 90 days to issue its report, which may then be appealed. If the defending party fails to comply with WTO recommendations, negotiations for compensation must be entered into within 20 days. If negotiations fail, the prevailing party may request authorization for retaliation from the DSB. Arbitration on the level of retaliation can be requested by the defending Member. Between 1995 and 2002, the United States and the EU filed 51 complaints against each other under the Dispute Settlement Understanding. The cases were evenly split between the two parties. The EU consistently filed cases each year, while the US peaked in 1998 and has since decreased to one case per year. The United States and the EU have filed complaints against each other annually, with the US peaking in 1998 and decreasing to one case per year. The EU has pursued a greater number of cases through the full panel process. Out of 26 complaints filed by the US against the EU, 13 are still in the consultative stage. The United States and the EU have filed complaints against each other annually, with the US peaking in 1998 and decreasing to one case per year. The EU has pursued a greater number of cases through the full panel process. Out of 26 complaints filed by the US against the EU, 13 are still in the consultative stage. The cases allege various violations including Safeguards Agreement and GATT violations, failure to protect trademarks and geographic indications, subsidies related to Airbus, export subsidies, and EU export subsidies on processed cheese. Seven complaints filed by the United States were settled either through consultations or before a panel had begun its work. The United States achieved satisfactory solutions in cases involving customs duties on rice and grain, as well as intellectual property issues. Out of the five cases taken through the full panel process, the US won two (beef hormones and bananas) and lost three (customs classification of computer equipment). The EU eventually complied with the successful challenge to the banana import regime after a delay. The US requested authorization to impose sanctions on the EU for non-compliance. The United States requested authorization to impose sanctions on EU products under Article 22 of the DSU for non-compliance. The WTO authorized the US to suspend $191.4 million in trade concessions, leading to 100% ad valorem duties on EU products. After compliance by the EU, the increased duties were suspended in July 2001. The case also raised concerns about DSU requirements and U.S. domestic procedures under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. The United States imposed sanctions on EU products for non-compliance in the beef hormone case, leading to 100% ad valorem duties on certain items. The EU's provisional steel safeguards are also under dispute, with a panel established in September 2002. In September 2002, the EU filed complaints against the United States, with seven cases remaining in consultations. These disputes involve antidumping and countervailing duties on steel products from France, Germany, and Italy, as well as issues with Section 301 carousel retaliation provision, Section 337 of the Tariff Act, U.S. harbor maintenance tax, and an import ban on poultry products. The EU filed complaints against the United States in September 2002, involving antidumping and countervailing duties on steel products from France, Germany, and Italy, as well as issues with U.S. harbor maintenance tax, an import ban on poultry products, and antidumping measures on solid urea from the former German Democratic Republic. Five disputes were settled through consultations or allowed panels to lapse, including cases on U.S. rules of origin for textiles and pre-WTO retaliatory measures against the EC beef hormone directive. Two remaining cases challenged U.S. measures for foreign policy reasons, including the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act and a Massachusetts state law imposing procurement sanctions. The EU filed complaints against the United States in September 2002, involving various trade disputes. Thirteen out of 25 cases have been pursued by the EU through panels or are currently pending. The disputes included challenges to Section 301 and U.S. actions in the banana case, with mixed results. The EU prevailed in nine cases, while some disputes were settled through consultations or allowed to lapse. The Supreme Court eventually held that a Massachusetts state law imposing procurement sanctions on firms doing business in Burma was preempted by federal law. The EU filed complaints against the United States in various trade disputes. The United States has complied in two cases and taken action in others. Two cases are at the panel stage, one involving steel safeguards and the other on line pipe and wire rod safeguards. The United States has not fully complied in seven cases, including one involving the Extraterritorial Income Exclusion Act. The United States has not fully complied in seven trade disputes with the EU. These disputes involve tax statutes, intellectual property issues, and trade remedies such as antidumping and countervailing duties. The United States has not fully complied with seven trade disputes with the EU, including issues related to tax statutes, intellectual property, and trade remedies like antidumping and countervailing duties. Compliance deadlines have passed in three cases, with the Administration calling for repeal of the ETI statute and considering legislative proposals for reform. Legislation has been introduced to address these disputes, including bills to repeal the Antidumping Act of 1916 and trademark provisions related to the U.S. trade embargo with Cuba. In a music licensing case, disputing parties agreed to arbitration under Article 25 of the DSU for trade injury determination, resulting in a $1.1 million annual arbitral award. Congress established a judgment fund in the Trade Act of 2002 for WTO awards but has not yet appropriated funds. In P.L. 108-11, Congress allocated $3.3 million for a one-time payment to the European Communities to cover three years of trade injury. Compliance is ongoing in recent cases. The United States is complying with rulings in recent cases challenging CVD orders on EU steel products. A proposed revision of privatization methodology has been issued by the Commerce Department. The compliance deadline for the US-EU dispute is November 8, 2003. Disputes involving beef hormones and the ETI Act export subsidy are testing the implementation articles of the DSU. These cases involve tax policy and national regulation, particularly in social and health matters. The beef hormone dispute between the US and EU dates back to 1989 when the EU banned hormone-treated beef. The US challenged the ban in 1996, arguing it violated the SPS Agreement by lacking scientific evidence. This dispute raises questions about the WTO's role in resolving domestic policy issues. The EU ban on hormone-treated beef was challenged by the US, claiming it lacked scientific evidence and was a disguised trade barrier. WTO panels sided with the US, giving the EU time to comply. The EU argued that scientific reports did not prove the safety of hormone-treated beef and that protection levels were a value judgment. Food safety concerns, including \"mad cow disease\" and foot-and-mouth disease, made Europeans more risk-averse. The US imposed 100% tariffs on EU exports in retaliation. The United States has filed a complaint in the WTO against the EU for restrictions on GMO products, including a moratorium on approval and import bans. The US argues that these measures are not scientifically-based and impact agricultural exports. Members of Congress are calling for dispute settlement. The United States filed a WTO complaint against the EU for GMO restrictions, with Canada and Argentina also taking action. GMOs are a sensitive issue in Europe due to food safety concerns and a preference for family farms, raising doubts about EU compliance with a WTO decision. The EU's compliance with a WTO decision on lifting the moratorium on GMOs is uncertain due to US-EU efforts to influence other countries. The FSC/ETI controversy involves EU charges of export subsidies by the US, leading to WTO rulings against the US. WTO panels sided with the EU in a dispute over U.S. taxation of exports, allowing the EU to impose punitive tariffs on U.S. exports to Europe. The EU requested authorization from the WTO to impose retaliatory measures if compliance is not achieved by a certain deadline. EU Trade Commissioner Lamy expressed optimism about U.S. efforts to repeal the statute but warned of potential countermeasures if compliance is not met by a specified date. The EU challenged the U.S. over taxation of exports, leading to a WTO ruling in favor of the EU. U.S. policymakers are divided on compliance with the ruling, with some proposing negotiations to amend the agreement. Legislation has been introduced in the House to repeal the statute and provide tax benefits. In the 107th Congress, legislation was introduced to provide tax benefits but faced opposition from large exporting companies. In 2003, the President called for the repeal of the ETI statute and discussions have continued in Congress for replacement legislation. Legislation was introduced to repeal the current statute, provide transition relief, and create a new tax deduction for U.S. production activities. The credibility of the WTO relies on a prompt and fair dispute settlement mechanism. The credibility of the WTO relies on a prompt, effective, and fair dispute settlement mechanism. Non-compliance by the U.S. or EU with WTO rulings could hinder this objective. To address non-compliance, policymakers should consider factors like case selection, panel limitations, mediation, and trade liberalizing remedies. Some complaints to the WTO may be driven by domestic political interests rather than serious trade issues, leading to challenges in implementing panel decisions due to political opposition. Policymakers should be more selective in initiating cases to ensure future compliance. Sensitivity in case selection can prevent weakening of the WTO dispute process. Disputes involving complex issues should be handled carefully to avoid panel rulings that create new obligations. Politically agreed compromises may be preferable to quasi-judicial WTO rulings in some cases. Efforts could be made to settle disputes through bilateral negotiations, mediation, or arbitration from a non-WTO party. Strengthening mediation and conciliation provisions in highly divisive cases is suggested. Enhancing the \"early warning system\" to prevent future disputes is also recommended. The EU's choice to accept retaliation over complying with a WTO ruling on beef hormones raises concerns. Accepting retaliation instead of complying with the WTO beef hormone ruling raises concerns about WTO remedies. While retaliatory measures may manage disputes with implementation difficulties, they conflict with trade liberalization goals, raise political tensions, and impose economic costs on various parties. Critics suggest compensation as the only remedy for non-compliance, implemented through monetary fines. Retaliation can harden the resolve of the offending party, reducing the utility of pressuring compliance. WTO remedy for non-compliance involves compensation through monetary fines or reducing trade barriers. Negotiations are ongoing for revisions to the WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding, with the US proposing changes to give disputing parties more control. The success of these negotiations and their impact on US-EU disputes remains uncertain. Implementing rulings requiring statutory changes may prove more challenging than those not requiring such changes. The WTO dispute process allows Members to choose cases that best fulfill their policy goals. Past experience may influence decisions on which cases to initiate in the future."
