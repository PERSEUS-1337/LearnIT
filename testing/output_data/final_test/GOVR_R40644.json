The Administration requested $2.015 billion for DEA in FY2010, exceeding FY2009 funding by $55.6 million. The FY2010 funding for the DEA would have exceeded the enacted FY2009 level by almost $55.6 million, reflecting a 2.8% increase.

The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) was established in 1930 to house federal inmates and ensure centralized administration of the federal prison system. BOP's mission is to confine offenders in safe and humane facilities, providing work and self-improvement opportunities for inmates to become productive citizens. BOP operates 115 correctional facilities and contracts with Residential Re-entry Centers (RRC) to assist inmates nearing release with employment counseling and other services. Congress funds the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) through two accounts: Salaries and Expenses (S&E) for daily operations and Buildings and Facilities (B&F) for construction and maintenance. Funding also comes from Federal Prison Industries (FPI) revenue, with Congress setting limits on administrative expenses. The FY2010 budget proposed a decrease in funding for the Bureau of Prisons, with a total proposed amount of $6.079 billion, reflecting a 1.6% decrease from the previous year. The reduction was mainly due to a decrease in the B&F account, with the Administration requesting $96.7 million, significantly less than the $575.8 million appropriated in FY2009. The House-passed bill included $6.177 billion in total funding for BOP. The House-passed bill for FY2010 included $6.177 billion in total funding for the Bureau of Prisons, with a $476.5 million increase in the S&E account. The Senate-passed bill proposed $6.082 billion for BOP, with $5.969 billion for S&E and $99.2 million for B&F. The Senate's S&E funding was 6.6% higher than FY2009, but less than both the Administration's request and the House-passed amount. The B&F funding was 82.8% less than FY2009, but higher than the Administration's request. The FY2010 appropriation for the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) was $6.188 billion, slightly higher than FY2009 enacted amount. By the end of FY2009, the federal prison population exceeded 208,000 inmates, with most held in BOP facilities. The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) is facing challenges due to overcrowding in its facilities, with inmate-to-staff ratios increasing. Congress is considering increasing funding to manage the growing prison population more effectively. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about staffing levels at BOP facilities and mandated $70.6 million for hiring more correctional officers. The Senate Appropriations Committee also raised concerns about BOP's ability to manage federal prisons effectively under the Administration's FY2010 budget. The joint explanatory statement emphasized the need for at least $98.2 million to address these staffing issues. The joint explanatory statement highlights the allocation of funds for hiring additional correctional officers in the BOP's S&E account. The B&F account includes $25.4 million for new construction, with the Senate recommending $99.2 million for this purpose.

The high prison population and costs of recidivism have led Congress to focus on offender re-entry issues. Over 95% of prisoners will be released, with two-thirds likely to commit new offenses within three years. The average cost of incarceration in state prisons was $62 per day in 2001. In 2008, the Second Chance Act was passed, allocating $165 million for offender aid programs in FY2009 and FY2010.

NASA's FY2010 budget allocated $4.477 billion for Science, with a slight decrease in funding. Earth Science, Planetary Science, and Heliophysics saw increases, while Astrophysics faced a decrease. NASA is exploring options after the loss of the Orbital Carbon Observatory, including building a replacement. The House and Senate increased funding for Earth Science, Astrophysics, and Heliophysics in NASA's FY2010 budget.

The requested budget for Exploration saw a 13.1% increase, aiming for an initial crewed flight in March 2015. However, there are doubts about the funding projections for the development of the Ares V launch vehicle, Altair lunar lander, and lunar surface systems aligning with the goal of returning humans to the moon by 2020. The Augustine report found that the projected budgets would permit a return to the moon no sooner than \"well into the 2030s, if ever.\" The House and Senate provided less funding than requested for NASA's human space flight program, with the final appropriation being $3.746 billion, a reduction of $217 million from the request.

The conference committee recommends the EEOC develop a multiyear plan to increase staffing and reduce backlog of private sector cases. Quarterly reports on staffing levels are required to monitor resources adequacy. The agency's workload is expected to increase, necessitating additional personnel. The EEOC's workload is projected to increase due to various factors such as transitioning to an in-house call center, the passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, and economic factors like higher unemployment rates. To improve efficiency in handling federal employee cases, the EEOC plans to implement a system that categorizes cases into fast, regular, or complex tracks. The conference committee directs the EEOC to submit an implementation plan within 60 days, detailing the need for the tracking system, implementation schedule, and potential impact on federal employees.
