    "content": "On October 4, U.S. Special Operations Forces were attacked near Tongo Tongo in Niger, resulting in four deaths and two injuries. The incident highlighted security threats in West Africa's Sahel region and the increasing presence of U.S. military forces in counterterrorism efforts globally. The attack was attributed to a local group affiliated with ISIS, marking a significant event in the region. ISIS/ISIL was responsible for the attack in Niger, marking the first known incident of an Islamist militant group killing U.S. soldiers in the Sahel region. Islamist extremists have targeted Western civilians in North and West Africa since 2013. Niger's stability and partnership with Western militaries have made it an attractive location for U.S. military activities. Congress has influenced U.S. engagement with Niger and the military footprint through funding and oversight activities. Members of Congress have raised questions about the DOD mission in Niger following the October 4 incidents. Niger's security challenges, political instability, and economic struggles make it a key transit point for African migrants seeking to reach Europe. The country has never had a democratic transition between civilian leaders and faces recurrent challenges from ethnic rebellions and military interference in politics. The smuggling of goods and people in Niger's border regions has been a significant source of income for communities, some of which have rebelled against the government. The presence of Islamist armed groups in the central Sahel has increased since the crises in Libya and Mali in 2011. Various groups affiliated with Al Qaeda or the Islamic State operate in different parts of Niger, including AQIM along the western border with Mali and in the desert north. Additionally, Boko Haram conflict affects southeastern Niger. Islamist extremist groups in the Sahel region have spilled into the Lake Chad Basin subregion. In Niger, these groups pose a threat to internal security and Western interests. They target government officials, prisons, schools, and individuals collaborating with the state or French-led counterterrorism operations. Attacks also occur in the triborder region between Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso. U.N. peacekeepers in Mali have been frequent targets, and Western nationals have been kidnapped for ransom by AQIM-aligned groups since 2015. Since 2015, AQIM-aligned groups have kidnapped Western nationals for ransom in the Sahel region. Various armed groups, including ethnic militias, separatist rebels, and drug traffickers, operate in western Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso. Islamist armed groups exploit local conflicts and grievances to recruit followers, while local security forces' heavy-handed counterterrorism tactics may worsen instability. General Joseph Dunford acknowledged the dangerous area where U.S. troops were attacked by ISIS and Al-Qaeda. The State Department advises against travel to Niger's border regions due to extremist activity. Niger's government is collaborating with other countries to combat the threat. Niger's government collaborates with other countries to counter terrorism, including working with Western militaries. They participate in joint task forces to combat groups like Boko Haram and have proposed a joint force with G-5 Sahel countries to enhance border security. The G-5 Sahel states have requested donor support to make the force operational. Nigerien troops also partner with France's Operation Barkhane for counterterrorism operations in the Sahel region. Some Nigeriens have protested the increased military deployment. The U.S. military presence in Niger has increased since 2013, with about 800 armed military personnel stationed there to support counterterrorism operations. A U.S. Air Force facility is being constructed in Agadez to support logistical and intelligence operations. Some Nigeriens have protested the growing foreign military presence, raising concerns about potential challenges to Niger's internal stability. The U.S. military presence in Niger has grown significantly since 2002, with about 800 armed military personnel stationed there to support counterterrorism operations. A U.S. Air Force facility in Agadez supports logistical and intelligence operations, described as a \"light footprint\" by AFRICOM. The presence is focused on short-term missions, with varying personnel figures over time. The U.S. military presence in Niger has grown incrementally since 2013, with a focus on counterterrorism operations in response to Islamist insurgent groups in West Africa. This growth is attributed to various factors, including support for France's Operation Barkhane and concerns about the spread of terrorism in the region. The U.S. military presence in Niger has increased since 2013 for counterterrorism operations against Islamist insurgent groups in West Africa. AFRICOM stated that there is no active combat mission in Niger, but there are concerns about potential direct military strikes in the future. The Trump Administration has shown interest in reducing policy limitations on military operations in countries with active Islamist militants. The United States has been engaged in counterterrorism efforts in the Sahel region for the past 15 years, including security assistance, military engagement, and programs to counter violent extremism. Niger is seen as a key partner due to its stability and willingness to work with Western militaries. Resources for security assistance in the Sahel have increased significantly in recent years. In recent years, security resources in the Sahel have increased following events in Mali and the escalation of the Boko Haram conflict. U.S. military personnel in Niger are involved in ISR operations, military construction, logistical and intelligence support to France, security cooperation programs, joint exercises, and advisory activities. The U.S. military personnel in Niger are involved in various activities, including joint exercises, advisory activities, and security cooperation programs in the Sahel region. These activities are part of the State Department-led Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership (TSCTP) aimed at building the capacity of countries in North and West Africa. Congress periodically assesses the effectiveness of TSCTP and oversees its funding resources. The U.S. military has expanded security cooperation activities in Niger and Africa over the past decade, with increased funding for counterterrorism efforts. Niger is a top beneficiary of DOD programs, receiving about $170 million for counterterrorism purposes. Congressional concerns have been raised about the effectiveness of these programs and the ability of fragile states to maintain U.S.-origin equipment. Concerns have been raised about the ability of fragile states to maintain U.S.-origin equipment and capabilities, leading to directives in defense authorization measures. Congress has directed DOD to conduct foreign \"defense institution building\" activities in countries receiving security cooperation for purposes like counterterrorism. Additionally, challenges with DOD's global force management have emerged, along with support for French military operations in the Sahel encouraged through legislation. The FY2016 NDAA authorized DOD to provide support to allied countries for counterterrorism operations in Africa, including logistic support and supplies. Congress also approved funds for the Air Force's construction of a facility in Agadez. President Obama notified Congress of the deployment of U.S. Armed Forces to Niger in 2013 for intelligence support and sharing with French forces in Mali. The deployed forces have weapons for their own protection and security. President Obama directed the deployment of U.S. Armed Forces to Niger for force protection and security, citing his constitutional authority as Commander in Chief. Congress has not been specifically notified of the deployment under the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF). Questions that Congress may pose to the Administration include whether armed extremist groups in Niger with links to Al Qaeda and ISIS could be considered \"associated forces\" of the 9/11 terrorist groups. Congress may also consider new legislation for U.S. military operations in Niger and Africa. U.S.-Niger diplomatic ties have strengthened as a counterterrorism effort in the Sahel region. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson pledged to support Niger's economic growth and counterterrorism efforts. U.S. Ambassador to Niger-Designate Eric Whitaker aims to strengthen the partnership between Niger and the United States, focusing on combating extremism, promoting democratic governance, and fostering economic growth. Niger has been a key recipient of U.S. security assistance in Africa, with programs aimed at enhancing its counterterrorism capabilities and participation in peacekeeping operations. The Obama Administration focused on Niger's national security and defense resources. Niger's military is considered effective, with a better human rights record compared to other U.S. counterterrorism partners in West Africa. Concerns have been raised about the high levels of U.S. security assistance for Niger, leading to increased regional aid funding during the latter years of the Obama Administration. In 2016, the United States and Niger signed a $437 million MCC Compact for agricultural development. Ambassador-designate Whitaker aims to consult with AFRICOM for a balanced relationship. Niger's MCC assistance eligibility depends on democratic norms and anti-corruption efforts. Freedom House downgraded Niger's political rights rating in 2017 due to election-related issues. The Trump Administration's proposed changes to foreign aid could impact bilateral ties, with plans to eliminate the global Food for Peace program for Niger. General Dunford mentioned 6,000 U.S. troops deployed in Africa, mainly in Djibouti. This does not include MCC-administered funding or USAID regional initiatives. The U.S. has 6,000 troops in Africa, with a focus on supporting various missions in countries like Somalia, the Sahel, Maghreb, Libya, Boko Haram, and the Gulf of Guinea. General Waldhauser outlined five key areas of effort for AFRICOM in 2017. The U.S. military has a presence in various African countries to support missions and disaster response capacity of African partners. U.S. officials have publicly confirmed deployments in some countries, but the list may not be comprehensive. Additionally, nearly every country in Africa hosts some U.S. military personnel presence, such as at U.S. Embassies. The Defense Department also conducts joint exercises and training engagements with African partners. The U.S. military has a presence in various African countries, supporting missions and disaster response capacity of African partners through joint exercises and training engagements. In Cameroon, approximately 300 U.S. military personnel are deployed for airborne intelligence operations. In Chad, the U.S. leads the Coordination and Liaison Cell supporting the Multinational Joint Task Force against Boko Haram. In Djibouti, U.S. forces remain stationed as well. In his 2017 AFRICOM Posture Statement, General Waldhauser mentioned U.S. forces deployed in Djibouti for counterterrorism and counter-piracy operations in the Horn of Africa and Arabian Peninsula, as well as contingency support for embassy security in East Africa. Additional U.S. forces are also in Kenya for counterterrorism operations in East Africa. In Libya, U.S. airstrikes against ISIS targets have been conducted with the consent of the Government of National Accord. In Mali, the U.S. supports France's counterterrorism operations and provides airlift and logistical support. Continued U.S. support is crucial for France's efforts in the volatile region. A U.S.-Senegal defense agreement was notified to the Senate in 2016. In Somalia, U.S. forces counter terrorist threats and assist regional forces. General Waldhauser mentioned flying drones out of Tunisia during a press briefing in 2017. The U.S. military has been conducting surveillance and reconnaissance drone operations out of Tunisia for some time, in support of regional forces countering the Lord's Resistance Army. General Waldhauser stated that the U.S. will continue to work with countries in the region through training and exercises to prevent leaving a void. The future U.S. military presence in the area is uncertain. The DOD questions adherence to the \"golden hour standard\" for medical evacuation, which is the critical first 60 minutes after trauma or acute illness. More than 90% of casualties die within this hour without advanced trauma life support. While U.S. military medical support aims to transport patients within one hour, it is not an absolute requirement due to factors like lack of medical assets and tactical situations on the ground. AFRICOM officials have sought to improve the command's ability to respond rapidly to crises involving U.S. government personnel, despite challenges like the \"tyranny of distance.\" In instances where the one hour advanced treatment standard is difficult to achieve, commanders may assume more risk and provide additional on-the-spot medical support. In the case of the October 4 Niger ambush, at least one Special Forces medic was present but killed during the attack. Two U.S. soldiers wounded during the ambush were evacuated by French air assets to Niamey. The ambush in Niger resulted in U.S. soldiers being medically evacuated to Niamey by French air assets. The strategic rationale for U.S. soldiers in Niger is to assist local partners in building military capabilities. The global war on terror post-9/11 led to an expansion of DOD's security cooperation tools under the concept of building partner capacity (BPC). This approach involves working \"by, with, and through\" partner forces on the ground. The interest in Building Partner Capacity (BPC) stems from the belief that fragile states could become havens for terrorist groups, similar to pre-9/11 Afghanistan. BPC has become a key strategy for the US to secure its interests and national security objectives. However, challenges in BPC missions in Afghanistan, Iraq, and the Sahel have raised doubts about their effectiveness. Concerns also exist about the strain on the Department of Defense due to these missions. On October 4, 2017, four U.S. soldiers from the 3rd Special Forces Group were killed in Niger during a joint U.S.-Nigerien mission. Two other soldiers were wounded in the attack. On October 4, 2017, U.S. soldiers were killed and wounded in an ambush in Niger. Sergeant La David T. Johnson was initially missing in action and later found dead on October 6, 2017. The attackers were identified as local militants affiliated with the Islamic State organization. The incident is still under investigation. IS-GS, a group affiliated with the Islamic State, emerged in May 2015 when a leader from MUJAO pledged allegiance. In 2016, they carried out attacks in Burkina Faso and Niger. The relationship between Al Qaeda and Islamic State affiliates in West Africa is debated, with competition for recruits and prominence. Al Sahrawi's nationality is unclear, with some sources claiming he is a refugee from Western Sahara. MUJAO, formed in 2011 as a dissident faction of AQIM, gained control over Mali's Gao region in 2012. In 2013, MUJAO merged with another AQIM splinter faction to form Al Murabitoun. Al Sahrawi split from Al Murabitoun in 2015. Al Sahrawi split from Al Murabitoun in 2015 and formed Al Qaeda-aligned coalition in Mali in early 2017. IS-GS has been linked to attacks in the triborder region and kidnappings of a Romanian national and an American. In 2016, an attack occurred in Niger with no group publicly claiming responsibility. Interior Minister Mohamed Bazoum stated that the attackers were influenced by Abu Walid al Sahrawi and possibly loyal to Iyad ag Ghali of Al Qaeda-aligned JNIM. The government has yet to identify the assailants. The State Department designated MUJAO and two founders as Global Terrorists. Al Murabitoun was designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization in 2013. Abu Walid al Sahrawi is not sanctioned by the U.S. Some congressional concerns include oversight of military deployments, counterterrorism policy, and information sharing. General Dunford stated soldiers in Niger were there to build local forces' capacity to combat extremism in West Africa. The presence of U.S. troops in Niger supports the global counterterrorism strategy by building local forces' capacity to defeat extremism in West Africa. The deployment of military personnel on Train, Advise, and Assist Missions is coordinated with other federal entities. The policy and legal framework for such deployments, rules of engagement, and roles of U.S. military personnel in non-combat operations are key considerations for congressional oversight. The legal and policy framework for U.S. military activities in the Sahel is being questioned, along with the potential unintended consequences of an expanding U.S. military presence in the area. Congress is evaluating the impact of \"building partner capacity\" activities in Niger and the Sahel region, considering the risk, reward, and opportunity costs. Congress has expanded DOD's authority to conduct such activities under the FY2015 and FY2017 National Defense Authorization Acts. Members of Congress are evaluating U.S. military activities in the Sahel region, particularly in countries like Niger. They are considering the implications of counterterrorism capacity-building activities in fragile states with a history of conflicts. Questions arise about the adequacy of military posture and resources for missions in Africa, including contingency planning and intelligence support. The potential unintended consequences of U.S. counterterrorism assistance in such settings are also being examined. AFRICOM may require new capabilities and assets in the Sahel region, with questions on cost and changes to military posture. Allies like France play a role in enabling U.S. military missions, along with military contractors. Deployment strains on U.S. forces for BPC missions are being evaluated in the context of global force management. The focus on BPC missions by U.S. forces globally raises questions about the impact on other national security priorities. DOD's planning and force structure decisions need to consider the ability to respond to multiple contingencies affecting BPC missions. Adjustments to force planning may be necessary due to these considerations."
