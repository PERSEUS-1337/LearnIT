    "content": "The federal-state Unemployment Compensation (UC) program provides income support to eligible workers through UC benefits for up to 26 weeks. Benefits can be extended for 13 or 20 weeks under the Extended Benefit (EB) program. The Trade Adjustment Act (TAA) programs offer income support to workers affected by international competition. Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA) benefits are available to unemployed workers in certain situations. Workers may be eligible for Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA) benefits if their unemployment is directly linked to a declared major disaster. Former civilian federal employees and U.S. military servicemembers may qualify for unemployment benefits through specific programs. The Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act of 1991 ensures ex-servicemembers receive similar benefits as other unemployed workers. This report details regular UC and EB benefits, including eligibility requirements, benefits, and financing structures. The Unemployment Compensation (UC) program is funded by federal and state taxes, impacting most businesses in the US. In FY2018, $6.3 billion in federal taxes and $39.1 billion in state taxes will be collected. States are projected to spend $28.6 billion on UC benefits, covering approximately 141.0 million jobs. The program's funding and benefit structure aim to counter economic fluctuations like recessions, with revenue increasing during economic growth and spending decreasing as unemployment falls. The Unemployment Compensation (UC) program is funded by federal and state taxes, with increased tax revenues during low unemployment periods. This surplus of funds creates a cushion for the UC program during recessions when tax revenue falls and program spending rises. The UC system is governed by the Social Security Act, which authorizes grants to states for UC laws, components of the Unemployment Trust Fund, and advances to insolvent state UC programs. The federal government provides funds for federal and state UC program administration, EB payments, and loans to insolvent state UC programs. In FY2019, states are projected to receive $3.6 billion for UC program administration. The U.S. Department of Labor administers the federal portion of the UC system in each state, setting broad rules for the 53 state programs. Non-compliance may result in employers losing a portion of their state unemployment tax credit. The federal government funds federal and state UC programs, including administrative costs, EB payments, and loans to insolvent state UC accounts. Each state determines UC benefit eligibility, payments, and duration through state laws and regulations. The UC program generally does not provide benefits to the self-employed, those unable to work, or those without a recent earnings history. States disqualify claimants for various reasons such as voluntarily quitting without good cause or refusing suitable work without good cause. To receive Unemployment Compensation (UC) benefits, claimants must be able, available, and actively searching for work. UC eligibility is based on attaining qualified wages and employment in covered work over a 12-month period (base period) prior to unemployment. States use various methods to determine monetary eligibility, with most replacing about half of a claimant's average weekly wage. The base period typically includes the first four of the last five completed calendar quarters. This may result in a lag of up to five months between filing a claim and receiving benefits. Federal law allows states to develop expanded definitions of the base period for Unemployment Compensation (UC) benefits. More than two-thirds of states permit the use of an alternative base period (ABP) for workers who do not qualify under the regular base period. This allows states to consider wages and employment in the last four completed calendar quarters if the worker fails to qualify using the first four quarters. This flexibility helps ensure that workers with substantial labor market attachment are not ineligible for UC benefits. The state may use older wages and employment for workers with no current wages, typically due to illness or injury. The 2009 stimulus package provided funds to states to make changes to their unemployment programs, with $4.4 billion distributed and $2.6 billion becoming unrestricted funds. The $7 billion in funds from the 2009 stimulus package was distributed to states based on certain conditions, including the use of a base period for determining UC eligibility. States vary in their methods for determining monetary eligibility, with one method being the High-Quarter Wages requirement. The High-Quarter Wages requirement for determining UC eligibility involves workers earning a multiple of their high-quarter wages and total base-period wages. Multiple of Weekly Benefit Amount method requires workers to have earned a multiple of their weekly benefit amount during the base period before receiving benefits. States have varying requirements for unemployment benefits eligibility, including base period earnings, weeks/hours of employment, and flat qualifying amounts. The wide variation in state UC program laws and regulations also extends to data collection practices. Most states use quarters worked, quarterly earnings, and cumulative earnings to determine unemployment benefits eligibility and amount. Benefits are typically based on covered work wages over a 12-month period, with half of the average weekly wage replaced up to a weekly maximum. States also incentivize short-term or part-time work during unemployment by disregarding some earnings. The worker's UC payment is based on the weekly benefit amount and earnings, available for up to 26 weeks in most states. Exceptions include up to 30 weeks in Massachusetts, up to 28 weeks in Montana, and varying weeks in other states based on unemployment rates. In December 2017, 1.9 million unemployed workers received an average weekly UC benefit of $351. Weekly maximums ranged from $133 in Puerto Rico. The maximum UC benefit amounts vary by state, with weekly maximums ranging from $133 in Puerto Rico to $742 in Massachusetts. In states that provide dependents' allowances, the maximum can be up to $1,103 in Massachusetts. The average regular UC benefit duration in December 2017 was 15.4 weeks. UC benefits are funded through employer taxes, with federal taxes under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) and state taxes under State Unemployment Tax Acts (SUTA). The net FUTA tax rate for employers in compliant states is 0.6% on the first $7,000 of each worker's earnings per year. The FUTA tax rate for employers in compliant states is 0.6%, with a 5.4% credit available. This tax funds federal and state administrative costs, the EB program, loans to insolvent state UC accounts, and state employment services. Federal law defines job coverage for state UC programs to avoid the maximum FUTA tax rate of 6.0% on the first $7,000 of each employee's annual pay. $6.3 billion in FUTA taxes is projected to be collected in FY2018. States must cover jobs in firms that pay at least $1,500 in wages during any calendar quarter or employ at least one worker in each of 20 weeks in the current or prior year. The FUTA tax rate is 0.6% for compliant states, with a 5.4% credit available. It funds federal and state administrative costs, the EB program, and state employment services. States must cover jobs in firms that pay at least $1,500 in wages during any calendar quarter or employ at least one worker in each of 20 weeks in the current or prior year. Congress passed a temporary FUTA surtax in 1976, with the surtax at 0.2% on the first $7,000 of employee wages since 1983. The authorization of the surtax lapsed in July 2011. States levy their own payroll taxes (SUTA taxes) on employers based on the amount of UC paid to former employees. State unemployment compensation (SUTA) taxes are levied on employers based on the amount of UC paid to former employees. The tax rate varies by state, with minimum rates ranging from 0.00% to 2.64% and maximum rates ranging from 5.4% to 12.00% in tax year 2017. A projected $39.1 billion in SUTA taxes will be collected in FY2018, with state revenue deposited in the U.S. Treasury and reimbursed to states from the appropriate state accounts. The U.S. Treasury reimburses states from the appropriate state accounts for their benefit payments. These payments do not require an annual appropriation but count as federal budget outlays. FUTA and SUTA revenue collections typically exceed UC outlays during economic expansions, while they are less during recessions. If a state trust fund becomes insolvent, the state may borrow federal funds, with interest charged on loans. The EB program, established by the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970, provides extended benefits to states based on their insured unemployment rate. States are charged interest on unpaid loans obtained for benefit payments. If certain economic conditions are met, states may receive up to 13 weeks of extended benefits. Optional thresholds allow states to choose additional benefit options. The state can choose additional benefit options based on specific unemployment rate criteria. EB benefits are not carried over when a state exits the program. The timing of Extended Benefits (EB) activation depends on the state's IUR or TUR. If EB is activated based on the IUR, it is immediately in effect. States rarely trigger EB based on IUR. If EB is activated based on the TUR, benefits start on the third week after the first \"on\" indicator. Deactivation is immediate if the state fails to meet IUR trigger requirements. The Department of Labor produces trigger notices indicating which states qualify for EB benefits and provides the beginning and ending dates of payable periods for each qualifying state. The IUR statistics change weekly, and the TUR statistics change monthly. Trigger notices covering state eligibility for these programs can be found at https://workforcesecurity.doleta.gov/unemploy/claims_arch.asp. The EB program imposes federal restrictions on eligibility for benefits, requiring a systematic work search and refusal of suitable work. P.L. 97-35 amended the EUCA to mandate 20 weeks of full-time employment or equivalent in insured wages. States use different methods to determine equivalence. States that require specific methods for receipt of regular UC benefits and do not allow exceptions do not need to prove 20 weeks of full-time insured employment. The three methods include earnings in the base period equal to 1.5 times high-quarter wages, earnings in the base period of at least 40 times the most recent weekly benefit amount, or earnings in the base period equal to 20 weeks of full-time insured employment. The term \"full-time\" shall have the meaning provided by state law for regular UC benefits. The base period may be the regular, alternative, or extended base period. The reasoning behind the requirements is to ensure that high quarterly earnings meet certain criteria, such as being less than $4/hour in some states. The weekly benefit amount is roughly equivalent to half the average weekly wage."
