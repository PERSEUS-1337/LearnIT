    "content": "The \"Farm Safety Net Improvement Act of 2007\" may be cited as the short title. Section 1104 of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 is amended to establish a Revenue Counter-Cyclical Program. The \"Farm Safety Net Improvement Act of 2007\" establishes a Revenue Counter-Cyclical Program for covered commodities from 2008 to 2012. The Secretary provides revenue counter-cyclical payments to producers if actual State revenue is less than the program guarantee. The Revenue Counter-Cyclical Program determines the revenue counter-cyclical program harvest price for covered commodities based on the actual State yield for each planted acre in a State. The revenue counter-cyclical program harvest price for a crop year is determined based on the harvest price used for revenue coverage plans under the Federal Crop Insurance Act. The revenue counter-cyclical program guarantee for a covered commodity in a State is set at 90% of the expected State yield for each planted acre. The expected State yield for each planted acre for a crop year for a covered commodity in a State is determined based on a linear regression trend using National Agricultural Statistics Service data from 1980 to 2006. The Secretary assigns expected State yields for planted acres of covered commodities based on similar States if expected yields cannot be established. The revenue counter-cyclical program pre-planting price is determined for crop years. The revenue counter-cyclical program pre-planting price for a crop year for a covered commodity is based on the average price used for crop insurance guarantees in the current and two preceding years, with a minimum and maximum price change limit of 15 percent. Payment amounts are determined for crop years 2008 through 2012 if revenue counter-cyclical payments are required. The revenue counter-cyclical payment for a covered commodity is calculated based on the difference between the program guarantee and actual state revenue, multiplied by acreage and production history. The Secretary will provide recourse loans to producers for the 2008-2012 crops of a covered commodity, based on the expected State yield and set at 90 percent. SEC. 3. IMPACT ON CROP INSURANCE PROGRAMS. The Secretary of Agriculture will conduct a study to ensure that all crop insurance policies are properly rated to account for risk changes due to the new Act. Within 180 days, actions identified in the study will be implemented. Additionally, efforts will be made to prevent duplication between the Risk Management Agency and Farm Service Agency. The government will work to prevent double compensation for farmers by reducing crop insurance payments by the amount of revenue counter-cyclical payments. SEC. 4. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS.
