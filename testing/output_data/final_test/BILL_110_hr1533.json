High levels of mercury exposure can impair neurological development in children. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that eight percent of women of childbearing age in the US have unsafe blood mercury levels. Fish consumption advisories due to mercury contamination have been issued for 44 states as of 2004. Fish consumption advisories for mercury contamination have been issued in 44 states, covering over 52,000 square kilometers of lakes and 1,230,000 kilometers of rivers. The primary route for mercury input to aquatic ecosystems is through atmospheric transport and deposition, posing significant human and ecological health risks. Various models and assessment tools predict different outcomes in reducing mercury levels in fish, with a lack of broad-scale data to validate these predictions. In 2003, a workshop was held by the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry to develop a system for measuring changes resulting from reduced mercury emissions in the US, leading to the publication of a plan in 2007. Additionally, in 2005, a proposal for a comprehensive, long-term mercury monitoring program was put forward in Environmental Science and Technology. Many regulations are in place to limit mercury emissions, but there is a lack of adequate monitoring to assess the environmental benefits. The Office of Inspector General of the EPA highlighted the need for improved monitoring to advance mercury science and detect health risks from 'utility-attributable' hotspots. The EPA needs to develop a mercury monitoring plan to assess the impact of regulations on mercury deposition and fish tissue. A study identified biological mercury hotspots in the northeastern U.S. and southeastern Canada linked to atmospheric mercury emissions. The study identified high mercury deposition near a coal-fired electric utility in southern New Hampshire, emphasizing the need for monitoring local impacts from mercury emissions to evaluate State and Federal policies. SEC. 3. MONITORING PROGRAM. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in consultation with various agencies, will establish a national scale mercury monitoring program to monitor long-term changes in mercury levels in the air and watershed across the United States. This program will include selecting multiple monitoring sites in different ecoregions and measuring wet mercury deposition. The national mercury monitoring program will measure atmospheric mercury speciation, dry deposition, flux, export, and re-emission levels. It will also monitor mercury levels in water and soil chemistry at selected locations determined by the Environmental Protection Agency. The national mercury monitoring program will measure mercury levels in sediment cores, surface sediments, surface water, and throughout the water column. It will also monitor mercury levels in aquatic plants and animals, including yearling fish. The national mercury monitoring program will measure mercury levels in various organisms, including yearling fish, reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mammals. The program will also assess mercury levels in phytoplankton, algae, zooplankton, and benthic invertebrates at selected locations recommended by the Environmental Protection Agency. The Scientific Advisory Committee recommends suitable monitoring sites for the established mercury monitoring program. The Scientific Advisory Committee is responsible for recommending monitoring sites for the mercury monitoring program. The Scientific Advisory Committee advises the EPA on the national mercury monitoring program establishment, site selection, and operation. It consists of scientists appointed by various government agencies. (6) 2 scientists appointed by the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration advise the EPA on the national mercury monitoring program. SEC. 5. REPORTS AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency must submit a report to Congress every 2 years on the program, including an assessment of mercury reduction rates to prevent ecological harm. All data collected under this Act must be made public. For fiscal years 2008, 2009, and 2010, appropriations are authorized for various agencies including the Environmental Protection Agency, United States Geological Survey, Fish and Wildlife Service, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. For fiscal year 2010, appropriations include $5,250,000 for the Environmental Protection Agency, $3,250,000 for the United States Geological Survey, $3,250,000 for the Fish and Wildlife Service, and $1,250,000 for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Additionally, funding is allocated for these agencies for fiscal years 2011 through 2013. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, key definitions include ecoregion, mercury export, mercury flux, and surface sediment. Ecoregion refers to a distinct area with natural communities, while mercury export and flux relate to the movement of mercury in ecosystems. Surface sediment is defined as the top layer of sediment. The term \"surface sediment\" refers to sediment in the top 2 centimeters of a lakebed or riverbed."
