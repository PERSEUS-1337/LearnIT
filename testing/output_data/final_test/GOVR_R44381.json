    "content": "This report analyzes intelligence funding from 2007 to 2018, showing that intelligence spending has remained around 11% of national defense spending. Various tables and graphs depict trends in intelligence spending, including highs and lows in NIP spending from 1965 to 1994. Figure 2 and Figure 3, along with tables in Appendix B and Appendix C, provide an overview of intelligence spending compared to national defense spending. Tables in Appendix B and C detail defense NIP programs, nondefense NIP programs, and MIP programs, showing how they are distributed across different departments and agencies. This report is published alongside another report that examines IC spending programs, including NIP and MIP subordinate programs like CCP and NRP. The NIP and MIP budgets do not cover all U.S. intelligence-related spending. Various departments have their own intelligence-gathering entities with department-specific missions and funding sources. For example, the Homeland Security Intelligence Program (HSIP) within the Department of Homeland Security funds intelligence activities of the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis. The NIP and MIP budgets do not cover all U.S. intelligence-related spending. The NIP funds intelligence activities of the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis, excluding certain military platforms like the E-3 AWACS and MQ-9 Reaper UAV. The intelligence budget supports activities related to foreign countries, governments, and military forces. The curr_chunk discusses activities related to foreign governments, political groups, and military forces that impact the defense, foreign policy, and national security of the United States. It includes countermeasures against similar activities, covert actions affecting US relations with foreign entities, and the collection of information on individuals posing a threat to internal security. The intelligence budget, separate from the defense budget, was established in the 1970s to enhance oversight of the Intelligence Community (IC). Presidents Ford, Carter, and Reagan centralized management over the National Foreign Intelligence Program (NFIP), which combined the CIA budget with defense budget portions for national intelligence activities. The National Intelligence Program (NIP) was previously known as the National Foreign Intelligence Program (NFIP) and is associated with national intelligence activities such as cryptologic and reconnaissance programs. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act (IRTPA) of 2004 renamed and modified the NFIP as the NIP, giving the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) greater budgetary authority. Military-specific tactical or operational intelligence activities were managed separately as Tactical Intelligence and Related Activities (TIARA). The Tactical Intelligence and Related Activities (TIARA) and Joint Military Intelligence Program (JMIP) were merged in 2005 to create the Military Intelligence Program (MIP). The MIP is managed separately from the National Intelligence Program (NIP) by the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (USD(I)). The National Intelligence Program (NIP) funds activities supporting multiple departments or agencies in the IC, including the CIA and strategic-level intelligence activities. It also funds Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) programs. The Military Intelligence Program (MIP) addresses unique DOD requirements and is managed separately from the NIP. The DNI and USD(I) collaborate to integrate NIP and MIP efforts, with some programs receiving resources from both. NIP programs are complex, spanning the entire IC and focusing on capabilities like cryptology and reconnaissance. The NIP is overseen by program managers who control resources, with the DNI acting as an intermediary in the budget process. The MIP focuses on defense intelligence activities supporting the Secretary of Defense's responsibilities, excluding capabilities associated with weapons systems. The MIP is \"take it with you\" intelligence for deployable units in all services, managed by component managers within DOD organizations. The MIP is managed by the U.S. Navy (USN/N2) in accordance with USD(I) guidance. MIP components include various intelligence elements within DOD, with most intelligence dollars classified for security reasons. Disclosure of intelligence budget details has been a topic of debate for years. The disclosure of intelligence budget details has been a topic of debate for years due to concerns about national security. In 1999, then-DCI George Tenet highlighted the potential risks, stating that the budget request reflects the Administration's assessment of intelligence capabilities. The 9/11 Commission also acknowledged the importance of budget decisions in meeting national security needs. The 9/11 Commission recommended disclosing the amount of money spent on national intelligence to the public, stating that the top-line figure alone does not provide enough insight. Section 601(a) of P.L. 110-53 directs the DNI to disclose the NIP topline number within 30 days after each fiscal year, in response to the Commission's recommendations. The Director of National Intelligence must disclose the aggregate amount of funds appropriated for the National Intelligence Program within 30 days after each fiscal year. The President can waive or postpone disclosure if it would harm national security. The Intelligence Authorization Act of 2010 requires the President to publicly disclose the amount requested for the NIP for the next fiscal year when submitting the budget to Congress. Only the NIP topline figure is mandated to be disclosed based on statute. The DNI is not required to disclose detailed information about the NIP budget, but the Secretary of Defense started revealing MIP appropriations annually from 2010 onwards. This transparency allowed public access to previously classified budget numbers for national and military intelligence activities. A graph shows fluctuations in NIP spending between 1965 and 1994 without specific dollar amounts. The pattern of spending in the graph correlates with world events and defense spending trends. Defense spending trends over the past decades are influenced by world events, such as the Vietnam War and the Reagan defense build-up. Budget comparisons from FY2007 to FY2019 show adjustments for automatic spending cuts. Graphs and tables illustrate national defense spending trends. The NIP and MIP budgets have shown varying trends from FY2007 to FY2019, with the NIP portion increasing steadily and becoming three times larger than the MIP by FY2015. In constant dollars, the highest NIP spending was in FY2011 at $61.7 billion. The NIP spending in constant dollars peaked at $61.7 billion in FY2011, while MIP dollars were significantly lower in FY2017 at $19.1 billion compared to FY2007 at $24.6 billion. Intelligence spending has remained relatively constant, representing around 11% of national defense spending over the past decade. Additional NIP topline values were classified until 2007, with exceptions in FYs 1997, 1998, 2005, and 2006. The intelligence budget for FY1997 was $26.6 billion, increasing to $26.7 billion in FY1998. NIP topline numbers for FY2005 and FY2006 were declassified, but MIP topline dollars for those years are not public. Despite limited data, NIP spending has shown relative constancy over the past two decades. The secrecy surrounding the intelligence budget process limits oversight and understanding of how intelligence dollars are spent. DNI Daniel Coats has expressed a commitment to transparency to build public trust in intelligence endeavors. Many believe the IC could be more transparent with budgetary matters. In the 115th Congress, legislation has been introduced to address transparency in intelligence budgets. H.R. 5406 and S. 2631, titled \"Intelligence Budget Transparency Act of 2018,\" would require the President to disclose the total budget amount for intelligence activities of each government element for the upcoming fiscal year and the following four years. The 115th Congress introduced bills for transparency in intelligence budgets, requiring disclosure of total budget amounts for intelligence activities for upcoming fiscal years. Questions arise about the adequacy of funding for intelligence agencies and the value they provide. Congress must balance national security needs with fiscal responsibility in determining appropriate spending levels. The IC's funding for collection capacity, data processing, and international partnerships, as well as organizational efficiency and oversight, are key considerations for Congress in determining appropriate spending levels. The Intelligence Community (IC) comprises 17 component organizations across six government departments and two independent agencies. Six U.S. intelligence entities receive funding from both the National Intelligence Program (NIP) and Military Intelligence Program (MIP). Directors of DIA, NGA, NRO, and NSA manage both NIP and MIP funds. NIP spending is spread across all 17 components, while MIP spending is limited to the Department of Defense (DOD)."
