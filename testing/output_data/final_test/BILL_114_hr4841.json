    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Co-Prescribing Saves Lives Act of 2016\". Congress finds that misuse of heroin and opioids leads to approximately 25,000 deaths in the US annually. Drug overdose was the top cause of injury death in 2013, surpassing motor vehicle fatalities among people aged 25 to 64. Fatal opioid-related overdose rates have quadrupled since 1990, with 46 people dying daily from prescription painkiller overdoses. Naloxone is an effective antidote for all opioid-related overdoses. The opioid overdose antidote naloxone has reversed over 26,000 overdose cases between 1996 and 2014, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. SEC. 3. Health care provider training in federal health care and medical facilities. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, Department of Veterans Affairs, and Department of Defense shall establish health care provider training guidelines for Federal health care facilities, including Federally qualified health centers and facilities of the Indian Health Service, as well as medical facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Training will be provided to all providers in accordance with the guidelines. The Secretary of Defense will establish health care provider training guidelines for all medical facilities within the Department of Defense, ensuring training on the appropriate prescribing of opioid medications for Federal employees and contractors in health care facilities. The training requirements for healthcare providers working with the Federal Government include prescribing controlled substances and practicing in designated healthcare facilities. Training topics must cover best practices for pain medication prescribing and pain management principles. Training approaches for healthcare providers working with the Federal Government may include traditional continuing education models and intensive coaching for high-volume prescribers. The training should align with consensus guidelines on pain medication prescribing from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Training frequency for healthcare providers working with the Federal Government should occur not later than 18 months after the enactment of the Act, and every 3 years thereafter. The term \"controlled substance\" is defined as per the Controlled Substances Act. SEC. 4. Naloxone co-prescribing in federal health care and medical facilities. Naloxone co-prescribing guidelines must be established for federally qualified health centers, Department of Defense medical facilities, and Department of Veterans Affairs medical facilities within 180 days of this Act. The guidelines will address naloxone co-prescribing for pain patients. The section defines co-prescribing as prescribing an opioid overdose reversal drug alongside opioid prescriptions for patients at risk of overdose or being treated for opioid use disorders. It also explains the term \"elevated risk of overdose.\" The term \"elevated risk of overdose\" is defined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services and may include criteria from the Opioid Overdose Toolkit. This includes patients on first course opioid treatment, using extended-release opioids, and those with respiratory diseases or other co-morbidities. Grant program to state health departments for expanding naloxone co-prescribing. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a 4-year grant program for State health departments to develop co-prescribing guidelines and increase access to naloxone. States must submit an application identifying community partners, providers for training, and criteria for eligible patients. The program aims to secure funding for continuation after the grant expires. Priority is given to State health departments aligning guidelines with existing ones. Grants can be used for co-prescribing naloxone and expanding distribution models. The program aims to train healthcare providers on co-prescribing opioid overdose reversal drugs, track patient outcomes, purchase reversal drugs, and offset costs for eligible individuals. The program aims to prioritize uninsured individuals for health services, conduct community outreach on co-prescribing practices and opioid overdose reversal drugs, establish protocols for connecting overdose patients to treatment, and require State health departments to submit evaluations for grant receipt. The program funded by the grant must submit information on outcome measures specified by the Secretary. The term \"co-prescribing\" is defined in section 4. Authorization of appropriations for $2,500,000 annually from 2017 to 2021 is provided to carry out this Act."
