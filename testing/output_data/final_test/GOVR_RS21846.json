Negotiations began in January 2004 and were completed in May 2004. The agreement was approved by the House and Senate committees in November 2005, passed by the House in December 2005, and signed into law by the President on January 11, 2006. The United States-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (P.L. 109-169) was signed into law on January 11, 2006. The agreement entered into force on August 1, 2006, after Bahrain passed new intellectual property rights laws. The AFL/CIO opposed the agreement, but House Democrats eventually supported it after receiving assurances from Bahrain on labor protections. The FTA is backed by various industry associations. There has been dissent in the Middle East region over the U.S.-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement (FTA). Saudi Arabia, a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), alleges that GCC countries signing bilateral trade agreements with the U.S. violate a GCC economic agreement. Saudi Arabia has threatened to impose a 5% duty on U.S. goods imported into the GCC and then exported to Saudi Arabia, possibly due to concerns about U.S. agricultural products, like wheat, being exported to Saudi Arabia through other GCC countries. The U.S.-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement has faced opposition from Saudi Arabia, who claims it violates a GCC economic agreement. Some analysts question the USTR's focus on small trade agreements like Bahrain's, suggesting resources should be directed towards more significant agreements like the FTAA. The U.S. government sees these FTAs as stepping stones for future agreements and reforms, with Bahrain chosen as the first U.S. FTA in the Persian Gulf due to strong political and military ties and Bahrain's reforms. The U.S.-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement is a building block for Middle East free trade initiatives. Bahrain, a close U.S. partner in the Persian Gulf, is a constitutional monarchy ruled by the al-Khalifa family. It hosts the Fifth Fleet, headquarters for U.S. Persian Gulf naval forces, and was designated a Major Non-NATO Ally in 2001.

King al-Khalifa, installed in 1999, has pushed for political and economic liberalization. Parliamentary elections have been held, and oil and gas production play a significant role in the country's economy. Revenues from oil and natural gas account for 16.5% of Bahrain's GDP and 60% of government income. Bahrain has the smallest proven oil reserves among GCC countries. The IMF predicts Bahrain will run out of petroleum in 2018 if pumping continues at current levels. The financial sector is the second largest contributor to GDP, with no restrictions on capital flows. Bahrain has passed laws to liberalize foreign investment. In the past two years, Bahrain has passed laws liberalizing foreign property ownership and tightening anti-money laundering laws. Bahrain is the United States' 88th largest goods export market, with U.S. exports to Bahrain totaling $351 million in 2005. Aircraft, miscellaneous manufactures, and agricultural products are the main exports. U.S. imports from Bahrain in 2005 were $432 million, with little impact expected from the FTA due to already low tariffs. Trade between Bahrain and Israel is subject to the Arab League boycott, but not strictly enforced. In June 2003, USTR Robert Zoellick and Bahraini Minister of Finance Abdullah Saif discussed Bahrain's WTO membership and efforts to remove the boycott against Israel. Bahrain announced in September 2005 its intention to end the boycott. President Bush aimed to establish a Middle East Free Trade Area by 2013 through bilateral agreements with Middle Eastern countries. The United States aims to create a free trade area with 20 Middle Eastern and North African countries by 2013. President Bush announced the MEFTA plan in 2003, which includes expanding trade agreements and investment frameworks in the region. The FTA negotiations cover various sectors like services, agriculture, and intellectual property rights, eliminating tariffs on consumer and industrial products. The U.S. and Bahrain have reached an agreement where 98% of U.S. exports to Bahrain are now duty free, with a 10-year phase-out for the remaining items. Textiles and apparel trade will be duty free immediately if the product contains U.S. or Bahraini yarn. The agreement provides U.S. firms with high access to service markets, including key sectors like audiovisual, telecommunications, and financial services. U.S. financial service suppliers can establish subsidiaries in Bahrain with regulatory transparency. Bahrain has agreed to allow access for life and medical insurance upon entry into force of the Agreement, and for non-life insurance within six months. They will not discriminate against U.S. insurance suppliers and will allow existing suppliers to continue business activities. The agreement highlights Bahrain's open financial sector, allowing U.S. firms to offer cross-border services to Bahrainis in financial information, data processing, and advisory services. U.S.-based asset managers can manage portfolios of collective investment schemes in Bahrain under the FTA. Under the FTA, U.S. phone companies in Bahrain will have access to the telecom network at cost-based rates and can build physical networks with access to key facilities. The Agreement also includes measures to combat piracy and counterfeiting, with both governments committing to enforcing IPR laws. The FTA between the U.S. and Bahrain includes measures to combat piracy and counterfeiting, with enforcement against goods-in-transit to deter violators. Ex officio action can be taken in border and criminal IPR cases, providing more effective enforcement. The Agreement mandates statutory and actual damages under Bahraini law for IPR violations, deterring piracy by allowing monetary damages even if economic harm cannot be determined. The intellectual property chapter does not affect public health measures for diseases like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. The Bush Administration's FTA with Bahrain includes measures to combat piracy and counterfeiting, with enforcement against goods-in-transit. The agreement also addresses labor obligations, with commitments to uphold internationally recognized labor rights and cooperate on promoting respect for labor standards. Labor rights have been a major area of contention in the agreement. Labor rights have been a major area of contention in the FTA between the Bush Administration and Bahrain. Critics have raised concerns about labor laws, including restrictions on forming unions, penalties for anti-union discrimination, withholding foreign workers' salaries, and limitations on strikes. Bahrain has made some reforms and agreed to align its laws with International Labor Organization standards."
