    "content": "The \"Auction Reform Act of 2002\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. The findings section is included in the Act. The Congress acknowledges the changing circumstances in the telecommunications market since the 1997 spectrum auction mandate, highlighting the need for a comprehensive plan for allocating additional spectrum for advanced communications services. The Federal Communications Commission should have flexibility in auctioning frequencies in the 700 megahertz band for this purpose. The Department of Defense is still consulting on sharing spectrum for wireless services after the June 19th auction for the 700 megahertz band. The FCC is working on resolving interference issues in the 800 megahertz band, possibly involving the 700 megahertz band. The 700 megahertz band auction should not proceed until 800 megahertz interference issues are resolved. The band is currently occupied by TV broadcasters, creating uncertainty and reducing its value for potential bidders. This situation hampers the auction's potential revenue and the spectrum's optimal use. The Commission's rules for vacating the 700 megahertz band by broadcast stations lack certainty for availability to mobile communications services and public safety operations. The rules should support the transition to digital television without unjustly benefiting incumbent licensees. SEC. 3. REPEAL OF DEADLINES FOR SPECTRUM AUCTIONS. Amendments are made to various Acts regarding spectrum auctions, including repealing deadlines. SEC. 4. TERMINATION OF SCHEDULED AUCTIONS. The Federal Communications Commission will not conduct auctions 31 and 44 on June 19, 2002, as originally planned. Within a year, the Commission must report to Congress on rescheduling these auctions and progress in digital television transition and spectrum allocation for mobile communications services."
