The \"Targeted Economic Development Block Grant Program Act of 1993\" establishes a program to allocate funds to qualified cities based on a formula determined by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. The \"Targeted Economic Development Block Grant Program Act of 1993\" sets criteria for a city to qualify for funds, including being a metropolitan city, eligible for funds under section 106(a)(3), and having a need-adjusted per capita income factor of 0.55 or less. The terms 'A', 'U', and 'X' are defined for calculating allocations. The term 'X' is calculated based on the total population of the city, the need index, and the need adjusted per capita income factor. The need index is determined by a specific formula involving the term 'N'. The term 'N' is calculated as the ratio of funds allocated to the city under section 106(a)(3) to the total funds received by all eligible cities under the same section. The term 'P' is calculated as the ratio of funds allocated to the city under section 106(a)(3) to the total funds received by all eligible cities under the same section. The term 'P' represents the percentage ratio of the total population of the city to the total population of all eligible cities in the current fiscal year. Eligible cities are those that meet specific requirements. The need adjusted per capita income factor is determined based on the percentage ratio of the total population of the city to the total population of all eligible cities. The need adjusted per capita income factor is determined based on the percentage ratio of the total population of the city to all eligible cities. The term 'I' in the context refers to the per capita income of the city for the most recent year available, as determined by the Secretary of Commerce. The term 'Q' is the product of the need index of the city and the per capita income of the United States. The Secretary may not make a grant to a city unless the city submits an application containing required information and certifications from the chief executive official and Governor that the grant will be used for its intended purpose. The city must use grant funds for eligible activities, provide matching amounts, and maintain all received funds and matching amounts. The city must maintain separate accounts for grant funds, ensure expenditures meet certain levels, reserve 5% for minority-owned businesses, and report within 180 days of receiving the grant. The city must report on the use and effectiveness of grant funds within 180 days of receiving the grant. The Secretary will notify the city of any proposed disapproval within 20 days of receiving the application. The city must report on grant fund usage within 180 days.

A special rule applies for cities with rates below 5 cents or above 25 cents per dollar of allocated amounts. State Matching Funds require each State with a city receiving grant amounts to provide funding at a rate of 25 cents per dollar allocated under subsection (a). The State Matching Funds require each State with a city receiving grant amounts to provide funding at a rate of 25 cents per dollar allocated. The State resource index (R) is determined by dividing the term F by the term V, with F determined by a specific formula. The State Matching Funds require each State to provide funding at a rate of 25 cents per dollar allocated. The State Matching Funds require each State to provide funding at a rate of 25 cents per dollar allocated. The term 'G' in the formula refers to the sum of the respective terms 'Y' determined for the States, where 'Y' is calculated as the 3-year average of total taxable resources divided by the State cost index. The State cost index is determined by a specific formula. The formula .5 + .5(W) is used for State Matching Funds, with each State required to provide funding at a rate of 25 cents per dollar allocated. The State wage index (W) is determined by the average annual private industry wages per employee of the State divided by the average annual private industry wages per employee for the United States. The term 'V' is calculated as the quotient of the total amount 'Z'. The term 'Z' is determined by the total population of the State using data from the Secretary of Commerce. A special rule applies if the rate is over 25 cents per dollar. Grants must be used for eligible activities in a city.
