    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Abandoned and Medically Fragile Infants Assistance Act of 1995\". The Congress finds that the number of infants and young children exposed to drugs during pregnancy has increased dramatically, leading to abandonment in hospitals due to inadequate care and lack of suitable shelter homes. Many of these children remain in hospitals as boarder babies, which is costly and deprives them of a nurturing environment. Foster care personnel training is also inadequate. The increase in infants and young children infected with HIV or exposed to dangerous drugs has led to challenges in finding suitable foster homes. Many of these children have parents who are intravenous drug abusers, making placement even more difficult. This situation has resulted in a growing number of infants being abandoned in hospitals by mothers dying of AIDS. There is a need for comprehensive services for infants and young children affected by HIV or drug exposure, including foster care, case management, family support, counseling, and crisis intervention. Support is also needed for families to prevent abandonment of these children, along with funding strategies to coordinate resources for these services. Grants are available for projects addressing the abandonment of infants and young children in hospitals. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may grant funds to prevent abandonment of infants and young children, address their needs, assist them in residing with their families or in foster care, recruit foster families, and provide residential care programs. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may grant funds for programs to prevent abandonment of infants and young children, provide respite care, recruit and train personnel, and offer model programs for abandoned children in specific geographic areas. The Secretary may grant funds for programs prioritizing abandoned infants and young children infected with HIV or exposed to dangerous drugs, with a requirement for a case plan for foster care programs. The program provides care to infants and young children in foster homes or nonmedical residential settings away from parents. It requires a case plan for each child and a case review system. The Secretary may grant funds for programs focusing on abandoned infants and children with HIV or drug exposure, with a condition to use funds as specified in the application. The program requires approved applications for grants to ensure proper fiscal control, reporting annually on activities, costs, and outcomes. The Secretary may not grant funds without a submitted application providing assurances for the grant's purpose. The grant application must provide assurances of compliance satisfactory to the Secretary and be in the necessary form and contain required information. Grants are provided for nurturing home environments and family-centered services for medically fragile infants. The Secretary may grant funds to public and nonprofit entities for programs to prevent medical neglect of disabled infants with life-threatening conditions, improve services for them, and assist families in obtaining necessary services. The Secretary may grant funds for necessary services for families of disabled infants with life-threatening conditions, including social and health services, financial assistance, and services for adoptive placement. The Secretary will conduct evaluations of projects under the Act and disseminate information.
