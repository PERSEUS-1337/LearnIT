    "content": "The Administration's response to the September 11, 2001 events was swift and decisive, shifting to preemption with the \"Bush Doctrine\" to combat terrorism and Al Qaeda. Military force was used preemptively against terrorist groups, launching a full-scale campaign to dismantle Al Qaeda and its support structures. The international campaign against Al Qaeda involved military operations in Afghanistan with support from 136 countries. The Taliban regime was removed from power, Al Qaeda training sites were destroyed, and many leaders were captured or killed. President Bush stated that nearly half of the known Al Qaeda leadership had been dealt with by 2003. The United States launched a war against Iraq in 2003, targeting Saddam Hussein due to his alleged ties to terrorism and possession of weapons of mass destruction. After a swift military campaign, President Bush declared the end of Saddam Hussein's regime on April 15, 2003. In 2003, Saddam Hussein was arrested by U.S. personnel near Tikrit, declaring the end of his regime. U.S. forces were also deployed to Yemen, the Philippines, and Georgia for training local militaries. Military aid to Colombia was granted for counternarcotics and counterterrorism efforts. International cooperation, law enforcement, and economic development were highlighted in the National Strategy for Combating Terrorism. The United States has increased intelligence-sharing and law enforcement cooperation with other governments to combat terrorist cells globally. Approximately 3,000 terrorists and supporters have been detained in over 100 countries, with $124 million in assets frozen worldwide. The G-8 leaders announced plans to establish a Counter-Terrorism Action Group to aid nations in strengthening their counterterrorism efforts. The Counter-Terrorism Action Group was created to assist nations in enhancing their anti-terrorism capabilities through cooperation and capacity building. Certain states like Libya and Sudan have shown willingness to distance themselves from terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. Iran, however, remains the primary state sponsor of terrorism according to the Department of State. Iran, labeled as the primary state sponsor of terrorism by the Department of State, has been actively pursuing a nuclear development program, leading to concerns about its nuclear ambitions. Despite signing an agreement to suspend enrichment activities and allow inspections, Iran was found in violation of its obligations, resulting in the IAEA calling it into noncompliance with the NPT. The UN Security Council set a deadline for Iran to comply with resolutions. The U.N. Security Council passed a resolution on July 31, 2006, giving Iran a one-month deadline to comply with demands for halting enrichment or face possible sanctions. Iran insists on the \"right\" to continue its enrichment program for nuclear research. International terrorism poses a threat to U.S. foreign and domestic security, with concerns about radical Islamist groups exploiting tensions in various countries. Terrorist organizations are seen as a threat to U.S. foreign policy objectives, with concerns about their activities in countries lacking central governments. Al Qaeda affiliates were reported to be training operatives in the southern Philippines. The challenge of \"terrorist activity not functionally linked to any supporting nation\" is a growing concern for policymakers. Terrorists pose a significant challenge for U.S. policymakers, financing their activities through various illegal means such as narcotics, extortion, and kidnapping. Organizations like Colombia's FARC and Al Qaeda rely on a range of fundraising operations, including charities, businesses, and banking connections. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is a major concern, with reports of cross-national links among terrorist groups. State sponsors of terrorism like Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria are also worrisome. State sponsors of terrorism, including Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria, have been involved in WMD-related programs. Iran and North Korea have nuclear weapons-oriented programs. Terrorists have sought WMD technology, such as the Aum Shinrikyo cult acquiring Sarin gas in the 1990s. There are reports of Osama bin Laden's interest in WMD procurement, but evidence is limited. In 2001, bin Laden had discussions with Pakistani nuclear scientists about nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. Reports mentioned attempts to buy radioactive waste and reactor fuel. Al Qaeda was found to have built a dirty bomb in Afghanistan. In 2003, a plot to use ricin in England was disrupted. The Department of State releases an annual report on global terrorism, with the latest edition being Country Reports on Terrorism 2005. The National Counter Terrorism Center (NCTC) report analyzes trends in terrorism, highlighting the threat from radical Jihadists becoming more widespread and homegrown. Concerns about limited terrorist sanctuaries in democratic cities are growing. The emergence of \"micro actors\" is noted, influenced by the success in isolating Al Qaeda leadership. The NCTC report highlights trends in terrorism, including Al Qaeda's shift to a more ideological role and terrorists using global networks for their benefit. There is a growing overlap between terrorism and international crime, with an increase in suicide bombings. The report also links the unrest in Iraq to global terrorism, with a significant number of terror incidents and deaths in 2005 attributed to Iraq. The NCTC report released data on terrorist incidents in 2005, showing a significant increase in casualties compared to previous years. The report indicated 40,000 individuals were wounded or killed, with 14,602 deaths in 2005. The total reported terrorist attacks in 2005 numbered 11,111. However, some argue that the data concerning Iraq casualties may distort the global terrorism picture. Outside of Iraq, incidents with ten or more deaths remained consistent at 70 per year. The 2006 NCTC report suggests that higher casualty terror attacks, excluding Iraq, remain stable at approximately 70 per year. State sponsorship of terror is declining, with Iran listed as the most active sponsor. The report praises Saudi Arabia for its antiterrorism efforts but may downplay criticism of nations like Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. Libya and Sudan are noted for cooperating in the global war on terror, with Libya being removed from the U.S. list of state sponsors. The 2006 NCTC report highlights state sponsorship of terrorism, with Syria, Cuba, North Korea, and Lebanon mentioned for various reasons. Syria provides support to Hezbollah and Palestinian groups, while Cuba and North Korea lack anti-terror cooperation. North Korea's nuclear program is seen as a major concern for potential WMD sales to terrorists. Lebanon is recognized for supporting terrorist organizations like Hezbollah. The State Department's 2006 report emphasizes that countries with weak counterterrorism resources can become sanctuaries for terrorists due to lack of governmental control. The report acknowledges that Al Qaeda's ideological nature makes it difficult to decisively defeat, but eliminating key leaders like Bin Laden and Al Zawahiri could help. International cooperation and capacity-building programs, such as the Anti-Terrorism Assistance Program, are crucial in combating terrorism. The State Department's report highlights the central role of Anti-Terrorism Assistance (ATA) in combating terrorism globally. Efforts to curb terrorist finances may have diminishing returns as many groups are self-supporting. The Administration declassified excerpts from a 2006 National Intelligence Estimate on Trends in Global Terrorism, which align with the State Department's findings. The declassified key judgments of the report were consistent with the State Department's findings on terrorism in 2005. Concerns were raised about the growth of radical Islamist political parties worldwide, some of which may be linked to terrorist activities. There is worry that these parties could create a political climate where terrorism is seen as acceptable, making their countries attractive to terrorist groups. Some groups in various countries are using political participation as an alternative to violence to secure their base, including Hamas and Hezbollah in the Middle East. The rise of terror-linked political parties poses a dilemma for the United States, balancing support for democracy with combating terrorism. Past administrations have used a range of measures such as diplomacy, sanctions, covert action, and military force to combat international terrorism. The Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 shifted U.S. policy towards deterring state sponsors of terrorism. It created a legal category of Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTO) to combat international terrorism. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 extended and strengthened provisions to combat international terrorism by creating a legal category of Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTO) and banning support to such groups. The State Department's 2006 global terrorism report listed 42 designated FTOs. U.S. anti-terrorism policy post-9/11 focused on preempting attacks from Al Qaeda and protecting the homeland by securing borders, critical infrastructures, and enhancing law enforcement and intelligence resources. The policy also aimed at denying access to weapons of mass destruction by rogue states and terrorist non-state actors. The White House's focus is on denying access to weapons of mass destruction by rogue states and terrorist non-state actors. In 2003, the Office of Management and Budget released a report detailing spending on combating terrorism and homeland security. Since 2001, Congress has appropriated around $430 billion for military and diplomatic efforts in the Global War On Terrorism, with unclear tracking of funds. Total appropriations are estimated at about $437 billion. Efforts to combat terrorism in democratic countries like the United States are complicated by conflicting goals of providing security and maintaining individual freedoms. The total appropriation for the war in Iraq through FY2006 was estimated at about $437 billion. The challenge for policymakers in combating terrorist activity is to identify and target the perpetrators, supporters, and sponsors of terrorism. International unity in applying sanctions against rogue states may deter overt support for terrorist groups, but covert support remains a concern. Increased deployment of intelligence and law enforcement assets is necessary to detect and prevent transfers of weapons and funding to terrorists. Identifying dual-use items that could be used for military purposes is also a significant challenge. The U.S. policy focuses on terrorist organizations like Al Qaeda and state supporters. New types of terrorists, not affiliated with established groups, pose a threat. Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, linked to the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, had no clear group affiliation. Disruption of groups like Al Qaeda could lead to individual or \"boutique\" terrorism. The profile of a 21st-century terrorist may be a private individual not affiliated with any established group, drawing support from like-minded individuals. Adjustments in counterterrorism policies may be needed as the focus shifts from state sponsors to individual terrorists. The challenge lies in condemning and combating terrorist activities without appearing anti-Islamic. Punishing states for supporting terrorism may conflict with other foreign policy objectives. The Bush Administration's response to September 11 events included using diplomacy to create a global anti-terror coalition. However, concerns exist that the Administration undervalued diplomacy and weakened its effectiveness by taking non-multilateral positions on international issues. Despite its limitations against determined terrorists, diplomatic measures are often the first choice for the United States to prevent conflicts from escalating. Some worry that U.S. diplomacy may not be proactive enough. Some believe U.S. diplomacy needs to be more proactive due to resource limitations. They argue that investing in extensive diplomatic relations and public diplomacy initiatives could enhance international anti-terror cooperation. Additionally, increasing funding for face-to-face diplomacy in culturally important regions could be a long-term investment in future relations. Embassies in hardship locations, particularly in the Middle East, are often understaffed or underfunded. Some argue that diplomacy is essential in combating terrorism, citing ongoing success against Al Qaeda. However, engaging with subnational groups is complicated by the lack of communication channels. While the U.S. has a policy of not negotiating with terrorists, some suggest that communication in certain cases could be beneficial. Communicating with terrorists may benefit U.S. interests, especially with well-established groups like Hezbollah or Hamas. Some experts suggest engagement over extermination, citing Colombia's peace process with FARC as an example. However, skepticism exists, with former CIA director James Woolsey warning that terrorists may not just want a seat at the table but to destroy it. In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, the Bush Administration considered involving state sponsors of terrorism like Libya, Sudan, and Syria in an Islamic coalition against Al Qaeda. While some cooperation was achieved, results, especially with Syria, were mixed. Critics argue that such initiatives divert attention from the need to take a firm stand against terrorism in all forms. The issue of engaging with states, organizations, or terrorist leaders is controversial, with differing views on the potential outcomes of direct contact. The Iraq Study Group Commission recommended the US engage in diplomatic dialogue with Iran and Syria. Public diplomacy through the media can influence public opinion and government actions, potentially mobilizing pressure on governments to combat terrorism. Public diplomacy through media coverage can influence public opinion in other countries to pressure governments to combat terrorism. The Bush Administration created the position of Undersecretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs to enhance the notion of winning hearts and minds. Karen Hughes, the current Undersecretary, faces challenges in implementing effective strategies across federal agencies. Karen Hughes, the Undersecretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs, faces the challenge of getting federal agencies to agree on a coordinated strategy. Sanctions can be unilateral or multilateral, targeting nations or terrorist groups' assets. President Bush signed Executive Order 13224 to freeze assets of individuals and organizations affiliated with bin Laden's network. The U.S. Treasury Department expanded the freeze list to include designated terrorist groups, supporters, and financiers of terror. UN Security Council Resolutions 1373 and 1390 required member states to freeze assets associated with terrorist organizations like the Taliban and Al Qaeda. Over $200 million in terrorist funds had been frozen worldwide by September 11, 2003. By September 11, 2003, around $200 million in terrorist funds had been frozen globally as a result of U.S. and U.N. financial initiatives. However, the effectiveness of these economic measures is uncertain as much of the flow of terrorist funds occurs outside formal banking channels. Al Qaeda's assets are believed to be held in untraceable forms like gold and diamonds, and some suggest that terrorist operations can be relatively inexpensive. Economic sanctions on nation-states involve various restrictions including trading, technology transfer, foreign assistance, export credits, and foreign exchange. Economic sanctions can involve trade restrictions, technology transfer limitations, foreign assistance cuts, and controls on foreign exchange and capital transactions. The President can use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose restrictions on economic relations during a national emergency declared for reasons of national security, foreign policy, or the economy. This act allows regulation of imports, exports, and financial transactions like fund transfers, foreign exchange, credit, and securities. The Libyan trade embargo is authorized by Section 504 of the International Security and Development Cooperation Act of 1985, while Section 505 allows for banning imports from countries supporting terrorism. Other laws that can be used against terrorism-supporting countries include the Export Administration Act of 1979 and the Arms Export Control Act. P.L. 90-629 prohibits arms sales to non-cooperating countries and withholds foreign assistance from nations providing military aid to terrorist-listed countries. The Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003, P.L. 108-175, also plays a role in sanctions. The Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003, P.L. 108-175, imposes sanctions on Syria for supporting terrorist groups and activities against U.S. policy. President Bush imposed economic sanctions on Syria in 2004 for failing to act against terrorist groups and foreign fighters entering Iraq through Syria. This resulted in a ban on most U.S. exports to Syria. The United States imposes economic sanctions on Syria and North Korea for supporting terrorism. Economic inducements can influence anti-terror cooperation, and efforts to address poverty and education can help prevent terrorism. Educational alternatives to Madrasas can help bring stability to weak countries, improve lifestyles, and reduce the appeal of extremist groups. Critics argue that economic conditions are not the sole driver of terrorism, pointing to resentment against specific countries, political orders, and religious fanaticism as important motivations. Osama bin Laden's wealth and the middle-class backgrounds of the 9/11 hijackers contradict the idea of economic deprivation as the main cause of terrorism. The ETA in Spain, a well-off organization, further complicates the link between poverty and terrorism. The Basque Fatherland and Liberty organization (ETA) in Spain is a well-heeled terrorist group. Economic conditions partly influence terrorist behavior, but political, ideological, and religious factors are often more significant. Covert activities like intelligence gathering and infiltration are used to understand and exploit terrorist organizations' intentions and vulnerabilities. Active covert actions may involve providing support during hostage crises or hijackings without public acknowledgment. Some nations use unconventional methods to neutralize terrorists and prevent attacks, such as intercepting funding or weapons, destroying WMD facilities, or capturing wanted terrorists. This activity may be seen as preemptive self-defense or a violation of international law. Senate and House Intelligence Committees recommended increasing covert actions to counter terrorism. In a December 10, 2002 report, committees recommended maximizing covert action to counter terrorism. U.S. legal doctrine allows trials to proceed regardless of how individuals are brought to the United States. Bringing wanted criminals to U.S. justice through means other than extradition can complicate foreign relations. The \"rendering\" of criminals to U.S. courts is permitted under limited circumstances. The \"rendering\" of wanted criminals to U.S. courts is permitted under limited circumstances by a June 21, 1995 Presidential Decision Directive (PDD-39). International cooperation in law enforcement, Customs control, and intelligence activities is essential for the Bush Administration's anti-terrorism policy. FBI agents stationed overseas in 50 countries aid in investigating terrorist crimes and gathering intelligence. DEA maintains offices in 62 countries to combat international terrorism. Extradition of terrorist suspects is a crucial law enforcement tool, but it faces limitations, including some countries' refusal to extradite. The U.S. faces limitations in extraditing terrorist suspects due to political and extraterritorial issues. To overcome these obstacles, the U.S. has resorted to extrajudicial transfers, or \"rendition,\" to obtain wanted terrorists. The State Department is negotiating treaties with fewer restrictions to facilitate the transfer of suspects. The U.S. has implemented a program offering rewards for information to prevent terrorism or apprehend criminals, with rewards up to $5 million. This program led to the arrest of Mir Amal Kansi and possibly Ramzi Yousef. The bounty for Osama bin Laden and Ayman al Zawahiri has been raised to $25 million. The bounty for the capture of Osama bin Laden and Ayman al Zawahiri has been increased to $25 million each. Military force, especially when used by a superpower like the United States, can be influential in combating terrorism. The U.S. has utilized military force in various anti-terrorism missions and operations in different regions. Successful use of military force for preemptive or retaliatory strikes requires the ability to identify terrorists. The use of military force for preemptive or retaliatory strikes against terrorists can be challenging due to the difficulty in identifying the perpetrators and their locations. Critics argue that military action can result in civilian casualties and damage to economic infrastructure in the target country. Despite these concerns, military force can also serve as a political message to nations supporting terrorism. The use of military force for preemptive or retaliatory strikes against terrorists can result in civilian casualties and damage to economic infrastructure. Mistakes in bombing campaigns can lead to anger against the United States and bolster terrorist recruitment efforts. Counterterrorist military attacks may radicalize sectors of the Muslim population and damage the U.S. image worldwide. Other risks include counter-retaliation, escalation by terrorist groups, failure to destroy leaders, and perception of ignoring international law. Financial costs are also a concern. The United States faces financial costs and criticism for its military presence in Afghanistan and Iraq. Al Qaeda aims to cause a financial blow to the U.S. and the West. The U.S. has joined anti-terrorism conventions, including prosecuting offenders for terrorism-related crimes. The Convention for the Marking of Plastic Explosives is an important convention with implementing legislation in P.L. 104-132. On July 26, 2002, the U.N. Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings and the U.N. Anti-Terrorism Financing Convention entered into force for the United States. Many experts suggest establishing an international court, possibly under the U.N., to adjudicate cases of international terrorist crimes. However, the U.S. has concerns about losing national sovereignty by granting jurisdiction to international courts like the International Criminal Court. Some propose working with the media to promote voluntary guidelines for reporting on terrorism, but others believe that \"media self-restraint\" is unrealistic as sensationalism prevails. The media have been manipulated in the past to serve terrorist goals, but are now more aware of their role. The media's role in promoting terrorist goals has been a concern, leading to calls for reconfiguring the government's approach to the global terrorist threat. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 was signed to consolidate federal agencies into the Department of Homeland Security, marking a significant reorganization of the government. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 reorganized the Federal government to address the global terrorist threat, including provisions for an information analysis element within DHS and increased law enforcement authority under the USA PATRIOT Act. The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States issued its final report in 2004, with 41 recommendations for combating terrorism. These recommendations align with the Administration's National Strategy for Combating Terrorism, focusing on diplomacy, intelligence, and preemption. The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States issued its final report in 2004 with recommendations for combating terrorism, including preemption, protection, coordination, centralization of oversight, and enhancing agency capacities. The report indirectly addresses issues in the U.S.-Saudi relationship. Recommendations are at various stages of acceptance, funding, and implementation. The Bush Administration conducted a high-level internal review of its anti-terrorism strategy in 2005, focusing on combating violent extremism and boosting public diplomacy. A new national anti-terrorism strategic approach was developed, with goals to defeat terrorism and create an inhospitable environment for it worldwide. Lead and subordinate agencies were designated to carry out tasks such as destroying Al Qaeda. The 2006 National Strategy for Combating Terrorism emphasizes the importance of engaging in the \"war of ideas\" to confront radical ideologies justifying terrorism. This approach aims to strengthen the ideological component in the long-term fight against terrorism, alongside other efforts to protect the homeland and attack terrorists. The policy emphasizes confronting radical ideology justifying violence in the name of religion. Advancing effective democracies is crucial to reducing terrorist support and recruitment. The strategy assumes it is possible to promote democracies in regions where minority rights may not be respected, and that terrorists are less likely to recruit in democratic societies. The National Security Council (NSC) advises the President on national security and foreign policy, coordinating policy among government agencies on interdisciplinary issues such as terrorism. Under the NSC structure are committees and working groups addressing terrorism issues. The Counterterrorism Security Group (CSG) and Homeland Security Council (HSC) are key committees and working groups that address terrorism issues. The CSG includes high-level representatives from various departments and agencies, while the HSC coordinates policy and operations to prevent, respond to, and recover from terrorist attacks within the United States. The Department of State leads U.S. efforts in combating terrorism through diplomacy and foreign aid. The Department of Justice handles law enforcement matters related to terrorism. President Bush signed the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, creating the Director of National Intelligence position and the National Counterterrorism Center. The State Department coordinates counterterrorism plans and activities, providing daily threat information to policymakers. The Antiterrorism Assistance Program trains individuals from foreign countries in skills like crisis management and bomb detection. President Bush established the Terrorist Screening Center in 2003 to consolidate the U.S. government's approach to terrorist screening. The National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) and the Terrorist Screening Center (TSC) were established to consolidate the U.S. government's approach to terrorist screening. The NCTC serves as a central hub for analyzing information on international terrorist threats, maintaining the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE) with over 325,000 terrorist-related records. The TSC, administered by the FBI, is a multi-agency collaborative effort. The Terrorist Screening Center (TSC) collaborates with the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) to maintain the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) with data from TIDE on international terrorists. The TSDB includes nearly 238,000 records and is used to distribute lookout records to various agencies. The TSC also provides operational support for encounters with known and suspected terrorists, assisting agencies like the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP). The Department of State's Terrorist Interdiction Program (TIP) helps foreign governments improve border control with a screening system. TIP provides real-time verification of traveler identities at border crossings. Congressional interest includes facilitating compensation for terrorism victims. The State Department's Counterterrorism Research and Development Program focuses on addressing the threat posed by sophisticated equipment and technology available to terrorist groups. It includes projects on chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear countermeasures, explosives detection, and improvised devices. The State Department's Counterterrorism Research and Development Program focuses on addressing threats posed by sophisticated equipment and technology available to terrorist groups, including biological, radiological, and nuclear countermeasures, explosives detection, infrastructure protection, and personnel protection. TSWG activities are funded by State and DOD, with a focus on various security measures such as surveillance operations support and tactical operations support. The Diplomatic Security Program aims to protect U.S. personnel, information, and facilities domestically and abroad through secure facility construction, security guards, and counterintelligence efforts. Terrorists are targeting economic infrastructure and tourism, highlighting the need for programs to combat terrorism by safeguarding nuclear materials and detecting threats. Programs to combat terrorism focus on safeguarding nuclear materials, detecting weapons, protecting critical infrastructure, and enhancing security. Despite efforts, some terrorist acts may succeed, leading to the need for robust response capabilities in disaster management. Difficult issues arise regarding cost-effectiveness and acceptable losses in anti-terror efforts. Further reform and enhancement of programs are being considered. The battle for hearts and minds in the fight against modern-day terrorism is ongoing, with the U.S. facing challenges in its public diplomacy efforts. Some argue that the ineffectiveness of these efforts is due to a mismatch between U.S. foreign policy and its promotion of democracy and human rights. The U.S. faces challenges in public diplomacy efforts, supporting regimes with room for improvement in values. Resources are consolidating, not expanding, with the former U.S. Information Agency now part of the State Department. The Strategic Information Initiative failed due to public opinion and lack of support. Extremist groups' activities have led to increased acceptance of radical views. Extremist views are being spread through radical madrasas and Hezbollah charities, targeting vulnerable populations. The U.S. and Western countries need to address this growing threat of radicalization among Muslim youth to prevent increased terrorism. The evolving demographics and political alliances require a shift in public diplomacy efforts to promote freedom and democracy. The world's demographics, economics, and political alliances are changing. Extremist views are being spread to youth in high birth rate countries with oil revenues that could influence public opinion. The U.S. needs to improve its public diplomacy efforts to counter hostile ideologies effectively. The U.S. government has created the Middle East Television Network (METN) to counter radical Islamist groups' information-based activities in the Middle East. Supporters believe U.S. television can help change negative perceptions of U.S. policy in the Arab media. The effectiveness of these programming efforts still needs to be evaluated. The U.S. government has requested $79 million for programming efforts including the Al-Hurra satellite TV network and Radio Sawa. The fight against terrorism is a long-term strategy involving various fronts to slow its spread and address root causes. The U.S. government is seeking to promote tolerance, modernize education, interdict weapons, and promote democratic institutions. Efforts overlap with counternarcotics and counterterrorism strategies, cultural exchange programs, humanitarian assistance, and human rights promotion. Challenges remain in developing a strategy to marginalize radical jihadist extremists and determining coordination and implementation responsibilities. The role of the U.S. Department of State in these efforts is uncertain. The U.S. Department of State's ability to effectively fight the cold war of ideology is being questioned. Suggestions include reviving the United States Information Agency or creating a new entity solely for public diplomacy. The Department of Defense or CIA may be better equipped for this mission, but it could be perceived as less credible if associated with defense or intelligence agencies. These issues may require further attention from Congress. The CRS reports cover various topics related to terrorism, including the 9/11 Commission recommendations, global economic costs of terrorism, Al Qaeda's ideology and threat assessment, combating terrorism effectiveness, intelligence and law enforcement, Islamist extremism in Europe, the National Counterterrorism Center, and the Navy's role in irregular warfare and counterterrorism. There is no universally accepted definition of international terrorism, but one widely used in U.S. government circles involves terrorism that affects citizens or property of more than one country. Terrorism is politically motivated violence. International terrorism is broadly defined as politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents. This definition includes traditional forms of violence as well as cyberterrorism, which involves more sophisticated forms of destruction and extortion. The focus is typically on groups, but there is a rising trend of individual (\"lone wolf\") terrorist activity that is not organizationally aligned with any group. The October 12, 2000 bombing of the U.S.S. Cole raised questions about categorizing attacks as terrorism due to the target being a military vessel. Current definitions of terrorism focus on politically or religiously motivated behavior, with groups like Al Qaeda emphasizing radical religious ideologies in driving violence. Osama bin Laden's fatwah in 1998 called for killing Americans, highlighting the role of religious motivation in terrorist acts. The growth of criminal organizations has led to widespread violence for financial gain. Definitions of terrorism do not always include violence for profit, leading to disagreements internationally. Countries have enacted laws to criminalize specific acts like kidnapping and bombing to combat terrorism. The 1999 International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism defines terrorism as the collection or provision of funds with the intent to harm civilians, intimidate a population, or coerce a government."
