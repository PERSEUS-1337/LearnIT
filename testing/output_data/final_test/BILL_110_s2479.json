The \"Catalyst to Better Diabetes Care Act of 2007\" includes provisions for a diabetes screening collaboration program, an advisory group for employee wellness, a National Diabetes Report Card, vital statistics improvement, and a study on diabetes medical education levels. Congress acknowledges diabetes as a growing public health issue in the US, with alarming statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2005, 20.8 million Americans had diabetes, 7% of the population. 6.2 million were undiagnosed. African-Americans and American Indians have higher rates. Diabetes costs $132 billion in direct and indirect costs. 18% of Medicare population has diabetes. Diabetes affects 18% of the Medicare population but consumes 32% of the budget. In 2002, diabetes contributed to 224,092 deaths, with underreporting common. The disease carries significant economic and human costs, causing over 224,000 deaths annually. Diabetes is a significant health issue in America, leading to a high number of deaths annually. People with diabetes have a higher risk of stroke, blindness, kidney failure, and amputations. In 2002, thousands of new cases of blindness, kidney failure, and amputations were reported among Americans with diabetes. Poorly controlled diabetes before conception and during the first trimester of pregnancy can lead to major birth defects in 5-10% of pregnancies and spontaneous abortions in 15-20% of pregnancies. Diabetes complications can be prevented through early detection, better education on self-management, and improved medical treatment delivery, potentially saving billions in hospital costs. Medicaid programs saved $2.5 billion in hospital costs in 2001. Lifestyle interventions for prediabetes reduced diabetes development by 58-71%. Detecting and treating diabetic eye disease can reduce severe vision loss by 50-60%. Comprehensive foot care programs can reduce amputation rates by 45-85%. Early detection and treatment of diabetic kidney disease are crucial. Early detection and treatment of diabetic kidney disease can reduce the decline in kidney function by 30 percent. DIABETES SCREENING COLLABORATION AND OUTREACH PROGRAM. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in collaboration with the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, will review and address issues with diabetes screening benefits utilization, establish an outreach program to increase awareness, and maximize cost effectiveness in increasing utilization. The Secretary and the Director will consult with various units of the Federal Government and entities with an interest in diabetes for screening benefits. SEC. 3. ADVISORY GROUP ON EMPLOYEE WELLNESS AND DISEASE MANAGEMENT BEST PRACTICES. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish an advisory group with representatives from public and private sectors, including the Department of Commerce, Department of Health and Human Services, and the Small Business Administration. The group will examine and recommend best practices for employee wellness and disease management programs to help save money and improve quality of life for patients with chronic illnesses. The advisory group established by the Secretary of Health and Human Services will submit a report on the examination of best practices for employee wellness and disease management programs within one year of the enactment of the Act. SEC. 4. NATIONAL DIABETES REPORT CARD. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in collaboration with the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, prepares a national diabetes report card biennially. The report includes health outcomes for individuals with diabetes and prediabetes, covering preventative care practices, risk factors, and outcomes. Updated reports include trend analysis for the nation and each state. The Secretary, in collaboration with the Director, prepares a national diabetes report card biennially to track progress in meeting national goals for improving diabetes care and inform policy development. The Report Card is made publicly available, including online. Improvement of vital statistics collection. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in collaboration with relevant agencies and States, aims to promote physician education on birth and death certificate data, encourage adoption of updated certificate standards, and assist States in enhancing their vital statistics systems for better data accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, the Secretary may support improvements in death certificate data collection. The Secretary may promote improvements to diabetes mortality data collection by adding a question about diabetes on death certificates. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct a study with the Institute of Medicine on the impact of diabetes on medical practice in the US and the required level of diabetes education for licensure. A report will be submitted to relevant Congressional committees within 2 years."
