The Security Officer Screening Improvement Act of 2016 highlights the need for criminal history background checks for private security officers to ensure public safety. The FBI's fingerprint database holds records of over 71 million individuals, but many security officers still lack proper background checks required by federal and state laws. The National Child Protection Act of 1993 is amended to include a program for national criminal history background checks. The definitions in this section include terms like 'covered entity' for employers of private security officers, 'covered individual' for those employed or applying for such positions, 'criminal history review designee' for the entity designated to carry out background checks, 'criminal history review program' for the established program, 'qualified State program' for state agencies providing access to background checks, and 'private security officer' for individuals in this role. The State law establishes a program to provide criminal history background checks for private security officers and prospective officers. The term 'private security officer' is defined in the Private Security Officer Employment Authorization Act of 2004, and 'State' includes various regions within the United States. The Attorney General will establish policies and procedures for private security officers to undergo criminal history reviews through State and national background checks. Designees may be appointed to carry out these duties. The Attorney General will establish policies and procedures for private security officers to undergo criminal history reviews through State and national background checks.

National criminal history background checks will be completed upon request, and information will be shared with the criminal history review designee. The Attorney General will establish policies and procedures for private security officers to undergo criminal history reviews through State and national background checks. Requests for background checks must include fingerprints, required documents for State checks, and a fee. Additionally, the Attorney General will collect a fee to cover the costs of the national criminal history background check. The Attorney General will establish procedures for criminal history reviews to provide reliable information on covered individuals' fitness for security services. This includes collecting a fee to cover the costs of conducting the criminal history review and remitting it to the FBI. The Attorney General will establish procedures for criminal history reviews to determine the fitness of individuals for security services. Criminal history records indicating potential concerns will be conveyed to the requesting entity, along with guidance to consult the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Enforcement Guidance #915.002.

Application processing will be established for covered entities. The Attorney General will establish procedures for criminal history reviews for covered entities to obtain State and national background checks. Covered individuals can challenge the completeness of their records with the FBI. The Attorney General will determine covered entity participation, and entities authorized to handle fingerprints and criminal history records must maintain privacy. The FBI will retain fingerprints and criminal history records for verification, investigation, and notification services, ensuring confidentiality and limited use of the information. The FBI may retain fingerprints for verification, investigation, or notification services, and for the retention of criminal history. This does not replace any existing background check programs authorized by Federal or State law."
