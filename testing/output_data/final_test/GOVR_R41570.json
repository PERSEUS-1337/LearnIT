    "content": "The United States has expanded its refugee resettlement program to include a broader representation of nationalities from around the world, with over 10 million refugees currently in need. While previously dominated by a few nationalities with family ties in the US, the program now includes refugees from over 60 nationalities processed in 90 countries, with over 80% referred by UNHCR. The Administration has collaborated with Congress to allocate resources for this effort. The U.S. government has collaborated with Congress to invest resources in resettling a diverse group of refugees, aiming to achieve economic self-sufficiency for them upon arrival in the United States. The refugee resettlement assistance programs, administered by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, provide transitional support to refugees and designated groups. The U.S. government collaborates with Congress to invest in resettling refugees for economic self-sufficiency upon arrival in the United States. In recent years, achieving self-sufficiency has been challenging due to economic recession. HHS requested additional funding for refugee resettlement in FY2011. The Department of State administers the Reception and Placement Program for newly arriving refugees, providing initial resettlement services and referrals. DOS increased the grant for these agencies from $900 to $1,800 per refugee in 2010. The Obama Administration has initiated a review of refugee resettlement, led by the National Security Council. The review involves consultation with federal agencies, including HHS and DOS, and refugee advocates. Results are anticipated to energize reform efforts in the refugee resettlement assistance system. The report discusses resettlement assistance programs for refugees in the United States authorized by the Immigration and Nationality Act. It outlines key issues, challenges, and policy options for reforming the current system. Refugee admissions and resettlement are governed by the Refugee Act of 1980, with procedures for determining admissions levels and criteria for permanent residency. The Refugee Act of 1980 amended the Immigration and Nationality Act to establish refugee assistance programs in the United States. It requires refugees to apply for legal permanent resident status after one year. The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) at HHS administers these programs for various humanitarian admissions categories. A refugee is a person outside their country unable to return due to persecution based on race, religion, nationality, social group, or political opinion. Asylees are refugees granted asylum in the United States. Cuban and Haitian entrants are also considered refugees. A Cuban and Haitian entrant is an individual granted parole status as a Cuban/Haitian Entrant or any other special status for nationals of Cuba or Haiti. They can also be individuals from Cuba or Haiti who were paroled into the US, are in removal proceedings, have an asylum application pending, and do not have a final order of removal. Victims of severe trafficking are those subjected to severe forms of trafficking such as sex trafficking, and are either under 18 or adults. Amerasians are aliens residing in Vietnam who can prove they were born there to a US citizen between 1962 and 1976. They can also be spouses or children of these individuals. Iraqi and Afghan Special Immigrants are admitted to the United States as legal permanent residents under special programs for those who have worked with the U.S. Armed Forces or government in Iraq and Afghanistan. The U.S. government has special immigrant programs for Iraqis and Afghans who have worked for or on behalf of the U.S. government in their respective countries. These programs aim to assist refugees in achieving economic self-sufficiency. Over the past 30 years, changes in refugee populations, resettlement programs, policies, and economic conditions have impacted the ability of refugees to become self-sufficient. Since the early years of the U.S. refugee program, data related to economic adjustment, including education and English language proficiency, have been collected about refugees in the United States. Table 1 shows self-reported data on education and English language ability at the time of U.S. entry for Southeast Asian refugees. In 1982 and 1986, Southeast Asian refugees from Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam accounted for a significant portion of total annual refugee arrivals. In recent years, refugee arrivals in the U.S. have shown higher education levels but lower English language proficiency. Changes in refugee eligibility for public assistance have led to limited cash and medical assistance since 1991, compared to the initial 36-month assistance period established in 1980. Since 1991, refugee assistance in the U.S. has been limited to eight months, impacting the economic success of Vietnamese refugees. Reforms to federal assistance programs have tightened eligibility requirements. Economic fluctuations can affect refugees' resettlement success. The INA authorizes various refugee assistance programs. The Refugee Act of 1980 authorized the initial resettlement program for refugees, administered by the Department of State. The program primarily serves aliens admitted to the U.S. as refugees, including Iraqi and Afghan special immigrants. Other ORR programs for refugee minors, unaccompanied alien children, torture survivors, and trafficking victims are not covered in this report. Special immigrants must accept all associated benefits to receive DOS benefits under the Reception and Placement Program. This includes travel arrangements by the International Organization for Migration and initial services provided by voluntary agencies. Services include pre-arrival placement, reception upon arrival, basic needs support for 30 days, and referrals to health and employment. The ORR director and agency administering the Reception and Placement Program consult with State and local governments and voluntary agencies for refugee distribution. Policies for refugee placement and resettlement are developed in consultation with voluntary agencies and governments. Voluntary agencies applying for grant proposals must provide data and narrative information. Proposals for FY2011 required abstracts about affiliates, including reasons for resettling refugees, assessment of housing, transportation, and employment, available services, capacity for special needs cases, and ability to resettle new refugee groups. Consultations held by affiliates also needed to be described. The affiliates consulted with state and local officials and stakeholders to prepare the proposal, including the state refugee coordinator and state refugee health coordinator. Decisions on resettling approved refugee cases are made at weekly meetings in Arlington, VA based on biographical data. Initial resettlement services are provided by voluntary agencies using Reception and Placement Program funds. The Reception and Placement Program funds for initial resettlement services increased from $900 to $1,800 per refugee in January 2010. The increase was due to insufficient resources for quality resettlement. $1,100 of the grant must be used for direct support of refugees, while up to $700 can be used for program management. Obligated funds for the program increased from FY2006 to FY2010. The refugee resettlement assistance program in the United States is justified by the federal government's decision to admit refugees on humanitarian grounds. Unlike immigrants, refugees are not required to demonstrate economic self-support and are provided with resources for employment training, English language training, and cash assistance to achieve economic self-sufficiency quickly. The INA authorizes the ORR director to provide cash and medical assistance, social services projects, and targeted assistance for refugees to ensure their economic self-sufficiency and equal opportunities for women. Refugees may receive assistance from programs like TANF and SSI for up to five and seven years, respectively, and may also enroll in Medicaid if eligible. Refugees who meet Medicaid eligibility requirements can enroll in the program for seven years. Some refugees may meet income and resource standards for means-tested programs but not qualify categorically. For example, single individuals and childless couples do not qualify for TANF. Historically, most nonelderly childless adults could not receive Medicaid. Refugees who meet financial requirements but are categorically ineligible for programs can receive special refugee cash assistance (RCA) and refugee medical assistance (RMA) under the INA. Cash assistance for employable refugees is conditioned on registration with an employment service and participation in social services. The eligibility period for refugee cash assistance (RCA) and refugee medical assistance (RMA) is limited to eight months, starting at different times for different beneficiary groups. The refugee social services program focuses on economic self-sufficiency, providing job training and language assistance to refugees. The ORR director can fund projects to help refugees acquire necessary skills for employment. Projects are designed to assist refugees in obtaining skills for economic self-sufficiency, including job training, employment services, day care, and health services. Funding is provided through formula grants to states and discretionary grants. Formula grants are available to refugees in the U.S. for less than five years, allocated based on the number of refugees who arrived in the past 36 months. For FY2010, ORR revised the funding formula to base allocations on refugee arrivals in the last two years to provide more accurate funds allocation. Social services discretionary grants are awarded to states, state-alternative programs, and nonprofit agencies to assist refugees who have been in the U.S. for more than five years. Targeted assistance aims to promote refugee employment and self-sufficiency in counties and similar areas. Targeted assistance for refugee employment and self-sufficiency is provided through formula and discretionary grants, benefiting counties with high refugee populations and public assistance use. Funding allocations are now based on arrivals data for the past two years to meet the needs of newly arriving refugees and ensure their long-term self-sufficiency. The ORR provides targeted assistance for refugee employment and self-sufficiency through formula and discretionary grants. Funding is allocated based on arrivals data to support newly arriving refugees and promote their long-term self-sufficiency. Funding data for selected ORR programs, including transitional and medical services, social services, and targeted assistance, is provided in Table 3 for FY2006-FY2011. The Administration is requesting funding increases for transitional and medical services and social services discretionary grants in FY2011. The Administration is requesting funding increases for transitional and medical services and social services discretionary grants to establish a $25 million contingency fund for refugees facing emergencies during the recession. Refugees in the United States may receive cash assistance, medical aid, and employment services through various programs based on their circumstances and location. The Office of Refugee Resettlement provides funding for state-administered programs that offer cash assistance and medical aid to eligible refugees. States may choose to administer these programs if they believe it is more effective than community-based organizations. Formula social services grants are given to states based on the number of refugee arrivals in the last two years. States may receive competitively awarded social services discretionary grants in five program areas: Cuban/Haitian; Preventive Health; School Impact; Services to Older Refugees; and Targeted Assistance. States also have the option of establishing a public/private partnership for Refugee Cash Assistance programs. The public/private partnership model for Refugee Cash Assistance programs operates in five states: Maryland, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Oregon, and Texas. This model aims to strengthen the link between refugee placement and social service programs, offering higher payment levels compared to state-administered programs. The Wilson/Fish amendment directs the HHS Secretary to develop alternatives to state-administered refugee resettlement assistance, leading to the establishment of alternative Wilson/Fish projects providing interim support, medical services, and support services to refugees. The Wilson/Fish program provides interim support, medical services, and case management to refugees to promote self-sufficiency and reduce welfare dependency. It also ensures refugee assistance programs in states where refugees are resettled, funding projects in 12 states and one county. Funds for Wilson/Fish projects come from refugee cash and medical assistance. Wilson/Fish projects in San Diego County, CA are funded through refugee cash and medical assistance funds, social services formula allocations, and competitively awarded grants. These projects focus on providing intensive services to refugees, integrating case management, cash assistance, and employment services under one culturally and linguistically equipped agency. They also use innovative strategies for cash assistance tied to employment goals. These projects may offer higher payment levels similar to PPP. The Wilson/Fish projects provide cash assistance to TANF-eligible refugees through a self-sufficiency plan. The Voluntary Agency Matching Grant Program helps refugees become self-sufficient within their first four or six months in the United States by offering services like case management, job placement, and interim housing. The Matching Grant Program (MG) offers case management, job placement, interim housing, and cash assistance to refugees. There are MG program sites in most states, with federal funding drawn from transitional and medical services funds. The program is voluntary for both refugees and voluntary agencies, with a one dollar match for every two federal dollars provided. To be eligible, at least one person in the refugee unit must be employable, and refugees cannot receive other public cash assistance while participating in the program. Refugees eligible for resettlement assistance may receive RMA but cannot receive TANF, RCA, or other public cash assistance. ORR provides competitive social services discretionary grants to states and public agencies in various program areas. States use different approaches to deliver resettlement assistance, as shown in a 2008 evaluation of refugee social services programs in California, Florida, and Texas. In California, Florida, and Texas, different approaches to providing refugee cash assistance and social services were discussed. Texas, for instance, offers refugee cash assistance through a public/private partnership and a Matching Grant program that provides greater benefits than TANF. This is due to Texas offering low TANF benefits and receiving a diverse group of refugees annually, requiring cultural competency that voluntary agencies can provide. The state of Florida has a state-administered refugee assistance program, receiving a stable group of refugees from Cuba and Haiti. Welfare agencies have developed cultural understanding to serve this population. The United States has admitted a diverse group of refugees, presenting new challenges in providing extended employment services for integration into society. Many arriving refugees in the U.S. face challenges integrating into society due to limited work skills, trauma, and disabilities. Questions have been raised about the adequacy of the existing refugee resettlement assistance program to meet their needs. A 2010 congressional report highlighted that the current systems are outdated and fail to address the needs of culturally diverse refugee populations. The report highlights challenges faced by culturally diverse refugee populations in the U.S., with a focus on strains on local communities and the limits of the resettlement system. Reports also discuss the resettlement of Iraqi refugees in specific locations like Atlanta and Phoenix. The report focuses on challenges faced by Iraqi refugees resettled in Atlanta, GA, and Phoenix, AZ, highlighting issues with the U.S. refugee resettlement assistance program. The program faces broad challenges, including weak linkages between initial reception and longer-term services for refugees. The lack of information sharing among agencies involved in the U.S. refugee admissions and resettlement systems has been noted in several reports. This includes gaps in sharing information between federal and local agencies, as well as limited sharing of refugee cases between different organizations. Recent reports have highlighted the need for better information sharing to ensure refugee needs are met. The IRC report and Refugee Crisis in America found that federal funding for resettlement assistance is insufficient for refugees to achieve long-term sufficiency and integration. Funding is lacking for cash assistance, employment services, English language training, education, housing, and medical treatment. Allocation formulas for social services and targeted assistance funding are also problematic, impacting service providers' ability to meet refugees' needs. The Senate report highlighted the strain on local communities due to the refugee resettlement system, with insufficient resources and lack of information provided to resettlement communities. This leaves newer communities without the necessary resources to support incoming refugees. Secondary migration can pose challenges for communities and refugees, as there are inadequate mechanisms to track and anticipate trends in movement. This lack of tracking hinders the allocation of resources to areas in need, leading to delays in resettlement assistance. Some question the effectiveness of the historical emphasis on quick employment in refugee resettlement. Refugee Crisis in America criticizes mainstream public assistance programs like TANF and Medicaid for being misguided in helping refugees. Refugees face unique challenges such as rebuilding their lives in a foreign country, learning a new language, and adapting to a new way of life. The 2009 IRC report on Iraqi refugees highlighted barriers like trauma, illness, and the struggle of Iraqi widows with young children to find employment. These challenges provide context for specific concerns about refugee resettlement. Some key issues with the resettlement assistance program include the criticism that eight months of cash assistance is insufficient for refugees to become self-supporting. The dollar amount of assistance provided is also deemed insufficient to cover basic necessities, according to the 2009 International Rescue Committee report. The cash assistance provided to refugees is often insufficient to cover rent and basic necessities. Many refugees rely on money from relatives in Iraq for help with housing. Assistance levels vary by state and county, leading to disparities in support. Refugees in states with generous welfare programs fare better than those in states with less assistance. The U.S. refugee resettlement program faces challenges in helping refugees find employment due to economic difficulties. Refugees from countries like Burma, Bhutan, and Burundi may struggle with work experience, education, and English proficiency, making it hard to adapt to the U.S. labor market. Refugees with limited work experience, education, and English proficiency struggle to find jobs in the U.S. Iraqi professionals also face challenges in finding comparable jobs. Many educated Iraqis realize they need to accept any job, even if it doesn't utilize their skills fully. They believe they could contribute more to American society if given time and resources to recertify in their professions. Refugee Crisis in America highlights the challenges faced by Iraqi refugees in finding suitable employment due to being pushed towards lower-paying jobs despite their professional credentials. Limited public assistance duration hinders their ability to pursue recertification or higher education without government financial aid. Additionally, an increasing number of incoming refugees have untreated health conditions from living in inadequate refugee camp settings, requiring treatment before entering the workforce. Needy refugees, particularly Iraqi refugees, face challenges in finding employment due to limited public assistance duration and untreated health conditions. Proficiency in English is crucial for economic self-sufficiency, with lack of language ability hindering access to healthcare and law enforcement. Refugee caseworkers emphasize the importance of English language skills for long-term employment success. Recent reports indicate that refugees face challenges in accessing quality English language training for resettlement assistance. The existing system may need reforms in administration, planning, and legislative action to address these issues effectively. Policy options in the administration and planning category aim to improve coordination among entities involved in refugee admissions and resettlement. A lead agency could establish policies for consistency, while information-sharing mechanisms could enhance communication among agencies and organizations. Policy options in the administration and planning category suggest improving coordination among entities involved in refugee admissions and resettlement. This includes sharing processing information with ORR, voluntary agencies, and local affiliates to anticipate new arrivals' needs. Enhancing communication and information sharing between PRM and ORR, as well as establishing two-way information sharing mechanisms between voluntary agencies, local officials, and service providers in resettlement communities, could also be beneficial. Additionally, giving state and local officials a formal role in the refugee placement process and tracking secondary migration in real time are proposed reforms for the refugee resettlement system. Options for reforming the refugee resettlement assistance programs include tracking secondary migration in real time to determine resource needs and revising formulas for allocating social services and funding. Establishing a system to facilitate assistance for refugees who relocate to new communities is also suggested. Observers recommend increasing funding for existing programs like cash assistance and social services. Increased funding for refugee resettlement programs could enhance monthly cash assistance benefits, extend eligibility periods, and expand the Voluntary Agency Matching Grant Program. Targeted funding for employment services like English language training and improved access to mental health services, especially for those who have experienced trauma, are also recommended. Many argue for increasing refugee cash assistance levels and reforming the system by de-linking it from TANF. Tailoring employment services to refugees' needs, such as job recertification and vocational training, could improve their long-term employment prospects. The Obama Administration has taken steps to provide additional resources for refugee resettlement assistance programs, but many believe more comprehensive reform is needed for successful integration. It is uncertain if further steps will be taken by the Administration or if Congress will pursue reform through legislation. The results of the NSC-led interagency review may help garner support for specific reforms."
