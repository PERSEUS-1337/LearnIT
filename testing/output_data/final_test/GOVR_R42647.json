    "content": "The federal agencies' program activities are funded annually through appropriations acts. If these acts are not enacted by the start of the fiscal year, continuing resolutions (CRs) provide temporary funding. A CR can be in the form of a joint resolution or a bill. If appropriations are not enacted, a funding gap occurs. During a fiscal year, a \"funding gap\" can occur if appropriations are not provided through a regular appropriations act or a CR. This may lead to a shutdown of affected programs and activities as federal agencies are prohibited from spending funds without appropriations. Congress has enacted numerous CRs over the years, with an average of four CRs per fiscal year. The report provides an overview of CR components and congressional practices related to their use. The report explains the main components of CRs and discusses the enactment of regular appropriations acts. It also provides information on the variation in the number and duration of CRs enacted each fiscal year. Additionally, it discusses the features of \"full-year CRs\" that provided funding through the remainder of the fiscal year. See Table 4 in the report for more details. A list of CRs enacted between FY1977 and FY2019 is provided in Table 5 of the report. CRs include funding for specific activities, budget authority for a set time period, overall funding rate, restrictions on new activities, adjustments through anomalies, and legislative provisions. A CR provides funds for specified activities, with adjustments through anomalies and legislative provisions included in some cases. The coverage of a CR is typically defined with reference to activities funded in previous fiscal years' appropriations acts. For further analysis on potential impacts on budget execution or agency operations, refer to CRS Report RL34700. In Section 101 of P.L. 111-68, the continuing resolution for FY2010 included funding for activities from previous fiscal years' appropriations acts, such as the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2008 and the Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009. The continuing resolution for FY2010 included funding for activities from previous fiscal years' appropriations acts, such as the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2008 and the Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009. CRs may specify coverage with reference to regular appropriations bills for the current fiscal year that have yet to be enacted, potentially excluding activities funded in the previous fiscal year unless included in the current year's appropriations bill. The continuing resolution for FY2010 included funding for activities from previous fiscal years' appropriations acts. Section 101 of P.L. 105-240 specified that funding would continue under certain circumstances, including for projects or activities from the fiscal year 1998. The continuing resolution for FY2010 included funding for activities from previous fiscal years' appropriations acts. CRs may be enacted as stand-alone legislative vehicles or as provisions attached to a regular appropriations bill or an omnibus bill. In instances where regular appropriations bills are near completion, a CR may be included in the same legislative vehicle to cover activities not yet funded. The continuing resolution (CR) provides budget authority for covered activities for a specified period, ending upon the enactment of regular appropriations or a specified expiration date. Additional CRs may be enacted if needed to prevent funding gaps and allow time to complete remaining appropriations bills. The continuing resolution (CR) allows for additional time to complete regular appropriations bills, with CRs sometimes lasting for brief periods or extending for weeks or months. Multiple CRs may be enacted in a fiscal year, with subsequent CRs replacing the expiration date of the previous one. The continuing resolution (CR) extends the duration of funding for covered activities, with subsequent appropriations measures or specified conditions superseding the CR. Regular appropriations bills may replace CR funding for covered activities, while other activities in the CR continue to be funded unless superseded or the CR expires. Funding for certain activities may be shortened based on specified conditions in the CR. The CR extends funding for covered activities, with subsequent appropriations or conditions superseding it. Regular appropriations may replace CR funding, while other activities continue unless superseded or the CR expires. Funding for certain activities may be shortened based on specified conditions. A CR extends funding for activities until a specified date, while regular appropriations cover activities for the remainder of the fiscal year. Full-year CRs can fund all bills or include the text of regular appropriations bills. CRs often fund activities under a formula-type approach known as the \"funding rate,\" which provides budget authority at a restricted level based on a reference level multiplied by the fraction of the fiscal year. This is different from regular and supplemental appropriations acts, which specify amounts for each account. CRs often fund activities using a \"funding rate\" approach, which provides budget authority based on a reference level multiplied by the fraction of the fiscal year. This is different from regular and supplemental appropriations acts, which specify amounts for each account. In previous years, CRs have provided funding across accounts by referencing the amount of budget authority available in specified appropriations acts from the previous fiscal year. The Appropriations Act, 2008 (P.L. 110-161) and other Continuing Resolutions (CRs) provide funding based on previous fiscal year levels, with adjustments up or down. For example, P.L. 112-33 for FY2012 reduced funding by 1.503 percent compared to FY2011 levels. The funding rate under subsection (a) is reduced by 1.503 percent. Different types of funding rates have been used in continuing appropriations, such as variable funding rates based on various reference sources like regular appropriations bills, the President's budget request, or previous year's budget authority. If no funding is provided in appropriations bills, the rate is based on the lower of the President's request or current operations. Continuing resolutions (CRs) may provide funding at different rates, with some incorporating actual text from regular appropriations bills. For example, P.L. 112-10 funded the Department of Defense through a regular appropriations bill, while providing formulaic funding for other activities. The funding rate in a CR applies to activities not covered in the incorporated bills. Funds in CRs can be used as specified in previous appropriations acts. Continuing resolutions (CRs) may restrict the use of funds to activities funded in the previous fiscal year, known as a prohibition on \"new starts.\" They may also retain conditions and limitations on program activity from previous appropriations acts. An example of such language is seen in P.L. 112-33, which specifies that funds should be used in the same manner as the pertinent appropriations Act and prohibits the initiation or resumption of projects without available funds from the previous fiscal year. Continuing resolutions (CRs) may include provisions known as \"anomalies\" that allow for exceptions to the duration, amount, or purposes for which funds may be used for certain activities. Anomalies preserve Congress's authority to provide appropriations as it sees fit, even with short-term funding. These anomalies may designate a different duration of funding for specific activities within a CR. Anomalies in continuing resolutions allow for exceptions to funding duration, amount, or purposes for specific activities. Section 112 of P.L. 108-84 provided an exception to the expiration date of October 31, 2003, allowing for continued funding at current levels through specified dates. Anomalies in continuing resolutions allow for exceptions to funding rates for specific accounts or activities. These anomalies can provide different funding rates than the overall funding rate specified in the CR. For example, Section 120 of P.L. 112-33 provided a specific rate for \"Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board\u2014Salaries and Expenses\" at $29,130,000. Funding adjustments can also be made for groups of accounts, as seen in Section 121 of the same law. The District of Columbia Funds for programs and activities under title IV of H.R. 2434 (112th Congress) are set forth in the Fiscal Year 2012 Budget Request Act of 2011. Anomalies may provide exceptions to specified amounts in other laws, allowing for funds to be expended in excess of statutory limits. CRs may use anomalies to alter the purposes for which funds may be expended, allowing for activities that would otherwise be prohibited or prohibiting activities that might otherwise be allowed. For example, the first CR for FY2005 prohibited funds from being available to a particular department for a certain activity. The CRs may include legislative provisions to prevent funding gaps, with restrictions on including such provisions in appropriations bills. These provisions can range from a short paragraph to over 200 pages in length. The rules of the House and Senate restrict the inclusion of legislative provisions in appropriations bills, but there is more leeway with CRs. A point of order must be raised to prevent legislative language from being considered and enacted. CRs often establish new policies or amend existing laws, such as the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984. They can also renew import restrictions, like those under the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003. Additionally, CRs may temporarily extend expiring laws. Legislative provisions in CRs temporarily extend expiring laws, effective until the CR expires. Regular appropriations bills were enacted after October 1 in most fiscal years between FY1977 and FY2019, requiring CRs to prevent funding gaps. During the period from FY1977 to FY2019, regular appropriations bills were often enacted after the start of the fiscal year, leading to the need for continuing resolutions (CRs) to prevent funding gaps. In some years, no regular appropriations bills were enacted before the fiscal year began, with CRs becoming a significant part of the annual appropriations process. During FY1998 to FY2019, a total of 117 continuing resolutions (CRs) were enacted into law, with an average of almost five months of funding provided each fiscal year. The duration of CRs ranged from 21 days to 365 days, with an average length of about 39 days. Three full-year CRs were used for FY2007, FY2011, and FY2013. During FY1998 to FY2019, 117 continuing resolutions (CRs) were enacted, with durations ranging from 21 days to 365 days. The final CRs for FY2002-FY2004 and FY2019 had expiration dates set between January 10 and February 20, while in six other fiscal years, expiration dates were in the first quarter between December 8 and December 31. Some final CRs expired in January (FY2014) or March (FY2009, FY2015, FY2018), while others provided funding through the end of the fiscal year (FY2007, FY2011, FY2013). During FY1998 to FY2019, 117 continuing resolutions (CRs) were enacted, with durations ranging from 21 days to 365 days. The largest number of CRs enacted for a single fiscal year during this period was 21 for FY2001, covering a period lasting 82 days at an average duration of about four days per act. There is a mix in the use of shorter-term and longer-term CRs for a single fiscal year, with considerable variation in duration. During FY1998 to FY2019, 117 continuing resolutions (CRs) were enacted, with durations ranging from 21 days to 365 days. The legislative negotiations leading up to the national elections on November 7, 2000, were covered by a series of CRs of varying lengths. The remaining CRs, ranging from one to six days, covered the lame-duck session and days beyond. Table 5 provides detailed information on the number, length, and duration of CRs enacted for FY1977-FY2019. During FY1977-FY2019, full-year continuing resolutions (CRs) were enacted to cover annual discretionary spending. These CRs were used in various fiscal years, starting with FY1977 after the implementation of the Congressional Budget Act. Full-year CRs were enacted for FY1971, FY1973, FY1975, FY1976, FY1978-FY1988, FY1992, FY2007, FY2011, and FY2013. Table 4 provides details on the 15 full-year CRs enacted during this period. Full-year CRs were enacted for FY2007, FY2011, and FY2013. Table 4 identifies the 15 full-year CRs enacted since FY1977. Nine of the 15 full-year CRs during this period were enacted in the first quarter of the fiscal year\u2014three in October, two in November, and four in December. The remaining six measures were enacted between February 15 and June 5. Full-year CRs varied in length and funding form, with measures from FY1983-FY1988 being much lengthier. Between FY1983 and FY1988, full-year CRs increased in length as Congress began incorporating the full text of regular appropriations acts, rather than using formulaic funding provisions. The number of regular appropriations acts covered by full-year CRs also increased significantly during this period, ranging from five to 13 acts, averaging about 10. However, the full-year CRs for FY1992 and FY2007 reverted to using formulaic references and anomalies for funding levels. The FY2011 and FY2013 full-year CRs provided funding through formulaic provisions and anomalies, with the FY2013 CR containing the texts of five regular appropriations bills. These measures were shorter than previous full-year CRs that included the full text of regular appropriations acts. Division F of the appropriations acts provided continuing funding for seven regular appropriations bills through formulaic provisions and anomalies, based on FY2012 amounts rather than a rate."
