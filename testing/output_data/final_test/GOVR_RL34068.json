    "content": "In 1990, Washington passed a law allowing for the civil commitment of sex offenders, where the state can retain custody of individuals deemed \"sexually dangerous\" after their prison sentence. This requires proof of a mental abnormality making them likely to commit sexual violence. 19 states have similar laws, and in 2006, Congress passed legislation allowing the Attorney General to civilly commit federal inmates. Civil commitment laws target the hospitalization or commitment of sexually violent persons after their release from prison. These laws allow for the civil commitment of sexually dangerous individuals, including sex offenders. Discussions often treat sex offenders as a homogenous group, sometimes distinguishing between \"rapists.\" Sex offenders are a heterogeneous group, ranging from rapists to child molesters. Congress is debating the effectiveness and cost of civil commitment for sexually dangerous individuals. Questions arise about the cost, effectiveness of treatment, and alternatives for managing sex offenders. The report discusses the history of civil commitment laws and Supreme Court cases addressing constitutional issues. The report discusses the history of civil commitment laws in the United States, including Supreme Court cases addressing constitutional issues. It also covers recently enacted legislation, research on sex offender recidivism and treatment, and evaluation of civil commitment issues. Civil commitment laws for sexually dangerous persons originated from \"sexual psychopath\" laws in the 1930s, reflecting the rehabilitative ideal of the American criminal justice system at that time. In the mid-1960s, sexual psychopath laws were enacted in more than half of the states in the US, reflecting the belief that sexual psychopaths could be identified and treated. These laws were influenced by psychiatry and aimed to provide alternatives to prison for sex offenders by sending them to mental health facilities for control and treatment. In the 1970s, sexual psychopath laws were repealed due to criticism from the Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry and the American Bar Association. Critics argued that labeling offenders as sexual psychopaths lacked scientific merit, treatment was ineffective, and predicting future offending was unreliable. GAP criticized sexual psychopath and sexual offender statutes as failed approaches, questioning the validity of labeling individuals and treating them for community safety. Growing intolerance towards treating sex offenders emerged after released offenders committed more crimes, leading states to adopt a criminal justice model for managing dangerous offenders. In the 1990s, states began passing sexual predator civil commitment laws in response to heinous sex crimes and changing societal attitudes towards violence against women. By 2007, 19 states had enacted these laws, opting to incarcerate sex offenders rather than place them in mental health institutions. In response to changing societal attitudes towards violence against women, states enacted civil commitment laws for sexually dangerous individuals. These laws required proof of past sexually harmful conduct, current mental disorder, and a finding of dangerousness. Civil commitment laws for sexually dangerous individuals require proof of past sexually harmful conduct, current mental disorder, a finding of risk of future harmful conduct, and a connection between the mental abnormality and danger. These laws differ from old sexual psychopath laws as they mandate commitment after completing a criminal sentence without requiring recent criminal behavior or deteriorating mental state. Controversy surrounds civil commitment laws as they allow confinement post-sentence completion, leading to challenges from the psychiatric community regarding the definition of \"mental abnormality.\" The Washington State Psychiatric Association challenges the definition of \"mental abnormality\" in civil commitment laws, arguing that it should focus on \"abnormal behavior\" rather than \"mental disorders.\" Offenders who have committed multiple sex offenses are assumed to have some type of mental abnormality making them likely to re-offend, leading to challenges in court on the constitutionality of civil commitment laws. Civilly committed offenders challenge the constitutionality of civil commitment laws, arguing that they can be committed even without a recognized mental disorder after completing their sentences. Legal challenges like Kansas v. Hendricks and Kansas v. Crane have reached the Supreme Court, addressing issues with laws like the Kansas Sexually Violent Predator Act targeting repeat sexual offenders. The Act aims to confine sexually violent predators who may not have a mental illness but pose a danger. The legislature recognizes sexually violent predators as individuals with anti-social personality features that make them likely to engage in repeat acts of predatory sexual violence. Current involuntary commitment procedures are deemed inadequate to address the risk these individuals pose to society, as their treatment needs are long-term and different from traditional mental illness treatments. Kansas created a civil commitment procedure specifically for sexually violent predators, defined as individuals likely to engage in predatory acts of sexual violence due to a mental abnormality or personality disorder. This was intended to be applied regardless of previous convictions. In Hendricks, the state sought to commit a defendant convicted of indecent liberties with minors after serving prison time. The state of Kansas filed a petition to confine a defendant convicted of indecent liberties with minors as a sexually violent predator after serving prison time. The defendant was civilly committed based on evidence of past sexually violent behavior and a present mental condition indicating a likelihood of future misconduct. The Act required a finding of dangerousness before civil commitment, consistent with due process. The Court considered challenges related to ex post facto and double jeopardy laws, focusing on whether the Act was punitive or regulatory in nature. The Supreme Court has ruled that the Ex Post Facto Clause limits Congress from passing retroactive criminal or penal laws. When determining if a law is punitive, courts use the \"intent/effects\" test to analyze legislative intent. For example, a statute requiring sex offenders to register was upheld as nonpunitive. The Supreme Court has ruled that the Ex Post Facto Clause limits Congress from passing retroactive criminal or penal laws. When determining if a law is punitive, courts use the \"intent/effects\" test to analyze legislative intent. In Hendricks, the Court found that Kansas intended for the Act to be civil in nature, not punitive, as it was placed within the Kansas probate code and did not implicate retribution or deterrence. The Supreme Court ruled that the Kansas Act was civil, not punitive, and could be used to determine dangerousness even after acquittal for prior criminal conduct. The confinement under the Act is indefinite and reviewed annually, with no attributes of punishment for double jeopardy purposes. The Act does not violate the ex post facto clause or double jeopardy when applied after a criminal case. In Kansas v. Crane, the Court further refined its holding in Hendricks. In Crane, the Court considered whether a civil commitment statute must show that a defendant has difficulty controlling dangerous behavior, reaffirming language from the Hendricks case. The Kansas Act requires it to be \"difficult, if not impossible\" for a dangerous person to control their behavior. The Court indicated that a state must show a defendant has \"serious difficulty\" in controlling impulses. Title III of The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 established a federal civil commitment program for sexually dangerous individuals. The program allows for certification of individuals in custody as sexually dangerous, with a court conducting a hearing to determine their status. The individual cannot be released until the proceedings conclude. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 established a federal civil commitment program for sexually dangerous individuals. If found to be sexually dangerous, the individual is committed to the custody of the AG and may be released to the state for custody, care, and treatment. If the state does not assume responsibility, the offender is placed in a treatment facility until no longer considered a threat. The director of the facility may petition the court to release an offender deemed no longer sexually dangerous. The court can order discharge or hold a hearing to determine release. Conditional discharge may be granted with appropriate medical care. The director must inform the AG and court. The director of a facility is responsible for notifying the AG and the court of any failure to comply with the treatment regimen. If non-compliance is detected, the individual is arrested and brought before the court to determine if they should be remanded to a suitable facility as a sexually dangerous person. Additionally, the law allows for the release of individuals certified as sexually dangerous by the facility director to the appropriate state official if charges are dismissed for reasons unrelated to their mental condition. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 allows the Attorney General to release individuals to the state for civil commitment if deemed sexually dangerous. Grants can be awarded to establish civil commitment programs, and states must notify officials of impending release of high-risk individuals. The civil commitment of sex offenders is based on the belief that they are high risk for reoffending. Studies on sex offender recidivism have limitations due to underreporting of sexual offenses and debate on outcome measures. Debate surrounds the choice of outcome measure for measuring recidivism among sex offenders. Studies often report recidivism rates for sex offenders as a whole, rather than specific subgroups, leading to varying rates. Additionally, many studies only include incarcerated sex offenders, not those on probation, potentially skewing the sample. The follow-up period length can impact reported recidivism rates, with longer periods showing higher rates. Some sex offenders may commit new crimes even 10, 15, or 20 years after release. Two studies from the Bureau of Justice Statistics compare recidivism rates of sex offenders and violent offenders released in 1994 to assess the risk of sex offenders reoffending. The Bureau of Justice Statistics collected data on 9,691 male sex offenders released from prison in 1994, representing two-thirds of all male sex offenders released that year. Within three years, 5.3% of these offenders were rearrested for a new sex crime. This data is compared to other studies to evaluate sex offenders' recidivism rates. 5.3% of released sex offenders were rearrested for a new sex crime within three years, with specific percentages for different types of offenders like rapists, sexual assaulters, child molesters, and statutory rapists. Released sex offenders were four times more likely than non-sex offenders to be rearrested for a sex crime, with 5.3% of released sex offenders rearrested within three years compared to 1.3% of non-sex offenders. Data from a 2002 BJS report on offenders released in 1994 showed that released rapists and sexual assaulters were less likely to be rearrested for a violent offense. The data suggests that released rapists and sexual assaulters have lower recidivism rates compared to other violent offenders. A 1998 study combining data from 61 sex offender recidivism studies found that sex offenders had a 13.4% recidivism rate for sex crimes, rapists had an 18.9% recidivism rate, and child molesters had a 12.7% recidivism rate. The study analyzed recidivism rates for sex offenders, revealing rates of 36.3% for all sex offenders, 36.9% for child molesters, and 46.2% for rapists when defined as any re-offense. Non-sexual violent offense recidivism rates were 12.2% for sex offenders, 9.9% for child molesters, and 22.1% for rapists. The meta-analysis included data from 10 studies with 4,724 sex offenders, cautioning that the averages varied due to diverse methods and follow-up periods. The study estimated recidivism rates for sex offenders over different time periods: 5-year (14%), 10-year (20%), 15-year (24%), and 20-year (27%). Factors influencing the varying rates include different follow-up periods, types of sex offenders studied, and the countries where the studies were conducted. The data on sex offender recidivism from studies conducted in different countries and years suggest that sex offenders may not be as high-risk as perceived. Some argue for special measures like civil commitment, while others believe treatment can help decrease recidivism rates. Civil commitment aims to treat sexually dangerous individuals by confining them until they are no longer a threat. The effectiveness of sex offender treatment is debated, with research showing varying results on reducing recidivism rates. The researchers found that there was no compelling evidence that sex offender treatment reduced recidivism, but they could not definitively conclude that it was a failure. Methodological shortcomings in the studies hindered the ability to draw definitive conclusions about the effectiveness of sex offender treatment. The researchers noted that many treatment programs evaluated in the studies are now considered obsolete. The 1996 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on sex offender treatment found inconclusive research, with some studies suggesting cognitive-behavioral treatment was promising but limited by methodological weaknesses. A 2002 study compared treated and untreated sex offenders, showing a lower recidivism rate for treated offenders. Antiandrogen treatment reduces testosterone levels in sex offenders, leading to decreased deviant sexual fantasies and potentially reducing recidivism. Cognitive-behavioral treatment combined with other therapies can help reduce sex offender recidivism. Antiandrogen treatment has side effects and requires medical supervision, but its long-term effects are unknown. Some cognitive-behavioral treatments aim to reduce deviant arousal and correct distorted cognitions in sex offenders. These treatments include aversion treatment, covert sensitization, imaginal desensitization, and cognitive restructuring. Other interventions focus on social skills training, victim empathy training, lifestyle management, sex education, and relapse prevention. Research shows promising results in reducing recidivism for violent sex offenders through treatment, with a 9.4% recidivism rate for offenders treated in prison. Research on the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral treatment for incarcerated sex offenders shows promising results in reducing recidivism rates. One study found a 9.4% recidivism rate for treated offenders compared to 17.6% for untreated offenders. However, the evidence is not sufficient to draw a conclusion about the overall effectiveness of treatment for incarcerated offenders. Studies evaluating the effectiveness of sex offender treatment emphasize the importance of long-term follow-up to determine if treatment truly decreases recidivism. The effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral treatment for incarcerated sex offenders raises questions about the duration needed to decrease recidivism. Research suggests that longer offense-free periods decrease the likelihood of reoffending. Offenders with psychopathy or ASPD may be less amenable to treatment compared to those with paraphilias. Candidates for civil commitment, especially rapists, may have characteristics that make them less likely to benefit from treatment. Candidates for civil commitment, as repeat offenders diagnosed with paraphilias, may have difficulty completing treatment if they did not receive it in prison before being committed. Delays in treatment can lead to offenders denying responsibility for their offenses, making it harder to treat them. Questions remain about the effectiveness of involuntary treatment in reducing sex offender recidivism. Most literature on treatment involves offenders who voluntarily seek it, which is significant as civil commitment laws mandate treatment. The research on sex offender treatment is inconclusive, with experts debating its effectiveness. While some believe treatment can reduce recidivism, others argue that more research is needed to prove its efficacy. Methodological issues in past research limit the generalizability of findings, and recent studies have attempted to address these concerns. However, there is still not enough evidence to definitively prove that treatment for sex offenders works. Some issues in sex offender treatment studies include limited treatment groups, questionably implemented treatment, lack of comparison groups, non-random assignment of offenders, exclusion of non-compliant offenders in recidivism calculations, and narrow definitions of recidivism. Research has shown that longer follow-up periods increase the rate of recidivism, despite Supreme Court rulings on constitutional issues. Challenges to the long-term viability of civil commitment laws include determining which offenders should be committed, using alternative measures, indeterminate sentencing for sex offenders, and the cost of programs. Many states have enacted special laws to manage sex offenders due to concerns about their likelihood to commit new crimes. Sex offenders are not only dangerous but also more likely to commit new sex crimes. Research shows that they do not specialize in specific types of sex crimes, making it difficult to label them as just \"rapists\" or \"child molesters.\" Most sex crimes are committed by offenders with extensive criminal histories involving other violent and property crimes. Data from reports on recidivism rates of prisoners and sex offenders released in 1994 suggest that sex offenders often engage in a pattern of both violent and non-violent offending. Released sex offenders have a tendency to commit new sex crimes, but also engage in other criminal activities. Data shows that while they do specialize in sex crimes to some extent, they also commit other offenses. For example, the odds of a rapist being rearrested for rape are 4.2 times higher than a non-rapist, and for sexual assaulters, it is 5.9 times higher. The odds ratios for rapists and sexual assaulters suggest they are more likely to be rearrested for the same crime compared to other violent offenders. Over 40% of sex offenders were rearrested for any type of crime within three years of release, with more than 20% being reconvicted. Sex offenders were more likely to be rearrested for any type of crime than for a sex crime. Data in Table 4 shows that a large percentage of sex offenders had prior arrests for various crimes, with more than half having past convictions. Sex offenders are more likely than non-sex offenders to have prior arrests or convictions for sex offenses, but they also commit other types of crimes. Despite being more likely to be rearrested for a sex crime, sex offenders are also rearrested and reconvicted for non-sex offenses. Some sex offenders, especially those diagnosed with paraphilia and psychopathy, have a high risk of re-offending, with rates estimated at 50% to 80%. Offenders with psychopathy, particularly when combined with paraphilia, are more likely to recidivate than other sex offenders. Research shows that over 80% of sex offenders diagnosed with psychopathy were rearrested for a violent offense within six years of release from a maximum security psychiatric facility. Research indicates that over 80% of sex offenders diagnosed with psychopathy were rearrested for a violent offense within six years. A high Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R) score is a good predictor of violent recidivism in general, while sexual recidivism is predicted by a combination of a high PCL-R score and deviant sexual arousal. Predicting dangerousness before civil commitment involves clinical and actuarial methods. The clinician assesses the offender's history, criminal record, and psychosexual background to predict the likelihood of re-offense if released unsupervised. This assessment can be shaped by cues that actuarial methods may miss, especially through offender interviews. Actuarial methods use instruments developed from data on repeat sex offenders to predict re-offense risk. Actuarial tools are used to predict the likelihood of sex offenders re-offending based on common characteristics. Supporters argue that these tools are developed using proven statistical methods and prevent bias, making them more objective. However, both actuarial and clinical methods have their flaws in predicting risk accurately. The predictive accuracy of clinical judgments of sex offender dangerousness is quite poor, with an average correlation of 0.10 between prediction and actual offending. Clinicians may introduce bias into risk assessments by weighting certain factors more heavily. Actuarial instruments can only identify a range of risk for a group of offenders, relying heavily on static factors. Individual risk within a group may vary. Risk assessments for sex offenders can be challenging due to low recidivism rates and the possibility of errors. Despite advancements in predicting re-offending risk, determining when it is safe to release offenders back into society remains a complex issue. Predictions of dangerousness for sex offenders are based on static risk factors, while predictions of safety rely on dynamic risk factors. However, accurately identifying which dynamic risk factors decrease the risk of re-offending remains a challenge. Assessing risk in an institutional setting is difficult as offenders lack the opportunity to re-offend and face different stimuli compared to the community. This complicates the assessment of whether committed offenders are safe to be released from confinement. Predicting whether committed offenders are safe to release from confinement raises questions about using less restrictive alternatives for managing sexually dangerous persons. Maricopa County in Arizona implemented a lifetime supervision program for sex offenders, involving specialized units focused on supervision. Offenders in this program are assigned to probation officers with limited caseloads for more effective monitoring. Maricopa County in Arizona has a lifetime supervision program for sex offenders, with probation officers having limited caseloads for effective monitoring. Offenders undergo evaluations to determine their risk level and receive specific supervision conditions. Violations lead to increased surveillance and supervision. The lifetime supervision program for sex offenders in Maricopa County, Arizona includes increased surveillance and supervision for offenders. Offenders are subject to polygraph examinations to ensure compliance with supervision terms, which has shown to help prevent recidivism. Data from specialized units over a seven-year period indicated that a small percentage of offenders committed new criminal or sex offenses, with violations mainly related to treatment compliance, substance abuse, and contact with children. The proportion of offenders sentenced for violent or non-violent sex offenses is unclear. The Maricopa County's lifetime probation program for sex offenders includes polygraph examinations, reduced caseloads for POs, supervision conditions, and intensive supervision. An outpatient civil commitment program could incorporate elements like electronic monitoring to prevent offenders from entering prohibited areas. Colorado's sex offender management program, similar to Maricopa County's program, includes containment plans tailored to offenders based on their offense patterns. Colorado's program uses tailored containment plans for offenders based on their offense patterns, placing boundaries on their activities. Intense supervision in the community could aid in offender treatment and motivation for participation. However, there is a risk with parole as offenders may commit new crimes despite supervision. Starting in the 1980s, many states adopted determinate sentencing laws, allowing judges to impose fixed sentences based on sentencing guidelines. These laws often eliminated parole, leading to offenders being released unsupervised after serving their sentence. Some states still maintained indeterminate sentencing, where offenders are released on parole determined by a parole board. One researcher proposes a sexually dangerous offender sentence, combining determinate and indeterminate terms for repeat sex offenders. Offenders would undergo a special hearing to determine their sexual dangerousness, ensuring they serve a minimum sentence. Sexually dangerous offender laws would ensure that the offender serves at least the minimum sentence required by law, but if there is reason to believe that the offender is still dangerous and would commit a new crime if released, the state would not be required to release him from prison. Offenders would be released on parole instead of unsupervised release, avoiding the costs of civil commitment. This system could be implemented at the federal level, but would require Congress to reestablish parole for convicted offenders while providing appropriate procedural due process. The civil commitment program for sexually dangerous offenders involves providing procedural due process rights, such as contesting evidence and presenting evidence with legal assistance. The annual cost can be in the millions, with estimates of around $100,000 per person per year. As of fall 2006, 2,694 offenders in 18 states have been civilly committed, with 252 discharged. Arizona and California have released the most offenders. The civil commitment program for sexually dangerous offenders involves procedural due process rights and high annual costs. Five states have not released any civilly committed offenders, leading to a growing population that may require new facilities. The aging population of civilly committed offenders could result in increased medical care costs. The high costs of civil commitment for sexually dangerous offenders include legal proceedings, court and litigation costs, community placement programs, construction and operation of facilities, and medication expenses. Public demand for harsher penalties and better management of sex offenders has increased due to media coverage of high-profile sex crimes. Recent media coverage of high-profile sex crimes has heightened public fear of sex offenders, leading to civil commitment being used by elected officials in 19 states and the federal government to protect the public. However, there is a growing debate on whether civil commitment is the best approach. Issues such as the actual threat posed by sex offenders and varying rates of recidivism contribute to the ongoing controversy. The effectiveness of treating sex offenders to reduce recidivism is uncertain, as studies show varying results. Some offenders, especially those considered for civil commitment, may be resistant to treatment. Predicting dangerousness and determining the most appropriate candidates for civil commitment remains a challenge due to the lack of consensus. The potential high cost of implementing and maintaining civil commitment programs adds to the complexity of the issue. The potential high cost of establishing and maintaining a civil commitment program is a concern, especially if few offenders are released. This raises questions about the effectiveness of civil commitment for managing sex offenders and whether it is more cost-effective than other measures. The appendix provides an overview of state laws governing the civil commitment of sexually dangerous individuals. The appendix provides an overview of state laws governing the civil commitment of sexually dangerous persons, excluding laws for individuals with serious mental illness."
