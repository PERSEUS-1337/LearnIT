    "content": "The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), established in 1947, allowed for consultations and dispute resolution among 128 countries. Parties could use Articles XXII and XXIII for dispute settlement. However, the GATT procedure had deficiencies like lack of deadlines and consensus decision-making process. The GATT Parties faced issues with lax surveillance and implementation of panel reports, leading to the reform of the dispute process in the GATT Uruguay Round. The resulting WTO DSU aimed to create a more judicial approach to dispute settlement, different from the diplomatic system favored by other trading partners. The WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) aims to secure a \"mutually agreed solution\" through a more \"rule-bound\" mechanism than the GATT process. It applies to disputes under all WTO agreements and is part of the Uruguay Round package, which expanded on original GATT obligations. The WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) applies to disputes under all WTO agreements, including new agreements like the Agreement on Agriculture and the General Agreement on Trade in Services. Congress approved the WTO Agreement and other agreements in the Uruguay Round in 1995, with the DSU strengthening the prior dispute resolution system. The WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) introduced new features to strengthen the prior system, such as a \"reverse consensus\" voting rule, legal review by an Appellate Body, deadlines for dispute procedure phases, and improved oversight of compliance. The DSU applies the same dispute settlement rules to disputes under all WTO agreements, with the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) administering proceedings. The DSB operates by consensus, but the DSU prevents individual Members from blocking critical DSB decisions. The WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) ensures that the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) can make decisions without being blocked by individual Members. The DSB will approve panel requests, adopt reports, and authorize retaliatory measures if necessary. The Appellate Body reviews legal issues in panel reports, with seven members serving on each case. Dispute settlement in the WTO is primarily driven by the disputing Members. The WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) allows disputing Members to decide on actions such as initiating disputes, requesting panels, seeking authorization for countermeasures, and imposing retaliatory measures. The preferred outcome is a mutually acceptable solution, with withdrawal of violative measures as the primary objective. As of the date of this report, 450 complaints have been filed under the DSU, resulting in 153 original panel reports and 29 compliance panel reports. Over half of the panel reports have been appealed, leading to 108 Appellate Body reports. The United States is involved in nearly half of the complaints filed. The United States Trade Representative manages U.S. participation in the WTO and is the chief representative in WTO disputes. The DSU was reviewed by WTO Members under a Uruguay Round Declaration, with negotiations continuing during the WTO Doha Development Round. In 2008, a consolidated draft legal text was prepared for dispute settlement negotiations, with subsequent discussions summarized in reports issued in 2011. The chairman issued reports in April and September 2011 summarizing discussions on revisions to the DSU. The United States proposed greater Member control, transparency, and other revisions. The WTO dispute settlement process includes consultations, panel and Appellate Body review, and implementation stages. The WTO dispute settlement process involves consultations, panel and Appellate Body review, and implementation. Article 3.2 of the DSU guides their work, preserving Members' rights and obligations under covered agreements. The Vienna Convention's Article 31 is a key interpretative rule under international law for this purpose. The WTO dispute settlement process involves requesting consultations within 30 days, with a panel being requested if the dispute is not resolved within 60 days. If consultations fail, a panel can be requested before the 60-day period ends. The requesting Member must do so in writing. The WTO Member requesting a panel must do so in writing and \"identify the specific measures at issue and provide a brief summary of the legal basis for the complaint.\" A defending Member may block the establishment of a panel initially, but it will be established automatically if requested again. When a WTO Member requests a panel at a DSB meeting, it will be established automatically the second time such a request is made. The panel is typically composed of three persons, and if disputing parties cannot agree on panelists within 20 days, the WTO Director-General can appoint them. This process may be delayed if disputing Members do not make a request promptly. Once a panel is constituted at the WTO, it hears arguments from disputing parties and issues an interim report with findings and conclusions. The final report is circulated to all WTO Members within six months, with possible extensions for complex cases. The period from panel establishment to circulation of a panel report to WTO Members should not exceed nine months, but panels have taken over 13 months on average. Within 60 days of circulation, the report is to be adopted at a DSB meeting unless appealed. Appeals are limited to legal issues, and the Appellate Body must issue a report within 60 days (extendable to 90 days). The AB report is to be adopted unless the DSB decides otherwise within 30 days. The period from panel establishment to the DSB considering the panel report for adoption should not exceed 9 months (12 months if appealed). If a defending Member is found to have violated a WTO obligation, they must inform the DSB of their implementation plans within 30 days. The Member has a reasonable period to comply, and full implementation is expected by the end of this period. Compliance can be achieved by withdrawing or modifying the WTO-inconsistent measure. The \"reasonable period of time\" for compliance with WTO obligations is determined by the disputing parties or through arbitration within 45 days after DSB adoption. Arbitration must be completed within 90 days, with a non-binding guideline of 15 months for compliance. A compliance panel can be requested if there is disagreement on compliance, with a maximum of 18 months from panel establishment to determining the compliance period. The DSU provides for a compliance panel to resolve disputes on whether a defending Member has complied with a WTO decision. The panel must issue a report within 90 days, which can be appealed to the WTO Appellate Body. If the defending Member fails to comply, the prevailing Member can request negotiations for a compensation agreement. The compliance deadline expires, allowing the prevailing Member to request authorization from the DSB to retaliate by suspending concessions or obligations under a WTO agreement. The DSB must authorize the request within 30 days unless decided otherwise by consensus or if arbitration is requested. Members should first try to suspend concessions in the same trade sector, then in another sector under the same agreement if necessary. If not feasible, concessions or obligations under another agreement can be suspended in serious circumstances. If a Member fails to comply with WTO agreements, they may face retaliation by suspending concessions or obligations under another agreement. This can include imposing tariff surcharges on specific products or suspending market access obligations in services or intellectual property rights. The defending Member can object to the retaliation proposal. The defending Member has the right to object to a retaliation proposal under the DSU. Arbitration is automatic and must be completed within 60 days after the compliance period ends. The arbitral decision is final, and the prevailing party can request DSB approval of its proposal. The prevailing Member is not required to impose authorized measures. The DSU requires WTO Members to follow procedures in disputes involving WTO agreements, including determining violations, compliance deadlines, and retaliatory actions. The prevailing Member must obtain DSB authorization before imposing trade retaliation measures. The DSU procedures require WTO Members to follow specific steps before suspending WTO tariff concessions or obligations in case of non-compliance. Difficult cases have exposed deficiencies in the DSU system, leading to suggestions for reform. \"Sequencing\" issues first arose during the compliance phase of a U.S. challenge against the EU's banana import regime in 1998-1999. Article 22 allows a prevailing party to request retaliation authorization within 30 days after a compliance period ends, while Article 21.5 deals with disputes over compliance measures through WTO procedures. Compliance panel reports are due within 90 days and can be appealed. The DSU lacks integration in this process. The DSU procedures for compliance involve a 90-day period for dispute resolution and possible appeals. There is a lack of integration between Article 21.5 and Article 22 deadlines, leading to ad hoc procedural agreements for retaliation requests. The DSU does not specify how compliance is determined for retaliatory actions. In a dispute initiated by the European Union against the United States in 2004 over tariffs on EU goods, the WTO found the EU ban on hormone-treated beef violated the SPS Agreement. The EU claimed compliance with a 2003 Directive. The EU argued that the US and Canada violated WTO obligations by imposing retaliatory tariffs, citing the 2003 EU Directive as WTO-compliant. WTO panel reports in 2008 found the EU maintaining bans on hormones without scientific basis and the US and Canada breaching Article 23 requirements. The panel found that the United States and Canada breached WTO obligations by not initiating a WTO proceeding to resolve the EU compliance issue and determining unilaterally that the EU was still in violation. However, they did not violate Article 22.8 as sanctions were not removed once the offending measure was withdrawn. The panel suggested initiating a compliance panel proceeding under Article 21.5 to promptly resolve the issue. The Appellate Body reversed the panel's findings on the US and Canada breaching DSU obligations and the EU violating the SPS Agreement. They recommended initiating an Article 21.5 compliance panel proceeding to determine EU compliance with the EC\u2014Hormones decision. The EU requested consultations under Article 21.5 in December 2008, but the US proceeding was suspended under a bilateral agreement. The US and EU suspended WTO litigation under a bilateral agreement in May 2009 to resolve the beef hormone dispute. The agreement included three phases for the EU to expand market access for US beef. Retaliatory tariffs were maintained by the US in the first phase, and new duties were not imposed. The USTR delayed additional duties until September 19, 2009, and officially terminated them. As a result, the duties were never imposed. The adoption of a panel and Appellate Body report by the WTO does not have direct legal effect in the United States. Federal law remains unaffected until Congress or the executive branch makes changes. Only the federal government can challenge state or local laws for inconsistency with WTO agreements, and private remedies based on WTO obligations are not allowed. Federal courts do not consider WTO reports binding and have jurisdiction over compliance decisions. The Trade Act of 1974 allows private parties to petition the USTR to address harmful foreign trade practices. If the USTR initiates an investigation on a foreign measure violating a WTO agreement, they must use the WTO dispute process for resolution. Section 301 permits the USTR to impose retaliatory measures, such as tariff increases, to remedy uncorrected foreign practices. The USTR can terminate a Section 301 case if the dispute is settled, but must monitor foreign compliance under Section 306 of the act. The USTR can initiate a WTO dispute without invoking Section 301, but can use its authorities to impose sanctions if necessary. Section 306 of the Trade Act allows the USTR to periodically revise the list of products subject to retaliation if a country fails to comply with WTO obligations. The European Union challenged the US statutory provision of \"carousel retaliation\" at the WTO in 2000. In 2008, the US used \"carousel\" authorities to modify the list of EU products subject to tariff surcharges. The revised list was published in 2009, removing some products from the original list. The EU challenged the US \"carousel retaliation\" provision at the WTO in 2000. In 2009, the US revised the list of EU products subject to tariff surcharges, including removal of some products, addition of new products, modified coverage for certain EU member states, and increased duties on Roquefort cheese. The EU announced preparations to pursue WTO dispute settlement regarding the carousel statute, citing breach of WTO requirements. The US agreed not to impose announced tariff increases on new items under an MOU with the EU to settle the beef hormone dispute. The DSU allows for unilateral actions in trade disputes involving WTO agreements, with Section 301 being used consistently. However, some trading partners argue that Section 304 of the Trade Act of 1974 is inconsistent with Article 23 as it requires the USTR to determine the legality of a foreign practice before DSU procedures are completed. The WTO panel found this provision prima facie inconsistent but noted that U.S. undertakings removed the threat of violative determinations. The U.S. undertakings, as outlined in the Uruguay Round Statement of Administrative Action and before the panel, led to the removal of Section 301. The WTO panel did not find a violation of the DSU by Section 306 of the Trade Act of 1974. The panel report, adopted in January 2000, was not appealed. S. 239 (Klobuchar), the Innovate America Act, would authorize funding for the USTR to resolve disputes with WTO member countries. The Trade Enforcement Priorities Act, S. 708, aims to address harmful foreign trade practices by requiring the USTR to initiate WTO dispute settlement proceedings. No action has been taken on this bill yet."
