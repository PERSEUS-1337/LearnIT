Concerns exist that the lack of access to postsecondary education hampers rehabilitation and reintegration into society. Tough on crime policies have contributed to a growing prison population, with the recognition that most offenders will eventually be released. The prison population in the United States increased steadily from 1980 to 2009 before decreasing somewhat from 2010 to 2018. In 2018, there were approximately 1,471,000 prisoners under the jurisdiction of state and federal correctional authorities, compared to 330,000 prisoners in 1980. The growth in the prison population combined with the Pell Grant ban means that more prisoners are unable to participate in postsecondary education, potentially hindering their reintegration into society. The prison population in the United States has increased over the years, with approximately 626,000 prisoners released in 2016. A study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics found high rates of rearrest among released prisoners. Participation in postsecondary education while incarcerated has shown to reduce recidivism rates. Data from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS) shows a correlation between employment rates and educational attainment. Adults with higher levels of education have higher employment rates. Incarcerated individuals generally have lower levels of education compared to the general population. The National Center for Education Statistics reported that 58% of incarcerated individuals did not further their education while in prison. Self-financing can be a barrier for prisoners wanting to participate in postsecondary education. Incarcerated individuals were eligible for aid under Title IV of the Higher Education Act, including Pell Grants and loans. Reports estimated thousands of prisoners received Pell Grants in the late 1970s and 1980s. Policy initiatives in the 1980s and 1990s increased penalties for offenders. The Higher Education Amendments of 1992 limited Pell Grant eligibility for incarcerated students, excluding those sentenced to life without parole or death. Pell Grant aid had to supplement state education assistance for inmates. Some questioned if Pell Grants were the best form of aid for incarcerated individuals. In FY1988, incarcerated individuals were not eligible for loans, and the cost of attendance was limited to tuition, fees, books, and supplies. Institutions with more than 25% of enrolled students incarcerated were ineligible for HEA Title IV programs. A 1994 GAO report addressed concerns about Pell Grants for inmates, including the number of recipients, impact on other needy students, and research on correctional education's effect on recidivism rates. Approximately 23,000 Pell Grant recipients were reported for AY1993-1994. Approximately 23,000 Pell Grant recipients were incarcerated in AY1993-1994, representing less than 1% of all recipients. The average grant amount was consistent regardless of incarceration status. Most incarcerated recipients were enrolled in public two-year IHEs (39%) or private nonprofit four-year IHEs (35%). The Pell Grant availability for incarcerated individuals did not impact non-incarcerated students due to the program's entitlement nature. The studies on incarcerated students' participation in educational programming and recidivism have conflicting findings due to difficulties in isolating the effect of correctional education on recidivism. The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 enacted a \"tough on crime\" approach, including grants for states with \"truth in sentencing\" laws and expanding federal death penalty offenses. The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 expanded federal death penalty offenses and established new federal crimes, including restrictions on Pell Grants for incarcerated individuals, leading to a decline in postsecondary education programs for state prisoners. The Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 prohibited civilly committed sex offenders from receiving Pell Grants, in response to 54 individuals in Florida who received them in 2004. This Act also defined incarcerated students as those serving criminal sentences in various facilities. The definition of incarcerated students includes those serving sentences in correctional institutions, excluding those in pre-sentencing confinement or less restrictive settings. To be eligible for a Pell Grant, students must meet requirements set by Title IV of the Higher Education Act, such as having a high school diploma or GED certificate. To be eligible for a Pell Grant, students must have a high school diploma, GED certificate, or completed an eligible homeschool program. They must not be incarcerated in a federal or state penal institution or subject to involuntary civil commitment following incarceration for a sexual offense. Males subject to Selective Service registration must be registered. Students must not be in default on any HEA Title IV student loan. Incarcerated individuals are ineligible for Pell Grants if serving a sentence in a federal or state penal institution. However, those in juvenile facilities, local jails, halfway houses, or home detention may be eligible. No incarcerated individual is eligible for loan programs, but they can qualify for the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant program. In 2015, the Second Chance Pell Experiment was initiated by the Department of Education to increase enrollment of incarcerated individuals in postsecondary education programs. This initiative was part of the Obama Administration's commitment to reform the criminal justice system and reduce recidivism. The experiment aimed to determine if access to Pell Grants would help achieve these goals. The Secretary used waiver authority to implement the Second Chance Pell Grant Experiment, allowing incarcerated individuals to receive Pell Grants for education programs. Priority is given to those likely to be released within five years, aiming to increase educational attainment, reduce recidivism, and improve post-release employment opportunities. Incarcerated students can enroll in educational programs leading to high-demand occupations, offered online or completed while incarcerated or after release. Participating IHEs must provide academic and career guidance, transition services, and Pell Grant aid supplementing other education assistance. 65 IHEs are involved, enrolling around 8,500 inmates in the first year, 11,000 in the second year, and 10,000 in the third year. Two-thirds of participating IHEs already offered postsecondary correctional education before joining the experiment. Some faced challenges with accreditation, facilities, recruiting eligible prisoners, and financial viability. Programs aimed to award certificates (35%), associate's degrees (47%), or bachelor's degrees (18%). ED issues reports analyzing outcomes and benefits for decision-making. The experiment was extended in February 2019. In February 2019, the Second Chance Pell Experiment was extended for an additional year without providing data or evaluation. The 2019 GAO report revealed that in AY2017-2018, 59 schools disbursed $22.3 million in Pell Grants to over 6,000 prisoners. Challenges included issues with Selective Service registration, default on student loans, and proving financial need. Lack of resources is a significant barrier for prisoners interested in postsecondary education. Expanding Pell Grant eligibility to federal and state prisoners will increase program costs funded by discretionary and mandatory appropriations. Policymakers should consider obstacles to providing postsecondary education in correctional institutions and barriers to post-release employment for educated prisoners. Expanding Pell Grant eligibility to federal and state prisoners would increase program costs funded by discretionary and mandatory appropriations. Eligibility expansion would not reduce awards for current recipients but would only broaden the pool of eligible individuals. To limit the cost increase, certain provisions under current law would apply, such as the requirement for students to have a high school diploma or be enrolled in an eligible career pathway program. If policymakers reinstate prisoners' eligibility for Pell Grants, it could help them secure post-release employment and reduce recidivism. Currently, only 3% of incarcerated individuals have a bachelor's degree. The average Pell Grant award in AY2017-2018 was $4,032 for undergraduates and $3,541 for Second Chance Pell Experiment participants. Additional considerations for extending Pell Grant eligibility to specific subgroups are discussed. The Second Chance Pell Experiment aims to help prisoners secure post-release employment and reduce recidivism. However, there is a debate on whether prisoners who may never be released should be eligible for Pell Grants. This includes individuals serving life sentences, with or without the possibility of parole, and those convicted of sex offenses who could be civilly committed. In 2016, over 160,000 state and federal prisoners were serving life sentences. In 2016, there were 53,290 prisoners serving life without parole (LWOP) and 44,311 serving virtual life sentences, defined as having to serve at least 50 years before being eligible for release. These virtual lifers, although technically eligible for release, are likely to spend the rest of their lives in prison. This accounted for 14% of all inmates in 2016. The Sentencing Project's research in 2016 found that a few states had the majority of inmates with life without parole (LWOP), life with parole (LWP), and virtual life sentences. California, Georgia, New York, and Texas had 55% of LWP prisoners, while California, Florida, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, and the Bureau of Prisons had 53% of LWOP prisoners. Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, and Texas had 55% of virtual life sentence prisoners. There was a 27% increase in prisoners serving any life sentence from 2003 to 2016, with a 59% increase in LWOP sentences and an 18% increase in LWP sentences. Policymakers considering expanding Pell Grant eligibility should also consider these statistics. Laws allow for civil commitment of certain sex offenders post-prison. 20 states, DC, and federal government have such laws. Offenders are held until no longer meeting criteria, in secure facilities. Eligibility for Pell Grants may include civilly committed sex offenders. In 2016, 5,430 offenders were civilly committed in 15 states for qualifying sex offenses and mental conditions. Unlike prison sentences, there is no set release period for civilly committed individuals. Some states, like Minnesota, have not released any civilly committed sex offenders since the mid-1980s, with 40 individuals dying in custody. Congress may need to amend Pell Grant eligibility requirements for Selective Service registration, as it poses obstacles for men involved in the criminal justice system. Men ages 18-25 who are incarcerated are not required to register with the Selective Service while in prison. Research suggests that those involved in the criminal justice system may be at a higher risk of failing to register due to misunderstandings. Eligibility for Pell Grants can still be achieved through various processes if a man did not register, including providing evidence of an exception, registering if under 25, proving inability to register due to circumstances beyond control, showing prior active duty in the Armed Forces, or demonstrating lack of willful failure to register. For incarcerated or previously incarcerated men 26 and older who failed to register with the Selective Service, proving Pell Grant eligibility may be challenging. Some institutions in the Second Chance Pell Experiment suggest waiving the registration requirement for incarcerated individuals to boost enrollments. This waiver could ease the burden of proving eligibility for men 26 and older who were incarcerated between the ages of 18 to 25. Addressing the educational needs of prisoners who have not completed secondary school may also be necessary to promote postsecondary education completion. Addressing the educational needs of incarcerated individuals, particularly those who have not completed high school, is crucial for promoting postsecondary education completion. Many correctional systems allocate funding for Adult Basic Education (ABE) and GED preparation courses, but additional funding or program restructuring may be necessary. Even prisoners with a high school diploma or GED may require remedial education for college-level courses. Congress could consider supporting ABE and GED programs in prisons, as well as diagnosing learning disabilities in prisoners to enhance secondary education opportunities. Several federal programs provide support for secondary education of prisoners, including the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA) and the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act. AEFLA grants funds to states for basic education for adults, with a portion allocated for educational activities in correctional institutions. The CTE Act supports career and technical education programs at secondary and postsecondary levels. The Second Chance Act of 2007 provides competitive grants for offender reentry programs at state, local, and tribal levels, including education and training support. The HEA allows schools to establish career pathway programs for students without high school diplomas, who can demonstrate potential for postsecondary education. These programs offer occupational skills training, counseling, workforce preparation, high school completion, and postsecondary credential attainment. Students in these programs may qualify for Pell Grants and other HEA Title IV aid by passing an approved exam or completing college coursework. Ability to benefit tests for incarcerated individuals may be challenging. If they do not take the test, they must complete college work to qualify for HEA Title IV aid. Congress could promote postsecondary education for prisoners by developing career pathway programs in correctional facilities. There is a lack of data on postsecondary education in prisons. More research is needed on the impact of postsecondary education on recidivism. The literature suggests a need for more comprehensive data on postsecondary education in correctional institutions to support rigorous studies on its impact on recidivism. The federal government, through the BJS, collects data on the prison population and educational programs. The First Step Act of 2018 mandates data collection on educational attainment and facilities with remote learning capabilities. The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) collects data on prisoner participation in education and job training, but the data are collected sporadically. The most recent iteration was in 2016, with previous surveys conducted in 1974, 1979, 1986, 1991, 1997, and 2004. The BJS has experience collecting data on prison inmates, and there is a suggestion to expand their mandate to gather more detailed data on postsecondary education in correctional facilities. The NPS program and SPI collect data on prisoners while incarcerated, but do not gather post-release data essential for evaluating correctional education programs. To encourage state participation, policymakers could tie it to grant funds like the JAG program. A new federally sponsored data collection effort is needed to track post-release outcomes of prisoners, such as education credentials and employment. Policymakers should consider authorizing the sharing of criminal history records for research purposes to promote studies on recidivism and postsecondary education impact on prisoners. The literature on postsecondary correctional education lacks studies using randomized controlled trials, which could provide more definitive conclusions on the impact of education on recidivism. However, conducting such trials raises ethical concerns about denying some prisoners access to education programs. Ethical considerations arise when conducting randomized controlled trials on prisoners, who are given additional protections as subjects of behavioral science research. Congress could support more rigorous evaluations of postsecondary correctional education by providing dedicated funding to the National Institute of Justice. Evaluations of correctional education programs should focus on outcomes beyond just recidivism and employment, as cessation of criminal activity is crucial for rehabilitation. However, the emphasis on recidivism limits understanding of how education programs aid in prisoners' reintegration into society. Prisoners benefit from correctional education to improve cognitive skills, continue education/training post-release, and secure employment. Policymakers should focus on evaluating motivation, literacy gains, skill development, disciplinary actions, postsecondary credits, and program completion. Research is needed to enhance delivery of postsecondary correctional education programs. There is a lack of research on effective postsecondary education delivery in prisons, including considerations like prisoners' initial educational levels, different modalities of education, and the impact of time spent on education on recidivism. Resource challenges in correctional environments, such as space and access to educational equipment, may limit participation in postsecondary education programs even if Pell Grants are provided. Resource challenges identified by ED and GAO in correctional systems include space, access to educational equipment, and trained staff. Overcrowded prisons may struggle to provide sufficient classroom space for postsecondary instruction. Instructors in rural areas may be hard to find, and educators need training on effective teaching strategies for correctional students. Prisoners are often transferred for reasons like security reclassification, medical treatment, and program participation. The Institute for Higher Education Policy (IHEP) suggested that providing more access to online courses could address resource problems limiting postsecondary education for prisoners. However, many correctional agencies restrict internet access. Congress could consider promoting online postsecondary courses for prisoners to address this issue. Steps to promote online postsecondary courses for prisoners include developing and testing security protocols for internet access, exploring different educational programming arrangements, addressing potential conflicts between agencies responsible for prisoner education and confinement, and giving wardens the authority to decide on offering postsecondary education courses at prisons. The importance of coordinating with prison staff and state corrections agencies for effective expansion of educational activities in prisons is highlighted. There is a suggestion for states and the Bureau of Prisons to have a uniform curriculum across correctional facilities. Policymakers may need to consider promoting consistent policies for correctional education, such as placing conditions on federal funds for state correctional departments to determine available postsecondary education courses. The current educational programs for prisoners may not be tailored to enhance academic and post-release success in prison settings. The Education Department (ED) offers a research-based guide for developing education programs to support incarcerated adults in transitioning successfully to their communities. This includes providing supportive services like academic program selection, tutoring, study skills assistance, financial literacy help, academic and employment counseling, and guidance on choosing courses and careers that lead to practical employment post-release. These practical employment options should enable self-sufficiency, be open to individuals with criminal records, and align with their chosen communities. Some incarcerated individuals may want to continue their education post-release, but may face challenges in completing their degree before release. To increase program completion rates, it is important to ensure that credits earned in correctional education programs are fully transferrable. Policymakers should also consider how prisoners can effectively utilize the education and skills they acquire. Prisoners often seek vocational certificates for post-release employment. One study shows a high interest in certificate programs compared to other degrees. It is crucial for vocational training in prisons to align with local job opportunities to be relevant. Policymakers should consider mandated coordination between correctional agencies, state labor departments, and businesses to ensure inmates use Pell Grants for postsecondary programs aligning with local job opportunities. Criminal history can hinder employment, with a significant percentage of men having felony convictions or criminal records. Increasing access to relevant skills training is crucial for successful reentry into the workforce. In 2014, 34% of unemployed working-age men had a criminal record. Increasing access to Pell Grants may not be effective if ex-prisoners face barriers in getting hired due to their criminal histories. Policymakers should consider reducing the negative impact of criminal records on post-release employment by expanding programs like the Department of Labor's Federal Bonding Program for employers hiring released prisoners."
