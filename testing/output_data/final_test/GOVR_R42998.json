    "content": "To be eligible for Medicare-covered home health services, a beneficiary must meet three requirements: be homebound, need skilled nursing care or rehabilitation, and be under the care of a physician. The definition of homebound has been clarified over time to assist beneficiaries, providers, and Medicare claims contractors. The regulatory definition of homebound for Medicare-covered home health services states that a beneficiary must be confined to the home, but not necessarily bedridden. Leaving the residence must require a considerable effort, with infrequent absences for short durations or medical treatment. A 2012 report found that 98% of Medicare home health claims met the homebound requirement. The HHS-OIG found that 98% of home health claims met the homebound requirement, but was unable to verify the remaining 2%. Medicare covers part-time skilled nursing care and rehabilitation services for homebound beneficiaries. The definition of \"intermittent\" care has evolved over time, with earlier interpretations requiring care four days or fewer per week. The Health Care Financing Administration redefined intermittent skilled nursing care as fewer than seven days a week in 1989. Medicare covers skilled nursing care if provided by a registered nurse and necessary for a medically predictable recurring need. Diabetics may receive an exception to the intermittent requirement for insulin administration. Skilled rehabilitation services are covered if necessary for maintaining function affected by illness or injury. Homebound beneficiaries may receive skilled nursing care if deemed reasonable and necessary. Skilled nursing care and rehabilitation services are covered by Medicare if deemed reasonable and necessary for homebound beneficiaries. This includes services provided by a registered nurse to assess and monitor the beneficiary's condition, as well as rehabilitation services to improve or maintain their functional ability. Maintenance therapy may also be considered necessary to prevent a decline in functional ability. Medicare beneficiaries meeting home health eligibility criteria are entitled to 60-day home visits by skilled professionals, with no cost-sharing requirements. Roughly 9.5% of Medicare FFS beneficiaries used home health services in 2011, covering skilled nursing care, physical therapy, and occupational therapy. A 20% coinsurance is required for durable medical equipment and Part B drugs. The home health benefit for Medicare beneficiaries includes skilled nursing, therapy, occupational therapy, speech and language pathology, medical social work, and home health aide services. The proportion of visits has shifted towards more skilled nursing and therapy services since 2000. The distribution of home health visits in 2011 was 51% for skilled nursing, 33% for therapy, 15% for home health aides, and 1% for medical social services. The average number of visits per home health user has remained relatively constant at 36.2 visits in 2011 compared to 36.8 visits in 2000. Prior to payment reductions in 1997, the average number of visits per user was much higher at 72.6 visits. This decrease in visits per user has implications for the Medicare home health payment system. In 2011, there was wide geographic variation in Medicare-covered home health admission rates across the United States. The West South Central region had higher admission rates, with Louisiana, Texas, and Florida having the highest rates per 1,000 Part A enrollees. Hawaii, Alaska, and South Dakota had the lowest rates of home health admissions. In 2011, Hawaii, Alaska, and South Dakota had the lowest rates of home health admissions. Medicare covers home health benefits as a \"post-acute care\" benefit, with most episodes provided to beneficiaries without prior hospitalization. In 2010, 34% of home health episodes were for beneficiaries with prior hospitalization, while 66% were for those already living in the community. Home health services cover a wide range of conditions. The most common primary diagnosis for beneficiaries without prior institutional stay was diabetes at 9.8%. In 2011, common diagnoses among FFS home health users included essential hypertension, heart failure, and chronic skin ulcer. Medicare-certified HHAs provide skilled nursing and rehabilitation services in patients' homes. Payment reductions from BBA 97 led to a 34% decrease in the number of HHAs between 1997 and 2000. Since the implementation of HH PPS in 2000, the number of HHAs has steadily increased. Since the implementation of the home health prospective payment system (HH PPS) in 2000, the number of Medicare-certified HHAs has grown steadily, with a majority being for-profit HHAs. Between 2000 and 2011, the number of HHAs increased by 62%. HHAs have faced scrutiny for fraud allegations within the industry, with investigations involving Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP. The PPS reimburses providers based on predetermined formulas adjusting for care needs and wage differences. The Medicare HH PPS was implemented for home health services starting on or after October 1, 2000. Under this system, Medicare pays HHAs for covered services on a 60-day per episode basis, unlike the previous method based on \"reasonable costs.\" HHAs bill Medicare Part A or Part B for services provided during a beneficiary's home health episode. Part A covers services for beneficiaries with only Part A coverage, while Part B covers services for those with only Part B coverage or both Part A and Part B. Medicare Part A covers the first 100 home health visits in a series of adjacent episodes for beneficiaries who had a three-day inpatient hospital stay and received their first Medicare-covered home health visit within 14 days after discharge. Part B covers subsequent home visits and services for beneficiaries entitled to Part A and enrolled in Part B. In 2011, Part A home health expenditures were $6.9 billion, while Part B expenditures were $11.6 billion. Home Health Agencies (HHAs) are responsible for billing Medicare for services provided, even if they contract certain services to outside providers. The Medicare reimbursement process for Home Health Agencies (HHAs) involves consolidated billing, where the HHA negotiates reimbursement with outside providers. Components of Medicare reimbursement under the HH PPS include the episode base rate, case-mix adjustments, area wage adjustments, final episode rate, and low utilization payment amount. The episode base rate for Home Health Agencies (HHAs) is the base reimbursement amount for a 60-day episode of care, adjusted annually for changes in the costs of home health services. Starting in CY2014, the episode base rate will gradually change to reflect 2011 cost reports and 2012 home health claims data, inflated by market basket updates. This change is a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The home health episode base rate will be reduced by $80.95 each year from CY2014 through 2017 to reflect updated costs of home health services, as required by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The episode base rate for home health services may be adjusted for case-mix classification trends and rural service provision. Changes in costs are calculated using a market basket index, with adjustments for productivity increases mandated by the ACA. The home health market basket update may be reduced for HHAs that fail to submit quality data from OASIS and HHCAHPS. Non-compliant HHAs may face a 2% reduction in the market basket update. Less than 1% of HHAs received this reduction in 2010. In 2010, less than 1% of HHAs received a 2% reduction to the market basket update. HHAs can receive a full market basket update the following calendar year by submitting quality data. The episode base rate may be reduced for all HHAs to address trends in case-mix classification. Since CY2008, CMS has reduced the home health market basket update for nominal case-mix growth. In CY2008, CMS noted an increase in the national average HHRG case-mix index, indicating higher-reimbursed services billed by HHAs. To offset this growth, CMS reduced the episode base rate by 2.75% for CYs 2008-2010 and an additional 2.71% in 2011. In CY2013, CMS reduced the episode base rate by 1.32% to offset case-mix growth. The rural add-on, initially increased by 5% in 2005, was reestablished at a 3% increase in 2010 by the ACA. Medicare requires HHAs to assess patient outcomes for quality improvement. The OASIS tool is used to gather beneficiary assessment data for adult home care patients to determine expected care needs for the HH PPS. Beneficiaries are assigned into one of 80 unique HHRGs based on scoring data elements from the assessment, which helps determine severity levels and expected care needs. Beginning CY2008, CMS implemented refinements to the case-mix adjustment for the Home Health Resource Groups (HHRGs). The new HHRG-153 classification system reduced the number of levels for clinical and functional severity dimensions to three, added a separate group for third or greater episodes, and established multiple therapy visit thresholds. The HHRG-153 classification system, introduced in CY2008, reduced levels for severity dimensions, added a group for third or greater episodes, and set therapy visit thresholds. Data elements from the OASIS tool determine HHRG assignment, each with a unique case-mix weight adjusting reimbursement rates for expected care needs. Labor-related and non-labor-related shares of the adjusted rate are further adjusted for area wage differences. The labor-related share of the case-mix adjusted rate for home health services is typically 77%, with the remaining 23% as the non-labor-related share. This share is multiplied by an area wage index specific to the beneficiary's residence to adjust for wage differences across the country. The home health wage index is calculated annually from a survey of wages and wage-related costs from acute care hospitals. If no data is available, adjacent areas are used as a proxy measure. The final episode rate in home health services includes labor-adjusted, non-labor, and payment for non-routine medical supplies. NRS payment levels are based on patient's clinical conditions and adjusted annually. In CY2014, HHAs submitting quality data would receive a minimum NRS payment of $14.47. In CY2014, home health agencies submitting quality data would receive a minimum NRS payment of $14.47 and a maximum of $581.63. The final episode rate is a bundled Medicare payment for covered home health services over a 60-day episode of care, which may be adjusted for outlier payments and intervening events. Outlier payments are determined by a formula and additional visits, based on the cost of care provided. The outlier payment formula for Medicare home health services is based on the cost of care provided, with a fixed dollar loss amount equal to 45% of the final episode rate. Medicare may provide an outlier payment adjustment for costs exceeding this threshold, with two capitations in place to limit outlier payments. The outlier payment formula for Medicare home health services limits outlier payments to 10% of total Medicare home health payments and caps total outlier payments at 2.5%. Analysis shows that a significant portion of outlier episodes are for patients with diabetes, with 95% of high-cost episodes related to diabetes or insulin use. A partial episode payment (PEP) adjustment may be made for nursing visits per day if there is an intervening event during the beneficiary's 60-day episode. Examples of events triggering a PEP adjustment include reaching treatment goals, enrolling in Medicare Part C, or transferring to a different HHA. The adjustment is calculated based on the remaining days of care since the last billable visit as a proportion of 60. The PEP adjustment reduces the final episode rate by 66% if the beneficiary's last billable visit was on the 20th day after the first billable visit. The HH PPS provides a low utilization payment amount (LUPA) for 60-day episodes with four or fewer visits, reimbursed annually with market basket updates and adjustments. LUPA reimbursement is based on six different visits and disciplines, including home health aide, medical social services, occupational therapy, physical therapy, skilled nursing, and speech language pathology therapy. In CY2007, around 11% of home health episodes were reimbursed using LUPA. Beginning CY2014, the per visit reimbursement amounts for six different disciplines in home health care are: home health aide $54.84, medical social worker $194.12, occupational therapist $133.30, physical therapist $132.40, skilled nurse $121.10, and speech language pathologist $143.88. The ACA requires rebasing of LUPA episodes with more recent data over four years, not exceeding a 3.5% change in the CY2010 home health payment rate. CY2013 LUPAs were reconciled against 2013 average cost per visit amounts for each discipline, estimated using 2011 cost report information inflated by market basket updates. The LUPA for each discipline will be increased annually at 3.5% of the 2010 reimbursement level from CY2014 through 2017. The increase varies from $1.79 for home health aides to $6.34 for medical social workers. LUPA episodes receive an add-on payment of $99.89 in CY2014 to cover upfront costs for the beneficiary's first home health visit. The LUPA add-on payment for the first home health visit in CY2014 is $99.89 and can be increased if provided by a skilled nurse, physical therapist, or speech language pathologist. Reimbursement calculations for urban and rural areas are illustrated in Figures 3 and 4, showing adjustments based on clinical and functional severity levels. In CY2014, the episode base rate is adjusted and updated to $2,869.27 with no further adjustments for services in an urban area. The case-mix adjusted rate is calculated by multiplying the base rate by the HHRG case-mix weight and splitting it between labor-related and non-labor-related shares. The final episode rate includes labor-related share, non-labor-related share, and an NRS payment at the minimum severity level, with no outlier payments or PEP adjustments. In CY2014, the episode base rate is adjusted to $2,869.27 for services in an urban area. The case-mix adjusted rate is calculated by multiplying the base rate by the HHRG case-mix weight. The final episode rate includes labor-related share, non-labor-related share, and an NRS payment at the minimum severity level. No outlier payments or PEP adjustments are made for this calculation. Figure 4 illustrates the reimbursement for the third episode of care provided to a beneficiary in rural California with moderate clinical and functional severity, and 10 therapy visits. The CY2014 episode base rate is $2,955.35 after adjustments and updates. Total Medicare FFS home health payments increased from $8.5 billion in 2001 to roughly $18.4 billion in 2011\u2014an average annual rate of growth of 8.0%. Between 2001 and 2011, the rate of FFS enrollees who used the Medicare home health benefit increased by 33.8%, from a rate of 71 per 1,000 FFS enrollees to 95 per 1,000 FFS enrollees. The episode base rate increased by 3.7% from FY2001 to CY2011, while Medicare home health payments per user increased from $3,545 in 2001 to $5,357 in 2011, a 51% increase. The average Medicare home health payments per user increased from $3,545 in 2001 to $5,357 in 2011, showing a 51% increase at an average growth rate of roughly 4.2% per year. The rise in payments may be due to an increase in case-mix classification and the number of episodes per home health user. Freestanding HHAs had high Medicare margins, with a 13.6% margin in 2003, increasing to 19.1% in 2010 before dropping to 14.8% in 2011, likely due to a reduction in Medicare's home health reimbursement. The reduction in Medicare's home health reimbursement is likely attributed to nominal case-mix adjustments and required ACA reductions. 75% of freestanding HHAs had a Medicare margin at or greater than -0.3%, while 25% had a margin at or greater than 22.8%. Hospital-based HHAs had a lower aggregate Medicare margin of -10.9% in 2011 due to higher overhead costs. MedPAC has suggested that HHAs with high margins have lower costs, possibly due to economies of scale. Medicare Part B home health expenditures have also seen trends in spending. Medicare Part B home health expenditures have increased relative to Part A expenditures. Part B provides payment for home health services for beneficiaries enrolled in Part B, transferring some expenses from Part A to Part B. This change was implemented gradually after BBA 97. Since the implementation of the HH PPS in 2000, Medicare Part B home health expenditures have increased faster than Part A expenditures. Between 2001 and 2011, total Medicare home health expenditures rose by 8.0% annually, with Part A increasing by 5% and Part B by 10.5%. In 2001, Medicare spent $8.5 billion on home health services, with $4.2 billion under Part A and $4.3 billion under Part B. By 2011, total expenditures reached $18.4 billion, with $6.8 billion under Part A and $11.6 billion under Part B. In 2011, home health expenditures under Parts A and B declined from 2010 levels due to payment reductions and new documentation requirements from the ACA. The increase in Part B home health expenditures may be attributed to a changing home health population, with a decrease in beneficiaries with prior hospitalization. The distribution of home health services has shifted towards community-admitted beneficiaries receiving longer care periods. Part A home health payments show less county-level variation compared to Part B payments, with high expenditure outliers less concentrated in specific regions. In 2011, Part A standardized home health payments per user varied by county, with the national average at $2,125. Counties with payments at least three standard deviations above the average were at $3,007. 78 counties in 22 states had payments exceeding three standard deviations. In 2011, 78 counties in 22 states had home health payments exceeding three standard deviations from the national average. West Virginia, Kentucky, and Georgia had the largest concentration of these counties. Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Texas also had a high concentration of counties with payments above three standard deviations. MedPAC's March 2013 Report to Congress highlighted the top five states with high home health utilization, including Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas. Efforts to increase payment efficiency and quality for Medicare home health benefit have been recommended, including cost-sharing for beneficiaries and implementing a value-based purchasing program for HHAs. High utilization counties within these states had average home health episodes per user double the national average. CMS recently issued a plan to implement a value-based purchasing program for home health agencies (HHAs) to base Medicare payments on quality of care. This program is recommended by MedPAC and is part of efforts to revise Medicare benefit guidelines due to a class-action lawsuit settlement. Additionally, there is a temporary moratorium on new HHAs in certain areas. The Social Security Amendments of 1972 and the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1980 eliminated coinsurance and deductible for home health services under Part B of Medicare. Cost-sharing for home health services has been recommended as a deficit reduction policy. MedPAC recommended introducing an episode copayment to reduce Medicare spending, while the Bipartisan Policy Center released recommendations for the Joint Select Deficit Reduction Committee. The Bipartisan Policy Center proposed introducing copayments for home health services to save $40 billion over 10 years. The President's FY2014 budget suggested a $100 copayment per home health episode for new beneficiaries starting in 2017, estimated to reduce Medicare spending by $700 million from 2014 to 2023. The CBO proposed a coinsurance amount of 10% per home health episode in 2013 to reduce the deficit by $40 billion over 10 years. Increased cost-sharing for home health episodes may lower Part B premiums and increase state and federal Medicaid expenditures. Home health copayments for Medicaid-covered users may raise Medicare supplemental policy premiums. Advocates fear beneficiaries may skip needed services, leading to costlier hospitalizations. About 30% of home health users end up hospitalized, mainly for respiratory, urinary, and heart conditions. ACA mandated a value-based purchasing program for Medicare home health benefits. CMS implemented a value-based purchasing program for Medicare home health benefits to reward providers based on quality measures. The program aims to improve efficiency and quality of care. Performance measures endorsed by the National Quality Forum are used to score HHA quality. The value-based purchasing program for Medicare home health benefits aims to improve care quality by measuring clinical, process, and utilization domains, as well as beneficiaries' ratings of care. Financial incentives like penalties and rewards are implemented based on performance benchmarks, with recommendations for budget-neutral redistribution of payments from poor to high performers. In January 2011, the Center for Medicare Advocacy filed a lawsuit against HHS, challenging the \"improvement standard\" used by Medicare claims contractors. This standard required beneficiaries to show likelihood of improvement to receive coverage for skilled care services. The lawsuit aimed to ensure coverage for home health care, SNF care, and therapy services for individuals with chronic conditions and disabilities. The lawsuit challenged the \"improvement standard\" used by Medicare claims contractors, which required beneficiaries to show likelihood of improvement to receive coverage for skilled care services. Many Medicare beneficiaries with disabilities and chronic conditions were denied coverage for skilled services needed to manage their condition, maintain function, or prevent deterioration. The Jimmo v Sebelius settlement agreement requires CMS to revise guidelines for Medicare benefits to clarify that coverage is based on individualized assessment of medical need for skilled care, not on potential for improvement. The Jimmo v Sebelius settlement agreement no longer requires a showing of expected improvement for home health care. Physicians must still certify that patients are homebound and can prescribe treatment by skilled practitioners. CMS must conduct an educational campaign to communicate the revised standards. The impact on home health eligibility, utilization, and Medicare expenditures is uncertain. Robert Resichauer commented on the settlement in The New York Times. The New York Times quoted experts discussing the impact of the \"improvement standard\" settlement on Medicare costs. Section 6401 of the ACA allows the Secretary to impose temporary moratoriums on new Medicare providers to prevent fraud and abuse. CMS issued temporary moratoria on HHAs in Chicago and Miami due to high numbers compared to national average, high ratio of HHAs to beneficiaries, and high payments. Moratorium may be extended if needed or in emergency situations. CMS expanded moratoria on new HHAs applying for Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP in Broward County, FL, and the Dallas, Detroit, and Houston metropolitan areas effective January 30, 2014. Target areas were identified based on fraud risk metrics, with measures in place to prevent fraudulent providers from relocating to neighboring counties. In addition to moratoria, CMS implements fraud prevention measures such as payment suspensions and provider number revocations in these areas. The home health benefit under Medicare has evolved over the years, with changes expanding services and eligibility requirements. Efforts have been made to move individuals out of nursing facilities and back into the community to avoid hospitalizations. While initially more episodes were for beneficiaries recently hospitalized, the percentage has decreased over time. In 2010, Medicare covered a significant number of subsequent home health episodes for beneficiaries with chronic illnesses, indicating a shift towards longer treatment plans. The home health benefit has expanded over the years to include more services and eligibility requirements, aiming to reduce hospitalizations and nursing facility stays. Since October 2000, Medicare FFS home health payments have grown rapidly at an average annual rate of 8.0% between 2001 and 2011. The high Medicare margins for freestanding HHAs in 2003 and 2011 suggest challenges in estimating home health service costs through the HH PPS due to large cost variations. The decline in home health services related to prior hospital and SNF stays, along with the rise in Medicare Part B expenditures, indicates changing care needs and geographic differences among Medicare beneficiaries. This may also suggest potential overutilization. The Social Security Amendments of 1965 established the Medicare program, providing eligible beneficiaries with up to 100 home health visits each year under Part A and Part B. Medicare paid for these visits based on reasonable costs incurred by the HHA. The legislation aimed to address potential overutilization and complexity in administering home health eligibility criteria. Beneficiaries must meet certain criteria to be eligible for home health visits under Medicare Part A or Part B, including the need for skilled nursing care or therapy. A three-day inpatient hospital stay is required for Part A coverage, while Part B coverage does not have this requirement but does require enrollment in Part B. Initially, a 20% coinsurance was required for Part B home health services, but this was eliminated in 1973. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1980 (OBRA 80) eliminated the annual 100 home health visit limitation for both Medicare Parts A and B. It also removed the 3-day inpatient hospitalization requirement for Part A and eliminated the Part B deductible for home health services. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA 97) reallocated some Medicare home health expenditures from Part A to Part B. Beginning October 1, 1997, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA 97) established an interim payment system that reduced Medicare reimbursement limits for home health services. On or after October 1, 1999, BBA 97 required a home health prospective payment system (HH PPS) to replace the interim system, reimbursing home health agencies based on a beneficiary's care needs and location. The Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA) further increased episode base rates for home health services in rural areas by 10% starting April 1, 2001. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (MMA) reestablished a rural add-on with a 5% increase to the episode base rate for home health services in rural areas from April 1, 2004, to April 1, 2005. The Act also changed home health payment rates to be updated on a calendar year basis and reduced the home health market basket update by 0.8 percentage points from April 1, 2004, to December 31, 2006. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 reestablished a 5% rural add-on to Medicare payments for home health services from January 1, 2006, to January 1, 2007. It also required HHAs to submit quality data from patient assessments and surveys starting in 2007, with penalties for non-compliance. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act made modifications to the HH PPS, including reducing the episode base rate and implementing a productivity adjustment. The ACA reestablished the rural add-on for home health services in rural areas, increasing the episode base rate by 3% between 2010 and 2016. It also required a rebasing of the home health payment rate with more recent data, a four-year phase-in of the rebased rate, and documentation of a face-to-face encounter for initial home health episodes of care by physicians."
