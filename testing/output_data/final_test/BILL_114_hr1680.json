    "content": "The Act is known as the \"Police CAMERA Act\" and establishes a matching grant program for law enforcement body-worn cameras under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. The Assistant Attorney General may grant funds to States, local governments, and Indian tribes for purchasing body-worn cameras for law enforcement officers to enhance accountability, transparency, and evidence collection. Grants awarded will be for a duration of 2 years. The Assistant Attorney General disburses 50% of the grant upon awarding it to the entity, and the remaining 50% upon completion of requirements. Grants are distributed to States, local governments, or Indian tribes for purchasing body-worn cameras for law enforcement officers. The Assistant Attorney General awards grants for body-worn camera programs, including training, data storage, and policy implementation for law enforcement officers. Grant recipients must establish policies, procedures, and data collection practices before officers use body-worn cameras. Grant recipients must develop and publish policies for the safe use and data management of body-worn cameras, with community input. Compliance with data use requirements is also required. The protocol for body-worn camera data management includes protecting privacy rights, complying with open records laws, and conducting security evaluations. Officers wearing body cameras must adhere to the data collection and retention protocol. The protocol for body-worn camera data management includes minimizing data collection unrelated to law enforcement purposes and ensuring all data viewing, modification, or deletion is logged in the storage system. The protocol for body-worn camera data management includes preventing unauthorized access or disclosure of data, prohibiting law enforcement officers from accessing data without authorized purpose, and requiring the collection and reporting of data on incidents of use of force and complaints against officers. The protocol for body-worn camera data management includes the disposition of complaints against law enforcement officers and the use of camera footage for evidence collection in crime investigations. Individuals can file complaints regarding improper camera use, and data collected must comply with established requirements. The use of body-mounted cameras in law enforcement is restricted to internal and external misconduct investigations, evidence collection for crimes, and limited training purposes. The Assistant Attorney General will establish rules to ensure data is used for these specific purposes. Transfer of data to other agencies is prohibited, except for criminal investigations. An entity receiving a grant under this section may transfer data collected from a body-mounted camera to another law enforcement or intelligence agency for criminal investigations if there is reasonable suspicion of evidence related to the crime being investigated. The Federal share of the cost of a program using a grant under this part cannot exceed 75 percent. Funds from Congress for Indian tribal government agencies can be used as matching funds. The Assistant Attorney General may waive this requirement. The Assistant Attorney General may waive the matching requirement for fiscal hardship. $10,000,000 from the Office of Justice Programs budget is allocated for this purpose in fiscal years 2015 and 2016. To apply for a grant under this part, the chief executive of a State, local government, or Indian tribe must submit an application to the Assistant Attorney General with required information. Regulations will be issued within 90 days to outline application details and requirements. Additionally, a study will be conducted under Section 3023. The Assistant Attorney General will conduct a study on the efficacy of body-worn cameras in deterring excessive force by law enforcement officers, impact on accountability and transparency, responses to complaints, safety of officers, public safety, evidence collection, and storage issues. The Assistant Attorney General will conduct a study on issues related to body-worn cameras, including secure storage, privacy concerns, public access to footage, officer training, best practices, and other relevant factors. A report on the study will be submitted to Congress within 180 days."
