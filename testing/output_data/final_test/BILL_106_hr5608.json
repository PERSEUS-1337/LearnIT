    "content": "The \"Federal Drug Treatment Alternative Sentencing Act of 2000\" allows courts to consider probation with substance abuse treatment for individuals convicted of misdemeanors under the Controlled Substances Act. The court may order probation with specific conditions for substance abuse treatment, including day fines, house arrest, electronic monitoring, intensive probation supervision, day reporting centers, victim-offender reconciliation, intermittent confinement, and treatment in a therapeutic community. Offenders participating in a substance abuse program must serve a sentence to ensure treatment participation. The court may order substance abuse treatment as a condition of probation, with a preference for community-based programs in the offender's locality. Offenders must complete treatment or face imprisonment for the underlying offense. The Bureau of Prisons is required to maintain a rehabilitation program for incarcerated offenders, including substance abuse treatment and aftercare services. They must report annually to Congress on the programs and their compliance with the Act. Definitions are also provided in the legislation. The Act defines \"residential substance abuse treatment\" as a 9 to 12-month program in residential facilities aimed at addressing substance abuse issues, improving cognitive and behavioral skills, and providing addiction education and counseling. Residential substance abuse treatment programs may include counseling for addiction, parenting skills, domestic violence, sexual abuse, HIV education, access to health and social services, and reentry planning for society integration. Aftercare services involve individual and group treatment for a minimum of one year, with sustained interaction for individuals completing residential substance abuse treatment. These services aim to provide support for obtaining housing and employment post-treatment and release from prison. The term \"substance abuse or dependency\" refers to the abuse of drugs or alcohol, involving consistent personal interaction with a primary counselor, group and individual counseling sessions, social activities for recovering substance abusers, and more intensive intervention when necessary. The Attorney General must report on the racial impact and effectiveness of mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent controlled substance offenses within 1 year of this Act."
