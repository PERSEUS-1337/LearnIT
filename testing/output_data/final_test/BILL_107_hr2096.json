    "content": "The Act titled \"Responsible Stem Cell Research Act of 2001\" is cited as such. Key findings are outlined in the Act. The Congress finds that past investments in biomedical research have led to better health, improved quality of life, and reduced national healthcare expenditures. The commitment to biomedical research has expanded scientific knowledge and revolutionized medicine. Research sponsored by the National Institutes of Health has identified genetic mutations for nearly 100 diseases. Many Americans still face serious health problems, including neurodegenerative diseases in the elderly. Neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, cancer, psychiatric and neurological diseases, and diabetes pose significant health challenges for millions of Americans. Stem cell research offers promising advancements in understanding and treating these conditions. Ethically responsible stem cell research could lead to significant advancements in treating various debilitating diseases, such as cancer, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, diabetes, and heart disease. Federal investment in this research must be expanded to fully harness its potential for finding cures or effective treatments. The National Stem Cell Donor Bank is established. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a National Stem Cell Donor Bank to collect and preserve qualifying human stem cells for research and therapeutic purposes. The Donor Bank will be supervised by the Secretary and a board of directors meeting specified criteria. The Donor Bank will operate a patient registry, find suitable donors, and conduct educational activities for qualifying human stem cells. The Secretary will establish criteria for quality standards, donor selection, and informed consent. The section outlines criteria for protecting donors and recipients, ensuring proper stem cell collection and transportation, and establishing confidentiality standards for patient records. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2002 through 2006. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may conduct and support research using qualifying human stem cells. $30,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2002, with additional funding for fiscal years 2003 through 2006. Definitions for \"qualifying human stem cells\" and \"Secretary\" are provided in the Act."
