The OAS was founded in 1948 by the United States to create a forum for hemispheric nations to address mutual concerns. Over the years, OAS decisions often reflected U.S. policy, especially during the early Cold War period and in the 1990s after the Cold War ended. The end of the Cold War in the 1990s led to a decline in the United States' authority in the Western Hemisphere. Latin American and Caribbean countries elected diverse leaders, experienced economic growth, and pursued independent foreign policies less deferential to the U.S. policymakers have responded to this shift. U.S. policymakers have responded to the United States' declining influence in the OAS by debating the organization's effectiveness in supporting democracy and human rights in Latin America. Some Members of Congress urge stronger action on these issues, while others argue for reforms to strengthen the OAS. The debate continues as Congress considers appropriations and legislation related to the organization. The report discusses the history, funding, and priorities of the OAS, along with policy issues like the Inter-American Democratic Charter, human rights challenges, and Cuba's potential reintegration. The OAS charter was adopted in 1948, with multilateral relations dating back to the late 1800s. The First International Conference of American States in 1889-1890 led to the establishment of the Pan American Union, later renamed the OAS. The Convention on the Rights and Duties of States in 1933 promoted equality and nonintervention among nations. Hemispheric ties were further strengthened with the Rio Treaty in 1947. The OAS Charter and American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man were signed in 1948 to legally codify the institutions and principles of the inter-American system. The OAS expanded its activities into various areas over time, including the creation of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in 1959 and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in 1979. The organization also focused on economic, social, cultural, scientific, and technological programs, particularly after the launch of President Kennedy's \"Alliance for Progress\" in 1961. The OAS expanded its activities over time, creating the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in 1959 and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in 1979. The organization addressed narcotics trafficking with the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission in 1986 and terrorism with the Inter-American Committee Against Terrorism in 1999. The Inter-American Democratic Charter was adopted in 2001 to promote democracy in the region. The OAS Charter aims to strengthen peace and security, promote democracy, prevent disputes, and provide for common action in case of aggression. The OAS aims to solve political, juridical, and economic problems, promote economic and social development, eradicate extreme poverty, and limit conventional weapons. It consists of the General Assembly, Permanent Council, and General Secretariat as primary bodies responsible for setting and carrying out the organization's agenda. The General Assembly is the main policymaking organ that meets annually to discuss current issues, approve budgets, and set policies for other OAS bodies. The General Assembly of the OAS approves budgets, sets policies, and governs other OAS bodies. It consists of delegations from 34 member states, with decisions requiring majority or two-thirds votes. The 47th regular session was in Canc\u00fan in June 2017, and the next session is scheduled for June 4-5, 2018 in Washington, DC. The day-to-day governance is handled by the Permanent Council at the organization's headquarters in Washington, DC. The Permanent Council, based in Washington, DC, maintains friendly relations among member states, assists in dispute resolution, regulates the General Secretariat in the absence of the General Assembly, receives reports from inter-American bodies, and can take diplomatic action in case of government alteration. Each member state appoints a representative with one vote, and decisions require two-thirds majority. Operating by consensus, it works closely with the General Assembly. The Permanent Council in Washington, DC, maintains friendly relations among member states, assists in dispute resolution, regulates the General Secretariat in the absence of the General Assembly, and can take diplomatic action in case of government alteration. The General Secretariat, led by the Secretary General and Assistant Secretary General, implements policies set by the General Assembly and Permanent Council. The Secretary General, elected by the General Assembly for a five-year term with the possibility of one reelection, serves as the legal representative of the organization and can establish offices and hire personnel to implement OAS mandates. The effectiveness of the OAS relies heavily on the leadership of the Secretary General. Luis Almagro, the current Secretary General, took office in May 2015, succeeding Jos\u00e9 Miguel Insulza. Almagro has been more active in addressing democracy and human rights issues, which has garnered praise from U.S. policymakers but has also caused some member states to be alienated. The OAS budget for 2018 is expected to be $151 million, with the largest portion allocated to the Regular Fund for daily operating expenses. The Regular Fund of the OAS is financed through assessed contributions from member states based on gross national income. Specific Funds, voluntary contributions, have been collected since 1997 to supplement the budget. The United States is the top funder, contributing $68 million in FY2017, 44% of the approved budget. The United States contributed $50.4 million for its assessed contribution and $17.6 million in voluntary contributions to the OAS in FY2017. These voluntary contributions support various initiatives such as democracy promotion, human rights protection, development assistance programs, humanitarian demining in Colombia, and security cooperation in the Caribbean. Legislation has been introduced to assess the effectiveness of U.S. investments in the OAS. Other top member state contributors in 2017 were Brazil, Canada, and Mexico. The top contributors to the OAS in 2017 were Brazil, Canada, Mexico, Argentina, and Peru. The largest nonmember donors were the United Kingdom, Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Germany. The Trump Administration requested $42 million for the OAS in FY2018, which is $8.5 million less than the required payment. Congress has not yet passed a full-year appropriations measure for FY2018. The House and Senate recommend U.S. voluntary contributions to the OAS for FY2018, including funding for the MACCIH, Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, democracy programs, and OAS development assistance. The Administration's FY2019 budget request includes $41.9 million for the U.S. assessed contribution to the OAS, with no proposed voluntary contributions. The OAS focuses on strengthening democracy, promoting human rights, advancing development, and enhancing security in the Western Hemisphere. It has actively supported democratic governance since the end of the Cold War, culminating in the adoption of the Inter-American Democratic Charter in 2001. The OAS upholds commitments through activities like supporting elections, providing technical assistance for institutional development, and coordinating collective action. It has deployed over 250 electoral observation missions in 27 countries since 1962, earning a reputation for impartiality. The OAS observes multiple electoral processes annually, with countries inviting them to observe elections and seeking separate funding. In 2018, eight countries, including Brazil, invited the OAS to observe their elections. Eight countries, including Brazil, have invited the OAS to observe their elections in 2018. Some analysts criticize OAS observation missions for legitimizing flawed elections. The OAS also provides technical assistance to member states to strengthen institutions and combat corruption through the Inter-American Convention against Corruption. The OAS conducts reciprocal reviews of member states' implementation of the anticorruption convention, provides advisory support for governance matters in countries like Colombia, and assists in developing stronger anticorruption legal frameworks in Honduras. However, the OAS has faced challenges in mobilizing collective efforts to defend democracy. The OAS has faced challenges in defending democracy, with the General Secretariat and other bodies highlighting threats to democratic governance. Despite calls to take action against Venezuela's collapse of democracy, collective action has been hindered by member states aligned with Venezuela or benefiting from subsidized oil. The OAS has struggled to defend democracy, facing challenges in taking action against Venezuela's democratic collapse. The U.S. and its allies have been selective in their defense of democracy, with the organization failing to collectively assess the legitimacy of elections in Honduras despite irregularities. Secretary General Almagro called for new elections, but some nations recognized the official results before a meeting could be convened. Many analysts view the Inter-American human rights system, including the IACHR and the Inter-American Court, as the most effective part of the OAS. These bodies are autonomous and can condemn violations of democracy and the rule of law in the region. The IACHR promotes and protects human rights, bringing attention to abuses by repressive regimes since its inception in 1959. The IACHR continues to receive, analyze, and investigate over 2,500 allegations of human rights violations annually in the Americas. It issues requests for precautionary measures and monitors human rights situations in member states, with special attention to Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Venezuela in its most recent report. The IACHR focuses on human rights issues in Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Venezuela. It has created 10 rapporteurships addressing various vulnerable groups. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights interprets the American Convention on Human Rights, with 20 OAS member states accepting its jurisdiction. The United States does not. The Inter-American Court has been crucial in shaping international human rights law, delivering justice to victims and promoting systemic changes. However, critics argue that the court's credibility is at risk due to its involvement in controversial issues like same-sex marriage. Despite progress in economic growth and social inclusion, poverty and inequality persist in many countries. The OAS supports development through its Department of Economic Development, focusing on enhancing productivity and competitiveness for small and medium-sized enterprises. The Inter-American Agency for Cooperation and Development provides training to governments to strengthen their capacities for trade agreements and new opportunities. The Development Cooperation Fund supports member states with social inclusion and productive employment projects, but voluntary contributions have declined significantly. The OAS Development Cooperation Fund saw a significant decrease in funding from $6 million in 2008 to $290,000 in 2017. Despite this, the fund is still seen as beneficial for member states by providing seed funding for partnerships. Some suggest the OAS should focus on areas like democracy promotion and conflict resolution instead of development programs. Member states prioritize economic and social development, but the OAS has shifted focus to hemispheric security in recent years. The OAS has increased attention on hemispheric security in the past two decades, establishing the Secretariat for Multidimensional Security in 2005 to address transnational crime and regional security threats comprehensively. The Secretariat supports various activities such as reducing gang violence, preventing human trafficking, and coordinating antidrug efforts through CICAD. CICAD helps member states strengthen antidrug policies, provide technical assistance, and build trust for cooperation. After regional leaders expressed frustration with U.S.-backed counternarcotics policies, the 2012 Summit of the Americas called for the OAS to analyze the results and explore alternative approaches. CICAD's 2013 reports suggested policy flexibility, including marijuana decriminalization, incorporated into the 2016-2020 Hemispheric Plan of Action on Drugs. CICTE coordinates counterterrorism efforts among OAS member states. CICTE helps member states implement the 2002 Inter-American Convention against Terrorism by conducting training courses and activities focused on cybersecurity, border controls, terrorism finance prevention, and legal framework enhancements. The United States plays a significant role in funding the organization, providing over 44% of its funding in FY2017. Congress appropriates funds for the U.S. contribution and voluntary contributions to support specific initiatives. The United States provides significant funding to the Organization of American States (OAS) and Congress oversees how the funds are spent. Congress is also involved in the development of inter-American treaties and provides oversight on OAS actions. Key policy issues for Congress include the Inter-American Democratic Charter, human rights challenges, OAS management and budget, and the potential reintegration of Cuba into the inter-American system. The Inter-American Democratic Charter, adopted in September 2001, asserts the right to democracy in the Americas. It emphasizes elements like human rights, rule of law, political pluralism, and separation of powers. The OAS is tasked with promoting democracy through electoral observation missions and programs. Mechanisms for collective action by member states are established in case of threats to democratic institutions. There has been ongoing debate on the application of the Charter's provisions. The operational scope of the Inter-American Democratic Charter is limited due to tension between nonintervention and defending democracy, lack of clear criteria for democratic breakdown, and limited access for powers outside the executive branch to the OAS. Member states have been hesitant to invoke collective action mechanisms despite acknowledging the need for it in cases of democratic breakdowns. The OAS follows a principle of nonintervention and can only intervene in a country if requested, or after a democratic rupture has occurred. In the case of Honduras in 2009, the government did not request OAS assistance until after the ouster of then-president Manuel Zelaya. This delayed collective action by member states until the country was already in crisis, leading to Honduras being suspended from the OAS. Diplomatic efforts were unable to reverse the situation. The Democratic Charter's ambiguity on defining unconstitutional interruptions of the democratic order has hindered its effectiveness. Elected leaders in the region have taken actions to consolidate power within constitutional procedures, leading member states to hesitate in responding. The Venezuelan government's erosion of democratic institutions was documented for over a decade before the Democratic Charter was invoked in 2016. General Almagro invoked the Democratic Charter in May 2016, requiring the Permanent Council to assess the situation in Venezuela. Despite most member states supporting OAS efforts, a small group aligned with Venezuela has blocked resolutions. The composition of the OAS has been a barrier to applying the Democratic Charter, as the Permanent Council members interpret consent for intervention as needing approval from the nation's executive power. This limits other branches of government and civil society from invoking the Charter's mechanisms. Charter's collective action mechanisms were not invoked when Ecuador's Supreme Court was dissolved in 2004. It was only after the Ecuadoran Congress removed the President and requested OAS assistance in 2005 that member states sent a mission. U.S. policy has focused on promoting democracy in Latin America and the Caribbean, with Congress supporting efforts to strengthen democratic governance and civil society accountability. Members of Congress have praised progress in the region while expressing concerns about declining democracy quality. The OAS's role in promoting democracy in the hemisphere is debated, with some criticizing its failure to address democratic erosion in countries like Venezuela and Nicaragua. The 115th Congress has used the OAS to address democracy deterioration in Venezuela, supporting Secretary General Almagro's invocation of the Inter-American Democratic Charter. Almagro's call for invoking the Inter-American Democratic Charter in Venezuela is supported by H.Res. 259, which urges OAS member states to push for free elections and release political prisoners. Despite some in Congress wanting broader application of the Charter, there is little regional support due to historical U.S. intervention. Given historical U.S. intervention and reluctance to foreign involvement, OAS member states are unlikely to invoke the Democratic Charter for collective action unless faced with democratic breakdowns resembling coups. The inter-American human rights system, a key part of the OAS, has faced challenges, with calls for significant changes after decisions that upset regional governments. Some member states proposed significant changes to the IACHR, such as stricter criteria for precautionary measures and shifting focus from individual cases to general human rights promotion. The IACHR rejected major recommendations and made minor procedural adjustments. Despite ongoing calls for radical changes, the system has struggled with limited resources, with half of its budget coming from member states' dues. The IACHR's budget is primarily funded by the OAS Regular Fund, with additional support from voluntary contributions. In 2016, a funding crisis almost led to layoffs and activity suspensions, but was averted by a last-minute surge in donations. In 2017, the OAS General Assembly approved a 33% annual increase in funding for the IACHR and Inter-American Court, aiming for full funding by 2020. This move may strain the OAS budget but aims to ensure the sustainability of the inter-American human rights system. Congress has shown support for the inter-American human rights system by appropriating $4.5 million in voluntary contributions to the OAS for human rights programs. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended providing $5 million for the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression in FY2018. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended providing $5 million in voluntary contributions to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, including $500,000 for the Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression. Some analysts argue that the United States lacks credibility in defending the human rights system due to its reluctance to ratify the American Convention on Human Rights. This reluctance has created a multitiered human rights system in the hemisphere that is viewed as problematic by the IACHR and many OAS member states. The IACHR has issued recommendations to the United States in 27 cases since 2001, with the U.S. in full compliance in one case, partial compliance in 10 cases, and noncompliance in 16 cases. Recommendations include halting capital punishment and informing detained foreign nationals of their right to consular assistance. The U.S. is currently subject to the IACHR's jurisdiction under the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man. The U.S. government argues that the Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man does not create legally binding obligations. The OAS has faced budget problems due to stagnant member state contributions, leading to a structural deficit. Financial reserves were exhausted by 2010. The OAS has faced financial difficulties due to stagnant member state contributions, leading to a structural deficit. Financial reserves were depleted by 2010, forcing the organization to delay infrastructure investments, reduce staff posts, and struggle with cash flow shortages. The 2017 report highlighted the ongoing budgetary imbalance and the need for member states to identify programs to cut in order to address the financial sustainability issue. Some analysts believe that the OAS's budget problems have created a cycle where it can't invest in necessary resources, leading to a loss of importance. Congress passed the OAS Revitalization and Reform Act of 2013 to address these issues, calling for core function prioritization, budget reforms, and quota changes by 2018. The OAS Revitalization and Reform Act of 2013 directed the U.S. Secretary of State to develop a strategy for OAS reforms and provide quarterly briefings to Congress. The OAS has made progress on recommended reforms, realigning its structure and resources to focus on core priorities. The General Secretariat has drafted a strategic plan with objectives, activities, indicators, and timeframes for measuring progress. The OAS is working on reforms to reduce the largest contributor's assessed dues to less than 50% of the total. This may require increased contributions from other member states or cuts to OAS staff and programs. The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget request for the OAS is $8.5 million less than the U.S. government's estimated quota assessment. The U.S. government's estimated quota assessment for the OAS aims to share the funding burden more equitably among member states. Cuba, a founding member of the OAS, has been suspended since 1962 due to its adherence to Marxism-Leninism. The reintegration of Cuba into the organization remains a contentious issue among member states. The OAS has been a source of contention among member states, with efforts to include Cuba in hemispheric forums. In 2009, a measure was adopted to repeal the 1962 resolution suspending Cuba from the OAS. Cuba's potential participation would be the result of a dialogue process, but the Cuban government showed no interest. In 2015, Cuban President Ra\u00fal Castro attended the Seventh Summit of the Americas in Panama, although not officially part of the OAS. The OAS serves as the technical secretariat for the Summits of the Americas, with Panama inviting Cuba to attend the summit. Secretary General Almagro aims to integrate Cuba into the OAS, despite Cuba's lack of interest. Relations between Almagro and the Cuban government have deteriorated. Relations between Almagro and the Cuban government have worsened in recent years due to Almagro's calls for democratic reforms. Cuba denied Almagro entry in 2017, and Ra\u00fal Castro stated in 2018 that OAS officials are not welcome in Cuba. Members of Congress have differing views on U.S. policy towards Cuba, with some supporting isolation and others advocating for a change in the sanctions-based approach in place since the 1960s. Members of Congress have differing views on U.S. policy towards Cuba, with some supporting isolation and others advocating for engagement to encourage reforms. Congressional debate reflects disagreements over broader U.S. policy towards Cuba, with some opposing efforts to reintegrate Cuba into the inter-American system. Congressional actions related to normalization of relations with Cuba could have broader implications. The reintegration of Cuba into the inter-American system could impact U.S. interests in the hemisphere. Latin American governments support the rapprochement between the U.S. and Cuba. Some analysts believe this move removed a contentious issue in U.S.-Latin American relations. It may also create political space for allies to pressure Cuba on human rights and democracy. The OAS, composed of 35 diverse nations, operates based on consensus but is slow to arrive at decisions, especially when ideologically polarized. Member states' inability to establish consensus can lead to inaction. The OAS carries out activities to promote democracy, protect human rights, and enhance regional security cooperation. The United States, as the largest financial contributor, remains influential within the organization. However, there are conflicting tendencies between OAS actions and stated objectives, leading to a decline in the US government's ability to advance its policy initiatives within the organization. This has sparked a congressional debate over the utility of the OAS. The OAS activities promote democracy, protect human rights, and enhance regional security cooperation. The US, as the largest financial contributor, is influential within the organization. However, conflicting tendencies between OAS actions and objectives have led to a decline in the US government's ability to advance its policy initiatives, sparking a congressional debate on the OAS's utility for US interests in the Western Hemisphere."
