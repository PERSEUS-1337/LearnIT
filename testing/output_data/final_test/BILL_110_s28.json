    "content": "The Act titled \"Northern Border Travel Facilitation Act\" establishes a State Driver's License and Identification Enrollment Program. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 amends Section 7209 to establish a State Driver's License and Identification Card Enrollment Program for US citizens. The Program requires cooperation between the Secretary of State, Secretary of Homeland Security, and participating states. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 establishes a State Driver's License and Identification Card Enrollment Program for US citizens. A driver's license or identity card issued by a participating state that meets the requirements of the REAL ID Act of 2005 and includes the individual's US citizenship status allows citizens of the United States to enter from Canada without additional documentation. The State that issued the license or card must have an approved mechanism to verify the individual's US citizenship status, without requiring it to be included on the license or card. All information regarding the applicant's citizenship status must be managed in the same manner as information collected through the US passport. The US passport application process collects information and restricts its use. Citizens of Canada can enter the US with approved Canadian identity documents meeting security requirements. The Secretary of Homeland Security ensures technology standards for Canadian identification documents for entry into the US. Children can enter the US without proof of citizenship under certain conditions. Children under 16 can enter the US from Canada or another country with a legal guardian without proof of citizenship, as long as the guardian provides valid identification. The Program allows individuals to enter the US from countries other than Canada or using evidence of citizenship other than a driver's license. This does not create a national identity card or certification of citizenship for any other purpose. The Program allows entry into the US from countries other than Canada using alternative citizenship evidence. The term 'State' is defined as various US territories. Implementation of the Program by Homeland Security and State Departments is required by December 31, 2009. The Northern Border Travel Facilitation Act allows US and Canadian citizens to enter the US from Canada by demonstrating citizenship with specific documents."
