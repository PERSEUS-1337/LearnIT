    "content": "The Act titled \"Electronic Financial Services Efficiency Act of 1997\" is aimed at improving electronic financial services. The Congress acknowledges the impact of new technological applications on bank capital markets and business operations. Financial and consumer transactions are now conducted digitally, allowing for instant information retrieval and electronic transactions. These changes affect documentation, goods and services transactions, fund transfers, and other aspects of commerce and finance. The emergence of new electronic commerce infrastructure and authentication methodologies has impacted the national payment system, financial services industry, and capital markets. Parties in transactions can now use electronic authentication methods of equal or greater reliability. The United States should be actively involved in developing global standards for electronic authentication to ensure market access and growth are not limited by narrowly defining industries that can provide these services. Congress should enable a framework for government, business enterprises, and financial institutions to participate in electronic authentication services. The purpose of this Act is to establish a framework for electronic commerce involving government, businesses, financial institutions, and consumers. It aims to recognize digital authentication as an alternative to paper-based methods, improve efficiency in capital markets and payment systems, and harmonize practices for electronic authentication. The Act aims to establish a framework for electronic commerce involving government, businesses, financial institutions, and consumers, recognizing digital authentication as an alternative to paper-based methods and improving efficiency in capital markets and payment systems. For the purpose of this Act, definitions include electronic commerce as business conducted electronically, electronic means encompassing various forms of computer-mediated communication, and electronic authentication as methods to verify identity and documents in electronic commerce. The curr_chunk discusses the definitions of digital signature, certification authority, and trusted third party in the context of electronic commerce. A digital signature is an electronic symbol with legal force, a certification authority provides assurance for digital signatures, and a trusted third party is a known certification authority in transactions. A certification authority is a trusted entity in electronic transactions whose certificate is relied upon by parties. The term \"certificate\" refers to an electronic message attesting to the certificate holder. The term \"State\" is defined as per the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, and an \"affiliate\" is a person under common control with another. SEC. 4. COMMUNICATIONS WITH FEDERAL GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES. Any party in written communication with a US Government agency or court can use a digital signature with a trusted third-party certificate. SEC. 5. VALIDITY OF ELECTRONIC AUTHENTICATION. Electronic authentication that meets standards outlined in the Act will be equivalent to paper-based signatures for communications with Federal agencies, courts, and instrumentalities of the US government. This includes satisfying rules requiring records to be in writing and signatures to be present. The Act states that electronic authentication will be equivalent to paper-based signatures for communications with Federal agencies, satisfying rules requiring records to be in writing and signatures to be present. SEC. 6. CRITERIA FOR ELIGIBILITY. Electronic authentication technology must reliably establish the identity and integrity of electronic documents or communications. Public key cryptography and signature dynamics technology are currently accepted signature technologies, with criteria for evaluating other emerging technologies. These technologies must have unique identification methods and be capable of verification. The identification technology must be capable of verification and under the sole control of the user. It should be linked to data or communication in a way that any alteration would invalidate the authentication. SEC. 7. NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CERTIFICATION AUTHORITIES. The National Association of Certification Authorities (referred to as the \"Association\") is established for electronic authentication services in the United States. Membership can be denied for decertification or failure to comply with established guidelines. The National Association of Certification Authorities (referred to as the \"Association\") may deny membership to providers of electronic authentication services who fail to meet standards or engage in practices inconsistent with the Act. Lack of cooperation in supplying information may also result in denial of affiliation with a member. The Association may request information and examine the books of individuals or groups related to a member. Rules must ensure fair allocation of dues and fees. The Association will establish a Standards Review Committee for Electronic Authentications. The Standards Review Committee will establish criteria for the electronic authentication industry, including roles, responsibilities, application of standards, recognition of foreign standards, and transparency requirements. With approval from the Secretary of the Treasury, the Committee will create guidelines, standards, and codes of conduct. The Standards Review Committee will enforce guidelines and codes of conduct for electronic authentication, including consumer protections and disciplinary procedures. The Standards Review Committee ensures fair disciplinary actions for members and notifies certification authorities of any violations, requiring a response within 15 days. The Standards Review Committee can censure, suspend, or decertify a certification authority for violating guidelines, standards, or codes of conduct. The Standards Review Committee has the authority to penalize certification authorities for providing electronic authentication services in the United States, including imposing monetary penalties. Parties aggrieved by the Committee's order can seek judicial review in the United States Court of Appeals within 30 days. The Standards Review Committee has the authority to penalize certification authorities for electronic authentication services in the US. The court can affirm, set aside, or modify the Committee's order and require appropriate action. The Committee's findings on facts are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence. The Committee must report its activities to the Secretary of the Treasury by February 20 and July 20 each year. The Standards Review Committee conducts studies and makes recommendations to the Secretary of the Treasury regarding the implementation of electronic authentication as an alternative to paper-based verification methods. The Secretary of the Treasury oversees the Electronic Authentication Standards Review Committee semiannually to discuss and address any issues that may have arisen. Additionally, consumer protection measures are outlined in Section 9. No provision of this Act shall impair consumer rights under applicable laws for transactions authenticated by digital signature or electronic authentication standards. Transactions must include a notification of authentication prescribed by the Electronic Authentication Standards Review Committee. Definitions for this section are provided. Definitions for this section clarify that a consumer is an individual, a transaction is for personal, family, or household purposes, and communication is related to personal, family, or household matters."
