    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act.\" The Congress finds that citizens have a right to keep and bear arms under the Second Amendment. Lawsuits have been filed against firearms manufacturers for harm caused by third parties. The manufacture, sale, and use of firearms in the US are heavily regulated by federal, state, and local laws. The Congress believes that firearms manufacturers should not be held liable for harm caused by others misusing their products, as it would erode public confidence in the legal system and threaten constitutional rights. The liability actions against firearms manufacturers are seen as an unreasonable burden on commerce and a potential expansion of civil liability not intended by the Constitution or legislatures. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act aims to prevent lawsuits against firearms manufacturers for criminal misuse of their products, ensuring citizens' access to firearms for lawful purposes under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act aims to prevent lawsuits against firearms manufacturers for criminal misuse of their products, ensuring citizens' access to firearms for lawful purposes under the Fourteenth Amendment. Section 5 of the Amendment aims to prevent unreasonable burdens on commerce and protect the First Amendment rights of firearms industry members. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act prohibits qualified civil liability actions in Federal or State courts. Any pending actions will be dismissed immediately. The Act defines key terms such as \"engaged in the business\" and \"manufacturer\" in relation to the sale and manufacturing of ammunition. The term \"person\" includes individuals, corporations, associations, partnerships, and governmental entities. A \"qualified product\" refers to firearms, ammunition, or components transported in interstate commerce. A \"qualified civil liability action\" is a lawsuit against a manufacturer or seller of a qualified product. A qualified civil liability action is a lawsuit against a manufacturer or seller of a qualified product for damages or injunctive relief resulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse of the product. This does not include actions against a transferor convicted under certain laws, actions for negligent entrustment or negligence per se, or actions involving manufacturers or sellers. A qualified civil liability action can be brought against a manufacturer or seller of a qualified product for various reasons, including violations of state or federal statutes, breach of contract or warranty, and physical injuries or property damage from a defect in design or manufacture. Negligent entrustment is defined as part of these actions. Negligent entrustment involves supplying a qualified product to someone who is likely to use it in a way that poses an unreasonable risk of injury. Seller refers to an importer engaged in interstate commerce and licensed under relevant laws. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of different entities involved in the business of selling ammunition in interstate or foreign commerce, as outlined in title 18 of the United States Code. This includes importers, dealers, and persons engaged in the sale of ammunition at the wholesale or retail level. The term \"State\" is also defined to include various jurisdictions within the United States. The curr_chunk defines a \"trade association\" as a non-profit organization with 2 or more members who are manufacturers or sellers of a qualified product. It includes various jurisdictions within the United States, such as states, territories, and political subdivisions. The curr_chunk states that the document was passed by the House of Representatives on April 9, 2003, with the attestation of Jeff Trandahl, the Clerk."
