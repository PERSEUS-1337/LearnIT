    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Driver's License Improvement and Security Act of 2004\". It includes findings related to driver's licenses. The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 exposed flaws in the Nation's domestic security, particularly in the identification system. Drivers' licenses issued by States are widely used for identity verification but inconsistent requirements and insufficient verification have made them vulnerable to fraud and identity theft. Different designs on these licenses have led to a market for fake cards that appear authentic. The use of new technologies will enhance the security of State identification systems, including drivers' licenses and identification cards. This improvement will help prevent fraud, underage purchase of alcohol and tobacco, and reduce identity theft. The Federal Government is recommended to develop standards for State identification cards. The 9/11 Commission recommended setting standards for the issuance of drivers' licenses to reduce identity fraud using biometric identifiers. The 9/11 Commission recommended setting standards for the issuance of drivers' licenses to reduce identity fraud using biometric identifiers. State driver's license and identification card pilot programs are established. The Secretary will establish a voluntary pilot program to assist States in developing and implementing standards for driver's licenses and identification cards with biometric identifiers. The pilot program aims to help States develop driver's license and identification card programs that meet specific requirements. States must submit an application to participate, and the Secretary may select up to 6 States. To be eligible, States must provide assurances that they will implement a program with computer chips in licenses and ID cards. (A) A participating State must embed a computer chip in new or renewed driver's licenses or ID cards. The chip should contain all text data, encoded biometric data, and encryption to prevent unauthorized access. The text discusses access to data stored on a chip in driver's licenses or ID cards, emphasizing the need for consent except for authorized entities. It also mentions the acceptance of data from non-governmental devices with authorization and compliance with standards set by the Secretary. A participating State must obtain and maintain biometric data for driver's licenses and ID cards, which can only be matched with the holder's cooperation. States must also participate in linking databases for electronic access. The program established by the Secretary allows States to access information from other States' motor vehicle databases. Participating States must include specific information in their databases, excluding biometric data stored on licenses and cards. The participating State must include biometric data and motor vehicle drivers' histories on new or renewed driver's licenses or identification cards. These documents must have tamper-resistant security features for visual verification. The participating State must accurately document the identity and residence of individuals before issuing driver's licenses or identification cards. The Secretary will issue guidelines within 2 years to assist States in complying with the requirements, including standards for computer chip technology. Standards for biometric data on driver's licenses and identification cards include storing multiple applications, encoding biometric data on computer chips, obtaining biometric data from applicants, and linking State motor vehicle data. Standards for linking State motor vehicle databases, security features on State drivers' licenses, documentation of identity and residence, and a numbering system for State licenses to prevent duplication. The Secretary may issue guidelines for driver's license programs in consultation with relevant organizations and may provide grants to States for program development. The Secretary may provide grants to States for program development that meet specific requirements, with the Federal share of costs being 100 percent or less as determined by the Secretary. States receiving grants must submit reports on activities, and the Secretary will report to Congress on program results and technology assessment within one year of making grants. Authorization of $100,000,000 for technology assessment and program implementation for driver's license and identification card programs in participating States. The National Institute of Standards and Technology is addressed in Section 4. The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology will conduct a study on on-card biometric technologies in consultation with relevant parties. The study aims to determine the most effective biometric identifier and technologies to prevent individuals from having multiple State licenses. A report is due within one year of enactment. The Director will submit a report to the Secretary of Transportation within 1 year of enactment. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the study."
