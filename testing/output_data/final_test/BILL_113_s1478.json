    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Protect Advanced Communications for Emergency Services Act of 2013\" or the \"PACES Act.\" Congress finds that there are 302,000,000 active wireless mobile device users in the United States, with 51,000,000 people living in households relying solely on wireless communication. Over 300,000 wireless E-9-1-1 calls are made daily, with a majority originating from mobile devices. An advanced wireless 9-1-1 service system is crucial for law enforcement, homeland security, and emergency responders. The Federal Communications Commission requires wireless carriers and IP-enabled voice service providers to offer 9-1-1 services for accurate location tracking of callers. The increasing reliance on wireless technologies in the United States necessitates national text, picture, and video capabilities for 9-1-1 calls. Emerging technologies play a vital role in connecting the public with emergency medical services. Wireless carriers and vendors are facing patent infringement lawsuits while working to comply with the Federal mandate for E-9-1-1 location-based technology. This is impacting their ability to provide accurate emergency response services and hindering public safety efforts. Entities are compromising wireless carriers' ability to provide current 9-1-1 services and deterring the implementation of innovative technologies for next-generation 9-1-1 capabilities. Section 1498 of title 28, United States Code, protects those required to provide services for the government while ensuring legitimate patent holders receive fair compensation. This Act clarifies that patented technologies needed for emergency communication services must be compensated appropriately. The Act ensures that communication services provided for the United States under section 1498 of title 28, United States Code, do not infringe on patents and allows for patent litigation to proceed. The amendment to Section 1498 of title 28, United States Code, grants jurisdiction for claims related to 9-1-1, enhanced 9-1-1, or other emergency communication services against wireless carriers or IP-enabled voice service providers."
