    "content": "The world is facing a shortage of helium-3, a rare isotope with various applications. Federal officials warn that the shortage will impact investments in homeland security and scientific research. Scientists are concerned about the potential threat to research fields. Helium-3 is an inert, nontoxic gas with a very small natural abundance. Options are being explored to address the shortage and allocate the limited supply. The federal government manufactures helium-3 through nuclear decay of tritium, a byproduct of the U.S. nuclear weapons program. Helium-3 is in high demand for neutron detection in national security, industry, and science applications. Helium-3 is in high demand for neutron detection in national security, industry, and science. It is also used for its ability to polarize its nucleus in applications like MRI for real-time visualization and in low-temperature physics to achieve superfluidity at temperatures below 2.5 millikelvin. Helium-3 is not traded in the marketplace but is produced as a byproduct of nuclear weapons maintenance. Helium-3 is produced as a byproduct of nuclear weapons maintenance and accumulated in a stockpile in the United States. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) of the Department of Energy (DOE) is the U.S. producer of helium-3, which is then sold at public auctions by the DOE Office of Isotope Production and Research. The auction process has not always been competitive, with most sales going to just two companies. Spectra Gases, Inc. and GE Reuter Stokes, Inc. are major purchasers, with Spectra Gases owning the only facility licensed to remove trace amounts of tritium from raw helium-3. Despite increasing demand and declining supply, the historical auction price of helium-3 has remained stable. Despite declining supply and increasing demand, the historical auction price of helium-3 has been steady, ranging from $40 to $85 per liter. Production of helium-3 exceeded consumption before 2001, but consumption has risen rapidly in the past decade. This increase is due in part to the deployment of neutron detectors using helium-3 at the U.S. border for security purposes. The stockpile has been drawn down since 2001, with ongoing demand expected to exceed supply. In 2009, the government formed an Integrated Product Team to examine helium-3 supply and demand, concluding that further allocations would require interagency agreement. In July 2009, an interagency policy committee (IPC) was established by the White House National Security Staff to investigate helium-3 strategies. The IPC recommended ceasing auctions and allocating helium-3 based on three priorities: essential applications, nuclear material detection at ports, and programs with significant costs incurred. If helium-3 were traded freely, price could regulate supply and demand. The supply of helium-3 is currently allocated based on national needs, as demand exceeds supply. Public policy issues arise regarding increasing supply, reducing demand, and evaluating the current allocation process. The federal government began deploying neutron detectors at the U.S. border after 9/11, leading to increased demand for helium-3. Annual demand quickly exceeded supply, causing the stockpile to shrink. The supply of helium-3 quickly exceeded the annual demand, causing the stockpile to shrink. Federal officials realized that there was insufficient helium-3 to meet future demand, which is projected to significantly increase. Alternative sources of helium-3 exist domestically and internationally, but the ease of extraction and availability are unclear. Rationing or developing alternative technologies could reduce demand, but these options are not yet readily available. Policymakers may need to use a combination of supply- and demand-based approaches to address the helium-3 shortage. They face challenging decisions on how to allocate the scarce resource amidst competing priorities like science versus security, private sector versus public sector, and national needs versus international obligations. Unique applications with specific needs, such as cryogenic research, medical imaging, and neutron detection, pose particular challenges. Policymakers also need to decide on increasing helium-3 supply or reducing helium-3 demand to address future concerns. Policymakers must decide on how to allocate the limited helium-3 supply and set the appropriate price for diverse end-users. The federal government's response to the helium-3 shortage was reactive, with an interagency policy committee developing a rationing scheme for distribution. Some users, both federal and private-sector, received no allocation or a reduced amount. Several federal agencies are investigating alternative sources of helium-3 and ways to reduce the demand. The DOE did not predict the imminent shortage, and until 2008, released helium-3 without anticipation of future demand. In 2008, a large disbursement to a research facility coincided with the recognition that the stockpile could be exhausted. Officials from the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office testified about the helium-3 shortage at a congressional hearing in November 2009. The Government Accountability Office identified weaknesses in DOE's management of the helium-3 stockpile, delaying the response to the shortage. An interagency team was formed in March 2009 to examine helium-3 supply and demand. In 2009, an interagency team was formed to examine helium-3 supply and demand. A policy committee was established to investigate strategies for decreasing demand and increasing supply. The committee decided to stop allocating helium-3 for radiation portal monitors and to allocate it based on priorities for national security applications. The prioritization process for helium-3 allocation is impacting various activities, such as delaying the Radiation Portal Monitor program and causing price increases for small users like academic researchers. Federal agencies are trying to recover unused helium-3, issuing requests for information on recovery and storage. The DOE is investigating recovering helium-3 from retired tritium storage equipment and developing technological alternatives for homeland security. Congressional focus is on oversight of the current situation and potential solutions to address the limited helium-3 supply, which is currently only produced as a byproduct of tritium manufacture for nuclear weapons. The commercial supply of helium-3 comes mainly from the U.S. and Russian governments, with potential alternative sources facing technical and policy challenges. Congress has options to increase helium-3 supply, considering cost and production capacity uncertainties. The main source of helium-3 in the United States is the federal government's nuclear weapons program, where it is produced as a byproduct of maintaining tritium purity for warheads. The amount of helium-3 produced is determined by the tritium needs of the weapons program. The U.S. weapons program produced helium-3 as a byproduct of maintaining tritium purity for warheads. Helium-3 production exceeded demand until 2001, leading to a stockpile that grew despite sales. However, since 2001, demand has surpassed production, reducing the stockpile significantly by 2010. The DOE restarted tritium production in 2003 at the Watts Bar reactor in Tennessee, using a new process with Tritium-Producing Burnable Absorber Rods (TPBARs) and the Tritium Extraction Facility. The Tritium Extraction Facility at the Savannah River Site extracts tritium from irradiated TPBARs. NNSA plans to irradiate TPBARs at TVA's Sequoyah reactors in FY2012. Tritium decay generates 8,000 liters of helium-3 annually for the U.S. nuclear weapons program. Helium-3 market prices historically range from $100 to $200 per liter, potentially rising to $2,000 per liter or more. Additional helium-3 sources include increased tritium production in light-water reactors and extraction from commercial heavy-water reactors. The production of helium-3 can be achieved through various methods such as extracting it from tritium in commercial heavy-water nuclear reactors, using particle accelerators to produce tritium or helium-3, and extracting naturally occurring helium-3 from sources like natural gas or the atmosphere. The current shortage of helium-3 due to the decline in the nuclear weapons program's supply has made alternative sources more economically attractive. Increasing tritium production at reactors like the TVA's Watts Bar could significantly boost helium-3 production, potentially increasing annual production by 25,000 liters. The TVA's Watts Bar and Sequoyah reactors have site-specific licenses that limit the irradiation of TPBARs due to tritium permeation issues. Increasing the rate of TPBARs per cycle could lead to a potential annual increase in helium-3 production of 3,000 liters. However, it would take many years for the increased tritium production to result in a significant increase in helium-3 production. The nuclear weapons program subsidizes helium-3 production by manufacturing tritium. Additional helium-3 from increased tritium production may pass on extra costs. Unsubsidized tritium production costs $84,000 to $130,000 per gram, translating to $11,000 to $18,000 per liter of helium-3. Some reactors use heavy water as a moderating material. The Canada Deuterium Uranium (CANDU) design uses heavy water as a moderating material, with some reactors converting deuterium into tritium. Tritium is removed from heavy water in some cases due to radiation concerns. Foreign facilities with tritium stockpiles could potentially serve as a source of helium-3, as tritium decays into helium-3. Separating helium-3 from tritium would require specialized facilities, permits, and operational changes. Most CANDU reactors are in Canada, with other countries like Argentina, China, India, Pakistan, and Romania also having such reactors. Some countries with CANDU reactors include Argentina, China, India, Pakistan, Romania, and South Korea. Obtaining helium-3 from tritium stored in heavy-water reactors may face challenges due to international operators needing approval for transfer. Tritium stored in Ontario Power Generation could potentially produce 130,000 liters of helium-3 over ten years. The U.S. nuclear weapons program considered alternative approaches to producing tritium in the 1990s, including irradiating lithium with a linear accelerator. In 1998, the Department of Energy decided not to proceed with accelerator production of tritium, citing higher costs and less flexibility compared to production in a light-water reactor. The government's decision not to pursue accelerator production of tritium led to investments in tritium production infrastructure. Helium-3 can be produced directly in an accelerator process, but it is impractical due to high costs. Natural gas reservoirs often contain helium as an impurity, which can be extracted and sold as a commodity. Natural gas is the main source of helium, with approximately 80 billion liters extracted annually. A federal stockpile of raw helium near Amarillo, Texas was established in 1960 for national security purposes. The Helium Privatization Act of 1996 mandated the sale of most of the stockpile by 2015, but by FY2009, over 500 billion liters remained. Helium extracted from natural gas contains mostly helium-4 and a small amount of helium-3, which historically has not been separated due to perceived oversupply. The federal supply of helium-3 is perceived to be greater than the demand. Processes to extract helium-3 from natural gas are already in place during natural gas production. The cost advantage lies in the fact that helium produced from natural gas is already very cold, reducing the energy and infrastructure costs required for separation. The potential for extracting helium-3 from natural gas is promising, with existing processes in place during natural gas production. However, further investment in process engineering and development is needed for full-scale production. The Department of the Interior estimates significant reserves of helium-3 in natural helium sources, indicating a potential supply of 125,000 liters from the helium reserve and 200,000 liters from a reserve in Wyoming. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates total U.S. helium reserves and resources to be 20.6 trillion liters, with helium-3 reserves and resources estimated between 1 and 5 million liters. The energy cost for helium-3 extraction from natural gas is estimated to be around $12,000 per liter, with an incremental energy cost of $300 per liter for separating out the helium-3. The cost of separating helium-3 from natural gas is estimated to be $300 per liter, with differing estimates based on heat exchange efficiency. The cost of a helium-3 extraction plant is in the tens of millions of dollars. U.S. reserves could provide around 26,000 liters of helium-3 per year if all domestically produced helium was used for extraction. The atmosphere contains approximately 280 billion liters of helium-3, but extracting helium-3 from air is unlikely to be cost-competitive with extracting it from natural gas due to the low concentration of helium in the atmosphere. The energy cost of extracting helium-3 from air would be much higher, making it less feasible as a source. The energy cost of producing helium-3 from air is much higher than from natural gas due to the low concentration of helium in the atmosphere. Increasing helium-3 production could help address the shortage, but extracting it from air is not cost-competitive. Increasing the supply of tritium and helium-3 can be achieved by various methods, such as increasing U.S. tritium production, importing tritium and helium-3, recycling helium-3, or producing helium-3 from alternative sources. Congress has options to direct NNSA to increase tritium production, encourage private sector involvement, or reexamine past decisions on production methods. Congress could reexamine DOE's decision to reject accelerator production of tritium in the 1990s by funding research and development or new studies to address the helium-3 shortage. Increasing tritium supply would eventually lead to an increased supply of helium-3, but challenges like timeliness, capacity, cost, and nonproliferation concerns exist. Even with immediate domestic tritium production increase, the helium-3 supply wouldn't rise right away due to the time needed for irradiation and decay processes. The challenges in increasing domestic tritium production significantly impede the short-term solution of boosting helium-3 supply. Capacity limitations at existing reactors hinder the manufacture of additional tritium. Incentives may be necessary for commercial reactors to adopt the required operational changes. Despite these obstacles, the NNSA has yet to overcome these challenges. The NNSA faces technical challenges in increasing tritium production at Watts Bar and Sequoyah reactors. The capacity of the tritium extraction facility may limit production, but expansion or building a new facility could help. The cost of the existing facility was $506 million, subsidized by the weapons program. However, tritium costs beyond program needs may not be subsidized, potentially leading to higher prices. Increasing tritium production could raise nuclear nonproliferation concerns as it is a component of nuclear weapons. This could blur the line between civilian and military nuclear facilities, impacting foreign suppliers and potentially increasing nuclear warhead capacity. The U.S. government could increase the future supply of helium-3 by purchasing tritium from international sources, like foreign heavy-water reactors. However, limitations exist due to export controls and policies of some nations. Sequestering imported tritium for non-weapons use could be a solution, but extracting helium-3 from it may require additional infrastructure and increase costs. The U.S. government could potentially increase the supply of helium-3 by purchasing tritium from foreign heavy-water reactors, such as CANDU reactors in Canada and India. However, international export control agreements would regulate any tritium shipments to the United States, and diplomatic efforts may be needed to facilitate changes in restrictions. Russia is another possible source of tritium, but its history of exporting helium-3 directly makes tritium exports unlikely. Timeliness and conversion issues would also need to be considered, as imported tritium would decay gradually into helium-3, taking decades to reach its full potential level. Countries with tritium supplies could potentially have access to helium-3 from tritium decay. The United States imported Russian helium-3 between 2004 and 2008, but Russia has since suspended exports. Importing helium-3 poses similar export-control challenges as tritium, but with less burden due to no need for additional processing. The high market price of helium-3 suggests that countries capable of extracting it from tritium are likely already doing so. The absence of increased international helium-3 supply indicates limited separation capacity in most countries. Developing helium-3 separation infrastructure in countries with tritium sources could facilitate increased imports. Assistance could range from financial incentives to establishing joint ventures. Establishing an international partnership for helium-3 production may face challenges in determining equitable financing mechanisms. The current high market price of helium-3 suggests potential returns on investments if demand continues to outstrip supply. The high price of helium-3 may deter users from investing in production infrastructure, especially if the US takes actions to reduce demand. Helium-3 can be reused indefinitely due to its stability and inertness, with losses through leakage being small but costly to replace. Opportunities exist for extracting helium-3 from discarded tritium equipment, potentially providing additional supply. To increase the domestic supply of helium-3, Congress could mandate or facilitate recycling of existing helium-3. Options for policymakers include funding research on new production technologies, funding pilot projects, providing tax incentives, and guaranteeing a minimum future price or level of government purchases for alternative helium-3 sources. The demand for helium-3 has significantly increased since 2001, surpassing the available new supply. Projections indicate continued high demand for the next few years, with uncertainties due to varying estimates and measurement inconsistencies. The demand for helium-3 exceeds the available supply, leading to uncertainties in projections and measurement inconsistencies. Users may seek alternative technologies and make changes to reduce demand, impacting national security, science, medicine, and industry applications. The demand for helium-3 for security purposes includes detecting smuggled radiological and nuclear material and monitoring known special nuclear material. Various government agencies have deployed radiation detection equipment through programs like Cooperative Threat Reduction and the Radiation Portal Monitor program. These deployments have led to a significant demand for helium-3, which has been the largest drain on the helium-3 stockpile. The Department of Defense and NNSA use helium-3 in neutron detectors for monitoring special nuclear material. The United States has also provided helium-3 to the IAEA for nuclear security needs. Helium-3 is used in guidance and navigation systems, with testing underway for alternative gases. Scientific uses of helium-3 range from neutron detection to cryogenics and laser physics. Large-scale research facilities like the DOE Spallation Neutron Source utilize helium-3. The United States is a major source of helium-3 for international scientific projects, including the ITER project in France. Academic researchers may have limited ability to afford market-rate helium-3, despite federal funding for their research. Foreign scientists may rely on U.S.-supplied helium-3 for their work. The development of a polarized medical imaging technique in the late 1990s increased demand for helium-3. This technique involves patients inhaling polarized gas for MRI imaging of lung function. Helium-3 is also used in industrial applications for density measurements in oil and gas well logging and road construction. To address the helium-3 shortage, moving users to alternative technologies is suggested. The DOE national laboratories and others have explored various alternatives for neutron detection. Alternative technologies for neutron detection are being explored due to the current shortage of helium-3. Materials like boron trifluoride, boron-lined tubes, lithium-loaded glass fibers, and scintillator-coated plastic fibers show promise as replacements. Researchers are working on developing, testing, and evaluating these alternatives. A new scintillating crystal composed of cesium-lithium-yttrium-chloride (CLYC) shows promise as a replacement for helium-3 in neutron detection. Research is focused on improving sensitivity and efficiency for long-term goals, while also considering retrofitting existing equipment with alternative technologies to recycle helium-3. Future deployments may require identifying suitable alternatives to meet the potential large demand for helium-3. The DNDO plans to deploy alternative neutron detection technology in 2012 to help relieve the helium-3 shortage. The requirements for alternative neutron detectors for homeland security raise policy questions regarding performance standards. The DNDO plans to deploy alternative neutron detection technology in 2012 to address the helium-3 shortage. Policy questions arise regarding performance standards for new detectors, including whether they should match actual performance or just the specification, if reduced performance standards are acceptable for cost and toxicity considerations, and how to evaluate the performance of new systems. Considerations include whether to retrofit existing systems with new technology or use it only for new deployments, and how to balance the long-term value of recovered helium-3 against the short-term costs of retrofitting. Operational reasons for using a single type of technology are also considered. The requirements for applications outside the homeland security arena vary and may raise different policy concerns. In the scientific realm, large detector areas and rapid data rates may be paramount. Industrial applications may need to withstand vibrations and operate in constrained spaces. For medical imaging, alternative gases like xenon-129 could be used as a viable alternative to helium-3 within 5 to 10 years. The required properties of the inhaled gas are specific: polarizability, no toxicity or anesthetic effect, and a high signal-to-noise ratio for MRI. Helium-3 is not the only gas with these properties, but it has increasingly become the preferred choice. Helium-3 is the preferred choice for scientific applications like cryogenics research. Congress could promote alternative technologies through various means, such as directing federal agencies to change technology use or funding research and development projects. Increasing the use of alternatives could make them more available and desirable for the private sector. The decay of tritium produces new helium-3 each year, potentially meeting future demand. Delaying deployment schedules could help stretch out helium-3 supply. This approach could be successful for one-time events or fluctuating demands. An example is the deployment of radiation portal monitors by DHS, which is likely self-limiting. The deployment of radiation portal monitors by DHS is likely self-limiting due to the limited number of locations where they can be deployed. Adjusting deployment schedules may not fully solve the helium-3 shortage unless additional supply is found. NNSA extracts helium-3 during tritium maintenance and transfers it to the DOE for distribution to users. The Office of Isotope Production and Research disburses helium-3 to users through approved allocations by the interagency policy committee. Congress may consider criteria for prioritizing allocations and setting prices. Alternatively, a market-based system could be implemented. Helium-3 was previously provided through public auctions and interagency transfers, with increased sales post-2001 due to higher demand from companies. The demand for helium-3 increased significantly after 2001, mainly for neutron detectors used in homeland and national security. The auction price for helium-3 remained steady at less than $100 per liter. Federal agencies purchasing radiation portal monitors also acquire the helium-3 needed for operation, which is originally sold at auction by the Department of Energy. Few companies historically showed interest in purchasing helium-3 and completing the refining process. The auction sales of helium-3 were mainly to Spectra Gases Inc. and GE Reuter Stokes Inc. Spectra Gases owns the only facility licensed to remove tritium from raw helium-3 in the US. Factors influencing the low auction price included the perceived large stockpile and unclear future demand projections. The lack of stewardship responsibility within the DOE for coordinating production and sale of helium-3 was also noted by the GAO. The Office of Isotope Production and Research did not accurately forecast the increased demand for helium-3, as its production cost was subsidized by the nuclear weapons program. The focus was on selling helium-3 efficiently rather than conserving the stockpile or maximizing its long-term value. Helium-3 was sometimes transferred within DOE or to other agencies to meet specific needs. The IPC established a process for allocating helium-3 based on three priorities: applications with no alternatives, nuclear material detection programs, and programs incurring substantial costs. Since 2009, helium-3 has been allocated to federal agencies and commercial sectors using broad categories. Customers can request allocations through designated agency officials. The designated official collects helium-3 requests and submits them to the IPC for assessment. Upon IPC approval, customers can request helium-3 from the Linde Group. The Linde Group verifies the allocation with the designated official before releasing helium-3 to customers. The IPC also recommends a price for customers to pay. The price for helium-3 in 2009-2010 was based on quality, with higher prices for medical purposes. In 2011, prices vary based on quality and customer type, fluctuating annually. Policymakers may see the cost structure as favoring federal agencies, possibly as a subsidy for them. The pricing schedule for helium-3 in 2011 varies based on quality and customer type, with higher prices for nonfederal customers. The current pricing implies that the medical community is more similar to federal customers, resulting in a situation where a more purified product for medical use is sold at a lower price than a less purified product for nonfederal customers. The allocation of helium-3 is controlled according to national policy priorities by an interagency committee. The allocation of helium-3 is controlled by an interagency committee, which determines priorities, implements allocation, and sets prices. Different organizational arrangements for prioritization and implementation are possible. Establishing criteria for prioritization is crucial as users below a priority cutoff may have limited access to helium-3. Congress could establish new mechanisms for these tasks, such as setting prioritization criteria through legislation or directing agencies to do so. The IPC currently handles policy priorities and allocation, but responsibilities could be assigned to other agencies or advisory committees. The allocation of helium-3 is currently managed by an interagency committee, which determines priorities, implements allocation, and sets prices. Congress may consider formalizing the current system in statute or focusing on oversight rather than new legislation. Balancing competing priorities like science versus security and national needs versus international obligations is a challenge for any allocation system. Science and security are the primary uses for helium-3, with large scientific facilities relying on it for operation. The allocation of helium-3 is managed by an interagency committee, balancing priorities like science and security. Helium-3 is crucial for scientific research and infrastructure investments, as well as for security applications like radiation portal monitors at the U.S. border. The IPC considers contributions to national security and infrastructure needs when allocating helium-3, but some uses may have diminishing returns. Detectors are deployed at multiple border locations, but the incremental security benefit of additional detectors may decrease. Providing helium-3 to leading cryogenic scientists for research may make supplying newly established laboratories less important. Limiting helium-3 access to a smaller set of scientists could hinder research innovation. Private-sector users rely on federal government helium-3 availability, with the oil industry converting to helium-3 for neutron detection. The shortage is due to increased public sector helium-3 use for radiation detection equipment. Policymakers may prioritize private-sector helium-3 uses. The United States has domestic needs for helium-3, but is also involved in international agreements and collaborations that require helium-3 for security and scientific purposes. Policymakers may prioritize private-sector uses due to economic importance or public-sector uses for national security needs and helium-3 supply production. The United States faces a dilemma regarding the allocation of helium-3, with domestic needs conflicting with international agreements and collaborations. While some uses of helium-3 have alternative options, others, like ultra-low temperature research, do not. An allocation system may prioritize unique uses that have no alternatives to ensure their continuation. A criterion for helium-3 disbursement could prioritize unique uses without alternatives, potentially impacting applications like homeland security. Alternatively, market pricing could determine access, with higher prices incentivizing conservation and the development of new supply sources. The government may need to subsidize the purchase of helium-3 for essential applications that cannot afford it at market prices. This could clarify the economic costs of policy decisions but may increase administrative burdens. Moving to a market model for allocation could increase costs for government users obtaining helium-3 through direct transfer, but selling government-produced helium-3 at a higher price could generate more revenue. Determining the net effect of increased costs and revenue from helium-3 would require further analysis. The market price for helium-3 has been stable due to its production as a byproduct of the U.S. nuclear weapons program. Only a few commercial entities have historically sought helium-3 from the government. Policymakers should note that the federal office responsible for helium-3 sales does not produce or stockpile it, nor determine the overall need for helium-3. The public auction process for helium-3 had deficiencies as government production costs and market demand did not influence pricing. The agency managing the auctions aimed to match revenues with operating costs rather than maximizing revenue for the Treasury. Access to information about supply and demand may have been limited. The current market price for helium-3 obtained outside the federal allocation system is much higher than historical prices, reflecting its scarcity. However, there is limited private-sector involvement in developing new production technologies, possibly due to the small market size or uncertainty about future government decisions. The government could provide incentives to private producers to address the helium-3 shortage, such as subsidies, tax credits, or market guarantees. Congress could also increase supply by mandating or encouraging increased tritium manufacture and facilitating access to international sources. Seeking alternative sources through studies, R&D projects, or demonstration plants is another option. To address the helium-3 shortage, the government can provide incentives to private producers like subsidies, tax credits, or market guarantees. Other options include mandating increased tritium manufacture, facilitating access to international sources, and seeking alternative sources through studies, R&D projects, or demonstration plants. Actions to reduce demand and allocate supply can also be taken."
