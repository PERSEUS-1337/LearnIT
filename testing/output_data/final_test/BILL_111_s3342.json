    "content": "The \"Healthy Schools Partnerships Act of 2010\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. It establishes a Healthy Schools Partnerships Demonstration Program. The Healthy Schools Partnerships Demonstration Program, established under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act, defines eligible entities as school food authorities collaborating with local partners to improve nutritional standards and the school environment. The Secretary will establish a demonstration project to make grants to eligible entities for collaborations to improve nutrition education, student decision-making, and healthy school environments. An eligible entity must submit an application to the Secretary with specific details including the identified problems, the activity to be funded, how it will improve health and nutrition in schools, and the partner organizations involved. Priority will be given to eligible entities with a severe need to improve the school environment, demonstrated by high numbers of students receiving free or reduced-price lunches, high levels of obesity, or other indicators of poor health status. Community partners must show a commitment to making contributions, and the ability to measure results is essential. An eligible entity receiving a grant must use it to assess childhood obesity and poor nutrition in schools, develop innovative interventions with outside partners, and measure improvements in student health and nutrition through healthier school environments and increased nutrition education. The grant must be used to assess childhood obesity and poor nutrition in schools, develop interventions with partners, and measure improvements in student health through healthier school environments and increased nutrition education. This includes promoting access to healthier food, physical activity, and professional development opportunities for school staff. The grant aims to assess childhood obesity and poor nutrition in schools, develop interventions with partners, measure effectiveness, and assess sustainability. Authorization of $2,000,000 for fiscal years 2011 through 2015 is provided."
