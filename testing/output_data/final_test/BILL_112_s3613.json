The United States is an Arctic Nation with a 700-mile border with the Arctic Ocean, over 100,000,000 acres of land above the Arctic Circle, and a broader Arctic area including the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands. The region is home to an indigenous population reliant on marine mammals, fish, and wildlife. Temperatures have warmed significantly, and the Arctic ice pack is rapidly diminishing. The Arctic ice pack is rapidly diminishing, with the Arctic Ocean potentially becoming ice-free in 30 years. These changes are impacting indigenous communities, ecosystems, and wildlife. The opening of new areas in the US Arctic for development poses challenges. Existing federal programs lack coordination in addressing the environmental and socioeconomic impacts of a changing Arctic. The lack of research integration and synthesis in the changing Arctic hinders understanding of climate change impacts. Improved scientific understanding is crucial for developing effective climate change adaptation strategies. The purpose of the Act is to establish a permanent program for research, monitoring, and observation activities in the Arctic. The Arctic aims to promote a resilient ecosystem and human uses of natural resources through understanding ecosystem functions and monitoring vital signs. It also seeks to evaluate natural resource management effectiveness for improved performance and adaptive management. The Arctic Research Commission is established. The Arctic Research Commission is established and its duties are amended to include providing grants for research on the Arctic, including the marine environment, based on merit. The Arctic Research Commission is amended to administer grants for Arctic research and to compensate members with funds from the Commission or other agencies. The Arctic Research Commission is amended to include conflict of interest provisions for all members regarding financial interests in organizations applying for funding from the Commission. The Arctic Research Commission is amended to include conflict of interest provisions for all members regarding financial interests in organizations applying for funding from the Commission. The North Pacific Research Board is also amended to increase the percentage threshold for conflicts of interest and to adopt recusal provisions for all board members. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is amended to require disclosure of financial interests or relationships by Board members with organizations applying for funding. SEC. 4. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENT AND RESTORATION FUND. Amendment to the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1998 regarding the transfer and availability of earned amounts. Changes include making 40 percent available without further appropriations, increasing the allocation to 25 percent for certain purposes, and allocating 25 percent to the United States Arctic Research Commission for Arctic research and monitoring. The Department of the Interior Appropriations Act of 1998 is amended to allocate funds for the Alaska Ocean Observing Program and the United States Arctic Research Commission for Arctic research and monitoring. The Department of the Interior Appropriations Act of 1998 allocates funds for the Alaska Ocean Observing Program and the United States Arctic Research Commission for Arctic research and monitoring. Funds under subsection (c)(4) support the Alaska Ocean Observing System to establish long-term ocean observing systems in the North Pacific, Bering Sea, and Arctic Ocean. Programs and grants funded under subsection (c) should avoid duplication of effort. The North Pacific Research Board, Arctic Research Commission, and Alaska Ocean Observing System coordinate research activities, meet annually, and submit annual reports to Congress and the President. The term 'Arctic' is defined in the Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984."
