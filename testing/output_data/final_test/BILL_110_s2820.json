Amendment to Section 403(a)(3) of the Social Security Act for qualifying States to receive supplemental grants for fiscal years 2009 and 2010 based on tanf resources per child. The total amount required to be paid to the State under this paragraph for fiscal year 2008 is determined as 2.5 percent of the total amount required under paragraph (1) or $2,500,000, whichever is lesser. Qualifying states without a supplemental grant for fiscal year 2009 and below average tanf resources per child are eligible. In qualifying states without a supplemental grant for fiscal year 2009 and below average TANF resources per child, the amount to be paid is the lesser of 10 percent of the total required amount or $10,000,000. The amount paid to a State for fiscal year 2008 is subject to reduction based on welfare spending per poor child and the number of children under 18 in the State. The amount paid to a State for fiscal year 2008 is determined by multiplying the national average level of State welfare spending per poor child by the number of children under 18 in the State living in families below the poverty line. The qualifying criteria for a state to receive a grant under this paragraph include being entitled to a grant in fiscal year 2008 or having welfare spending per poor child below the national average level. The term 'level of welfare spending per poor child' refers to the total amount required to be paid to a State for a fiscal year, including payments under specific paragraphs. The term 'national average level of State welfare spending per poor child' is calculated based on historic State expenditures and the number of children under 18 living in poverty in the state according to the 2006 American Community Survey. The 'national average level of State welfare spending per poor child' is determined by the total amount required to be paid to the States under specific paragraphs for a fiscal year, along with an aggregate amount for all States of 80 percent. The term 'State' refers to each of the 50 States of the United States and the District of Columbia. It involves calculating the national average level of State welfare spending per poor child based on historic State expenditures and the number of children under 18 living in poverty. In the District of Columbia, funds are appropriated for grants in fiscal years 2009 and 2010, not to exceed $470,000,000 each year. If appropriations are insufficient, grants to states will be reduced proportionally. The amendments made by this section will reduce the funds appropriated in fiscal years 2009 and 2010 by a certain percentage, with an effective date of October 1, 2008."
