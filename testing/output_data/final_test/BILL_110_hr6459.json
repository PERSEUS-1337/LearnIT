    "content": "The \"Adoption Improvement Act of 2007\" may be cited as the official title of this Act. Despite the increase in adoptions from foster care since 1997, there are still 114,000 children waiting for adoption, with only 13% in preadoptive homes. Each year, 240,000 people inquire about adopting from foster care, but only a small fraction actually do so, leaving many children in need and prospective parents childless. According to a recent study by Harvard University and the Urban Institute, 78% of adults inquiring about adoption do not complete the process. Prospective adoptive parents face barriers such as difficulty accessing child welfare agencies and unpleasant experiences during initial contacts. The adoption process can be frustrating, with negative experiences having a lasting impact as frustrations are shared with others through word of mouth and the media. Child welfare agencies are defined as entities responsible for facilitating adoptions from the child welfare system. A grant program authorized by the Secretary of Health and Human Services aims to improve the adoption process by increasing access to adoption information for prospective parents. Applications for the program are required. Child welfare agencies seeking grants under this Act must submit an application with required information as specified by the Secretary. Grant recipients are selected through a process outlined in Section 6. The Secretary will award grants based on specified criteria and considerations, including the quality of the application, commitment to program goals, and geographic diversity. Criteria for eligibility include active involvement of independent marketing and research for child welfare agencies. The program funded by grants under this Act will involve independent marketing and research firms to incorporate marketing techniques in recruiting adoptive parents. Academic or nonprofit research institutions may also be involved. The child welfare agency aims to improve the first contact with prospective adoptive parents through a specialized adoption hotline and hiring employees with relevant backgrounds. The child welfare agency aims to improve the adoption process by hiring employees with counseling backgrounds and providing specialized training. They also plan to solicit feedback from prospective parents to enhance the adoption process. The child welfare agency improves the adoption process by providing clear guidelines for prospective parents, training staff, coordinating adoption sources, and explaining the adoption process to families. The child welfare agency provides clear information about the adoption process, including standard procedures like home studies and background checks, as well as the matching process and timeline for prospective parents. They also outline the rewards and challenges, adoption assistance availability, legal process, and post-permanency services for all families. The child welfare agency involves successful adoptive parents in recruitment, training, and matching processes. They establish an adoption advisory committee to improve matching procedures and develop a mentoring system for adoptive parents. The agency agrees to comply with evaluation procedures set by relevant agencies and research entities. A child welfare agency receiving a grant under this Act must use the funds to decrease adoptive parent attrition rates or enhance effective adoption practices. The Secretary will conduct research on the successes and challenges of programs established through grants, using standardized data collection tools. The research will assess the implementation of program components and their impact on adoptive parent retention, professionalization of child welfare professionals, and completed adoptions from foster care. The Secretary will conduct research on the successes and challenges of grant programs, focusing on completed adoptions from foster care and post-adoption services. Recommendations for best practices and program improvements will be made through an expert entity with expertise in adoption and child welfare issues. The expert entity conducting research on adoption from foster care will consult with researchers, child welfare administrators, national organizations, and adoptive parents. A report containing research results must be submitted to the Secretary within 2 years of fund dissemination. The research results must be submitted to the House of Representatives and Senate committees and made publicly available. SEC. 9. Nationwide review includes examining each State's progress on accessibility and responsiveness of child welfare agencies to adoptive parents. SEC. 10 authorizes $50,000,000 for this Act."
