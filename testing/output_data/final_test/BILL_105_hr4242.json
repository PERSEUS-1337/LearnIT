    "content": "The Act titled \"Combined Sewer Overflow Control and Partnership Act of 1998\" addresses issues related to combined sewer overflows. Section 402 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include requirements for permits, orders, and decrees related to combined sewer overflows. The Administrator signed the Combined Sewer Overflow Control Policy on April 11, 1994. The term of permits, orders, or decrees can be issued by the Administrator or the State, regardless of compliance schedules or permit limitations. The Administrator or State may issue a permit, order, or decree for combined sewer discharge with a compliance schedule not exceeding 15 years, extendable if justified by the owner or operator. The Administrator or State may allow a compliance schedule not exceeding 15 years for combined sewer discharge, extendable if justified by the owner or operator. Compliance can be demonstrated through progress towards a long-term plan under the Control Policy, with considerations for economic capability or appropriateness of a longer period. Any existing deadlines for treatment works construction may be affected by this provision. The construction of treatment works for controlling discharge from a municipal combined sewer system can be extended upon request of the owner or operator to align with specific requirements. Water quality standards in a long-term control plan must undergo a review process before compliance is mandated under the Act. The Administrator may provide grants to municipalities for facilities to manage combined sewer flows, ensuring compliance with water quality standards. Grants can be used for planning, design, and construction of necessary infrastructure. The Federal share of the cost for activities under the grant must be at least 55%, with the non-Federal share including public and private funds. $500 million is authorized for 1999, $750 million for 2000, and $1 billion for 2001. The Administrator must submit reports to Congress every two years starting in 2001. The Administrator must transmit a report to Congress with recommended funding levels for activities related to combined storm and sanitary sewer flows for the next two fiscal years."
