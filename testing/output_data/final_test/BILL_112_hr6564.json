The Board must have diverse scientific and technical expertise with at least ten percent representing State, local, or tribal governments. No more than ten percent can be current recipients of EPA grants. Persons with relevant expertise cannot be excluded due to affiliations with interested entities, as long as disclosed. Board members representing a single entity cannot participate in activities affecting that entity. The Administrator of the Board solicits public nominations from various federal agencies and the public, requires nominees to disclose financial relationships and professional activities, and accepts public comments on the nominees. The Board members are required to disclose financial assistance received from agencies for the past five years and their terms are limited to three years with a maximum of two terms over a ten-year period.

The Board's advisory activities must involve public participation, with reports and scientific information made public simultaneously to all. Public information-gathering sessions are required before major advisory activities, and public comments must be accepted, considered, and addressed before convening member committees or requesting scientific advice. The Administrator and the Board must accept and address public comments on questions to be asked, encouraging oral comments without time restrictions. The public has 15 days after Board meetings to provide additional comments for consideration. The Board's advisory activities should avoid making policy recommendations and clearly distinguish between scientific and policy advice. Uncertainties in scientific advice must be communicated, and dissenting views should be encouraged. Periodic reviews should ensure that the Board's activities address key scientific issues for the Environmental Protection Agency."
