    "content": "Following the 2001 terrorist attacks, the government recognized the need for new medical countermeasures against CBRN agents. The pharmaceutical industry cited the lack of a commercial market as a barrier to developing these countermeasures. In response, Congress passed the Project BioShield Act in 2004, allocating $5.6 billion for countermeasure acquisition from FY2004 to FY2013. Subsequent Congresses have reviewed the implementation of Project BioShield. The 109th Congress created BARDA and the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response in HHS through the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act. The 112th Congress is considering various Project BioShield-related policy issues, including funding diversion, countermeasure development process, stockpile replacement, and federal efforts to encourage broad-spectrum countermeasures. President Bush proposed Project BioShield to encourage the development of new CBRN countermeasures. President Bush proposed Project BioShield in 2003 to develop new CBRN countermeasures. The Project BioShield Act of 2004 was passed by the 108th Congress, with provisions for expedited spending on terrorism-related products, a government-market guarantee for purchasing countermeasures in development, and authorization for emergency use of countermeasures without FDA approval. This act eases procurement procedures for HHS in acquiring CBRN countermeasure support. The Project BioShield Act of 2004 allows expedited procurement of property or services for CBRN countermeasure research and development. It increases the maximum contract amount to $25 million and permits purchases without full and open competition. HHS used this authority for five contracts totaling $30 million between 2004 and 2005. HHS Secretary can use expedited peer review for CBRN countermeasure R&D grants under $1.5 million. Concerns exist about reduced research quality. NIAID awarded contracts and grants through expedited process. Normal peer review process takes 9 to 18 months for funding. The Project BioShield Act guarantees government purchase of CBRN countermeasures for the Strategic National Stockpile. Payments can be milestone-based, allowing for up to half of the total award before delivery. The Project BioShield Act allows HHS to purchase unapproved and unlicensed countermeasures, with milestone payments reducing the company's exposure to development risk. Critics fear the government may buy countermeasures that may never be approved, some of which lack FDA approval. The Project BioShield Act allows HHS to purchase unapproved and unlicensed countermeasures at lower cost than approved products. The act includes provisions for milestone payments and emergency use authorization by the HHS Secretary for products that can treat serious diseases. FDA and HHS approval processes aim to protect people from ineffective or dangerous treatments. The HHS Secretary can issue emergency use authorizations (EUAs) for products that treat serious diseases, with benefits outweighing risks and no adequate alternatives available. EUAs last for one year and can be renewed. Several EUAs have been issued for various countermeasures, including anthrax vaccine for DOD personnel and treatments for the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak. The only active EUA allows the distribution of antibiotic kits with doxycycline. The HHS Secretary issues emergency use authorizations (EUAs) for products treating serious diseases with no adequate alternatives. The only active EUA permits distribution of antibiotic kits with doxycycline hyclate. The Project BioShield Act of 2004 requires annual reports to Congress on the use of expedited procurement and grant procedures for unapproved products. GAO recommended HHS improve internal controls for expedited contracting procedures in response to the Act. The Project BioShield Act authorized up to $5.593 billion for procuring countermeasures from FY2004 through FY2013. $3.418 billion were available for obligation from FY2004 to FY2008, with the remaining funds becoming available in FY2009. No recommendations were made for improving Project BioShield in the second report. The Project BioShield Act authorized funds from FY2004 to FY2013 for CBRN countermeasures procurement. The 111th Congress transferred remaining funds to the HHS Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund account for Project BioShield-related purchases until FY2013. Congress has the power to adjust funding for the Project BioShield program, with funds also allocated for other purposes. $25 million was removed from the account through rescissions in 2004 and 2005. Additionally, funds have been transferred for pandemic influenza response and countermeasure development. In 2010, $609 million was transferred to HHS, with $305 million going to BARDA for countermeasure development and $304 million to NIAID for research. In FY2011, $415 million was transferred to BARDA. President Obama proposed transferring $765 million from Project BioShield funds in FY2012, with $600 million for BARDA and $65 million for administrative costs. The 112th Congress rejected a $200 million transfer request to establish an independent medical countermeasure strategic investment corporation. The first Project BioShield contract was announced on November 4, 2004, with subsequent contracts including $691 million for anthrax vaccine doses from Emergent BioSolutions, $334 million for Raxibacumab from Human Genome Sciences, and $144 million for other treatments. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has obligated funds for various treatments including ABthrax for anthrax, Anthrax Immune Globulin, smallpox vaccine, ST-246 for smallpox, botulinum antitoxin, pediatric potassium iodide, and pentetate calcium trisodium and zinc trisodium for radioactive particle contamination. HHS has obligated approximately $2.56 billion for Project BioShield procurement, targeting countermeasures against anthrax, smallpox, viral hemorrhagic fevers, and radiation. Products lacking FDA approval, such as Raxibacumab (ABthrax) and Anthrax Immune Globulin, have been acquired through Project BioShield. Congressional policymakers have scrutinized the implementation and effectiveness of the Project BioShield Act, leading to the creation of BARDA in HHS. The Project BioShield Act, funded through the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act, aims to develop countermeasures against various threats. Congressional policymakers have addressed concerns about the Act's effectiveness in transitioning research to product development, leading to amendments allowing milestone payments to incentivize progress. Congress created BARDA to manage and fund the development of CBRN countermeasures, allowing companies to receive milestone payments for product development. The Biodefense Medical Countermeasure Development Fund supports advanced development contracts, funded through transfers from the Project BioShield account. Critics argue that government funding may support unsuccessful products due to high failure rates. Critics argue that direct government funding for advanced development of countermeasures may lead to funding unusable products and insert government decision-makers into a role better suited for industry experts. Congress is addressing various policy issues related to Project BioShield, including diverting acquisition funding, changing the development process, replacing expiring countermeasures, and altering federal efforts to encourage development. Project BioShield is a program with a 10-year $5.6 billion advance appropriation to encourage the development of broad-spectrum countermeasures. Developers wanted a separate, advance-funded account for countermeasure procurement to ensure payment stability. However, the funds have been subject to annual appropriations, with over 25% rescinded or transferred by subsequent Congresses. Additional transfers proposed for FY2012 could further impact the total funding. The President proposed additional transfers for FY2012, which would increase the total amount rescinded and transferred out of the fund to 40% of the initial appropriation for Project BioShield. These transfers are divided into two categories: those related to CBRN countermeasures research and development and those unrelated to CBRN countermeasures. Congress and the President are adjusting the funds to align with HHS's ability to spend them. If no rescissions or transfers had been made, HHS would have needed to obligate $1 billion annually from FY2011 to FY2013. HHS needs to obligate $520 million annually from FY2011 to FY2013 to exhaust the fund before its expiration, below the anticipated rate by Congress but exceeding historical rates. The President's FY2012 budget requests a transfer of up to $765 million for BARDA activities. If enacted, total transfers out of the account would be $2.226 billion. If the requested transfer is made, HHS would need to obligate $400 million annually in FY2012 and FY2013 to exhaust the fund. Congress transferred $995 million from the special reserve fund to BARDA for CBRN countermeasure research and development between FY2009-FY2011. An additional $304 million was transferred to NIAID in FY2010 for biodefense research. These transfers aim to improve the rate of Project BioShield acquisitions. Annual transfers from the special reserve fund may impact future CBRN countermeasure development and procurement activities. Continued transfers from the special reserve fund for countermeasure research and development could reduce funding for countermeasure procurement, potentially affecting Project BioShield participation. Congress provided a 10-year advance appropriation to address developers' concerns about funding availability. Annual transfers may impact the roles of the federal government and private developers in countermeasure development. Continued transfers from the special reserve fund for countermeasure research and development could impact future appropriations and potentially hinder private firms' ability to sustain long-term research and development for countermeasures. Industry representatives argue that transferring funds weakens private firms' capital raising ability and their participation in Project BioShield, while advanced development funding may reduce the need for external funding sources. Funding transfers may also alter the roles of the federal government and private developers in countermeasure development. The government's use of Project BioShield transfers to directly fund countermeasure development increases its assumption of development risk. Two transfers from the special reserve fund supported non-related programs. In FY2009, $137 million was transferred for pandemic influenza preparedness, and in FY2010, an unspecified amount was transferred. In FY2010, an unspecified amount of the $304 million transferred to NIAID supported basic research on emerging infectious disease. President Obama requested authority to purchase influenza countermeasures using the Project BioShield special reserve fund, but the conferees declined. The 111th Congress considered using unobligated Project BioShield money for other purposes. The House passed the Disaster Relief and Summer Jobs Act of 2010 without rescinding Project BioShield funds. The Senate considered using these funds for settlements in lawsuits, which critics argue damages the biodefense industry. As fiscal pressure grows, unobligated Project BioShield funds may be targeted for rescission or diversion. Project BioShield is part of the federal effort to research, develop, and acquire countermeasures for civilian use. The Institute of Medicine and the National Biodefense Science Board recommended better coordination and management to increase the pace of countermeasure development. Additional recommendations include empowering a single office to align component agencies' efforts and developing a coordinated budget request for HHS and DOD agencies involved in countermeasure development. In December 2009, Secretary Sebelius ordered a review of how HHS develops and acquires countermeasures for public health threats, including CBRN agents. The review recommended new infrastructure initiatives and enhancements for medical countermeasure enterprise, some of which will require congressional action for funding or authorization. The review recommended new infrastructure initiatives for medical countermeasures, including developing a stronger scientific workforce, advancing regulatory science, and creating Centers for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing. The FDA may consider new legal authorities like a restricted or conditional license to improve preparedness for CBRN attacks. The President's FY2012 budget requests $70 million to support these efforts. The HHS plans to establish Centers for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing with funds from the Supplemental Appropriations Act, FY2009. The DOD also intends to build a similar center, despite Congress rejecting a request to transfer funds from the Project BioShield special reserve. Additionally, a private strategic investment corporation is recommended to support small companies developing technologies for public health and medical countermeasures. The HHS modeled a corporation after In-Q-Tel to serve the intelligence community's needs. President Obama requested funding transfers from the Project BioShield special reserve fund, but Congress did not grant them. The HHS recommended establishing \"Early Development Teams\" within NIAID to identify research findings with potential medical countermeasure applications. The HHS review recommended changes to the medical countermeasure enterprise management, including creating a centralized decision-making body and implementing a disciplined, metric-driven process. It also suggested the creation of a new position, the Medical Countermeasure Development Leader, to coordinate efforts. Additionally, HHS should institute a five-year budget planning system for medical countermeasure development activities, which may draw congressional interest. Congress has enacted laws and overseen the development of medical countermeasures, including Project BioShield, BARDA, and ASPR to improve management and accountability. Proposed changes to BARDA or ASPR roles may be scrutinized by policymakers to ensure successful development and acquisition of countermeasures for the national stockpile. All medicines in the Strategic National Stockpile have expiration dates, raising stockpile management issues. The GAO suggested addressing expiring countermeasures and how to replace them in 2007. In 2007, the GAO recommended establishing an inventory-sharing agreement between HHS and DOD to address expiring countermeasures. This led to a shared stockpile approach for anthrax vaccines and pandemic influenza countermeasures. However, this solution only applies to high-volume users, leaving HHS to discard and replace expired countermeasures like smallpox vaccine without compensation. HHS must also procure more doses than stored in the SNS, requiring periodic purchases to maintain stockpiles. For example, HHS bought 29 million doses of anthrax vaccine from 2006 to 2011 to keep at least 10 million doses in the stockpile. Additional periodic purchases may be necessary to ensure a consistent supply. Between 2006 and 2011, HHS purchased 29 million doses of anthrax vaccine to maintain a consistent readiness level and replenish the stockpile as countermeasures expire. Congress may need to decide whether to fund these purchases through the Project BioShield account or annual SNS appropriations. The use of SNS funds for purchasing countermeasures presents a challenge as they are not typically funded for maintenance and replacement. Experts suggest that broad-spectrum countermeasures would be valuable additions to the SNS. Broad-spectrum countermeasures, including those that address multiple CBRN agents, are seen as valuable additions to the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS). The Project BioShield Act allows for the procurement of such countermeasures, but consideration of commercial market availability is required. The HHS aims to acquire new broad-spectrum countermeasures through Project BioShield, moving away from the \"one bug, one drug\" approach. BARDA awarded its first contract for a product with multi-purpose potential in 2010. The HHS aims to acquire new broad-spectrum countermeasures through Project BioShield, with potential for biothreat preparedness and routine healthcare. Congress may consider providing further guidance or authorities for this purpose."
