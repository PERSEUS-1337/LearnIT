    "content": "Wetlands, found throughout the country with various physical characteristics, are known by different names in different regions. They have unique plant and animal communities due to the wet soil. Federal laws prior to the mid-1980s focused on providing habitat for waterfowl, but since then, wetland values have been recognized in national policies. The federal laws and national policies regarding wetland protection are not fully consistent or comprehensive. The Clean Water Act's Section 404 requires permits for some activities that impact wetlands, but not all. The swampbuster program indirectly protects wetlands by making farmers who drain them ineligible for federal farm program benefits. The federal government has various wetland protection programs, with the most significant legislation found in farm bills. The George W. Bush Administration supported wetland protection through legislation and events like Earth Day presentations. The Obama Administration made controversial changes to regulatory program jurisdiction in 2015. Congress has provided a platform for wetland protection discussions. The conflicts in wetland issues involve environmental interests advocating for greater protection, while others, including landowners and farmers, feel that protection efforts have gone too far, particularly criticizing the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Recent wetland legislative activity in Congress focused on two main issues: wetlands conservation provisions in the farm bill and proposals addressing the geographic jurisdiction of wetlands. The 2014 farm bill repealed the wetlands reserve program but introduced a new conservation easement program and reauthorized the Conservation Reserve Program with a reduced acreage enrollment cap. These programs aim to protect and restore wetlands while compensating landowners for removing land from agricultural production for soil, water quality, and wildlife habitat benefits. Legislative interest has focused on proposals addressing the geographic jurisdiction of wetlands regulations under the Clean Water Act, particularly in response to key court rulings. Recent legislation aims to halt or redirect Obama Administration rules redefining \"waters of the United States.\" Scientific questions about wetlands include defining them and tracking declines. Wetlands science has advanced in understanding wetland declines, restorations, and their importance to ecosystems. There are unresolved issues on how regulated wetlands should be treated equally and which subset should be covered by federal regulations. These questions are primarily addressed in the Clean Water Act Section 404 program. The definition of wetlands in law includes soils, plants, and hydrology. Interpretation is left to scientists and regulators, leading to controversies over sites that may not always exhibit wetland characteristics or have been modified by human activities. Wetlands subject to federal regulation are identified using technical criteria in a delineation manual issued by the Corps in 1987, providing guidance for agencies involved in wetland regulatory protection. The delineation manual issued by the Corps in 1987 guides the identification of wetlands for federal regulation. Agencies aim to enhance objectivity in wetland identification, but judgment still plays a role, leading to site-specific controversies. The value of wetlands, both ecological and economic, depends on factors like location and size. Historically, federal programs encouraged draining or altering wetlands due to perceived low value. The USDA has altered floodplain wetlands, impacting their values such as habitat for wildlife, water storage, purification, and recreation. Wetlands provide a combination of ecological and economic benefits, but altering them can lead to a decline in their overall value and have far-reaching effects on the surrounding water system. Conversion of wetlands to urban uses has increased flood damages, highlighting the importance of preserving these natural areas. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) periodically surveys national wetland acreage using the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI). Wetland acreage in the 48 states was estimated to be 110.1 million acres in 2009, showing a slight decline over the previous five years. This reflects a combination of losses and gains in wetland acreage across the country. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) has published reports on wetland status and trends in various regions and states, including Florida, Texas, Delaware, South Carolina, and Alaska. Coastal wetlands are of particular interest due to their importance in providing ecosystem services and habitat for commercially and recreationally important species. These wetlands are vulnerable to the effects of residential and commercial development, pollutant discharges, and population growth in coastal watersheds. The 2013 report by the FWS and NOAA revealed that coastal wetlands in the U.S. are disappearing at a rapid rate of over 80,000 acres per year, mainly due to severe weather in the Gulf of Mexico and urban development. The Gulf of Mexico region experienced the largest loss of 257,150 acres of coastal wetlands. The Gulf of Mexico region lost 257,150 acres of coastal wetlands due to erosion and oil/gas development, making them vulnerable to storms. EPA's national aquatic resource assessments found that 48% of wetlands are in good condition, 32% in poor condition, and 20% in fair condition. Less than half of wetland areas have healthy plant communities. The EPA reported that physical disturbances like surface hardening and vegetation loss are widespread issues in wetlands. The Bush Administration endorsed the \"no-net-loss\" goal for wetlands in 2002, aiming for an overall increase in wetland acres. President Bush announced a new goal on Earth Day 2004 to create, improve, and protect 3 million wetland acres over five years. The strategy also called for better tracking of wetlands. The Bush Administration aimed to increase wetland acres by 2005, with a goal of creating, improving, and protecting 3 million acres by Earth Day 2009. A report in April 2008 stated that over 3.6 million acres had been restored, protected, or improved, with expectations to reach 4.5 million acres by the original deadline. However, the report was criticized for not addressing wetlands lost to agriculture and development. The wetland loss patterns are not fully measured beyond raw numbers due to delays in policy changes, data collection, and difficulty in distinguishing policy effects from other factors like agricultural markets. Data only measuring acres limits insights into wetland quality, determined by location and surrounding land uses. Scientists highlight questions about wetland values and functions. Scientists caution about the qualitative and ecological integrity of existing wetlands, with uncertainties regarding the functional equivalency of replacement wetlands. Coastal wetlands play a crucial role in absorbing energy from storms, protecting shorelines, and providing habitat for species, but they are at risk from sea-level rise due to climate change. Wetlands are considered among the most vulnerable ecosystems due to limited adaptation capacity. Coastal wetlands are vulnerable to climate change, with predictions of inundation leading to irreversible conversion of marshland into unvegetated surfaces by the end of the 21st century. International scientists have modeled scenarios showing the potential disappearance of most coastal wetlands worldwide under rapid sea-level rise, while moderate and slow rise scenarios could still threaten some wetlands depending on sediment levels. Coastal wetlands are at risk of inundation due to climate change, with larger sediment amounts aiding in their adaptation. These wetlands act as a carbon sink, storing large amounts of carbon dioxide in their soils and plant biomass. However, the loss of wetland areas through inundation and erosion reduces their capacity to sequester carbon, while draining wetlands for development releases stored carbon back into the atmosphere. Coastal wetlands are crucial for storing carbon dioxide, but drainage and degradation have led to significant carbon emissions. Policymakers are now considering ways to halt carbon release from converted wetlands and restore degraded ones. There is also a discussion on quantifying the ecosystem benefits of wetlands in financial terms for potential use in climate change policy. The federal program addresses issues related to wetland protection, restoration, and mitigation, particularly under the Clean Water Act Section 404 program. Questions arise about treating all wetlands equally in federal programs, determining which wetlands should be regulated, and the effectiveness of protecting wetlands by acres. Private property concerns are also raised, as most wetlands are on private lands. Compensation for land use restrictions and decisions affecting land value is debated. The main regulatory protection for wetlands is in Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. The Clean Water Act's Section 404 provides protection for wetlands by requiring permits for activities involving disposal of dredged or fill materials into waters of the United States, including wetlands. The Corps of Engineers and EPA administer this program, with other federal agencies also playing roles. Legal decisions in the 1970s led to revisions in the program to include broad jurisdictional definitions. The Section 404 program under the Clean Water Act regulates activities involving disposal of dredged or fill materials in waters and wetlands. It has evolved since 1977, pleasing some for wetland protection but disappointing others for its broad jurisdiction. Debate surrounds whether Section 404 is the best approach for federal wetland protection, with some advocating for its replacement due to limited scope and exemptions for certain activities. The 1977 amendments to Section 404 exempt certain activities like farming, ranching, and forestry from permits. Wetland protection advocates argue that the current approach does not fully recognize the multiple values wetlands provide. The Corps evaluates over 85,000 permit requests annually, with the majority being for minor actions under general permits. The Corps evaluates over 85,000 permit requests annually, with more than 95% authorized under a general permit. These permits, including nationwide permits, allow landowners to proceed without individual permits in advance and aim to minimize regulatory burden. Nationwide permits are valid for up to five years and have an average processing time of 59 days. The Corps evaluates over 85,000 permit requests annually, with more than 95% authorized under general permits. Average processing time for other general permits is 59 days, while standard individual permits take 291 days. The nationwide permit program has few strong supporters due to complexity and lack of adequate protection for aquatic resources. Less than 5% of permits require detailed evaluation for standard individual permits. Regulatory procedures allow for interagency review and public comment. Individual permits allow for interagency review and public comment, which can cause delays and uncertainty, especially for controversial projects. EPA has veto power over Corps permits and has used it 13 times in over 40 years. Reforms have been made to streamline procedures, but concerns remain. Controversy arose in 2002 over revised regulations by EPA and the Corps regarding key terms in the 404 program. The revisions to the Section 404 program definitions aimed to clarify confusion between the EPA and Corps, but environmental groups argue that it could lead to less restrictive regulation of disposal activities, such as coal mining waste. Legislation has been introduced to reverse these changes. Wetlands delineations are based on hydrology, soil type, and plants. In wetlands delineations, three criteria - hydrology, soil type, and plants - are used to identify wetland areas. The presence of hydric soils and sufficient water determines plant growth, making vegetation a key factor in qualifying an area as a wetland. The National Wetlands Plant List was revised in 2012 to include 8,200 plant species, a 22% increase from the previous list published in 1988. The National Wetlands Plant List was updated in 2012, now containing 8,200 plant species, a 22% increase from the previous list. Some believe the updated list may lead to more areas qualifying as wetlands. Two states, Michigan and New Jersey, have assumed permitting responsibilities under Section 404, with efforts to encourage more states to do the same. States and tribes are unsure about which waters they can assume permitting responsibility for under Section 404, as regulations lack clarity. An advisory committee was formed in 2015 to provide recommendations on clarifying this issue. There is a perception that all wetlands are treated equally under the Section 404 program, but in reality, this is not the case. The Corps' general permits provide accelerated regulatory decisions for many wetland activities. Some activities are fully exempt from 404 permit requirements. Critics suggest a tiered approach for regulating wetlands. A tiered approach for regulating wetlands has been proposed, with different levels of protection based on wetland value. Questions arise about the implications of classification, defining clear boundaries between categories, and potential regional differences in treatment. Some advocates are concerned that classification could lead to reduced overall wetland protection. Advocates push for higher wetland protection levels, while critics argue for less stringent regulations. Corps and EPA highlight existing flexibility in current programs. Differential treatment of wetland types raises concerns about regulatory consistency on private property. Boundary delineation of wetlands remains a contentious issue. The controversy surrounding wetland boundary delineation is exacerbated by differing opinions on how to define and regulate wetlands. Some states, like Alaska, have a high percentage of designated wetlands but minimal conversion. Legislative proposals have been made to exempt Alaska from certain wetland regulations until a small percentage is lost. The Section 404 program, which governs wetland regulation, has faced legal challenges regarding its geographic scope and jurisdiction over isolated waters. The Supreme Court ruling in SWANCC v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers questioned the jurisdiction of Section 404 over isolated waters and wetlands. The ruling stated that denying a permit based solely on migratory bird usage exceeded the authority of the Clean Water Act. The impact of this decision on the regulatory program remains unclear even years later. The Supreme Court ruling in SWANCC v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers questioned the jurisdiction of Section 404 over isolated waters and wetlands. Environmentalists believe the Court misinterpreted congressional intent, while industry and landowner groups welcomed the ruling. The decision's impact on federal regulation depends on how broadly or narrowly it is applied, with varying interpretations by different federal courts. Attorneys for industry and developers predict that courts will continue to be the primary battleground for Clean Water Act jurisdiction questions. The 2003 legal memorandum issued by EPA and the Corps provided a narrow interpretation of the SWANCC ruling, allowing federal regulation of some isolated waters to continue. The guidance called for more review by higher levels in the agencies in such cases, demonstrating the government's commitment to \"no-net-loss\" wetlands policy. The Administration also issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comment on how to define waters under the regulatory program's jurisdiction. The government received over 133,000 comments on possible changes to CWA rules, with most being negative. Environmentalists and states opposed any rule changes, while developers wanted clarification on the SWANCC ruling. In December 2003, the Administration decided not to pursue changes to federal regulatory jurisdiction over isolated wetlands to avoid a contentious debate. Interest groups have criticized confusion in implementing the 2003 guidance, the main tool for interpreting the SWANCC decision. Environmentalists fear reduced protection, while developers seek clarity to avoid conflicting interpretations of wetland rules. The Government Accountability Office found discrepancies in how Corps districts apply federal rules, prompting efforts to promote consistency. Congressional interest has been sparked by concerns over inconsistent wetland regulation. Federal courts play a crucial role in interpreting the SWANCC decision. In February 2006, the Supreme Court heard arguments in cases seeking to narrow the scope of the CWA permit program for wetlands development. The Court's ruling in Rapanos v. United States brought clarity to federal regulatory jurisdiction. In Rapanos v. United States (547 U.S. 715 (2006)), the Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision led by Justice Scalia, held that the lower court applied an incorrect standard to determine CWA coverage of wetlands. Justice Kennedy joined the plurality to vacate the lower court decisions, but took different positions on substantive issues. The ruling's implications are unclear, leading to more case-by-case determinations and ongoing litigation. In 2008, EPA and the Corps issued guidance for CWA jurisdictional determinations in light of the decision. The 2008 guidance provided details on how agencies should evaluate the jurisdiction of certain waters under the Clean Water Act, including traditional navigable waters and adjacent wetlands. It emphasized determining a significant nexus with traditional navigable waters on a case-by-case basis. The guidance did not aim to change CWA jurisdiction and did not override previous guidance on isolated wetlands jurisdiction. Waters were considered jurisdictional if they met either the plurality or Kennedy tests in Rapanos. The 2008 guidance provided details on evaluating jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act, including traditional navigable waters and adjacent wetlands. In 2011, the Obama Administration proposed new guidance to clarify regulatory jurisdiction over U.S. waters and wetlands, adopting the Kennedy-test-or-plurality-test view of interpreting Rapanos. The agencies believed that previous guidance did not fully utilize the authority provided by the CWA. The 2011 proposed guidance on CWA jurisdiction generated controversy due to concerns of over-reaching by the agencies beyond Congress's authority. Critics also questioned the reliance on non-binding federal guidance. The draft was not finalized, and in 2013, EPA and the Corps withdrew it for revision. In 2014, a proposed rule aimed to clarify CWA jurisdiction but faced opposition for being seen as a federal overreach by property owners, land developers, and the agriculture sector. In 2015, the EPA and the Corps issued a final rule revising regulations defining the scope of waters protected under the CWA. The rule faced immediate challenges in federal courts by various stakeholders. In October 2015, a nationwide stay was issued on a revised rule defining \"waters of the United States\" due to legal challenges. The rule clarifies the regulatory status of isolated surface waters and seasonal streams, as well as nearby wetlands, following Supreme Court rulings. It aims to address jurisdictional questions under the Clean Water Act and categorizes waters that are and are not jurisdictional. The controversy surrounding the Court's rulings on CWA permits has led to concerns over the geographic scope of the act. The Corps and EPA aimed to clarify jurisdictional questions in a proposed rule, but faced criticism from industry, agriculture, and some states for being vague and potentially expanding regulatory jurisdiction beyond legal limits. Officials defended the rule but acknowledged concerns. The Corps and EPA defended the proposed rule but acknowledged the need for clarification in the final rule. The 2015 final rule made changes to provide clearer boundaries and simplify definitions for protected waters under the CWA. Legal challenges were filed by industry groups, states, and environmental groups to test the agencies' interpretation of CWA jurisdiction. Legal challenges were filed in federal courts regarding the Clean Water Act jurisdiction rule. Petitions for review were filed in both district and appellate courts, with the Sixth Circuit placing a nationwide stay on the rule in October 2015. Ongoing legal complexities include district court cases in other circuits and decisions in appeals before federal appellate courts. The Sixth Circuit's rulings and ongoing judicial review of the regulation have led the Corps and EPA to revert to making CWA jurisdictional determinations based on the 2008 guidance. Legislation has been introduced in Congress to address issues left unsettled by previous Supreme Court rulings. Environmental advocates argue that legislation is needed to reaffirm Congress's original intent with the Clean Water Act, as opposed to critics who question the constitutionality of proposed legislation that could expand federal authority. Developer groups support greater restrictions on waters and wetlands for regulatory purposes, while EPA and the Corps' efforts to develop revised guidance have been controversial. Legislative provisions to prohibit funding for activities related to the 2011 draft guidance and \"waters of the United States\" rule have faced congressional attention. Despite efforts in previous Congresses, no restrictions were enacted. Congressional interest remained strong in the 114th Congress, with hearings held on the impacts of the 2014 proposed rule. Several bills were introduced to either prohibit finalizing the rule or outline procedures for a new rulemaking. The House passed legislation requiring EPA and the Corps to take specific actions. In response to wetland loss, Congress created conservation programs in farm legislation starting in 1985, using incentives and disincentives to encourage landowners to protect and restore wetlands. The House passed legislation (H.R. 1732) for a new rulemaking to replace the 2015 rule, while a Senate committee approved related legislation (S. 1140) that ultimately failed to advance. President Obama vetoed a resolution of disapproval (S.J.Res. 22) passed by the Senate and House. The Reserve Program's wetland program uses incentives to protect wetlands, while swampbuster uses disincentives. Farmers have varying views on wetland protection, with some opposing federal regulation of private lands and others seeking certainty about their farm boundaries. Swampbuster, enacted in 1985, removes a farmer's eligibility from government support programs for activities on agricultural lands. Swampbuster removes a farmer's eligibility from government support programs for altering wetlands. Producers converting wetlands for agricultural use are ineligible for USDA benefits. The program has sparked controversy among farmers and wetland protection advocates due to enforcement concerns. Amendments in 1996 granted producers more flexibility. In 1996, amendments to the farm bill (P.L. 104-127) granted producers more flexibility with the Swampbuster program by exempting penalties for wetland restoration, providing exemptions for prior converted wetlands in agricultural use, and establishing mitigation banking. In 2014, Congress renewed the farm bill (P.L. 113-79) with limited modifications to Swampbuster, including adding crop insurance premium subsidies as ineligible benefits for non-compliance. The amendments also extended exemptions for compliance violators, allowing more time for remediation. The Wetland Reserve Program (WRP) provides federal payments to landowners for placing easements on farmed wetlands, offering long-term assistance for wetland protection and wildlife practices. Congress raised WRP enrollment limits in 2002 and 2008, with the latter introducing the Wetlands Reserve Enhancement Program to leverage federal funds for wetlands protection. The 2014 farm bill (P.L. 113-79) replaced the Wetland Reserve Program (WRP) with the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP), which includes wetlands reserve easements for wetland protection and restoration. Participants agree to restore and maintain wetlands in exchange for technical and financial assistance from USDA. Landowners are compensated based on fair market value and the length of the easement. The bill also includes the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) for additional support. The 2014 farm bill expanded the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) to include practices that enhance wetlands and incorporated the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program (WHIP) to provide assistance for wetland wildlife habitat development. The bill also requires 5% of EQIP payments to benefit wildlife habitat and includes the Conservation Stewardship Program for maintaining and improving conservation practices on agricultural lands. USDA administers conservation programs like Wetland Restoration Initiative for enrolling wetlands in CRP. Participants receive incentive payments to help with costs. Participants in conservation programs receive incentive payments equal to 25% of the cost to restore the hydrology of the site and assistance for installing conservation practices. The CWA Section 404 program applies to wetlands in all locations, exempting \"prior converted lands\" and \"normal farming activities.\" The SWANCC decision exempted isolated wetlands from Corps jurisdiction, potentially exempting 8 million acres in agricultural locations. These exemptions have eased criticism from farming interests over federal regulation of private lands. The farming industry has been critical of federal regulations on private lands, but recent exemptions have eased some of the criticism. Farm groups are concerned about potential legislation reversing court rulings that could impact their activities. Differences between the Clean Water Act and farm bill led to a memorandum of understanding in 2005. Agriculture industry groups have been vocal critics of the EPA-Army Corps \"waters of the United States\" rule. Many federal agencies, including the Fish and Wildlife Service, have been involved in wetland improvement efforts. The Partners for Fish and Wildlife program provides assistance and incentives for wetland restoration projects on private lands. The National Coastal Wetlands Conservation Grant Program helps acquire, restore, or enhance coastal wetlands through federal grants and contributions from various sources. Since 1992, $183 million in grants have been awarded to 25 coastal states and one U.S. territory for projects involving 250,000 acres of coastal wetland ecosystems. The federal government generally provides 50% of project costs, but this can increase to 75% if the state maintains a fund for acquiring coastal wetlands. Other programs, like the North American Wetlands Conservation Act, provide matching grants for wetlands conservation projects in the United States. The U.S. government has partnerships for wetlands conservation projects in North America, offering standard and small grants that require matching funds. Over 5,000 partners have received $1.3 billion in grants, contributing $2.7 billion in matching funds to impact 27.5 million acres of habitat under the Ramsar Convention. The Ramsar Convention involves 169 nations designating wetland sites of international importance, totaling 531 million acres. In the United States, 38 sites covering 4.6 million acres have been designated. Federal regulation of private property regarding wetland protection raises questions about compensation for landowners in cases of restricted use. Many argue that a taking should be recognized when a site is designated as a wetland. Congress has explored wetlands property rights issues, but recent proposals were not enacted. Wetlands in the US are regulated by federal, state, and local laws, as well as by nongovernmental organizations and private citizens. States play a crucial role in wetland protection, as highlighted in a study by the Environmental Law Institute. States play a crucial role in conserving wetlands, especially with recent uncertainty over federal jurisdiction and limited resources. They use various programs and tools like regulation, monitoring, restoration, and partnerships to protect wetlands, with programs varying between states. Many states regulate wetlands activities, often relying on CWA Section 401 for authority to review and approve federal permits. Two-thirds of states lack comprehensive wetland regulatory programs, with some also requiring state permits for activities impacting aquatic resources. Many states have authority to issue permits for dredge and fill activities in wetlands and other waters, with broader definitions than federal regulations. Groundwater is often included in state definitions of aquatic resources. Most states include groundwater in their regulatory programs, and all 50 states include wetlands in their definitions of state waters. The inclusion of wetlands does not automatically protect them; states must also have regulatory authority to issue permits. States have adopted legislation, policies, and guidelines for mitigating impacts to aquatic resources, with provisions ranging from general requirements to specific replacement ratios and mitigation options like purchasing credits from a mitigation bank. Nearly half of states have wetland-specific monitoring programs, with many also partnering with private landowners for restoration efforts. Louisiana has seen significant coastal wetland loss, with 80% of total U.S. coastal wetlands lost in the state. Louisiana's coastal changes result from natural processes. Changes to Louisiana's coastal area, as reported by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), are a result of natural environmental processes like erosion, saltwater intrusion, and sea level rise, along with human-related activities. Since 1932, coastal Louisiana has lost approximately 1,883 square miles of land, equivalent to the size of Delaware. The rate of land loss has slowed over the years, but events like hurricanes in 2005 and 2008 have increased the trend, resulting in a loss of 16.6 square miles from 1985 to 2010. If this rate continues, it would be like losing more than a football field annually. The loss of wetlands in Louisiana has led to a reduction in the natural flow of the Mississippi River, causing saltwater intrusion and destruction of vegetation. Congress authorized restoration projects under the Breaux Act, with a total cost of $1.78 billion for 147 approved projects. These projects include reintroducing freshwater, diverting sediment, constructing shoreline barriers, and planting vegetation. In a 2007 report, GAO found challenges in monitoring the success of coastal wetland restoration projects in Louisiana. Despite disagreements, ongoing project monitoring aims to provide insights into project performance. Legislative proposals post-hurricanes Katrina and Rita aimed to fund additional restoration projects in southern Louisiana. After hurricanes Katrina and Rita, Congress considered legislation to fund wetland restoration in southern Louisiana, with options ranging from $2 billion to $14 billion. The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act provides additional revenues for states adjacent to offshore oil and gas production, including for wetland restoration. Concern for Louisiana's coastal wetlands was heightened by the 2010 BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The Deepwater Horizon drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico experienced an oil spill in 2010, leading to oil reaching coastal shorelines. The impact on wetland vegetation can be acute and chronic, causing suffocation and death of plants, soil collapse, flooding, and accelerated erosion. Chronic toxicity from oil exposure hinders plant recovery, leading to further wetland loss. The oil spill from the Deepwater Horizon rig in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 had acute and chronic impacts on wetland vegetation, causing suffocation, soil collapse, flooding, and erosion. Efforts were made to protect wetlands from oil, but concerns remained about oil reaching marshes and destroying habitat for fish and wildlife. Cleanup efforts were limited to heavily oiled areas due to the potential for greater harm than good. Efforts to protect wetlands from oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 were successful in preventing large amounts of oil from reaching coastal marshes. However, oil residue remains in the environment, posing a risk of re-oiling coastal areas. Louisiana's Coast 2050 plan aims to restore coastal wetlands, while other Gulf states are just beginning similar restoration planning. Mitigation is now a key aspect of the Section 404 program, with agencies like EPA and the Corps signing a 1990 MOA to address environmental damage. A 1990 MOA signed by EPA and the Corps outlines steps for wetland mitigation: avoid impacts when possible, minimize when unavoidable, and use mitigation when impacts are still unacceptable. Mitigation may be required for a Section 404 permit, typically through a mitigation bank, in-lieu fee program, or permittee-responsible mitigation. Federal wetland policies focus on restoration, often to offset wetland loss. Implementation of mitigation has had mixed results. The 2001 NRC and GAO reports criticized the Corps' mitigation projects for not meeting the \"no net loss\" policy goal for wetlands. There is debate on the effectiveness of restoring or creating wetlands with ecological functions equivalent to natural wetlands. Some wetland protection advocates are critical of mitigation efforts. Some wetland protection advocates criticize mitigation efforts, viewing them as justifying wetland destruction. They argue that adverse impacts are not fully mitigated, and mitigation measures are not adequately monitored. The 2001 NRC and GAO reports led to new guidance from the Corps on compensating for wetland losses, but it was criticized for weakening standards. In 2008, the Corps and EPA promulgated a mitigation rule to replace the 1990 MOA with clearer requirements on compensating for wetlands lost to activities like construction, mining, and agriculture, in response to criticism and directives from Congress. The 2008 mitigation rule sets standards for three types of wetlands mitigation: mitigation banks, in-lieu programs, and permittee-responsible compensatory mitigation. It aims to improve the planning and management of projects restoring aquatic resources affected by activities disturbing half an acre or more of wetlands, ensuring no net loss of wetlands. Mitigation plans for compensation projects must include 12 fundamental components. Mitigation banks are considered the most reliable form of compensatory mitigation. The 2008 mitigation rule established standards for wetlands mitigation, including mitigation banks, in-lieu programs, and permittee-responsible compensatory mitigation. Mitigation banks are considered the most reliable form of compensatory mitigation, with a retrospective review in 2015 showing that impacts to wetlands and waters have been avoided and minimized. The use of mitigation banking and in-lieu fee programs has reduced permitting times, while projects utilizing permittee-responsible mitigation have seen increasing permit processing times. As of 2005, there were 330 active mitigation banks, with 1,521 approved and active banks and in-lieu fee programs as of September 2016. Obtaining compensatory mitigation credits for projects can be challenging, with concerns about availability and pricing. Mitigation banks are driven by economics, and their establishment depends on market demand and profit opportunities. The market for mitigation bank credits relies on demand driven by mandates for compensatory mitigation. Potential bankers face market and regulatory risks, with the price of credits determined by the sponsor. Congress has endorsed mitigation through various laws, supporting the concept of mitigation banking. The Department of Defense (DOD) authorization act (P.L. 108-136) and the Water Resources Development Act (P.L. 110-114) support payments to wetland mitigation banking programs for military construction projects impacting wetlands."
