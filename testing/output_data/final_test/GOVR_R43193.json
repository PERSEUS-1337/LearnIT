    "content": "The DHS appropriations bill includes funding for all components and functions of the department, with total funding levels for FY2013 at $46.2 billion and for FY2014 at $44.7 billion. The House-passed and Senate-reported legislation had similar funding levels. The totals represent net discretionary budget authority, including emergency spending and disaster relief. Analyses on fees and mandatory spending are included in the report. Due to sequestration, detailed comparisons with previous years' funding levels are impacted. The DHS appropriations bill for FY2013 and FY2014 totaled $46.2 billion and $44.7 billion, respectively. Post-sequestration numbers are not available, leading to uncertainty about funding levels. Reprogramming and transfers were done to address cuts from sequestration. The report contains pre-sequester funding levels for FY2013. The DHS appropriations bill for FY2013 and FY2014 totaled $46.2 billion and $44.7 billion, respectively. Post-sequestration numbers are not available, leading to uncertainty about funding levels. Reprogramming and transfers were done to address cuts from sequestration. The report contains pre-sequester funding levels for FY2013. The DHS bill lacks transparency in how resources are used, with funding by component providing more insight. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has the largest budget, with an FY2014 request of $10,833 million. Table 2 and Figure 1 break down DHS's discretionary budget authority by component. Figure 1 includes information on the disaster relief adjustment allowed under the Budget Control Act. The comparison in Figure 1 shows the new budget authority requested or provided, excluding budget authority rescinded for bill costs. DHS components like TSA and USCIS rely on fee income for funding, with USCIS receiving less than 4% of its funding through direct appropriations. The DHS budget for FY2014 is mainly funded through fee income, with 67% coming from discretionary appropriations. The rest of the budget is funded through mandatory appropriations, BCA adjustments, and other non-appropriated resources. The data presented in the graph is based on the Administration's budget request documents. Annual appropriations for DHS rose from the establishment of the department, peaking in FY2010. However, the Budget Control Act allowed disaster funding to be included in regular appropriations bills, altering the downward trend. Without disaster relief funding, the nominal level of annual appropriations declined each year until increasing in FY2014. Supplemental funding, addressing priorities like disaster assistance and border security, varies widely and distorts year-to-year comparisons.

The Administration requested $39.028 billion for DHS in FY2014. The House passed H.R. 2217 with amendments, resulting in a net discretionary appropriation of $38.991 billion for DHS. Funding for certain activities was 40% below the requested level due to offsets from management accounts. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported out H.R. 2217 with an amendment by a vote of 21-9, carrying a net discretionary appropriation of $39.1 billion for DHS for FY2014. On September 30, 2013, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) announced an emergency shutdown furlough due to the failure to enact appropriations legislation for FY2014. DHS released its \"Procedures Relating to a Federal Funding Hiatus\" on September 27, 2013. During the government shutdown in 2013, DHS furloughed over 31,000 employees while others worked without pay until funding was resolved. A short-term continuing resolution was passed to fund government operations until January 15, 2014. The Senate and House passed a bill to fund government operations until January 15, 2014, resolving the funding lapse and ending emergency furloughs for federal employees. The bill included provisions for extending expiring authorities for the department and providing flexibility for CBP and ICE. However, specific funding details were not provided in the legislation.
