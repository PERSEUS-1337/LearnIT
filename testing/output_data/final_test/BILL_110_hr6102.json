Repayment of Overpayments: Physicians can repay Medicare overpayments within 3 months without penalty or interest, and without denial of other claims. If physicians identify overpayments before being notified by carriers, they can reimburse without penalty, and the Secretary cannot audit or target them. If a physician makes a first-time Medicare billing error and has not been audited before, the carrier cannot fine them through extrapolation unless a fraudulent claim is submitted. Carriers must notify physicians of potential claim issues within one year before using extrapolation for reimbursement or penalties. Physicians can dispute carrier charges by submitting additional information and documentation. Following a post-payment audit, a carrier conducting a pre-payment screen on a physician service under Medicare cannot delay reimbursements for more than one month. Once the physician submits a corrected claim, the carrier must remove the pre-payment screen."
