The Ovarian Cancer Biomarker Research Act of 2007 establishes grants for research centers to study biomarkers for early detection of ovarian cancer. The Director of the Institute will collaborate with other relevant institutes to fund research on new and existing biomarkers for ovarian cancer. The Ovarian Cancer Biomarker Research Act of 2007 focuses on developing and validating biomarkers for early detection of ovarian cancer. This includes refining existing biomarkers, validating them clinically and in the laboratory, conducting research on biomarker utilization, and establishing repositories for biological specimens. The Director of the Institute is required to enter into cooperative agreements or make grants within a year of the enactment of this section. The Director of the Institute will provide banked serum and tissue specimens for ovarian cancer research funded by the Department of Health and Human Services. A report on cooperative agreements and grants must be submitted annually. $25,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2009-2012, with additional funding for 2013-2019. Authorization of appropriations is authorized for fiscal years 2009-2019, in addition to any other available funding for the specified purpose. The Public Health Service Act authorizes funding for ovarian cancer biomarker clinical trial committee from 2009-2019. The Director of the Institute will establish an Ovarian Cancer Biomarker Clinical Trial Committee to design and implement national clinical trials for early detection of ovarian cancer using validated biomarkers. The Committee will consist of 11 voting members appointed by the Director in consultation with medical societies and research organizations. The Ovarian Cancer Biomarker Clinical Trial Committee will have 11 voting members appointed by the Director of the Institute in consultation with medical societies, research organizations, and patient advocate groups. Voting members include patient advocates, experts in statistical analysis and clinical trial design, representatives from the Gynecologic Oncology Group and Department of Defense Ovarian Cancer Research Program, and ovarian cancer researchers. Nonvoting members will also be part of the Committee. The Committee members, including nonvoting members selected by the Director of the Institute, serve without pay but receive travel expenses. The voting members appoint a chairperson and meetings are scheduled by the chairperson or the Director of the Institute. The Director of the Institute shall ensure that all academic centers, community cancer centers, and individual physician investigators have the opportunity to participate in clinical trials for ovarian cancer. The Institute will reimburse all costs for enrolling women in these trials. A national data center will be established by the Institute to analyze data from clinical trials for ovarian cancer and provide guidelines for the medical community on biomarker use. Individual physician investigators can participate in these trials with costs reimbursed by the Institute. Individual physician investigators, defined as physicians providing healthcare to women at risk for ovarian cancer, can participate in clinical trials with costs covered by the Institute. The Director of the Institute must submit an annual report to Congress on activities conducted under this section. $5,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2009-2012, with additional funding for 2013-2019."
