The Act defines key terms such as \"compact\" as a binding agreement with the United States, \"economic development strategy\" as a plan for sustainable growth and poverty reduction, and \"eligible entity\" as a consortium of regional Alaska Native nonprofit organizations. The Secretary, in consultation with relevant parties, will determine organizations to receive priority for funding based on poverty levels in specific regions. In Hawaii, a consortia of Native Hawaiian community organizations will be selected. In the 48 contiguous States, up to 3 organizations, which may include Indian tribes or nongovernmental entities authorized by tribes, will be chosen by the Secretary in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior. The term \"Indian tribe\" is defined in the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Commerce. SEC. 4. MILLENNIUM CHALLENGE DEMONSTRATION PROJECT. The Secretary will establish the \"Native American Millennium Challenge Demonstration Project\" in the Department of Commerce. Assistance may be provided to eligible entities through funding agreements, not loans, and cannot be used for gaming activities. The Native American Millennium Challenge Demonstration Project will coordinate assistance with other Federal economic development programs for Native Americans, involving various departments such as Agriculture, Commerce, Energy, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, and Small Business Administration. The Native American Millennium Challenge Demonstration Project allows the Secretary to involve other Federal agencies in coordinating economic development assistance programs for eligible entities. These programs can integrate various federally funded economic development assistance programs into a single, coordinated program, including those available to Indian tribes. Upon execution of a compact, the eligible entity is authorized to coordinate these programs. The Secretary consults with the eligible entity and relevant Federal agencies to identify any necessary waivers of statutory requirements or regulations to implement the compact. SEC. 5. CHALLENGE COMPACTS. The Secretary will develop procedures for compacts and applications submitted by eligible entities, providing assistance only to those who enter into a compact with the United States. Criteria for selecting eligible entities will be based on the purposes of the Act. The Secretary may provide assistance to eligible entities based on factors such as the economic development strategy, remoteness of the reservation, economic status, poverty rates, and service capacity. Funds can be used for developing compacts between the United States and the eligible entity, with an initial compact lasting up to 5 years. Each compact between an eligible entity and the United States can be extended for up to 10 years if approaching expiration. Compacts must outline specific objectives for sustainable economic development and roles of each party. The compact outlines roles, responsibilities, benchmarks, beneficiaries, and financial plan for sustainable development. Suspension and termination of assistance are also addressed. The Secretary may suspend or terminate assistance for an eligible entity that fails to meet responsibilities or engages in inconsistent actions under the compact. Assistance may be reinstated if the entity corrects the conditions for suspension or termination. SEC. 6. PROGRAM ASSESSMENTS AND REPORTS. Each eligible entity must submit an annual report to the Secretary detailing the assistance received under this Act, including obligations, expenditures, programs, activities, effectiveness of assistance, and progress towards economic development goals. The eligible entity must submit an annual report to the Secretary, including relevant information, by May 15, 2008, and annually thereafter. The Secretary will then submit these reports to specific committees in Congress. SEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. $20,000,000 authorized annually for fiscal years 2008-2012. Unused funds can be carried over. Not more than 5% for administrative expenses."
