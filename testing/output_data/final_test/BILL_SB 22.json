    "title": "SB 22",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. The Legislature declares that over $40 million in funding for training primary care physicians in California will expire in 2016. Without replacement funding, 158 training slots for family medicine will be lost, exacerbating the shortage of primary care physicians in underserved communities. California currently has only 36% of active physicians practicing primary care, with 23 counties below the required physician to population ratio. By 2030, an estimated 8,243 additional primary care physicians are needed to prevent shortages, equating to about 412 new physicians per year. The Song-Brown program in California supports an increase in primary care providers for underserved populations. Over 32% of primary care physicians in California are 60 years or older. States with more primary care physicians have better health outcomes. Each primary care resident in Song-Brown provides an average of 600 additional patient visits per year during training. California leads in retaining physicians who train in the state. $300 million is appropriated for new and existing physician residency positions and training faculty under the Song-Brown Health Care Workforce Training Act. $100 million will be spent in the 2016-17 fiscal year. Article 7 is added to the Health and Safety Code, establishing the California Medical Residency Training Program. Definitions for terms like \"Director\" and \"Fund\" are provided. $100 million will be spent in the 2017-18 and 2018-19 fiscal years. The Medical Residency Training Advisory Panel consists of 13 members appointed by various entities. Primary care includes family medicine, general surgery, internal medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, psychiatry, and related specialties. The Medical Residency Training Advisory Panel members are appointed by various entities and include representatives from public hospitals, private hospitals, community clinics, health insurance providers, the pharmaceutical industry, and health care practitioner associations. All appointees must have an interest in increasing medical residencies and access to healthcare in underserved areas of California. The Governor appoints the president of the Medical Residency Training Advisory Panel from members appointed by various entities. Panel members serve different term lengths based on the appointing entity. The Medical Residency Training Advisory Panel members serve four-year terms without compensation but are reimbursed for necessary expenses. Members are appointed by various entities including the Governor, the Speaker of the Assembly, the Senate Committee on Rules, the Medical Board of California, and the Osteopathic Medical Board of California. The Medical Residency Training Advisory Panel members serve without compensation but are reimbursed for expenses. They can solicit funds for new residency positions in specific areas of the state. The panel is subject to the Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation Law. The Medical Residency Training Advisory Panel can encourage institutions to provide locations for new residency positions in specific areas of the state. They can recommend the establishment of new residency positions based on sufficient funds and medical service areas. The Medical Residency Training Advisory Panel can recommend the establishment of new residency positions in service areas designated as primary care shortage areas, health professional shortage areas, or medically underserved areas/populations. Upon approval, necessary funds are deposited into the fund, with a portion potentially coming from the private sector for administrative requirements. The foundation must submit an annual report to the Legislature detailing fundraising activities, expenditures, and residency position recommendations. It also provides support to the panel and approves recommendations fulfilling specified requirements. The office is responsible for implementing approved recommendations. The office is tasked with establishing a process for soliciting residency proposals from various institutions, requiring detailed information such as location, medical practice area, need for primary care practitioners, and funding requirements. The office is responsible for soliciting residency proposals from institutions, including funding requirements, location, and approval by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. Information on deficient primary care areas, Medi-Cal enrollees, and other relevant data must be provided to the panel and foundation for consideration. The Medical Residency Training Fund is created to allocate funding for new residency positions statewide. An annual report must be submitted to document fund contributions, expenditures, purposes, and recommendations for future positions. The fund also covers administration costs and other authorized purposes. The office and foundation can raise funds through public and private donations for the Medical Residency Training Fund. Money in the fund is continuously appropriated for the fund's purposes. Any regulations adopted to implement this article will be considered emergency regulations. The office may exempt documents related to anonymous donations from public disclosure. The Governor can propose a budget amount for the office's use, and if the Legislature appropriates money, it will be held by the office for distribution to the fund. Funds appropriated to the office shall be paid into the fund to match the amount deposited by the panel or foundation for the purposes of this article. Any unspent money at the end of the fiscal year will be returned to the General Fund. The Legislature acknowledges the need to protect individual privacy regarding donations for funding new medical residency positions in underserved areas, outweighing the public interest in disclosure."
