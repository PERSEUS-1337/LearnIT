A motion to reconsider the vote is not allowed. In the Senate, consideration of a joint resolution is limited to 10 hours, divided equally between majority and minority leaders. In the Senate, a motion to limit debate is in order and not debatable. Amendments, postponements, consideration of other business, or recommittal of the joint resolution are not allowed.

The Chair's decisions on Senate rules for joint resolution procedures are final without debate. Joint resolutions cannot be amended in either the House of Representatives or the Senate. If one House receives a joint resolution from the other, it is not referred to a committee, and the receiving House's procedure remains unchanged. Congress may not consider a joint resolution under this subsection after 7 calendar days from May 15, 2013. This subsection is enacted by Congress as part of the rules of each House, applicable only to the procedure for a joint resolution, superseding other rules if inconsistent. The rules allow either House to change procedures at any time. If Congress passes a joint resolution, the days between presentation to the President and his action are excluded from the calendar day period. The rules for veto override in the House and Senate are outlined, with debate time limited to 1 hour. If a joint resolution is enacted, the President cannot cancel budgetary resources, and sequestration continues as per the Balanced Budget Act. If disapproval is not enacted within a specified period, sequestration remains in effect. If the President submits a qualifying sequester replacement plan and a joint resolution of disapproval is not enacted, the President must cancel any sequestration order and budgetary resources as outlined in the plan."
