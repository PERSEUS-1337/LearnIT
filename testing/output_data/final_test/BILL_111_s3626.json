    "content": "The \"Thermal Renewable Energy and Efficiency Act of 2010\" includes sections on short title, findings, purpose, statement of policy, modification of credit for electricity from renewable sources, exempt facility bonds, and energy sustainability grants for institutions. Congress finds that approximately 30 percent of energy consumed in the US is used for heating and cooling buildings, district energy systems provide sustainable thermal energy infrastructure from various sources like biomass and solar energy. District energy systems in the United States, including biomass, geothermal, and solar energy sources, offer advantages such as local fuel use, stable energy costs, reduced reliance on fossil fuels, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and flexibility in fuel sources. These systems help cut peak power demand and support secure, affordable, renewable, and sustainable energy. District energy systems in the United States help cut peak power demand and reduce power transmission constraints by delivering chilled water for air conditioning and generating power near load centers. Combined heat and power systems increase energy efficiency by capturing thermal energy, doubling the efficiency of conventional power plants. According to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, increasing combined heat and power in the United States would be beneficial. The United States aims to increase combined heat and power to 20% of total electric generation capacity by 2030, which would save energy, create jobs, reduce carbon emissions, and save oil. Constraints to expansion include the lack of economic value in the energy marketplace for environmental benefits. The marketplace for district energy systems faces challenges such as high project development costs and expensive debt service, especially in the early stages before a customer base is established. The purpose of this Act is to encourage the implementation of thermal energy infrastructure in order to increase energy efficiency, use renewable energy resources, revitalize infrastructure, reduce air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, ozone-depleting refrigerants, and enhance power grid reliability and energy security. The United States energy policy emphasizes considering thermal energy's significant role in meeting energy requirements through renewable sources, district energy systems, and energy efficiency incentives. The United States energy policy focuses on thermal energy's role in meeting energy needs through renewable sources, district energy systems, and energy efficiency incentives. This includes energy security benefits such as reducing peak power demand, alleviating system constraints, and adapting fuel sources to changing availabilities and prices. Extension of renewable electricity credit to thermal energy under Title I. Extension of renewable electricity credit to thermal energy under Title I. The amendment adds a new subsection to Section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, providing a credit for the production of thermal energy from qualified energy resources at qualified facilities. The substitution of thermal energy for electricity in the application of the credit is outlined. The term 'thermal energy' in this section refers to heat or cooling. A combined heat and power facility must meet specific requirements to be considered a qualified facility. The Thermal Renewable Energy and Efficiency Act of 2010 sets criteria for thermal facilities to be considered qualified facilities, including a minimum energy efficiency percentage of 60% and being placed in service within a specific timeframe. The Thermal Renewable Energy and Efficiency Act of 2010 establishes criteria for thermal facilities to qualify, including a minimum energy efficiency percentage of 60% and timely service initiation. An election under this subsection prohibits double benefits for electricity production at the facility. Cold water sources are treated as a qualified energy resource under the Internal Revenue Code. The Thermal Renewable Energy and Efficiency Act of 2010 sets criteria for thermal facilities to qualify, including a 60% energy efficiency requirement. Cold water sources used for air conditioning are considered a qualified energy resource under the Internal Revenue Code. The Act also amends Section 45(d) to include facilities providing thermal energy for air conditioning from natural cold water sources as qualified facilities. The Thermal Renewable Energy and Efficiency Act of 2010 amends the Internal Revenue Code to include thermal energy as a qualified resource, alongside electricity. Various sections of the Code are updated to reflect this change, expanding the definition of qualified facilities to include those providing thermal energy for air conditioning from natural cold water sources. The Thermal Renewable Energy and Efficiency Act of 2010 amends the Internal Revenue Code to include thermal energy as a qualified resource, alongside electricity. Section 45 of the Code is updated to include thermal energy for air conditioning from natural cold water sources. The amendments apply to energy produced and sold after the enactment of the Act. TITLE II--EXEMPT FACILITY BONDS\n\nSEC. 201. EXEMPT FACILITY BONDS.\n\n    Amends the definition of local district heating and cooling facilities in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to include equipment for producing thermal energy. Regulations will establish that these facilities serve a general public use.\n\nTITLE III--ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY AND EFFICIENCY GRANTS FOR INSTITUTIONS\n\nSEC. 301. DEFINITION OF INSTITUTIONAL ENTITY. SEC. 301 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act is amended to include \"not-for-profit district energy system\" as an institutional entity. SEC. 302 addresses the availability of grants. SEC. 302 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act is amended to increase grant amounts significantly. Subparagraphs are adjusted to raise funding limits from $50,000 to $90,000, $90,000 to $150,000, and $250,000 to $600,000. Additionally, the authorization of appropriations for grants is increased from $1,000,000 to $20,000,000, and the percentage of funding is reduced from 60 percent to 30 percent. SEC. 303 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act authorizes an increase in appropriations for grants from $250,000,000 to $500,000,000 for fiscal years 2011 through 2015."
