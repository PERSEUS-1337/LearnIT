    "content": "The Act is titled the \"High Plains Groundwater Resource Conservation Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purposes section. The High Plains Aquifer, mainly the Ogallala Aquifer, has seen a significant decline in water levels, especially in the Southern Ogallala Aquifer. Some areas have experienced declines of over 100 feet from 1950 to 2007, with a saturated thickness reduction of over 50 percent in certain areas. The saturated thickness of the High Plains Aquifer declined from 54% to 51% between 1980 and 2007. Decreased water levels raise concerns about the sustainability of irrigated agriculture. Groundwater modeling shows that reducing pumping has a limited impact on conserving the water table, creating a disincentive for water conservation measures. Incentives are needed for conservation efforts. The purpose of this Act is to promote groundwater conservation on the High Plains to extend the useable life of the High Plains Aquifer. Incentives are necessary for conservation efforts, and reliable information on aquifer recharge rates and water table levels is essential for policymakers and groundwater users. SEC. 1240S. HIGH PLAINS AQUIFER GROUNDWATER CONSERVATION INCENTIVES PROGRAM is added to the Food Security Act of 1985 to promote groundwater conservation on the High Plains and provide incentives for conservation efforts. Reliable information on aquifer recharge rates and water table levels is crucial for policymakers and groundwater users. The High Plains Aquifer Conservation Program defines key terms related to the aquifer, including High Plains, High Plains Aquifer, High Plains Aquifer States, and Program. The Secretary will offer contracts to producers in High Plains Aquifer States through a Groundwater Conservation Incentives Program to achieve per-acre savings of groundwater. Producers drawing water from the aquifer region will have the opportunity to participate, with priority given to areas experiencing significant aquifer level declines. Producers in High Plains Aquifer States who agree to transfer water rights for nonirrigated land will be eligible for incentive payments. The Secretary will make payments to producers who agree not to irrigate land, based on the difference in payment amounts determined by the Secretary. Producers in High Plains Aquifer States can receive incentive payments for transferring water rights to nonirrigated land. Payments are based on the difference in payments received for irrigated land and expected payments for dryland production over the past 10 crop years. Producers can choose to receive a lump-sum payment for the agreement term. The Secretary can modify or terminate a contract with a producer if the producer agrees or if it is in the public interest. Involuntary termination can occur if the producer violates the contract. The producer violated the contract by not transferring water rights, implementing required practices, or complying with additional conditions. Payments to a producer under this section are limited to $50,000. High Plains Aquifer States can apply for funding to carry out activities described in this section. Funding comes from the Commodity Credit Corporation. The Secretary shall use necessary funds from the Commodity Credit Corporation to carry out activities described in this section."
