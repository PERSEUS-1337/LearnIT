    "content": "The people of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges the high exposure of beauty care workers to harmful chemicals in cosmetics, especially affecting women and minorities. Nail services are increasingly popular, with consumer spending in nail salons on the rise. Chemicals in cosmetics can harm salon customers, including young girls and women. Endocrine-disrupting chemicals can enter the body through the skin, with DBP in nail polish being particularly harmful to pregnant women. Developmental toxicants like toluene and formaldehyde found in nail polish can harm children's growth and health. Some cosmetic manufacturers have removed harmful substances from their products to prevent cancer and reproductive harm. Local governments, including San Francisco, Alameda, San Mateo, Santa Clara, and Santa Monica, have successful Healthy Nail Salon Recognition Programs promoting safer practices. California aims to provide guidelines for nail salons to operate safely for workers and consumers by January 1, 2018. The guidelines for an HNSR program may include a list of chemical ingredients to avoid, consideration of candidate chemicals, restrictions from existing programs, exposure potential, and safer alternatives. Additionally, best practices for minimizing exposure include using specific personal protective equipment. The guidelines for an HNSR program include engineering controls for ventilation, restrictions on certain chemicals in nail products, training topics for salon staff, criteria for outside products, compliance verification, and additional best practices determined by the department. The guidelines for an HNSR program include criteria for cities and counties, coordination with other programs, training requirements for salon staff, issuance of certificates, enrollment process, and compliance verification frequency. The department will consult with relevant agencies and promote HNSR guidelines by developing consumer education programs, presenting guidelines to local health officers, and providing information for successful implementation of HNSR programs."
