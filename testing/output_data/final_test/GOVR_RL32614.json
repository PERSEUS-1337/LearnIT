    "content": "The routine activities of federal agencies are funded by annual appropriations from regular acts. If there is a delay, Congress may use continuing appropriations acts as stop-gap funding. Failure to enact timely appropriations results in a funding gap, leading to a shutdown of affected projects and furlough of non-excepted personnel. Continuing appropriations acts, also known as continuing resolutions (CRs), provide funding in the form of a joint resolution or bill. Continuing resolutions are used as stop-gap funding when there is a delay in enacting regular appropriations acts. They can be designated by order or as further resolutions. The duration of a continuing resolution ends upon the enactment of a regular appropriations act or on a specified expiration date. The duration may vary for different agencies as their regular appropriations acts are enacted. The first continuing resolution for FY2004, set at 31 days, allows funds to be available until the enactment of an appropriation or October 31, 2003. Continuing resolutions can have different expiration dates for agencies or programs. Continuing resolutions extend funding deadlines by replacing expiration dates. They can be interim (temporary) or full-year measures, providing funding until September 30. Congress uses interim resolutions to buy time for completing actions. Congress can extend funding deadlines through continuing resolutions, which can be temporary or full-year measures. These resolutions provide additional time for completing actions on remaining regular appropriations acts, with durations varying from a single day to weeks. They are used to keep pressure on legislators, accommodate negotiations or recesses, and postpone difficult decisions. Continuing resolutions typically fund activities at a restricted level under a formula-type approach. Continuing resolutions fund activities at a restricted level, with a rate not exceeding the prior fiscal year's total appropriations. Exceptions, known as \"anomalies,\" may provide specific budget authority for certain accounts. Funding for activities can be adjusted when the regular appropriations act is enacted. Congress has flexibility in determining funding levels, with variations in practice over the years. Continuing resolutions do not allow new activities to be initiated, only funding for past year activities. During the past year, program activity limitations are retained by resolution language. Congressional action on appropriations acts has varied over the past 50 years, with tardy enactment being a recurring issue. From FY1977 to FY2012, regular appropriations acts were enacted on time only four times. Continuing resolutions were used to fund certain unauthorized programs during this period. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-344; 88 Stat. 297) extended the time for Congress to pass annual appropriations by moving the fiscal year start from July 1 to October 1. This change led to all regular appropriations acts for FY1977 being passed on time. However, reliance on continuing resolutions persisted in subsequent years. Continuing resolutions have been necessary in most fiscal years since FY1977, with only a few exceptions. A total of 161 continuing resolutions were enacted between FY1977 and FY2012, averaging about six per fiscal year. Full-year continuing resolutions provide funding for regular appropriations acts for the remainder of the fiscal year. Full-year continuing resolutions were used occasionally prior to the full implementation of the Budget Act in FY1977. Congress returned to the use of full-year continuing resolutions for more than a decade after successfully completing action on the regular appropriations acts for FY1977. For each of the 11 fiscal years following FY1977, covering FY1978-FY1988, Congress enacted a full-year continuing resolution. In the 11 fiscal years following FY1977, Congress enacted full-year continuing resolutions covering FY1978-FY1988, FY1992, and FY2011. These resolutions may provide appropriations through formulaic provisions, incorporating the full text of regular appropriations acts, or a combination of both. In the 11 fiscal years following FY1977, Congress enacted full-year continuing resolutions covering FY1978-FY1988, FY1992, and FY2011. These resolutions may provide appropriations through formulaic provisions, incorporating the full text of regular appropriations acts, or a combination of both. Table 1 identifies the 14 full-year continuing resolutions enacted since FY1977, with some including formulaic funding provisions and others not. The resolutions were enacted at various times throughout the fiscal year, with nine out of 14 being enacted in the first quarter. The full-year continuing resolutions enacted from FY1983-FY1988 were much lengthier, ranging from 19 to 451 pages, compared to earlier years. Congress abandoned formulaic references for funding levels and instead included the full text of regular appropriations acts in these resolutions. During FY1983-FY1988, full-year continuing resolutions included the full text of regular appropriations acts, increasing in length and covering 5 to 13 acts on average. P.L. 112-10 for FY2011 followed a similar funding approach. During FY1983-FY1988, full-year continuing resolutions included the full text of regular appropriations acts, increasing in length and covering 5 to 13 acts on average. P.L. 112-10 for FY2011 followed a similar funding approach by incorporating the full text of one appropriations bill (the FY2011 Department of Defense Appropriations Act) while also providing for the other 11 regular appropriations bills through formulaic provisions and specific anomalies. Continuing resolutions have been a significant element of the annual appropriations process during the last 15 fiscal years, covering FY1998-FY2012. A total of 92 continuing resolutions were enacted into law during this period, with an average of over four months (126.6 days) of funding provided each fiscal year. During FY1998-FY2012, 92 continuing resolutions were enacted, lasting an average of 28.8 days each. The expiration dates varied, with some set in the first quarter of the fiscal year and others in the following session. During FY1998-FY2012, 92 continuing resolutions were enacted, with varying expiration dates. The final continuing resolutions for FY2007 and FY2011 provided funding for the entire fiscal year. Figure 1 illustrates the number and duration of continuing resolutions, showing no significant correlation between the two variables. The largest number of continuing resolutions enacted for a single fiscal year was 21 for FY2001, lasting 82 days on average. The smallest number enacted was two each for FY2009 and FY2010, covering 162 days and 79 days, respectively. During FY1998-FY2012, 92 continuing resolutions were enacted, with varying expiration dates. The largest number of continuing resolutions for a single fiscal year was 21 for FY2001, lasting 82 days on average. For example, the first 25 days of FY2001 were covered by a series of shorter-term continuing resolutions, leading up to the national elections on November 7, 2000. During FY1998-FY2012, 92 continuing resolutions were enacted, with varying expiration dates. The second continuing resolution was enacted into law on November 15 and expired on December 5, covering the remainder of the lame-duck session. The remaining five continuing resolutions ranged from one to six days in duration, extending beyond the session as final appropriations legislation was processed for the President's approval."
