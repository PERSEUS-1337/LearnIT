    "content": "Medicaid is a joint federal-state program with varying eligibility and services across states. The complexity of Medicaid poses challenges for Hurricane Katrina victims, especially when evacuees move between states. While federal rules offer flexibility for states to act independently, certain issues may require federal intervention. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has developed voluntary measures to address these challenges. On the administrative front, CMS has created a voluntary Medicaid waiver option to address hurricane-related eligibility and benefit issues. Congressional action may be needed for enhanced federal reimbursement to states for Medicaid costs from Hurricane Katrina. Several bills for Medicaid and SCHIP relief for hurricane victims have been introduced. The report discusses Medicaid rules, current issues, and recent actions taken. The curr_chunk discusses Medicaid coverage requirements, including categorical and financial eligibility criteria. Categories of individuals eligible for Medicaid include aged persons, individuals with disabilities, children, parents, and pregnant women. States also set functional requirements for Medicaid-covered long-term care services. Financial requirements determine income and asset limits for Medicaid eligibility. The specific income and asset limitations for Medicaid eligibility vary among states and different groups. Section 1115 waivers provide exceptions to eligibility rules for states with approved waivers. The eligibility rules for Medicaid vary among states with approved waivers. Evacuees may face difficulties accessing healthcare services without proper identification. Residency rules help determine which state's Medicaid program to apply to. Residents of a state are considered eligible for Medicaid if they intend to live there permanently. Coverage cannot be denied based on residency duration or temporary absence. Home states may pay for covered services for displaced Medicaid recipients in other states. Displaced individuals may need to find out-of-state providers willing to accept Medicaid payment and meet residency requirements to access care. Medicaid coverage can be obtained in the state they have evacuated to if they meet residency criteria and are eligible. Medicaid coverage can be obtained in the state where displaced individuals have evacuated to if they meet residency criteria and are otherwise eligible. State policies vary on documentation requirements for income and assets to determine Medicaid eligibility. States have flexibility to collect information through self-declaration or require supporting documentation, but must have an Income and Eligibility Verification System (IEVS). State Medicaid agencies use IEVS to verify income and assets for Medicaid recipients, including information from federal and state sources like SWICA and SSA. Look-back period rules for financial eligibility in Medicaid are not clearly defined by federal laws, leaving states with flexibility in determining eligibility. Medicaid eligibility is determined by income and assets falling below certain thresholds, with states having flexibility in methods used. Budget periods for certain groups like the medically needy can be no longer than six months, with states able to shorten accounting periods. Financial and categorical restrictions limit eligibility for Medicaid. Medicaid eligibility is determined by income and assets falling below certain thresholds, with states having flexibility in methods used. Categories of individuals include the elderly, people with disabilities, dependent children, parents of dependent children, and pregnant women. States can waive categorical eligibility requirements through Section 1115 Medicaid waivers. Basic benefit rules require states to provide mandatory services like hospital services for most Medicaid recipients. Medicaid covers a range of services including hospital, FQHC, lab, X-ray, physician, nurse practitioner, pregnancy-related, EPSDT for children, nursing facility care, and home health care. Optional benefits like eyeglasses and prosthetic devices are available if states choose to include them in their Medicaid plans. Other optional benefits include services from specific medical providers like psychologists and nursing facility care for individuals under 21. Medicaid covers a wide range of services including hospital, FQHC, lab, X-ray, physician, nurse practitioner, pregnancy-related, nursing facility care for individuals under 21, and home health care. Special benefits are specified for targeted groups, such as EPSDT for children under 21, guaranteeing access to necessary services. States must provide otherwise optional services to Medicaid children, like eyeglasses, even if not listed in the state plan. Medicaid covers a wide range of services including hospital, FQHC, lab, X-ray, physician, nurse practitioner, pregnancy-related, nursing facility care for individuals under 21, and home health care. Children can receive eyeglasses through Medicaid, while adults may have limited access to this benefit. Medicaid is also crucial for long-term care services, which can be provided in nursing facilities or through home and community-based care. States can request federal permission for additional services. States can request federal permission for additional home and community-based services through a Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) waiver, authorized under Section 1915(c) of the Social Security Act. These waivers allow states to offer a range of services on a less-than-statewide basis, including case management, homemaker services, personal care, adult day health, and home-delivered meals. Variation in Benefit Coverage Across States for Medicaid programs is due to each state designing and administering its own program. Optional services like hospice care, ICF/MR, prescribed drugs, prosthetic devices, and transportation are covered in all states affected by Hurricane Katrina. However, services like physical therapy, emergency hospital services in non-certified hospitals, care for the elderly in institutions for mental disease, eyeglasses, and basic dental care are not covered by all states. States also define specific parameters for mandatory and optional services under their Medicaid plans. In the context of Medicaid programs, there are variations in benefit coverage across states due to each state administering its own program. Optional services like hospice care, prescribed drugs, and transportation are covered in states affected by Hurricane Katrina. However, there are interstate variations in the amount, duration, and scope of mental health services provided, even for mandatory benefits. Questions have been raised about which state's benefit package will apply to individuals displaced from their home state after Hurricane Katrina. The Medicaid program coverage for individuals displaced from their home state due to events like Hurricane Katrina is uncertain. While the home state may be obligated to pay for covered services provided out-of-state, finding a provider willing to accept the home state's Medicaid coverage can be challenging. Residency questions also arise for displaced Medicaid recipients. For displaced individuals on Medicaid, residency questions arise if they do not plan to return to their home state. Access to long-term care services, including nursing homes and home care, is crucial for those with significant physical or mental impairments. Medicaid covers these services for eligible individuals who require 24-hour supervision and assistance with daily activities. Access to care is crucial for displaced individuals on Medicaid, especially for those with long-term care needs. States are struggling to attract enough paraprofessionals to meet the demand for services. Unpaid caregivers play a significant role in enabling individuals to stay at home or in a community setting, reducing reliance on Medicaid-covered institutions. The loss of caregivers due to disasters like Hurricane Katrina can leave evacuees without necessary assistance. Unpaid caregivers are crucial for individuals with long-term care needs, but disasters like Hurricane Katrina can lead to a loss of caregivers, leaving evacuees without necessary assistance. Movement of HCBS waiver recipients across states may impact access to services, with uncertainties about enrollment in waiver programs and availability of community-based housing for evacuees. Host states may need federal approval to cover evacuees and renegotiate cost neutrality agreements. The movement of HCBS waiver recipients across states may affect their access to services, as each waiver covers different services for specific populations. Evacuees may face challenges with eligibility and service availability in their host state. Cost-sharing policies for Medicaid could also impact Hurricane Katrina survivors, both in their home states and if they relocate. The Medicaid program is jointly financed by the federal government and states, with cost-sharing requirements for in-state and out-of-state evacuees. States incur Medicaid expenditures by reimbursing providers and administering their Medicaid programs. States submit accounting statements quarterly for reimbursement at the federal rate based on the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP). The Medicaid program is funded jointly by the federal government and states, with reimbursement based on the FMAP formula. States are concerned about potential enrollment surges post-Hurricane Katrina and advocate for enhanced federal reimbursement for Medicaid costs related to serving hurricane victims. The Secretary of HHS may need legislative change for enhanced Medicaid reimbursement rates, as current exceptions include family planning and services for low-income children. The FMAP formula reimburses states for most Medicaid expenditures. States may experience increased expenditures for medical care and administrative costs related to eligibility determinations for hurricane victims. Temporary increases in federal reimbursement have been authorized by Congress in the past to assist with administrative costs, such as a $500 million fund for enhanced federal reimbursement for administrative expenditures. The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program includes payments for out-of-state care under federal regulations. States must pay for services in another state under certain conditions, such as medical emergencies or when services are more readily available in the other state. The regulations require states to establish procedures for Medicaid recipients seeking out-of-state care, including prior authorization and provider enrollment. Bordering states often have agreements in place to facilitate Medicaid services for recipients crossing state lines. For Hurricane Katrina displaced recipients, federal law does not prevent home state Medicaid coverage. Federal law does not prevent home state Medicaid coverage for Hurricane Katrina displaced recipients. The home state may pay for covered services in another state, but the recipient must find a provider willing to accept payment. Residency rules of the state where the individual evacuated to may apply. States operate their Medicaid programs within federal rules, allowing flexibility in certain situations like natural disasters. While states have flexibility in setting Medicaid eligibility and benefit rules, federal intervention may be necessary for significant modifications or special rules, such as covering childless adults or hurricane victims. Federal permission in the form of a waiver from the Secretary of HHS is generally required for such changes. Several states have opted to participate in the Section 1115 waiver arrangement offered by the federal government in response to Hurricane Katrina. Congressional action may be needed for enhanced reimbursement for Medicaid costs related to the hurricane. States are seeking federal guidance on Medicaid issues arising from the disaster. Louisiana has started issuing temporary Medicaid cards to recipients who lost theirs in the storm. Louisiana is providing temporary Medicaid cards to recipients affected by Hurricane Katrina, allowing access to Medicaid services without prior authorization requirements. Emergency procedures are in place to expedite provider enrollment for Medicaid payment. Medicaid staff are available at Family Assistance Centers and shelters to assist with health coverage forms for those impacted by the hurricane. All Louisiana Medicaid staff are working to enroll those in need of health coverage due to the hurricane. Louisiana is extending renewal dates for SCHIP and Medicaid recipients affected by Hurricane Katrina. The state has a temporary \"Hurricane Katrina Medicaid Program\" offering no-cost health coverage with differences from regular Medicaid. Mississippi Division of Medicaid is also providing assistance to those impacted by the hurricane. The Mississippi Division of Medicaid is offering essential services for Medicaid recipients affected by Hurricane Katrina, including temporary provider enrollment and up to five months of coverage for certain evacuees. In Alabama, a proclamation has been signed to expedite prescription refills for storm victims at any pharmacy. The state of Alabama is allowing out-of-state providers to verify eligibility for Alabama Medicaid recipients through an Automated Voice Response System. A special expedited enrollment process has been developed for out-of-state providers offering medical services to Alabama Medicaid recipients. Additionally, after Hurricane Katrina, Texas provided information to assist Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama residents on Medicaid with filling prescriptions and accessing services in Texas. The Texas Department of State Health Services is assessing medical care needs for evacuees with special needs. A Hurricane Katrina Section 1115 waiver provides temporary coverage for certain evacuees. Section 1115 allows the Secretary of HHS to waive requirements for research and demonstration projects under Medicaid and SCHIP. Under Section 1115, the Secretary can waive Medicaid requirements, allowing states to propose waivers for approval by CMS. These waivers have led to significant changes for Medicaid recipients and are used for restructuring coverage, cost control, and increasing state flexibility. Under Section 1115, states can obtain waivers to provide services to individuals not traditionally eligible for Medicaid, cover non-Medicaid services, limit benefit packages, adapt programs to special needs, or achieve policy goals like disaster relief. For example, after 9/11, New York received approval for a waiver called \"Disaster Relief Medicaid\" allowing residents of NYC to receive four months of coverage if they met eligibility requirements. Under Section 1115, states can obtain waivers to provide services to individuals not traditionally eligible for Medicaid, cover non-Medicaid services, limit benefit packages, adapt programs to special needs, or achieve policy goals like disaster relief. Approved waivers are part of a state's Medicaid plan for federal reimbursement. Restrictions exist on waivers related to mandatory services for specific groups and cost-sharing. Under Section 1115, states can obtain waivers to provide services not traditionally eligible for Medicaid, with costs subject to FMAP. Changes to financing arrangements require congressional action. Waiver programs must be budget neutral to the federal government. An exception was made for New York's Disaster Relief Medicaid waiver. The Section 1115 waiver program allows states to provide non-traditional Medicaid services with costs subject to FMAP. Recent approvals of emergency Medicaid waivers eliminated budget and allotment neutrality tests. SCHIP program has a different budget neutrality standard where federal expenditures are capped at the state's individual SCHIP allotment. Section 1115 waiver projects may interact with other program rules outside of the Social Security Act. The Secretary's authority over Section 1115 waiver programs can be influenced by program guidance and legislative action. The waiver policy may be shaped through program rules, guidance publications, and approved programs. Congressional action may be necessary to further define approval criteria or limit the Secretary's waiver authority. New York's Disaster Relief Medicaid program serves as a precedent for the Secretary of HHS to use Section 1115 authority in emergency situations. Following 9/11, New York received approval for a waiver program providing coverage to residents of NYC for four months. Medicaid applicants in New York City received four months of coverage under the Disaster Relief Medicaid program if they met eligibility requirements. The Family Health Plus program, approved by CMS, expanded Medicaid eligibility for certain groups. Those who were pregnant, disabled, or needed institutional services were processed through traditional Medicaid application. The DRM program provided Medicaid coverage to New York City and Westchester County residents without annual re-certification. It also offered temporary SCHIP eligibility for children affected by the World Trade Center attacks. The Secretary of HHS approved the DRM program in September 2001 for New York City and Westchester County residents, providing Medicaid coverage without annual re-certification. Temporary modifications to New York's SCHIP program were also approved, with final approval for the DRM Section 1115 waiver granted on December 31, 2002. CMS waived the usual Medicaid cost neutrality requirements due to the September 11 attacks, but SCHIP allotment neutrality requirements still applied. The DRM program, approved in September 2001 for New York City and Westchester County residents, facilitated Medicaid enrollment for new applicants. Applicants had to fill out a one-page application, prove their identity and income, and did not need to be direct victims of the 9/11 attacks. Those who qualified received temporary Medicaid authorization for services, including fee-for-service benefits. The program provided additional coverage and eligibility beyond the usual requirements. The New York waiver for the DRM program extended Medicaid coverage and eligibility, but recipients were not entitled to benefits during a fair hearing. A lawsuit was filed, leading to a court order for the Medicaid Agency to continue benefits until a fair hearing decision was made. The court reached a fair hearing decision regarding the New York waiver for the DRM program, indicating limitations on the Secretary's authority. Approximately 342,000 beneficiaries were enrolled in the program with estimated funding of $670 million. New York requested FEMA to cover the non-federal share of Medicaid expenditures, which was denied and is currently under appeal. The Section 1135 waiver authority allows immediate program changes in emergency situations. The Secretary of HHS can make immediate program changes in response to emergencies in specific geographic areas. Section 1135 of the Social Security Act allows temporary waivers of federal requirements for healthcare providers during emergencies. This includes waiving participation, state licensing, and pre-approval requirements. Section 1135 of the Social Security Act allows temporary waivers of federal requirements for healthcare providers during emergencies, including sanctions for failing to meet requirements for emergency transfers between hospitals and physician self-referral. The Secretary of HHS must provide Congress with certification and notice before exercising this waiver authority, which can last for 60 days and be extended. Within one year after the emergency, the Secretary must evaluate the approach and make recommendations for improvements under this waiver authority. The Secretary of HHS has utilized Section 1115 and Section 1135 waiver authorities to address the healthcare needs of Hurricane Katrina survivors. CMS implemented emergency policies to grant special evacuee status for accessing federal programs like Medicaid and SCHIP without income verification. Application templates were developed to aid states in obtaining emergency assistance. An application template was developed to assist states in obtaining emergency Medicaid and SCHIP Section 1115 waivers for Hurricane Katrina evacuees. Texas was the first of 17 states to obtain approval for a waiver, with others following suit. These waivers provide temporary eligibility for up to five months for evacuees to access Medicaid and SCHIP services in the host state. Emergency Section 1115 waivers were granted to 17 states for Hurricane Katrina evacuees, providing temporary Medicaid and SCHIP eligibility based on simplified criteria. Evacuees in some states are exempt from cost-sharing, while others impose it. Eight states also establish an uncompensated care pool for evacuees. In eight states with uncompensated care pools for Hurricane Katrina evacuees, funds can be used to augment Medicaid and SCHIP services, reimburse providers for uncompensated care costs, and explore alternative coverage methods for uninsured evacuees. States must report to CMS on the feasibility of adopting alternative methods. The Section 1115 waivers define an evacuee as an individual displaced by a disaster, not a non-qualified alien, and meeting specific income criteria for temporary eligibility. This includes children, pregnant women, individuals with disabilities, and low-income Medicare recipients. The Section 1115 waivers allow evacuees to self-attest to displacement, income, and immigration status for Medicaid and SCHIP eligibility without meeting neutrality requirements. This includes low-income individuals in need of long-term care and parents of children under 19 with family income up to 100% FPL. The Section 1115 waivers allow evacuees to self-attest to displacement, income, and immigration status for Medicaid and SCHIP eligibility without meeting neutrality requirements. Budget neutrality for most waivers involves negotiating a spending cap between federal and state governments to prevent increased federal spending. The Secretary has the discretion to decide if budget neutrality applies to a specific waiver. The Secretary has the discretion to decide if budget neutrality applies to a specific waiver. Financing under the Emergency Medicaid Waivers involves home states agreeing to pay the non-federal share of costs for treatment provided to evacuees. Some states with Hurricane Katrina Section 1115 waivers expect to receive 100% federal funding for services provided. Waiver documents do not specify how this would be achieved. The CMS official stated that waiver expenditures for uncompensated care pools will be reimbursed with 100% federal funds from the NDMS program, which has $100 million available. Costs for other emergency Medicaid waiver services are the responsibility of the home state. The budget reconciliation conference report includes $2 billion for Hurricane Katrina Medicaid and SCHIP relief, in addition to funds for health care costs related to Hurricane Katrina under the Department of Homeland Security. Eligible states providing care to affected individuals can receive payments under a Section 1115 project. The Secretary of HHS does not have the authority to waive provisions of federal Medicaid law governing the FMAP and other reimbursement rates. Each state is responsible for paying the non-federal share of Medicaid costs. If NDMS funds are insufficient, it is unclear if additional steps may be taken. The Secretary of HHS invoked Section 1135 waivers to accommodate emergency healthcare needs in Hurricane Katrina-impacted states. States covered under the waivers must meet specific requirements declared by the President and the Secretary of HHS. The Secretary of HHS declared public health emergencies in certain states under Section 319 of the Public Health Service Act. States covered under Section 1135 waivers for Hurricane Katrina must meet specific requirements for loosened program operating rules to speed up healthcare services. The Section 1135 waivers for Hurricane Katrina require certain conditions for healthcare providers to be reimbursed for services rendered to program recipients, including certification requirements, participation conditions, and pre-approval requirements. This includes the necessity for physicians and healthcare professionals to hold licenses in the state where they provide services, even if they have a license from another state. Sanctions may be imposed under Section 1867 of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act for redirecting individuals to another location for medical screening examinations. The curr_chunk discusses limitations on payments for Medicare Advantage enrollees to use out-of-network providers in emergency situations and sanctions for noncompliance with HIPAA privacy regulations. The curr_chunk discusses the uncertainty surrounding the Section 1135 waiver authority in Medicaid operations during emergencies, particularly in terms of payment for services. It also raises questions about how crisis services for Medicare and Medicaid patients in non-certified facilities will be paid for. The disaster relief areas and time periods defined in the Secretary's September 2005 waiver actions target individuals and states affected by Hurricane Katrina. Relief may not apply to other emergency situations like Hurricane Rita. The Secretary can relax provider rules under the Section 1135 waiver authority in crisis situations. CMS encourages Katrina-affected states to pursue waiver programs under the Section 1115 demonstration initiative to offer Medicaid and SCHIP coverage to evacuees from disaster-declared areas due to Hurricane Katrina. The CMS waiver initiative targeted Hurricane Katrina-impacted states for changes to Medicaid and SCHIP programs in response to the disaster. Several bills in the 109th Congress aimed to provide Medicaid coverage for Hurricane Katrina survivors, with relief focused on affected individuals and states. The relief may not apply to other emergency situations like Hurricane Rita. H.R. 3671 (Green) and H.R. 3698 (Dingell) are House proposals aimed at providing 100% federal funding for Medicaid expenditures for displaced Medicaid recipients and Katrina survivors in directly impacted states. States may also receive funding for administrative costs related to covering Katrina survivors. The proposal aims to provide federal funding for states covering Katrina survivors without imposing income or residency requirements. States would use a simplified application process during the disaster relief period from August 29, 2005, through September 30, 2006. Additionally, states would be held harmless for any reduction in their FMAP rate for FY2006, with the FY2005 rate applying if lower. The proposal also suspends certain Medicaid changes related to the Medicare prescription drug benefit until January 2007. The proposal aims to suspend certain Medicaid changes related to the Medicare prescription drug benefit until January 2007 for states impacted by Hurricane Katrina or with a significant influx of Katrina survivors. It also allows state Medicaid programs to pay for prescription drugs for Part D eligible individuals who are Katrina survivors. The changes can be ended if the Secretary determines that individuals can be effectively transferred to Medicare for their prescription drug coverage without discontinuing coverage. H.R. 3708 (Johnson) Status: Referred to House Committees on Energy and Commerce; Transportation and Infrastructure. The proposal in H.R. 3735 would allocate 10% of Hurricane Katrina relief funds for mental health services for victims and first responders. H.R. 3845 aims to establish a 90% FMAP rate for Medicaid and SCHIP services in Louisiana for FY2006. H.R. 3952 (Gingrey) proposes Disaster Relief Medicaid (DRM) coverage for Katrina survivors and residents of major disaster areas, transitioning drug coverage for Medicare/Medicaid dual eligibles, and expanding waiver authority. S. 1716 proposes Medicaid coverage for Katrina survivors based on state criteria, with 90% federal funding for services. It also includes a moratorium on Medicaid eligibility redeterminations and excludes treatment for alcohol and substance abuse. The proposal H.R. 3958 aims to waive Medicaid's prohibition on covering services in an institution for mental disease for Katrina survivors between ages 21 and 64 from August 28, 2005, to December 31, 2006. It is similar to S. 1716 in establishing Disaster Relief Medicaid coverage and providing 100% federal funding for eligible survivors. FMAP decreases in FY2006, transitioning drug coverage for Medicare/Medicaid dual eligibles in affected areas from Medicaid to Medicare Part D, expanding Section 1135 waiver authority. Provisions mainly apply to Louisiana, with some impact on certain counties in Mississippi and Alabama. DRM coverage is for Katrina survivors from Louisiana, with additional federal Medicaid funding and moratorium on Medicaid eligibility redeterminations specific to Louisiana. Proposal includes $400 million for Disaster Relief Fund for private health insurance premiums. Louisiana's expenditures for reimbursing healthcare providers during DRM coverage period are covered. The proposal aims to provide Disaster Relief Medicaid coverage for Katrina survivors, with a 12-month initial coverage period and a possible 12-month extension by the President. Similar proposals are being considered in both the House and Senate, with different coverage periods and committees involved. The proposal allows certain health professionals to provide Medicaid services in five states without state licensing laws for 90 days after enactment. Eligible health professionals evacuated from Louisiana and Mississippi can provide health services under federal programs without state licensing laws for 90 days. The proposal allows states to receive 100% federal funding for Medicaid and SCHIP expenditures for Katrina survivors during the disaster period. The disaster period is determined by the declaration of a major disaster area due to Hurricane Katrina and can be extended by the President for up to six months. States may extend the disaster period for up to an additional six months for Katrina survivors, with simplified application processes and no income or asset tests. They would be eligible for a range of services under Medicaid and SCHIP, including coverage for necessary medical services outside of Medicaid. S. 1716 (Grassley-Baucus) is currently on the Senate legislative calendar. The proposal on the Senate legislative calendar requires states to provide Disaster Relief Medicaid (DRM) coverage for Katrina survivors meeting specific income guidelines. Eligibility is based on family income not exceeding 100% of the federal poverty level or the state's Medicaid income eligibility standard. States must use lenient income counting rules, simplify the application process, and not impose asset tests or residency requirements. The DRM coverage period for Katrina survivors would be from August 28, 2005, until five months after the bill's enactment, with a possible extension by the President. States can offer extended mental health and care coordination benefits, home and community-based waiver services, and lift waiver restrictions for immediate services. Medicaid service expenditures and administrative costs for DRM-eligible survivors would be fully funded by the federal government. The bill provides 100% FMAP for medical assistance to Katrina survivors residing in affected areas. States are protected from FMAP reductions in FY2006, with a Disaster Relief Fund established for Medicaid providers. The bill aims to provide financial assistance to Medicaid providers affected by Hurricane Katrina and to state insurance commissioners for health insurance premium payments. It also includes a plan for transitioning individuals from Medicaid to Medicare Part D coverage and extends waiver authority to areas with a high number of evacuees. The proposal from the Committee on Finance aims to establish Disaster Relief Medicaid coverage for Katrina survivors, provide 100% federal funding for eligible individuals, and expand waiver authority. It differs from a previous proposal by offering 100% FMAP for medical assistance in specific Louisiana parishes affected by Hurricane Katrina. The Disaster Relief Fund would have an appropriation of $400 million and be available to pay for private health insurance premiums. Louisiana's expenditures for reimbursing hospitals, physicians, and clinics for care provided to Katrina survivors would be treated as medical assistance under the state's Medicaid plan with an FMAP of 80%. The instructions directed two committees to reduce Medicaid outlays by $10 billion (Senate Finance) and $14.734 billion (House Energy and Commerce) for FY2006-FY2010. The Senate Finance Committee approved a reconciliation proposal that was incorporated into S. 1932, passing the Senate on November 3. One provision of S. 1932 allowed states to receive 100% FMAP reimbursement for Medicaid and SCHIP assistance provided to Hurricane Katrina survivors in specified areas. The House Energy and Commerce Committee approved a reconciliation proposal that was incorporated into H.R. 4241, passing the House as an amendment to S. 1932 on November 18. Under the House bill, states would receive 100% FMAP reimbursement for Medicaid and SCHIP assistance provided to individuals in specified areas affected by Hurricane Katrina. Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama could elect to not have certain provisions of the bill apply during the disaster period. The House bill provides 100% FMAP reimbursement for Medicaid and SCHIP assistance to individuals affected by Hurricane Katrina in specific areas. Evacuees from Katrina in certain states would have their income disregarded for calculating state FMAPs. The bill allows Medicaid assistance to not apply to individuals affected by Hurricane Katrina in specific areas during an 11-month period. A conference report was filed on S. 1932 (H.Rept. 109-362) containing Hurricane Katrina Medicaid and SCHIP relief. The House agreed to the report, and the Senate removed extraneous matter before returning the amended measure for further action. The conference agreement would appropriate $2 billion. The conference agreement would appropriate $2 billion for the Secretary of HHS to pay eligible states for health care costs related to Hurricane Katrina, including the non-federal share of expenditures for health care provided to affected individuals and evacuees, administrative costs, and medical assistance under existing Medicaid and SCHIP state plans. The proposed legislation would allocate $2 billion for the Secretary of HHS to cover health care costs related to Hurricane Katrina, including medical assistance under existing Medicaid and SCHIP state plans. The non-federal share paid to eligible states would not be considered federal funds for Medicaid matching requirements. No payment obligations would be incurred for certain health care costs under approved multi-state Section 1115 projects."
