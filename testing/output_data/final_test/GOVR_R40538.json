    "content": "More than 20 federal entities conduct water-related research and development, collecting and disseminating water information and data. H.R. 1145, the National Water Research and Development Initiative Act of 2009, aims to determine if coordinating federally funded water research would benefit the nation. A 2004 report by the National Research Council found that federal spending on water research has remained constant at $700 million annually since the mid-1970s, but funding has not kept pace with federal budget growth or GDP. The focus of federal research has shifted towards water quality, neglecting water supply augmentation, conservation, and social science topics. H.R. 1145 aims to coordinate federal water research conducted by over 20 agencies. It establishes an interagency committee to develop a four-year research plan and a National Water Initiative Coordination Office to support the committee and disseminate findings. The bill aims to codify the Subcommittee on Water Availability and Quality (SWAQ) and establish an interagency committee for federal water research coordination. The U.S. Geological Survey monitors water quantity and quality, while the National Weather Service and Natural Resource Conservation Service collaborate with USGS for water supply and flood forecasting. The USDA and USGS collaborate to forecast water supplies and floods, while other federal agencies collect water data for their own missions. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers monitors runoff data and water quality for navigation and flood damage reduction. NASA and NOAA data are increasingly used for water resources research. The Department of Energy, USDA, EPA, and other federal agencies conduct research on water quantity management, desalination, and water quality. NOAA and NASA data are also utilized for water resources research. The National Science Foundation (NSF) and the USGS support various water quality, quantity, and social science research. Federal agencies like Reclamation, the Corps, EPA, and USDA also fund ecosystem restoration research. In FY2000, federal funding for water supply augmentation and conservation research totaled $14.5 million and $45.6 million, respectively. In the late 1960s, federal research in water supply augmentation was funded at approximately $120 million annually. Federal research funding for water quality management and protection totaled $191.2 million in FY2000, with a shift in research areas over time. The 2004 NRC report highlighted the need for increased investment in water use and institutional research topics to address the national water agenda adequately. H.R. 1145 lists research outcomes to target in a proposed four-year plan. H.R. 1145 outlines 25 research outcomes for a four-year plan, including data and evaluation goals, technology advancements, science improvements, and social sciences analyses. Implementing the plan may limit agencies' discretion in prioritizing research funding, depending on stakeholders' perspectives. The NRC report suggests that coordination of the federal water research portfolio is necessary to prioritize funds, minimize duplication, and present a coherent strategy for federal investment. This would ensure that limited federal funds are focused on achieving broader national priorities. The Subcommittee on Water Availability and Quality (SWAQ) was established in 2003 to coordinate water research for the National Science and Technology Council. SWAQ serves as a forum for federal agencies to share information on research and data programs. H.R. 1145 aims to formalize SWAQ as an interagency committee with an OSTP chair. A 2007 report by SWAQ emphasized the importance of federal involvement in providing information on water management. H.R. 1145 aims to coordinate federal water research to improve the government's role in providing information on water resources. Concerns exist that the bill may shift focus away from other research areas, such as the EPA's regulatory role, if additional funds are not allocated for water research. Enactment of H.R. 1145 may shift research funding towards technology development and water quality provisions, potentially duplicating current efforts. The bill aims to improve coordination in setting agency research agendas without increasing funding levels. The SWAQ focuses on improving coordination in setting agency research agendas and increasing transparency in water research budgeting. Some stakeholders question if transparency alone can bring significant changes without increased funding. Membership includes various departments and agencies such as the Department of Agriculture, Department of Commerce, Department of Defense, and Department of the Interior. The curr_chunk includes various government agencies such as the Bureau of Reclamation, Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service, U.S. Geological Survey, Department of Energy, Environmental Protection Agency, NASA, and more."
