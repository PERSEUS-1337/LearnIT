    "content": "Workers who lose their jobs due to a disaster can seek assistance through federally supported programs like Unemployment Compensation (UC), which provides weekly cash payments to involuntarily unemployed workers. States administer UC benefits with oversight from the U.S. Department of Labor, and it is funded by state unemployment taxes. Additionally, there are income support and employment service programs available for disaster-affected workers. Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA) provides weekly cash payments to individuals unemployed due to a major disaster, funded by FEMA and administered by DOL through state UC agencies. WIOA-DW grants offer training and career services to workers who lose jobs involuntarily, funded by DOL and administered by state agencies with oversight. Disaster Dislocated Worker Grants (DDWGs) provide federal grants for temporary disaster response jobs for unemployed workers. Funding for disaster-affected workers mainly comes from increased UC payments and DUA benefits, which are more scalable than WIOA-DW and DDWG funds. These programs focus on assisting workers who have lost their jobs due to a disaster. This report focuses on programs that support disaster-affected individuals who have lost their jobs, such as UC and WIOA-DW. These programs do not require job loss as an eligibility criterion and benefit receipt is not contingent on specific disaster criteria. The WIOA-DW system also serves workers who lose their jobs for reasons other than a disaster. The Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA) and Disaster Dislocated Worker Grant (DDWG) programs provide income support to individuals who lose their jobs due to declared disasters. DUA benefits are available to those directly affected by a major disaster under the Stafford Act, while DDWG assistance can be awarded for national emergency situations. The joint federal-state Unemployment Compensation (UC) program offers weekly benefits to eligible unemployed workers. The Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA) program provides income support to individuals who become unemployed due to major disasters. The Unemployment Compensation (UC) program offers benefits to eligible unemployed workers, with each state determining specific benefits. The UC program is funded by federal and state payroll taxes. Employers pay a 0.6% FUTA tax on the first $7,000 of each employee's earnings. States also levy SUTA taxes on employers to fund regular UC benefits. SUTA rates are based on the amount of UC paid to former employees, ensuring an equitable distribution of taxes among employers. The UC program ensures equitable distribution of taxes among employers and promotes a stable workforce. During economic downturns, states may need to use loans from the Unemployment Trust Fund to pay UC benefits. Failure to repay these loans promptly can result in interest charges and increased FUTA rates for employers. The UC program provides benefits to involuntarily unemployed workers who meet eligibility criteria. The UC program provides income support to eligible workers through weekly cash benefits during unemployment for up to 26 weeks in most states. Claimants must meet state-established eligibility rules, have recent earnings, and actively search for work to qualify for UC benefits. The Extended Benefits (EB) program can provide up to 13 or 20 weeks of additional benefits after regular unemployment benefits are exhausted, depending on eligibility and economic conditions. Workers affected by disasters may qualify for Unemployment Compensation (UC) if they meet eligibility requirements. The UC program does not typically cover the self-employed, those unable to work, or those without recent earnings history, but exceptions may be made during major disasters. The Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA) program provides income support to individuals who become unemployed as a direct result of a major disaster and are not eligible for regular Unemployment Compensation (UC) benefits. DUA benefits are authorized by the Stafford Act and funded through the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) administered by FEMA. Unused funds from the previous fiscal year are carried over to the next fiscal year, and when the DRF balance is low, Congress provides additional funding. The DUA program provides income support to individuals unemployed due to a major disaster. Congress replenishes the DRF when funds are low. DOL administers the program and coordinates with FEMA. The President can declare a major disaster, providing various forms of assistance under the Stafford Act, including DUA for disaster-affected workers. The Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA) program offers benefits to individuals in disaster-affected areas who have lost their jobs directly due to the disaster. Unlike regular Unemployment Compensation (UC), DUA eligibility does not always require a substantial work history or the ability to work. It includes self-employed individuals, those unable to reach their workplace due to the disaster, and those experiencing unemployment directly because of the disaster. The Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA) program provides benefits to individuals affected by a major disaster who have lost their jobs as a direct result of the disaster. Eligible individuals include those unable to reach their workplace, those who have become the main provider due to a family member's death, and those unable to work due to disaster-related injuries. Noncitizens must have a Social Security number and alien registration card to apply for benefits within 30 days of availability announcement. Extensions may be granted for good cause. DUA benefits can be extended past the 30-day deadline, but initial applications after the 26th week following the disaster declaration are not accepted. DUA beneficiaries are not eligible for regular UC benefits or Extended Benefits. Benefits are calculated based on state UC laws, with self-employed individuals needing to provide tax records for earnings verification. Workers unable to work due to disaster-related injuries may receive DUA benefits. Workers affected by a disaster can receive Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA) benefits if they are unable to work as a direct result of the disaster. The amount of DUA benefits is equivalent to what they would have received under the Unemployment Compensation (UC) system. Those without sufficient employment history for UC benefits receive half of the average UC benefit for their state. The maximum and minimum weekly DUA benefit amounts are determined by state law. Additionally, there are programs available for dislocated workers who lose their jobs involuntarily due to a disaster. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) provides formula grants to states for job training and career services for individuals who lose their jobs. Disaster Dislocated Worker Grants offer competitive grants for temporary jobs for workers unemployed due to disasters. WIOA-DW funds support dislocated workers through state workforce agencies and local workforce development boards. 20% of WIOA-DW funds are allocated to a national reserve for National Dislocated Worker Grants. National Dislocated Worker Grants are allocated to state workforce agencies based on unemployment factors. Governors can reserve up to 15% for statewide activities and up to 25% for rapid response to layoffs. The rest goes to local workforce boards for individual worker services. Eligible dislocated workers are those who involuntarily lost their job, have a labor force attachment, and are unlikely to return. Workers who lose their jobs due to a disaster and meet dislocated worker criteria can access services through WIOA-DW grants. Low-income individuals are prioritized if funding is limited. Services include career assessment, job search assistance, and training like classroom or on-the-job training. Local providers have flexibility in providing benefits to eligible workers. The governor's reserve allows the state to respond to mass layoffs, including those caused by disasters. Rapid response activities are conducted to determine eligibility for benefits for dislocated workers. The WIOA-DW program assists dislocated workers by determining eligibility for benefits and services, coordinating local responses, and seeking state economic development aid. Funding is based on unemployment factors, with areas affected by disasters potentially qualifying for higher funding in subsequent years. The program operates in partnership with WIOA Adult Activities to support career services and training activities. WIOA-AA funding can serve any jobseeker over 18, including new labor force entrants and incumbent workers. Unlike WIOA-DW, eligibility for WIOA-AA benefits does not require job loss, making it ineligible for this report. However, WIOA-AA benefits can provide career services and training to disaster-affected workers. Disaster Dislocated Worker Grants support temporary disaster recovery jobs and career services for participants. Disaster Dislocated Worker Grants (DDWGs) provide career services and training for participants in temporary jobs or those relocated due to a disaster. DDWGs are part of National Dislocated Worker Grants (NDWGs) funded by WIOA. States can apply for DDWGs through an Emergency Application within 15 days of a qualifying declaration, with a full application due within 60 days. Grantees can subgrant funds to local workforce boards or use them for qualified projects. DDWG funds are awarded to states experiencing disasters. Disaster Dislocated Worker Grants (DDWGs) provide career services and training for individuals affected by disasters. States can apply for DDWGs within a specific timeframe after a disaster declaration. Eligible individuals must reside in the affected area or have relocated due to the disaster. DDWGs primarily support Disaster Relief Employment, offering temporary jobs for clean-up and recovery efforts. Disaster Relief Employment offers temporary jobs for clean-up, recovery, and humanitarian efforts in response to disasters. Workers must be paid at least the minimum wage and can participate for up to 12 months or 2,080 hours. DDWGs also provide career and training services for dislocated workers unlikely to return to their prior employment, with a focus on relocated workers. When considering disaster response programs, funding mechanisms and limitations play a crucial role. Congress has enacted legislation to address program limitations in the past. UC benefits are funded by a state tax on employers and DUA benefits are paid from federal funds. Additional funding for the DRF is provided by Congress when needed. The UC and DUA programs can rapidly respond to unemployment caused by disasters with additional funding from Congress. However, increased UC outlays may lead to higher SUTA or FUTA taxes for affected state employers. States may need to raise taxes or borrow funds to continue paying benefits, with the requirement to repay borrowed funds. After disasters, Congress can provide additional funding to states through programs like the QI, TMA, and Abstinence Programs Extension and Hurricane Katrina Unemployment Relief Act of 2005. This helps alleviate the burden of increased UC claims and prevents automatic tax increases for employers. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 authorized a deferral of interest payments on a federal UI loan for the U.S. Virgin Islands. WIOA-DW and DDWG activities are supported by annual discretionary appropriations, with some flexibility for states to direct funds to disaster-affected areas. Congress may appropriate additional funds for these activities in disaster-related areas, but funding is not automatic and may be less timely than UC or DUA. Funding for workforce services has been expanded temporarily through additional appropriations, with recent examples including $125 million in supplemental funds for National Emergency Grants in 2005 and $100 million for the dislocated worker national reserve in 2018. Prioritizing DDWG activities may result in less funding for other National Dislocated Worker activities. The curr_chunk discusses the allocation of funding for disaster-related benefits such as UC and DUA, which provide immediate income support to affected workers. These benefits are designed to respond quickly to economic conditions caused by disasters. The UC program is evaluated based on how promptly eligible claimants are paid benefits. UC benefits are promptly provided to eligible individuals, but delays may occur if state offices are impacted by disasters. UC is typically limited to 26 weeks, while DUA benefits can be extended as long as the disaster continues, up to 26 weeks after the declaration. Congress enacted the Katrina Emergency Assistance Act of 2006 to extend DUA benefits for eligible individuals. In 2006, the Katrina Emergency Assistance Act (P.L. 109-176) extended DUA benefits for Hurricane Katrina and Rita victims by 13 weeks, totaling 39 weeks. Workers who exhausted UC benefits but received less than 39 weeks would get DUA benefits to reach the total. The WIOA-DW program prepares dislocated workers for local jobs, potentially aiding post-disaster labor markets. DDWG provides disaster relief employment for disrupted local worksites. The Disaster Dislocated Worker Grant (DDWG) provides federally subsidized employment for dislocated workers during labor market disruptions. It offers a more immediate benefit than WIOA-DW activities, with a 12-month maximum duration that can be extended for an additional 12 months in some cases. Supplemental appropriations can further extend the program, as seen in the example of funds available through September 30, 2019, more than two years after the 2017 hurricanes."
