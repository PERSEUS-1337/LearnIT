    "content": "The \"Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2001\" may be cited as such. It includes findings related to human cloning. The \"Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2001\" finds that the National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) deems human cloning morally unacceptable and recommends federal legislation to prohibit it. The NBAC also suggests international cooperation to enforce such prohibitions. Additionally, somatic cell nuclear transfer has potential applications in medical research according to the Institute of Medicine. The NBAC recommends federal legislation to prohibit human cloning, ensuring it does not hinder important research like stem cell development and transplantation. Biomedical research and clinical facilities operate in interstate commerce, with patients crossing state lines for access to services. The NBAC recommends federal legislation to prohibit human cloning and contract for research and purchase medical supplies in an interstate market. The purpose of the Act is to ban human cloning while still allowing for important medical research like stem cell research. The Act includes a prohibition on human cloning in Title 18 of the United States Code. The Act prohibits human cloning, defining terms like human cloning, human somatic cell, nuclear transplantation, nucleus, and oocyte. The Act prohibits human cloning, including conducting or attempting it, shipping nuclear transplantation products for cloning purposes, and using federal funds for prohibited activities. It does not restrict biomedical or agricultural research involving nuclear transplantation for human stem cells. The Act prohibits human cloning and related activities, including creating exact duplicates of molecules, DNA, cells, and tissues through various techniques. Violators face fines and imprisonment, as well as civil penalties and actions. The Attorney General can take legal action in federal court to stop violations of the Act. Property used in violations can be forfeited to the United States. The Attorney General can provide advisory opinions on the Act's enforcement. The President should cooperate with foreign countries to enforce restrictions on prohibited activities. No private right of action is granted. State laws inconsistent with nuclear transplantation research regulations will be preempted. \"ETHICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR NUCLEAR TRANSPLANTATION RESEARCH.\" In this section, definitions are provided for terms like human somatic cell, nuclear transplantation, nucleus, and oocyte. Research involving nuclear transplantation must adhere to federal ethical standards. The Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2001 outlines regulations for research involving nuclear transplantation, with civil penalties of up to $250,000 for intentional violations. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is responsible for enforcing these regulations."
