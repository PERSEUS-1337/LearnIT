Enterprise-level projects can be complex, requiring planning for up to 10k endpoints. Currently, planning is done manually or semi-manually, taking days to weeks. An automated planning engine using AI can generate high-quality migration plans quickly, addressing challenges in the industry. Cloud Migration involves transferring data, applications, and services to a cloud environment for improved performance and cost reduction. Researchers have extensively studied automated planning and AI planning in various sectors like healthcare, semiconductor manufacturing, and aviation. Enterprises are increasingly considering moving their IT infrastructure to Cloud or Hybrid Cloud platforms for scalability, flexibility, and cost benefits. However, there is limited discussion on using AI planning in Cloud Migration. This paper identifies the advantages and challenges of applying AI planning to Cloud Migration. Cloud Migration involves transferring data, applications, and services to a cloud environment for improved performance and cost reduction. It is a complex process that includes four major steps: Discovery, Planning, Execute, and Validation. The Discovery stage involves investigating the current IT system and identifying migration goals. Migration experts allocate resources and schedule execution activities in the Planning stage. The migration is then executed as planned in the Execute stage. During the Validation stage, applications are tested to ensure they run as expected in the new cloud environment. Due to IT system complexity, boundaries between stages may not be clear. In cases of data inconsistency during Planning, additional discoveries may lead to rescheduling or replanning of migration execution. Migration planning is typically done manually or with tools like Transition Manager and Velostrata. For instance, Transition Manager requires users to upload scripts manually. In a Cloud Migration planning problem, there are N assets to be migrated, with dependencies between assets creating precedence constraints for migration tasks. Manual planning approaches like Transition Manager and Velostrata Manager require users to upload scripts and create runbooks, relying heavily on practitioner's experience and domain knowledge. Domain-independent AI planners are emerging as a scalable solution with the advancement of computing speed and machine learning technologies. The goal of migration planning is to enforce precedence constraints for tasks, allocating resources and creating a task sequence. In enterprise-level migration, tasks must be executed within a limited time window to minimize business disruption. Developing an AI planner for Cloud Migration involves formulating the planning problem using Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). In a prototype AI planner, migration of physical servers and virtual machines is modeled as a planning problem with objects like servers and waves. Each server is assigned an 'effort hours' value representing cost. The Cloud Migration process involves assigning 'effort hours' to servers and 'effort hour limit' to waves to migrate servers without exceeding capacity constraints. A Metric-FF planner is used to test performance, with a graphical UI for user input. Translation engines generate Domain.pddl and Problem.pddl files automatically. The planner finds solutions quickly for a limited number of servers but struggles with 500 servers. The prototype planner overview is shown in Figure 1. The Cloud Migration process involves using a domain-independent AI planner for planning. Automating migration planning is beneficial for cost and quality considerations, leading to new research topics such as optimizing modeling, developing efficient algorithms, and improving computational speed for generating migration plans for complex scenarios."
