    "title": "SB 484",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 1507.6 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to allow mental health services for children in group homes, with the placing agency responsible for supervision. Psychotropic medications can only be used with physician and court authorization, and the facility must maintain detailed records for each child. The facility in charge of children in group homes must keep detailed records of each child's psychotropic medication, including court authorization, medication details, dosage, and administration. This requirement does not apply to runaway and homeless youth shelters. Section 1536 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to require the department to publish an annual list of licensed community care facilities, detailing licensing complaints and outcomes for certain types of facilities. The curr_chunk states the requirement to report law enforcement contacts made by facility staff or children. The curr_chunk emphasizes the protection of personal information of foster family homes and certified family homes to maintain privacy and confidentiality. This information is considered personal and should not be disclosed except for specific purposes related to licensing and placement of children. The curr_chunk focuses on the licensing program for foster family homes, facilitating child placement, and providing information to professional foster parent organizations and educational organizations. The department, county, or foster family agency can request and share information for reference checks on prospective certified parents, foster parents, or relative caregivers. A civil penalty may be imposed for failure to provide required information. The Legislature encourages the development of a database containing monthly reports and logs of certified and decertified family homes by foster family agencies. Notification to the department is required if a certified family home is decertified due to various reasons such as violating licensing rules, criminal convictions, or allowing illegal substances in the home. The department must annually post a statewide summary of de-identified information on its website regarding child abuse or neglect. Section 1538.8 of the Health and Safety Code addresses this requirement. Section 1538.8 of the Health and Safety Code requires the department to compile information on the use of psychotropic medications in group homes, including child welfare measures and HEDIS measures related to psychotropic medications. This includes Follow-Up Care for Children Prescribed Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Medication. The HEDIS measures related to antipsychotic medications in children and adolescents include monitoring the use of multiple concurrent antipsychotics, first-line psychosocial care, and metabolic monitoring. These measures aim to ensure appropriate and safe prescribing practices for this population. The department will collect data on glucose, HbA1c, lipid, and cholesterol levels in children prescribed multiple antipsychotics. Data will be stratified by age groups. Data will be drawn from existing records and shared in accordance with state and federal laws. This does not apply to runaway and homeless youth shelters. Section 1538.9 of the Health and Safety Code requires the department to work with stakeholders to establish a methodology for identifying group homes under the AFDC-FC program with high levels of psychotropic drug use. Facilities meeting this criteria will be inspected annually. The facility inspection includes reviewing the plan of operation, child-to-staff ratios, staff qualifications, and children's needs plan. It also involves assessing the availability of alternative treatments to psychotropic medications and conducting confidential interviews with current residents. Additionally, past residents and prescribing physicians may be interviewed as part of the inspection process. Following an inspection, the department may share information with relevant agencies and the facility to address risks related to psychotropic medication. The facility must submit a plan to remedy identified risks, which will be approved and verified by the department. The department can implement this section through all-county letters or similar instructions until emergency regulations are filed with the Secretary of State. The department must adopt regulations by January 1, 2017, to implement this section. Emergency regulations can be approved twice after the initial adoption. Final regulations must be adopted by January 1, 2018. The section does not replace existing requirements for responding to complaints or inspections in group homes. It also does not limit the department from taking other actions allowed by law. This section excludes runaway and homeless youth shelters. Section 11469 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended. The department will develop performance standards and outcome measures for group homes under the AFDC-FC program in consultation with stakeholders to assess care and supervision effectiveness. The performance standards and outcome measures for group home programs will be designed to measure their effectiveness in areas where they have influence. This includes assessing the services provided and their contribution to achieving child welfare case plan objectives. The regulations for group home performance standards will measure the effectiveness of mental health, education, medical, and other child-related services. Adjustments to AFDC-FC rates will be made if performance standards are not met. Effective July 1, 1995, group home performance standards must be implemented. Non-compliant programs will have their AFDC-FC rates adjusted. Group home programs must meet specific criteria to be classified at rate classification level 13 or 14. The performance standards system for group homes will not be enforced before the AFDC-FC performance standards system. On or before January 1, 2016, the department will develop additional performance standards for group homes to minimize law enforcement contacts and delinquency filings related to minors' behavior, in consultation with various stakeholders. On or before January 1, 2017, the department will develop additional performance standards for group homes in consultation with various stakeholders, including individualized behavior management programs and conflict resolution processes. No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII\u2009B of the California Constitution as it only incurs costs for local agencies or school districts related to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions."
