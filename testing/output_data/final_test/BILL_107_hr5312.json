Studies show high success rates for incubator tenant companies, particularly in technology-based sectors. Business incubators have significantly higher success rates than companies in the general economy. They also help academic institutions contribute to local economic development goals by providing high-paying jobs and benefits to employees. Education in entrepreneurship is crucial for business success and sustainable economic development. The Act aims to promote entrepreneurship by involving academia in supporting new small businesses through providing space and expertise. The Act defines \"degree-granting institution\" as a higher education institution awarding associate or baccalaureate degrees, and \"incubator\" as an entity affiliated with a degree-granting institution providing specialized services to entrepreneurial businesses during their startup phase. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Education. SEC. 4. PROGRAM AUTHORIZED. The Secretary is authorized to support the establishment and development of incubators by allocating funds for acquiring or renovating space, developing curricula, providing services, and programming for entrepreneurs. The Secretary allocates funds for incubators, including awards for feasibility studies and research on best practices. Contracts with organizations are authorized for research purposes. Awards are given to nonprofit entities affiliated with degree-granting institutions. The Secretary allocates funds for incubators, including awards for feasibility studies and research on best practices. Contracts with organizations are authorized for research purposes. Awards are given to nonprofit entities affiliated with degree-granting institutions that manage or provide technical assistance to the incubator. SEC. 5. USES OF FUNDS.\n\nFunds awarded under section 4(b)(1)(B) may be used for curriculum, training, or technical assistance developed by academic faculty with participation from entrepreneurship experts and local government leaders, programming that contributes to a coordinated set of business assistance tools, and hiring staff to coordinate activities or for curriculum development. Each entity seeking assistance must submit an application to the Secretary with required information. The application must assure that supported activities have municipal backing and align with local economic plans. Priority is given to applications promoting student entrepreneurship education and fostering collaboration between businesses, academia, and local government. The Secretary may consider funding applications supporting new incubators in economically distressed areas with successful graduation rates and economic benefits for tenant companies. Priority is given to incubators working with faculty entrepreneurs or university-based research, located in rural, inner-city areas, or Indian reservations to enhance and diversify the community. An incubator in economically distressed areas can boost the economy through technology commercialization. The term \"consideration\" in this context does not imply priority. SEC. 7. MATCHING FUNDS. Each entity receiving Federal assistance under section 4(b)(1) must provide matching funds equal to the amount of Federal assistance received. The non-Federal share can be in the form of in-kind contributions. SEC. 8. REPORT. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress at the end of the third year of assistance under the Act. The report includes descriptions of effective curricula additions, a comparison of small business survival rates in and out of incubators, factors contributing to incubator business success, the role of degree-granting institutions in business incubation, and a comparison of academic-affiliated incubators supported under the Act with those that are not. Authorization of appropriations for the Act includes $20,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2003 to 2005."
