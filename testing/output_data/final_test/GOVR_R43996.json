    "content": "The House Committee on Rules held a hearing on proposed amendments to H.R. 1560 and H.R. 1731 on April 21. Over 30 amendments were submitted for H.R. 1731 and over 20 for H.R. 1560. The committee reported H.Res. 212 on the two bills on April 21, with a structured rule allowing consideration of amendments. On April 22, all five amendments to H.R. 1560 were adopted, and the bill passed the House by a vote of 307 to 116. After the House Committee on Rules hearing, amendments to H.R. 1560 and H.R. 1731 were adopted and the bills passed with significant votes. Multiple bills on information sharing have been introduced in the 114th Congress, including the reintroduction of the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act as H.R. 234. H.R. 234, an amended version of the White House proposal, and S. 754, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015, aim to address barriers to sharing information on cybersecurity threats and attacks. Effective information sharing is crucial for protecting information systems from cybercriminals. Many private-sector entities are hesitant to share information on cybersecurity threats due to concerns about legal liability, antitrust violations, and protection of intellectual property. Traditional security approaches emphasizing secrecy hinder information sharing. Legislative proposals aim to address these concerns, with varying emphasis and methods. The NCPAA focuses on DHS and the NCCIC, while the PCNA focuses on the IC and the CTIIC. CISPA and CISA address roles of both DHS and the IC, while the NCPAA, S. 456, and the WHP focus on ISAOs. ISAOs gather and analyze information on critical infrastructure security, share it for defense and recovery, and disseminate it to relevant entities. President Obama signed Executive Order 13691 on February 20, 2015, requiring the formation of ISAOs to coordinate with the NCCIC for information sharing. The White House announced support for the NCPAA and PCNA bills, calling for liability protections and safeguards for defensive measures. The NCPAA and PCNA bills aim to facilitate information sharing among private-sector entities for cybersecurity and law enforcement purposes, with provisions to protect privacy and civil liberties. The proposals limit government use of shared information and provide liability protections for entities sharing cyber threat indicators. The NCPAA and PCNA bills aim to facilitate information sharing among private-sector entities for cybersecurity and law enforcement purposes, with provisions to protect privacy and civil liberties. The proposed mechanisms vary in addressing concerns about privacy and civil liberties, involving roles such as the Attorney General, DHS Secretary, Chief Privacy Officers, PCLOB, and Inspectors General. Reports to Congress on impacts are required, along with provisions to shield shared information from public disclosure. H.R. 1735, the National Defense Authorization Act of 2016, provides liability protections for defense contractors reporting incidents to DOD and cleared contractors reporting penetrations. Legislation on information sharing for cybersecurity purposes is seen as beneficial, but resistance to sharing among private-sector entities may not be reduced significantly. While sharing information can help prevent or mitigate attacks, there may not be a clear direct benefit for providing information. Indirect benefits could arise through reciprocity among sharing entities. Legislative proposals aim to reduce risks for private-sector entities sharing information. The importance of information sharing in cybersecurity legislation is highlighted, but there is a lack of explicit incentives for private-sector entities to participate. While sharing information can help prevent attacks, it is just one aspect of cybersecurity, and many organizations may prioritize other cybersecurity needs. Most information sharing focuses on immediate threats and may not address broader cybersecurity issues like education, workforce, and long-term challenges in hardware and software design. The report discusses long-term challenges in cybersecurity, including building security into hardware and software design, changing incentive structures, consensus building on cybersecurity needs, and adapting to cyberspace evolution. It also compares provisions in H.R. 1560 and H.R. 1731, now combined into a single bill, highlighting the PCNA and NCPAA titles. The text discusses the identification and formatting of provisions in a table, including the use of bold and underlined text for emphasis. It also explains how sections and subsections are referenced in bills, with examples provided. The focus is on highlighting differences between provisions in different bills and ensuring clarity in the presentation of information. The text explains the formatting of provisions in a table, including referencing sections and subsections in bills. Page numbers are hyperlinked to the provisions they reference, with explanatory notes in square brackets. Phrases like \"[Similar to NCPAA]\" indicate similarities in text, while \"[Identical to NCPAA]\" denotes no language differences. The curr_chunk states that there are no language differences in the two provisions."
