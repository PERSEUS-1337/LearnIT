The average age of nurses is 43.3, and without intervention, the shortage will worsen as nurses retire. Increasing access to nursing education for nontraditional students can help combat the shortage and reduce the average age of nurses. Increasing awareness among elementary and secondary school students about nursing careers through nonprofit organizations can help recruit nontraditional nursing students, addressing the current nursing shortage and lowering the average age of nurses. A scholarship program is established for nontraditional nursing students. A scholarship program is established for nontraditional nursing students under the Public Health Service Act.

The term 'nontraditional nursing student' refers to individuals underrepresented in nursing, enrolled in accredited nursing schools. The Secretary limits scholarships for advanced degree programs to 25%. Contracts with nontraditional nursing students include a service requirement. Nontraditional nursing students must agree to serve at a healthcare facility with a nurse shortage for a minimum of 2 years full-time or part-time as approved by the Secretary. The obligated service for nontraditional nursing students will be extended to equal at least 2 years of full-time service.
