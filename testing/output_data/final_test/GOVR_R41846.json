    "content": "In 2008 and 2009, the global economic slowdown and credit market collapse led to a severe downturn in the production and sale of motor vehicles in the US and other industrial countries. This posed significant challenges for automakers, impacting the entire supply chain and leading to financial struggles for companies like GM and Chrysler, who had to seek federal assistance due to tightening credit conditions. GMAC and Chrysler Financial, the companies financing GM and Chrysler vehicles, also faced financial difficulties during this time. During the financial crisis of 2008, GMAC and Chrysler Financial, the auto financing companies for GM and Chrysler, suffered losses in the mortgage markets. This affected the ability of Old GM and Old Chrysler to recover from the slump as other sources of credit were also reluctant to lend. The George W. Bush Administration turned to the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) to provide assistance to automakers and financial firms, as Congress did not pass auto industry loan legislation. TARP was created to address the financial crisis by purchasing troubled assets from financial firms. The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) was used during the 2008 financial crisis to provide broad financial assistance to troubled financial firms, including automakers and finance companies. The assistance totaled over $80 billion and raised legal and operational questions. Financial assistance during the crisis was divided into helping solvent companies facing temporary difficulties and aiding deeply troubled firms whose failure could impact the broader financial system. GMAC, a large financial institution, received TARP assistance from the Auto Industry Financing Program, Federal Reserve, and FDIC programs. GMAC's solvency status was unclear, but it ultimately received significant assistance. Chrysler Financial received minor TARP assistance and repaid the loan quickly. GMAC received TARP assistance and converted into a bank holding company during the financial crisis. The government took a majority ownership stake in the company, which was later renamed Ally Financial. Ally Financial filed for an IPO in 2011 to unwind government involvement. The government's ability to recoup its assistance depended on the IPO share price. The government's ability to recoup its assistance for GMAC/Ally Financial was impacted by the delayed IPO in 2011 due to global market conditions. The IPO was completed in May 2014, reducing government ownership to 15.6%. GMAC's involvement in mortgage markets, particularly through ResCap subsidiaries, led to negative returns and future losses, affecting Ally's financial status. ResCap filed for bankruptcy in May 2012. Ally Financial's subsidiaries filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in May 2012, leading to a $1.3 billion charge. The TARP oversight authority expired during the 111th Congress, but oversight hearings continued in the 113th Congress. Auto financing companies play a crucial role in the industry, with over 90% of customers financing or leasing their vehicles. Car companies like GMAC and Ford Motor Credit have long offered financing and leasing options to consumers. During the banking crisis of 2008-2009, auto financing companies like GMAC, Chrysler Financial, Ford Motor Credit, and Toyota Motor Credit faced challenges in providing floor plan financing and retail financing. GMAC, established in 1919 by Old GM, expanded into offering various financial products but remained a subsidiary of Old GM. In 2006, GMAC was spun off into an independent company with Cerberus Capital Management purchasing 51% for $14 billion. GM retained a 49% share due to financial pressure. GMAC's credit rating was lowered to junk status, increasing its cost of financing GM vehicle sales. GMAC paid interest rates up to 5.4 percentage points above comparable Treasury securities on its debt. After being spun off in 2006, GMAC sold a controlling stake to Cerberus to lower credit costs. GMAC's mortgage operations suffered losses during the housing market downturn, with significant exposure as an investor and participant. GMAC held $135.1 billion in mortgage assets in 2006 and its ResCap subsidiary was a major player in the mortgage industry by 2008. GMAC was the sixth-largest mortgage originator and fifth-largest mortgage servicer in 2008, producing over $51 billion in mortgage-backed securities. The housing market downturn and declining automobile sales negatively impacted GMAC's core auto financing business. GMAC faced difficulties accessing capital markets for funding and applied for federal bank holding company status in November 2008 to receive government support. After facing challenges in the mortgage and auto financing business due to the housing market downturn, GMAC applied for federal bank holding company status in November 2008. The Federal Reserve approved the application in December 2008, leading to the transformation into a bank holding company named Ally Financial, Inc. In December 2013, Ally Financial was granted financial holding company status, allowing it to engage in a broader range of businesses. This approval came amidst increasing competition in consumer lending and dealer financing, as highlighted in a Government Accountability Office report. Ally Financial faces competition in consumer lending and dealer financing from Chrysler Capital, GM Financial, and other large bank holding companies. This competition may impact Ally Financial's future profitability and share price once it goes public. GMAC/Ally Financial provided financing for New GM and New Chrysler after government assistance and industry restructuring. However, GM's acquisition of AmeriCredit Corporation in 2010 led to the creation of General Motors Financial Company, a subsidiary now competing with Ally Financial. GM Financial also purchased Ally's international auto lending operations in 2013, significantly expanding GM's lending business. Ally Financial faces competition from GM Financial and Chrysler Capital in consumer lending and dealer financing. GM Financial doubled in size and now finances 80% of GM's sales worldwide. Chrysler Capital was established in 2013 with Banco Santander, ending Ally's exclusive agreements with Chrysler and GM. Ally Financial remains a major U.S. bank holding company with $149.2 billion in assets, offering dealer financial services including automotive finance and insurance. Ally Financial provides dealer financial services, including automotive finance and insurance, to 16,000 auto dealers and 4 million retail customers. In 2013, these operations had $116.4 billion in assets and generated $4.7 billion in total net revenue. Ally Financial's mortgage operations had $8.2 billion in assets and generated $76 million in total net revenue in 2013. Ally Bank, a subsidiary, raises deposits through various channels and offers consumer banking activities such as savings accounts, certificates of deposit, and interest-bearing checking accounts. Ally Financial's subsidiary, GMAC/Ally Financial, offers various deposit products including savings and money market accounts, certificates of deposit, interest-bearing checking accounts, and individual retirement accounts. By the end of 2013, it held $52.9 billion in deposits, with $43.2 billion coming from retail deposits. The company participated in the TARP Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) and received $96 million in servicer incentive payments. GMAC/Ally Financial faced criticism for documentation issues in foreclosure proceedings, resulting in a $230 million charge to its 2011 earnings. The company received government assistance during the financial crisis, including Federal Reserve lending facilities. The Federal Reserve provided emergency lending to GMAC/Ally Financial during the financial crisis through programs like the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) and the Term Auction Facility. The Dodd-Frank Act required the Fed to disclose details of its emergency lending, which included GMAC's $7.6 billion outstanding debt from the CPFF. This information was released in late 2010, but did not cover borrowing from non-emergency facilities like the discount window. GMAC/Ally Financial borrowed from the CPFF and TAF during the financial crisis. The FDIC created the TLGP to boost liquidity in the banking system, guaranteeing senior unsecured debt issued by banks. GMAC/Ally Financial issued $7.4 billion of debt under the TLGP in three tranches. In return for the guarantee, the FDIC received $393 million in fees. GMAC also applied for the TARP Capital Purchase Program in 2008. GMAC/Ally Financial received three rounds of assistance through TARP, totaling $16.73 billion. The assistance was provided through preferred equity purchases, with the Treasury receiving warrants for additional preferred equity. Holders of preferred equity have no voting rights but are entitled to dividends before common stockholders. GMAC/Ally Financial received indirect TARP assistance through an $884 million loan to Old GM. In early 2009, stress tests were conducted on large banks, including GMAC, to identify those needing additional capital. The Capital Assistance Program was not used except for GMAC, which received two rounds of assistance from the Auto Industry Financing Program. The government provided additional assistance to GMAC/Ally Financial through the Auto Industry Financing Program. This included converting loans and preferred shares into common equity, increasing federal ownership to 73.8%. Share dilution later reduced government ownership to 63.4%. Other major shareholders included the GM Trust, Cerberus Capital, and other investors. The government's ownership stake in GMAC/Ally Financial was reduced from 73.8% to 0% through share dilution and equity sales from 2013 to 2014. The U.S. Treasury recouped $14.7 billion of assistance principal and received $4.9 billion in dividends. TARP assistance was converted into common equity, representing an ownership stake in the company. The government's ownership stake in GMAC/Ally Financial was reduced from 73.8% to 0% through share dilution and equity sales from 2013 to 2014, recouping $14.7 billion of assistance principal and receiving $4.9 billion in dividends. TARP assistance was converted into common equity, with the government's ability to recoup assistance depending on the sale price of shares. Proceeds from TARP assistance were to be paid into the Treasury's general fund for debt reduction. The government's holdings of common equity in large TARP recipients varied. For Citigroup, $25 billion of TARP assistance was converted into approximately 34% equity, resulting in a capital gain of $6.9 billion. In the case of General Motors, $40 billion of loans was converted into 60.8% equity, leading to an $11.2 billion loss. AIG saw $49.1 billion of TARP preferred shares converted into common equity, with government holdings peaking at over 92%. The government's holdings in AIG were converted into common equity, peaking at over 92% due to TARP and Fed assistance. Sales of this equity were completed by December 2012, resulting in a $13.5 billion loss on the TARP portion offset by $17.6 billion recouped from Fed assistance. Additionally, the Treasury recorded $1.0 billion in income from the AIG assistance. Treasury's holdings in Chrysler and Ally Financial were also sold, with losses and income realized from these transactions. The government recouped $19.6 billion from the assistance provided to GMAC/Ally Financial, resulting in a $2.4 billion gain. However, this gain is not considered a \"profit\" as it does not account for factors like borrowing costs and risk premiums. If these factors were included, the economic gain would be lower."
