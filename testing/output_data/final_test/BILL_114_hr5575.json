    "content": "The Act is titled the \"First-Time Homebuyer Savings Account Act of 2016\" and introduces a new section in the Internal Revenue Code for First-Time Homebuyer Accounts. The \"First-Time Homebuyer Account\" is tax-exempt but subject to certain taxes. It is a trust created for paying qualified home purchase expenses in cash or rollover contributions. The trustee must ensure that contributions to the First-Time Homebuyer Account do not exceed certain limits: $14,000 for married individuals filing jointly, $50,000 for all taxable years, and the account's fair market value must not exceed $150,000. The trustee must also be a bank as defined in section 408(n). The trustee for the First-Time Homebuyer Account must be a bank or a person approved by the Secretary. Trust assets cannot be invested in life insurance contracts and must not be mixed with other property except in a common trust fund. Qualified principal residence purchase expenditures are defined for first-time homebuyers. The First-Time Homebuyer Account allows a beneficiary who is a first-time homebuyer to use funds for the purchase price of a residence. The purchase price is defined as the adjusted basis of the residence on the purchase date. Distributions from the account must not exceed the qualified principal residence purchase expenditures of the beneficiary for the taxable year. Distributions from the First-Time Homebuyer Account must not exceed the qualified principal residence purchase expenditures of the beneficiary for the taxable year. If distributions exceed expenditures, the excess amount is taxable income for the distributee. The tax on a taxpayer receiving a payment from a first-time homebuyer account will increase by a certain percentage of the amount included in gross income. The applicable percentage is 5 percent if the payment is made within 10 years of the first contribution to the account. The tax on payments or distributions is 10 percent, with exceptions for beneficiaries after death, disability, or similar rules to section 408(d)(4). The tax on payments or distributions from a first-time homebuyer account is 10 percent, with exceptions for beneficiaries after death, disability, or similar rules to section 408(d)(4). Rollovers and changes in beneficiary for first-time homebuyer accounts have specific rules outlined in subparagraphs (D) and (E). The tax treatment of a first-time homebuyer account includes rules for distributions, disallowance of excluded amounts for deductions, credits, or exclusions, estate and gift tax implications, and tax treatment after the account holder's death. Rules for rollovers and changes in beneficiaries are also outlined. In cases where a first-time homebuyer account is jointly held by spouses, if one spouse passes away and the surviving spouse becomes the designated beneficiary, the account is treated as if the surviving spouse were the sole account holder. If someone other than the surviving spouse inherits the account, it will cease to exist. The text chunk discusses the treatment of a first-time homebuyer account upon the death of the account holder. If the account holder passes away, the account will no longer be considered a first-time homebuyer account, and the fair market value of the assets in the account will be included in the gross income of the beneficiary or estate. The text defines a first-time homebuyer as an individual with no present ownership interest in a principal residence, including special rules for divorced individuals. The term 'designated beneficiary' refers to the individual designated at the start of a first-time homebuyer account to receive payments, while a 'principal residence' is defined as in section 121. In the case of amounts paid to the account or a change in beneficiaries, an account may only be owned by one individual with one designated beneficiary. Dollar amounts under subsection (b)(1) will be adjusted for cost-of-living after 2017. The taxable year begins in calendar year 2007 for adjustments in the tax code. Excess contributions to a first-time homebuyer account are addressed in the Code. Excess contributions to a first-time homebuyer account are defined as the amount exceeding contribution limits under section 530A(b). Any distributed contribution is treated as not contributed. A clerical amendment is made to the tax code. The amendments made by this section regarding the First-time homebuyer account will apply to taxable years beginning after the enactment of this Act."
