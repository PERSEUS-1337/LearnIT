The government has struggled to address these grievances, impacting U.S. policies on human rights and democracy in China. Efforts to promote civil society and the rule of law in China could help address these concerns in the long term. Efforts to promote civil society and the rule of law in China could help address social grievances and prevent social unrest. Social unrest may impact foreign investment, economic reforms, political stability, and Chinese foreign policy. Policy options for Congress include monitoring the situation and increasing assistance for local democracy and civil society. According to Chinese Communist Party sources, social unrest in China grew by nearly 50% from early 2004 through 2005, with 87,000 cases of \"public order disturbance\" reported in 2005 compared to 74,000 in 2004. In 2003, the PRC government cited over 58,000 \"major incidents of social unrest\" involving millions of people. The number of labor demonstrations in China reached 300,000 in a year, with a clash in December 2005 in Dongzhou village resulting in several deaths. Social unrest in China has alarmed the Communist Party leadership and influenced national government policies due to economic reforms creating a two-tier society. The economic reforms in China have led to millions of layoffs, labor abuses in Special Economic Zones, displacement of homes and farmland, and environmental degradation. Mass protests, often violent, have erupted among various affected groups due to lack of political resources and restrictions on forming independent unions. Protests are triggered by official unresponsiveness, corruption, violation of citizens' rights, and repressive tactics by authorities. Popular protests in China have been fueled by a growing awareness of legal rights and grievances over declining social services and rising taxes. Collective protest activities ranged from petitioning officials to violent outbursts, leading to tax reforms in 2002 that helped boost rural incomes by 15%-40% in some areas. The lack of property rights in China has led to governmental abuses at the local level, with a new kind of protest emerging over local development projects, land confiscation, and environmental degradation. A comprehensive bill on property rights was shelved in 2006, hindering the protection of rights for both private entrepreneurs and citizens. Chinese peasants have long term land-use contracts but not ownership rights. When land takings occur, farmers are only entitled to compensation based on agricultural output. Violent clashes between demonstrators and police have erupted in poor and rich regions, where development pressures are heavy. Recent protests in rural areas include clashes over inadequate compensation for farmland taken for industrial use in Guangdong province. In Guangdong province, a teenage girl was killed in a dispute over land taken for industrial use. A violent clash in Dongzhou village resulted in the deaths of 3-20 demonstrators. The conflict included protests, roadblocks, and arrests of protest leaders. In Zhejiang province, police beat villagers protesting pollution from a battery factory. In August 2005, unemployed residents of Daye, Hubei province, protested against the annexation of their city to a larger city, resulting in clashes with police. In September 2005, 10 individuals were sentenced to prison for their involvement in the protests. In July 2005, residents of Taishi village in Guangdong province petitioned to remove their corrupt village chief, leading to clashes with armed police. In September 2005, police seized documents from villagers alleging corruption and shut down a reporting website. In March 2006, protest leader Feng Quisheng lost an election bid due to alleged vote-buying. In July 2005, farmers in Xinchang attacked a pharmaceutical plant over pollution concerns. In June 2005, hired thugs attacked farmers protesting lack of compensation for land, resulting in deaths. In April 2005, 20,000 peasants in Huaxi township complained about their situation. In Huaxi township, Zhejiang province, villagers protested industrial pollution for four years, leading to factory closures and arrests of protest leaders. In Ya'an, Sichuan, over 10,000 farmers protested relocation due to a dam, resulting in deaths. Workers' protests are seen as more politically impactful than farmers' due to urbanization, education, entitlement, and communication access. Workers in China have a greater sense of entitlement and access to communication with various groups. The Chinese Communist Party suppresses efforts to form independent labor organizations. Labor protests have been common in older industrial cities due to unemployment and cuts in pay and benefits. Layoffs from state-owned enterprises have continued despite economic growth, with millions of factory workers losing their jobs. In 1999-2004, millions of factory workers lost their jobs in China, with another 6 million expected to be laid off in 2005-06. Labor demonstrations have targeted collusive agreements between factory managers, local officials, and investors profiting from privatization schemes at the expense of workers. China's official union, the ACFTU, has been a weak advocate for workers, lacking autonomy to oppose government policies and enforce labor regulations. In 2002, some of the largest labor protests in China occurred, including a display of organization by 30,000 workers in Liaoyang, Liaoning province. In Liaoyang, 30,000 workers from 20 factories protested unpaid wages, living allowances, pensions, government corruption, and arrests of labor activists. In Daqing, up to 50,000 oil workers protested layoffs. Labor activism in China's northeast has decreased since 2003, but Shaanxi province saw a seven-week strike in 2004. Workers in coastal Special Economic Zones, mostly young female migrants, faced abusive conditions but were reluctant to complain due to a desire to earn money to send home. In the Special Economic Zones (SEZs), factories are owned by investors from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea, supplying U.S. retailers. A labor shortage of 2 million workers has been reported, especially in Guangdong province. Government policies raising incomes in rural areas have made factory work less attractive. Workers are becoming more aware of their rights under the PRC Labor Law and are supported by Chinese lawyers and international campaigns for better working conditions. This has emboldened some workers in the Pearl River Delta area to fight for their interests. In Guangdong province, a major labor hub in China, there were 863 protests involving over 50,000 workers between January-October 2004. Some notable incidents include a riot at a shoe factory in Guangzhou over unpaid wages, a riot at a garment factory for higher pay, and a rampage at a shoe manufacturer's facilities. The Pearl River Region near Guangzhou saw 10-12 walkouts in 2004. This region has a large migrant worker population and is known for frequent labor disputes. The rise of protests in China involves home owners and peasants opposing eviction or loss of farmland due to economic development. Many citizens claim lack of consultation and compensation, leading to public demonstrations. Forcible evictions in Guangzhou constituted a significant portion of protests in 2003-2004. Urban residents in China have bought state-owned or newly-built apartments, with land-use rights retained by local governments or developers. Recent protests include a demonstration outside a Shanghai legislature meeting in August 2005. In August 2005, 100 people protested outside a Shanghai legislature meeting over housing disputes and land seizures. Homeowners in Guangzhou sued the government in 2003-2004 for unfair compensation and lack of consultation regarding the demolition of villas and relocation of farmers. Police forcibly evicted villagers in 2005, but officials promised to return some land to farmers in 2006. Tensions between central and local governments have hindered the PRC government's efforts to address social unrest. The central government in China has acknowledged legitimate grievances of citizens but has not implemented fundamental political reforms. Despite some corrections to local policies, the state retains the authority to decide which protests are acceptable. Limited institutions protect human rights, political power is not shared with social groups, judicial independence is lacking, and social conflicts remain unresolved. Small demonstrations are tolerated, but organizing and speaking to the media result in harassment and repression by authorities. Additional reforms were promised by the central government at the end of 2005. The central government in China acknowledged citizens' grievances but has not implemented fundamental political reforms. Additional reforms were promised at the end of 2005, including better land management, legal system strengthening, protecting farmers' land, raising rural incomes, and abolishing the national tax on farmers. Local officials may resist these reforms due to unchecked power and corruption tendencies. The government uses a carrot and stick approach to control social unrest, allowing demonstrations to grow before identifying leaders and making arrests. The Chinese government uses torture, rewards, and scare tactics to suppress protests. Despite strict media control, news of events in Dongzhou spread through the Internet. Chinese leaders have differing views on how to respond to protest activities. The Chinese government has differing views on responding to protest activities. One view emphasizes peaceful demonstrations as a legitimate way to express grievances and protect rights, while another view stresses fortifying police forces and cracking down on large public demonstrations. The escalation of protests has led some leaders to take a tougher line, especially in light of past \"color revolutions.\" The Dongzhou case in December 2005 resulted in varied government responses. The Beijing Review quoted intellectuals criticizing police methods, government policy, and corruption in China and Hong Kong. The Guangdong governor admitted mistakes by the police commander, acknowledged innocence of most protesters, and mentioned corruption among local officials. The shooting was attributed to a small group of criminals. The government promised to improve social services but did not address the disputed construction of a power plant. Analysts argue that the government's response of appeasing protesters and punishing organizers encourages civil disobedience. Many Chinese demonstrators believe causing disturbances is the only way to achieve solutions. Premier Wen's remarks in March 2006 on protecting the \"democratic rights\" of farmers boosted rural protesters' spirits in China. Social unrest in China is fueled by the widening income gap, official corruption, and lack of political power among citizens. China's high Gini coefficient reflects significant income inequality between rural and urban areas. The widening income gap in China, with average rural incomes less than one-third of urban incomes, has led to social instability. A riot in Chizhou, Anhui province in 2005 was sparked by resentment towards wealthy officials and entrepreneurs. This incident highlighted the growing discontent among the poor towards the affluent class. The development of China's legal system has led to social unrest, with protests stemming from legal actions and claims based on constitutional rights. In 2004, there was a significant increase in labor dispute cases, with petitions regarding land confiscation also on the rise. The legal reforms in China have led to social unrest, with protests arising from land confiscation cases and labor disputes. Despite the growing body of law, legal institutions often fail to prevent unrest, leading to delayed or fueled tensions. Claimants face obstacles in seeking redress, as lawyers encounter harassment and lack of judicial independence. Favorable decisions are often not enforced due to competing interests, pushing claimants towards protests as the only option. Demonstrations have become larger and more organized, with successful protests inspiring future actions. Protests in Guangdong have seen increased collaboration through technology. Notable movements have attracted support from new political activists. Some activists are aiming to spark more protests, especially in light of the 2008 Olympics. Following a shooting incident, political dissidents condemned the government's use of violence and called for democratic reforms. Regional and local press have been actively reporting on the protests. The recent social unrest in China lacks political goals and organizational strength, but has the potential to undermine the government. Unlike past movements led by urban intellectuals, it does not have a national chain of command like the Falun Gong demonstrations. Recent social unrest in China lacks political goals and organizational strength, primarily reflecting local economic grievances in urban and rural areas. Mass protests have increased in scope, size, frequency, and boldness compared to a decade ago, sparking a policy debate within the Communist Party on economic reforms. Traditional social factors have hindered the formation of a national protest movement, as workers and peasants lack organizational connections with other social groups like students and intellectuals. Many analysts argue that social activities in China are localized and lack broader forms of collective identity or solidarity. Workers and rural protesters tend to focus on resolving grievances within their own communities rather than forming national movements. Educated and middle-class Chinese have largely benefitted from the economy and have not been involved in recent demonstrations. Mass demonstrations in China have been growing in size and sophistication, with a small group of activists persisting in helping aggrieved groups. Growing income disparities, corruption, and lack of democratic institutions are fueling social unrest. The government has been successful at defusing conflicts, but analysts believe that social unrest is unlikely to evolve into a national political movement. The Chinese Communist leadership faces a dilemma in promoting economic growth to maintain legitimacy among the middle class and elites while addressing social unrest. President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao are preoccupied with rural unrest, and there is speculation that the government may incite nationalist fervor as a distraction. Some PRC officials downplay social unrest, emphasizing national perspective amid economic changes. Analysis suggests violent outcomes in protests are not common, with leadership and social group relationships key in political impact. Leaders acknowledge the need to address issues. Most PRC leaders agree on the need to address social unrest before it escalates and threatens their power. President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao have shifted towards redistributing national wealth to poorer regions and rural areas, moving away from capitalist reforms. Social unrest has not deterred foreign investment in China, with risk assessments remaining stable. However, analysts highlight social unrest as a significant risk factor for the country. Some analysts in China warn of social unrest's threat to the country's stability and relations with the US. Foreign investors may hesitate to move to smaller cities due to fears of unrest, and companies facing layoffs could encounter resistance. Experts suggest that long-term unrest and corruption may hinder China's economic growth compared to India's. US efforts to support protesters in China include verbal pressure, sanctions, and local initiatives. Policy options involve urging the Chinese government to respect protesters' rights and release activists from prison. On December 15, 2005, a bi-partisan group of U.S. congressional leaders expressed \"deep concern\" over a shooting incident in Dongzhou to the PRC Ambassador. Legislation was introduced to urge the PRC government to allow civil rights attorney Gao Zhisheng to practice law freely and remove obstacles for lawyers defending criminal cases in China. The US also restricts exports of crime control equipment that could be used in suppressing protests. The PRC government objects to foreign interference in domestic affairs and uses it as a pretext to repress protests. The US funds programs in China related to local elections, legal education, and labor rights. Legislation aims to promote freedom of Internet expression, especially in China. The Congressional-Executive Commission on China recommended promoting freedom of Internet expression worldwide, including in China. They urged the US government to encourage the PRC to address social unrest by ensuring free village elections, empowering citizens to enforce constitutional protections, making the judiciary independent, and removing restrictions on the news media and NGOs."
