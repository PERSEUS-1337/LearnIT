The \"Safe Aviation and Flight Enhancement Act\" acknowledges the need to improve the retrieval of critical flight data from commercial aircraft to enhance national security and passenger safety in the face of increased aviation challenges. The \"Safe Aviation and Flight Enhancement Act\" aims to improve the retrieval of critical flight data from commercial aircraft by implementing recommendations from the National Transportation Safety Board and deploying technology used by the United States Armed Forces to avoid unnecessary costs in locating and recovering black boxes. The technology used by the Navy since 1993 involves a recorder system that ejects from the aircraft during an accident to increase survivability and retrieval of critical data, reducing time and cost of investigations and search operations. This technology aims to avoid direct impact forces, wreckage entanglement, and fire intensity, floating indefinitely on water to aid in quick recovery. Incidents involving aircraft electrical supply interruptions or black box failures have been observed in recent air disasters. For example, the black boxes from American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 in the 9/11 attacks were not recovered. It took several days to recover the black boxes from American Airlines Flight 77, with the cockpit voice recorder being damaged beyond repair. (C) The cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder were recovered after 13 days from Egypt Air Flight 990, 9 days from Swiss Air Flight 111, and 15 days from Valuejet Flight 592. The cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder from TWA Flight 800 were recovered 7 days after the explosion, despite the airplane not hitting the water for another 40 to 50 seconds. The underwater locator beacon failed, causing a delay in recovery. SEC. 3. REGULATIONS REQUIRING DEPLOYABLE RECORDERS. The text chunk discusses the amendment to Chapter 447 of title 49, United States Code, requiring all commercial aircraft to be equipped with 2 combination cockpit voice and digital flight data recording systems. One system must be located near the cockpit, while the other should be a deployable recorder mounted at the rear of the airframe. The amendment to Chapter 447 of title 49, United States Code mandates commercial aircraft to have 2 recording systems. One near the cockpit powered by the electrical bus, and the other at the rear for maximum reliability. The cockpit system must record data parameters for 25 hours and cockpit audio for 2 hours, with an independent power source for 10 minutes of operation. The regulations mandate the installation of dual combined recorder systems on commercial aircraft ordered by air carriers after January 1, 2005. Commercial aircraft are defined as jet aircraft with 10 or more seats or a maximum takeoff weight greater than 12,500 pounds. The term 'deployable recorder system' refers to a combined unit housing digital flight data recorder, cockpit voice recorder, and emergency locator transmitter designed to eject from the aircraft upon accident, float on water, and fly away from the crash site. The Secretary of Transportation will provide fixed and deployable recorder systems to air carriers for compliance with regulations. Aircraft manufacturers will be reimbursed for costs related to developing and installing these systems."
