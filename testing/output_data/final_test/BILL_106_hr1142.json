Any obligation of the United States to make payments is subject to the availability of appropriations. The agency must provide 30 days notice to property owners before taking any Federal action on non-Federal property, explaining their rights and obtaining permission or providing compensation procedures. The Act preserves compensation rights under the Constitution and other laws, with federal authority limited to payment of compensation except when property is bought by the Federal Government.
