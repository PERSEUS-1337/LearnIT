This approach benefits from specialized wavelet filters and reduces the need for prior information about the signals. The Sparse Deep Scattering Crois\u00e9 Network (SDCSN) is an innovative architecture that enhances the Deep Scattering Network (DSN) by optimizing thresholding for over-complete filter banks. This strategy sparsifies the network's latent representation, distinguishing between activity and noise to increase scattering coefficients' variance and improve robustness against non-stationary noise. Our new approach, which outperforms the DSN on a bird detection task, focuses on developing robust algorithms for natural machine perception tasks. Traditional models based on signal processing tools like Fourier analysis have become obsolete with the rise of deep neural networks (DNNs). Despite DNNs providing state-of-the-art performance, issues like input-output mapping stability persist, leading to adversarial attacks. The DNN's lack of stability in input-output mapping leads to adversarial attacks and instabilities with non-stationary noise. Low SNR inputs or unbalanced classes further challenge DNN stability. Increasing training set size and network parameters can help but is costly. To address these issues, a new non-linearity based on continuous wavelet thresholding in the DSN improves stability and control. The DSN improves stability and control through wavelet thresholding. Combining diverse wavelet families enhances scattering coefficient variability, linearization capability, and reduces the need for expert knowledge in filter bank selection. The paper discusses related work, network architecture, thresholding method, and evaluation on the Freefield1010 audio scenes dataset. The appendix provides details on building the wavelets dictionary for the architecture. The Deep Scattering Network is extended with linear and non-linear operators. The network is stable and applied in a bird detection task. The Deep Scattering Network is stable and suitable for machine learning tasks as it removes spatiotemporal nuisances by building space/time-invariant features through the application of the scaling function. The translation invariant property is provided by the scaling function, leading to an exponential decay of the scattering coefficients. Two extensions of this architecture have been developed to capture frequency correlations and represent the transient. The scattering coefficient captures frequency correlations for harmonic sounds, utilizing wavelet thresholding for signal denoising. This approach is based on theories related to signal thresholding in the wavelet basis and evaluation of the best basis, incorporating statistical signal processing, information theory, and signal processing perspectives. However, there is currently no thresholding method developed for continuous wavelet transform. To address the lack of thresholding method for continuous wavelet transform, the Deep Crois\u00e9 Scattering Network (DCSN) extends Berkner's work on thresholding over-complete dictionaries. It utilizes multiple wavelet families with complementary properties to provide higher dimensional features and reduce the need for manual selection of wavelet filters, enhancing the learning capacity of downstream classifiers. The Deep Crois\u00e9 Scattering Network (DCSN) utilizes decomposition of filter-banks and a novel thresholding operator to build the SDSCN, providing new features based on wavelet dictionary reconstruction risk. This method ensures stability of input-output mapping, sparse latent representations for learning decision boundaries, and characterization of time-frequency components. Combining scattering features enhances the linearization capacity of DSN. The Sparse Deep Crois\u00e9 Network introduces a locally adaptive thresholding method for sparsity, including a Deep Crois\u00e9 Scattering Network with multiple wavelet families and optimal non-orthogonal thresholding for overcomplete dictionaries. The network is a tree architecture based on the Deep Scattering Network, with a 3D tensor replacing the first layer of a scattering transform. The standard scalogram is replaced with a 3D tensor in the Sparse Deep Crois\u00e9 Network, incorporating multiple wavelet families for inter and intra wavelet decompositions. The network utilizes a tree architecture with wavelet configurations for filter-banks derived from mother wavelets. The filter-banks in the Sparse Deep Crois\u00e9 Network are derived from mother wavelets through scaling of resolution coefficients. The filter layer output, denoted as U(1), is a 3D tensor with shape (B(1), J(1) Q(1), N). The convolution operation between the filter-banks and U(1) is defined, leading to the introduction of cross family representations in the second layer. The second layer introduces cross family representations with a 5D tensor and scattering coefficients defined as S with a scaling function \u03c6 for symmetries invariances. The extended framework introduces thresholding over complete basis for cases where the quality factor, Q, is greater than 1, leading to increased frequency precision. Sparsity in the latent representation of connectivists models is essential for simpler models and improved generalization performances. The extended framework introduces thresholding over complete basis for cases where the quality factor, Q, is greater than 1, leading to increased frequency precision. Dhillon et al. propose to extend standard wavelet thresholding techniques for non-orthogonal filter-banks to handle non-stationary noise in large scale configurations. Their approach aims to minimize reconstruction error in the wavelet domain through analytical thresholding based on input representation and filter-bank redundancy. The L2 approximation errors between the original basis and the over-complete wavelet basis do not satisfy Parseval equality. Berknet et al. proposed using the Moore pseudo inverse for reconstruction. An upper bound for the ideal risk is developed, providing an explicit equation for the thresholding operator adaptable to any over-complete transformation. The observed signal y is corrupted with white noise, denoted as y = x+ where x is the signal of interest. The matrix W consists of wavelets at each time and scale, and W\u2020 is the generalized inverse. The generalized inverse is used to calculate the ideal risk, which is dependent on all possible pairs in the frequency axis due to correlation in filter banks. An upper bound for the optimal risk is proposed, denoted as R up, with error terms for selected and unselected coefficients. Evaluating this upper bound involves assuming an orthogonal basis and comparing it with the optimal risk in the orthogonal case. Assuming an orthogonal filter matrix, the upper bound ideal risk aligns with the orthogonal ideal. The ideal risk is calculated using the generalized inverse, dependent on all frequency pairs in filter banks. An upper bound, R up, is proposed with error terms for selected and unselected coefficients. When assuming an orthogonal filter matrix, the upper bound ideal risk aligns with the orthogonal ideal. In real applications, an empirical risk is proposed as a version of the ideal risk, comparing it in extreme cases to show its relationship with the upper bound ideal risk. The text discusses the propagation of noise in risk expression and the risk minimization process using a thresholding operator. It also mentions the importance of risk in optimal thresholding optimization. Illustrations show the effect of the thresholding operator at each layer of the network. The text discusses the optimal thresholding optimization and the concept of empirical risk in signal reconstruction. It emphasizes the importance of using the optimal empirical risk as part of the features characterizing the input signal. Visualizations in Fig. 3 show samples from the dataset with different acoustic scenes, highlighting the consistency of risk-based analysis with specific wavelet selections. The Paul family wavelet is known for transient characterization, while the Morlet wavelet is optimal for natural sounds like bird songs and music. The method and contributions lead to a significant performance increase, validated on a large-scale audio dataset using scattering coefficients fed into a random forest for binary classification of bird presence. Evaluation is done via the Area Under Curve metric on a subset of the data. The evaluation is done using the Area Under Curve metric on 33% of the data, with experiments repeated 50 times. The dataset contains over 11 hours of audio recordings, 10\u00d7 larger than CIFAR10 in terms of scalar values. Results show that both SDCSN and DCSN outperform DSN by at least 20% accuracy, demonstrating the enhancement of scattering feature. The architecture parameters include J1 = 5, Q1 = 8, J2 = 4, Q2 = 1. High frequency content in bird songs requires high resolution, with thresholding applied per window of 2^16 representing \u2248 1.5sec. The impact of denoising on different dataset sizes can be analyzed. The impact of denoising on dataset sizes is analyzed in Fig. 4a, showing that denoising becomes necessary as the dataset size decreases. A priori denoising is crucial for small-scale datasets, while infinite data with a high-capacity classifier can adjust hyperplanes without denoising. Additionally, experiments demonstrate the need for denoising in practical applications due to varying noise levels between training and testing sets. Performance significantly degrades when testing on raw data after training on denoised data. The need for a thresholding non-linearity to enhance robustness in Scattering networks is empirically demonstrated. Visualizing sparsity induced by the thresholding technique is proposed, showing improved performance and linearization capacities. An extension of the scattering network allows leveraging multiple wavelet families simultaneously for better cross-family representations. The experimental demonstration of an optimal overcomplete basis thresholding technique for improved performance in scattering networks is highlighted. The ability to perform active denoising is crucial for stability and consistent results, especially in large-scale settings. Potential extensions include adapting the technique to convolutional neural networks. Possible extensions include adapting the technique to convolutional neural networks for robustness against adversarial attacks. Using a joint scattering and DNN can benefit inner layers, and consistent best basis selection can be achieved with an optimized ReLU based thresholding. The concept of building a deep crois\u00e9 scattering network is introduced with a focus on continuous wavelet transform. Wavelets are functions used in high resolution seismology and developed theoretically by Meyer et al. They can be discrete or continuous, with continuous wavelets providing a more complete tool for signal analysis. To perform a time-frequency transform, a filter bank is built based on the mother wavelet, which is dilated and translated to create filters. Wavelets are used in high resolution seismology and are created based on a mother wavelet that is dilated and translated to form filters. Wavelets have a constant-Q property, with high-frequency wavelets being more localized in time. The dilation parameters follow a geometric progression, with integers J and Q representing the number of octaves and wavelets per octave. A systematic approach for developing a filter bank for any wavelet family involves a weighted version of the geometric progression. The implementation of a wavelet filter bank requires careful selection of the mother wavelet's center frequency to avoid artifacts or redundant information. In section A.3, a principled approach is proposed for computing the filter bank of any continuous wavelet using a geometric progression ensemble. The dilated version of the mother wavelet is computed in the Fourier domain for efficiency. Children wavelets inherit properties from the mother wavelet, ensuring coverage of all frequency support in the filter bank creation. The Morlet wavelet is a complex wavelet built by modulating a complex exponential and a Gaussian window. It is important for analyzing diverse signals due to its properties such as bandwidth and center frequency. Different mother wavelets can be selected among continuous wavelets, each with unique characteristics. The wavelet function captures low frequency contents and is known as the scaling function. A filter bank covering all frequency support is created using a block matrix W, where each block corresponds to filters at different scales for a given time. The Morlet wavelet is defined by its center frequency \u03c9 0 in the frequency domain. The parameter \u03c9 0 controls the center frequency of the wavelet, and can be adjusted to vary the support of the Morlet wavelet. The wavelet is optimal from the uncertainty principle perspective, and different versions can be defined by varying \u03c9 0. The uncertainty principle relates to the joint time-frequency resolution of wavelets, such as the Gammatone wavelet, which is widely used for biological signals. The Gammatone wavelet, a complex-valued wavelet, is derived from the real-valued Gammatone auditory filter and is effective for acoustic scene classification. The Gammatone wavelet, defined by Lostanlen & And\u00e9n, allows for explicit scaling while meeting admissibility criteria. The wavelet's parameters, including center frequency and bandwidth, can be manually selected for filter bank design. The asymmetric envelope of the Gammatone wavelet is not time-invariant, making it relevant to the auditory response system. The Gammatone wavelet is not time-invariant due to its asymmetric envelope, making it suitable for sound classifications. It is efficient and near optimal with respect to the uncertainty principle. The Paul wavelet, on the other hand, is complex-valued and highly localized in time, making it ideal for transient detection. The Paul wavelet is a powerful tool for transient detection, with clear formulations for capturing irregular variations in winds and sea surface temperatures. It represents phase gradients and can be used for optical phase evaluation. Different wavelet families are defined and their properties developed, leading to the creation of a filter bank using these wavelets. The filter bank is obtained using wavelets in the Fourier domain, chosen for efficiency and geometric progression scales. A mother wavelet is selected to create the filter bank from the scales. If signals are real-valued, information in [-\u03c0, 0] and [0, \u03c0] is the same with a symmetric atom. Complex-valued wavelets are considered. The mother wavelet is selected based on the type of wavelet being used, either complex-valued or real-valued. For complex-valued wavelets, the support is in [0, \u03c0], while for real-valued wavelets, the support is in [\u2212\u03c0, 0]. The position of the mother wavelet is determined by finding \u03b1 such that \u03bb 0 = \u03b1 * 2 0/Q, ensuring it avoids capturing elements after the Nyquist frequency and prevents the spectral mirror effect. The wavelet filter banks are generated based on the value of \u03b1 for a wavelet family, ensuring admissibility criteria are met by verifying zero-mean and square norm one wavelets. This is achieved by setting the wavelet to be null around \u03c9 = 0 and re-normalizing in the frequency domain of each atom. The wavelet coefficients are divided into selected (U) and unselected (S) sets, with I = D U + D S. This estimate involves thresholding in the new basis and the inverse transform of the truncated representation."
