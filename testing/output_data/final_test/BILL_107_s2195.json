The Congress finds that significant funding is needed for education infrastructure in the United States, with billions required for repairs, renovations, and modernizations. Around 14 million students attend schools in need of extensive building repairs, impacting student achievement. Researchers at Georgetown University found that students in poor school conditions fall behind by 10.9 percentage points compared to those in excellent buildings. Moving students to new facilities can lead to a 20 percent improvement in test scores. The Government Accounting Office reported that 52 percent of schools lack sufficient technology, affecting 21.3 million students. Many educational agencies struggle to secure funding for school facility improvements. The challenges facing public schools and libraries in the US are significant. The state of collections in America's public school libraries has increased demands on public libraries, with many substituting for school libraries. Research shows that a child's intellectual development is crucial before age 4, highlighting the critical role of public and school libraries in education. Public and school libraries are crucial for a child's early development by providing a wealth of books and resources for a head start in life and learning. The State Infrastructure Bank Pilot Program is outlined in Section 3. The Secretary of Education may enter into cooperative agreements with States to establish State infrastructure banks for providing loans to local educational agencies and public libraries for building or repairing schools and libraries. Congress grants consent to states to establish multistate infrastructure banks through interstate compacts, with the right to alter or repeal the section. Repayments on infrastructure bank loans go towards principal and interest. The State establishing an infrastructure bank must contribute at least 25% of the capitalization grant from non-Federal sources, appoint an operating entity to manage loan funds, allow funds to be used as reserves for debt issued by the State, and ensure investment income is used for loan purposes. The infrastructure bank must ensure that investment income is used for loan purposes, loans bear interest at or below the lowest rates offered for tax-exempt bonds, and repayment terms are in place for any loans provided. The infrastructure bank must ensure timely repayment of loans, with a maximum term of 30 years after the first payment, and provide regular reports to the Secretary. The bank can offer loans to educational agencies or libraries for eligible projects. The infrastructure bank requires timely loan repayment within 30 years and provides reports to the Secretary. Educational agencies or libraries can apply for loans for renovation projects, detailing deficiencies and corrective actions needed. The infrastructure bank must review loan applications within 90 days of submission. Applications should include details on improvements, cost estimates, energy conservation impact, and any other required information. The local educational agency or public library seeking a loan must demonstrate fiscal need, safety concerns for students, facility condition, and facility age for proposed projects. Qualifying Projects for a loan from an infrastructure bank include construction of new schools, repair or upgrading of classrooms, increasing physical safety, and enhancing access for students and teachers. The curr_chunk discusses activities to improve environmental hazards, infrastructure for educational technology, and bringing facilities into compliance with environmental and safety regulations. The curr_chunk outlines various types of work eligible for funding, including improving energy efficiency, addressing asbestos hazards in educational facilities, and constructing or upgrading public library facilities. The Davis-Bacon Act wage requirements apply to individuals employed on these projects. The infrastructure bank loans must supplement, not replace, other funds for school or library construction. Repayments cannot count towards project costs, and the Secretary will establish guidelines for the bank. Federal funds contributed to the bank do not create obligations for the United States. The infrastructure bank established under this section does not create any commitment, guarantee, or obligation on the part of the United States to third parties. Federal funds contributed to the bank are not subject to certain management regulations. States can use a small portion of grant funds for infrastructure bank administration costs. The Secretary is required to conduct a review and report on the infrastructure bank. The Secretary is mandated to review the financial condition of each infrastructure bank established under this section and submit a report to Congress within 90 days of completing the review. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions include terms like elementary school, free public education, local educational agency, secondary school, outlying area (referring to specific territories), and public library (defined as a library serving residents with public funding). The curr_chunk discusses the criteria for a research library to qualify for public funds, emphasizing free services, extensive collections, dissemination of knowledge, and independence from other institutions. The term \"State\" refers to each of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and outlying areas."
