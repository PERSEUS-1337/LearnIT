    "content": "The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA) allows the Secretary of the Treasury to use funds to restore stability to the US financial system. The act initially authorizes up to $250 billion, which can increase to $350 billion with presidential certification. Congress has a 15-day period to disapprove any request for funds exceeding $350 billion. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 allows the Secretary of the Treasury to use funds to stabilize the US financial system. Congress has a 15-day period to disapprove any request for funds exceeding $350 billion, with special \"fast track\" procedures in place for congressional consideration. If no disapproval resolution is enacted, the Secretary's authority automatically increases to $700 billion. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 allows Congress a 15-day period to disapprove the Secretary of the Treasury's request for funds exceeding $350 billion. Special \"fast track\" procedures expedite congressional consideration, bypassing usual legislative obstacles. If no resolution is enacted, the Secretary's authority automatically increases to $700 billion. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 allows Congress a 15-day period to disapprove the Secretary of the Treasury's request for funds exceeding $350 billion. The Senate majority leader, after consultation with the minority leader, is to notify Senators if the Senate has adjourned for more than two days. The adjournment resolution grants leaders discretionary authority to recall chambers in emergencies. EESA mandates Congress reconvening even if chambers do not wish to disapprove the plan. Joint resolutions under EESA do not contain a preamble and must disapprove obligations under the Act. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 mandates Congress to disapprove any amount exceeding the specified limits. The statute specifies the text of the joint resolution to prevent unrelated measures from being expedited. Members have a narrow window to introduce a qualifying joint resolution of disapproval under EESA. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 requires Congress to disapprove any amount exceeding specified limits. A joint disapproval resolution must be introduced within three days of receiving the President's report on the Secretary's plan. Members may have only one day to introduce a qualifying resolution due to recall provisions. The referral process for a resolution introduced in the House is not specified in the EESA. Under EESA, a joint resolution introduced in the Senate is placed directly on the Senate Calendar of Business without being referred to committee, requiring unanimous consent for referral. Congress generally does not mandate referral of bills to committee, except in certain circumstances. The EESA expedited procedure requires a committee of referral to act on legislation within five days, or the measure is placed directly on the calendar. This prevents long delays or inaction by a legislative committee on a joint resolution of disapproval. The statute is silent on whether a committee may amend the resolution. The EESA expedited procedure for joint resolutions of disapproval limits the ability to amend the resolution, as specified by the act. Committee amendments and floor amendments are precluded, with the option for a House committee to report favorably, adversely, or without recommendation. After committee action, a non-debatable motion can be made for consideration within six days. The House modified this process with the adoption of H.Res. 62 on January 15, 2009. The House changed the procedure for motions to proceed under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 with the adoption of H.Res. 62 on January 15, 2009. The motion can be made by the House Majority Leader or designee, can be offered until January 22, 2009, cannot be repeated, and the vote cannot be reconsidered. In the Senate, the motion to proceed to the consideration of a joint resolution of disapproval under EESA is not debatable or amendable and cannot be postponed. In the Senate, a motion to proceed on a joint resolution is allowed after the President's report is received, and once agreed upon, the chamber immediately considers the resolution without delay. The House typically debates measures under specific time limits, such as the one-hour rule or suspension of the rules procedure. EESA limits debate time for House and Senate consideration of joint resolution of disapproval. House debate limited to 2 hours, divided between proponent and opponent. Senate debate limited to 10 hours, divided between majority and minority leaders. Senate can further limit debate time with a non-debatable motion. The Senate can reduce debate time below 10 hours with a majority vote. EESA provisions make it difficult to delay or set aside the joint resolution without a vote. Amendments to the resolution are not allowed in either chamber. In the House, all points of order are waived, and the vote is automatic after debate. In the Senate, motions to postpone or reconsider the vote are not allowed after debate. The EESA includes provisions for the voting process on joint resolutions, with a focus on avoiding delays and facilitating the exchange of legislation between the House and Senate. Amendments are not allowed, and the resolution is automatically voted on after debate in the House, while in the Senate, motions to postpone or reconsider the vote are not permitted. The EESA includes provisions to expedite consideration of joint resolutions of disapproval, allowing for \"fast track\" consideration if one chamber fails to act. If the Senate passes a joint resolution, a companion measure from the House is not debatable. The EESA also disregards certain periods in computing the 15-day period before an increase in authorization goes into effect if a joint resolution is passed or vetoed by the President. The EESA includes provisions to expedite consideration of joint resolutions of disapproval, allowing for \"fast track\" consideration if one chamber fails to act. The President's veto can't delay the 15-day time clock for Congress to receive the veto message. Debate on a veto message in the Senate is limited to one hour. A joint resolution must pass both chambers and be signed by the President or enacted over his veto by supermajority vote to disapprove the Treasury Secretary's plan. Some Members argue that resolutions of disapproval put Congress at a disadvantage compared to the Executive, as the President is likely to veto them, requiring significant supermajorities for an override. This power dynamic allows as few as 34 Senators, along with the Chief Executive, to block the will of Congress. Some argue that resolutions of disapproval give the President flexibility while allowing Congress to influence policy. Expedited procedures like EESA can be altered by a majority of Members in either chamber, as each chamber has the power to determine its rules. The House can make changes to expedited procedures through special rules, suspension of rules, or unanimous consent. The House altered the expedited procedure in January 2009. Expedited procedures are more binding on the Senate, which operates under terms achieved by unanimous consent. Changing an established rule in the Senate would likely require 3/5ths of Senators' approval. An established rulemaking statute would likely require either 3/5ths of Senators or two-thirds present and voting to invoke cloture or suspend the rules. On January 12, 2009, the President transmitted a report to Congress detailing a plan to access additional EESA funds. The table below estimates deadlines for introducing and considering a joint resolution of disapproval under the EESA. Dates are estimates calculated by CRS. The House and Senate Parliamentarians are the definitive authorities on questions regarding chamber rules, including deadlines under the EESA. Consult them for formal opinions on specific questions."
