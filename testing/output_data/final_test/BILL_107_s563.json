    "content": "The Act may be cited as \"The Social Security Reporting Information and Right to Know Act of 2001\". The Social Security Advisory Board, Panel, and Chief Actuary are commended for their work on projecting the future financial operations of the social security program. The Panel recommended changes in 1999 that would increase estimates of the program's unfunded obligations. The Panel recommended using standards of comparison for program sustainability and evaluating reform proposals based on their impact on the Federal budget and funding shortfalls. Other recommendations included addressing workforce participation, elderly poverty rates, and equity investment returns to develop a fiscally responsible reform solution. The Panel recommended evaluating reform proposals based on their impact on the Federal budget and funding shortfalls, addressing workforce participation, elderly poverty rates, and equity investment returns to develop a fiscally responsible reform solution. Expansion of Social Security Account Statement. The amendment to the Social Security Act includes a statement about the program's cash flow deficits starting in 2015 and the need for general tax revenues to finance benefits. The Social Security Trust Fund has claims on future Government resources to cover deficits through 2037, with revenues sufficient to pay 72% of benefits thereafter. The Trust Fund balances are not real economic assets but claims on the United States Treasury that will need to be financed through taxes or borrowing in the future. The Social Security Trust Fund balances do not impact the government's ability to pay benefits, as they will need to be financed through taxes or borrowing in the future. The amendments made by the Act will apply to statements provided after its enactment date. SEC. 4. EXPANSION OF ANNUAL REPORT OF THE TRUSTEES OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUNDS. The amendment to the Social Security Act requires the annual report to include clear information on when Trust Funds' outlays will exceed their income based on the Chief Actuary's findings. The annual report must include the projected annual outlays exceeding the annual cash income of the Trust Funds, excluding intragovernmental transfers and interest income. It also requires the aggregate amount of excesses over a 75-year period and the change from the previous year's report. The annual report must include the projected deficit or surplus in the old-age, survivor, and disability insurance program for the last year of the 75-year projection period. It should also mention the aggregate assets and unfunded obligations in the Trust Funds for that final projected year. Additionally, it should state the necessary increase in payroll taxes or reduction in benefits to maintain financial balance after the Trust Funds are depleted. The annual report must include how the program can stay in financial balance by raising payroll taxes or reducing benefits if delayed for 5, 10, 25, and 50 years. It should also explain the nature of the Trust Funds and their role in financing future benefit payments. The Social Security Trust Fund balances are not real economic assets but claims on the United States Treasury. When redeemed, they will need to be financed through taxes, borrowing, or benefit reductions. The Trust Fund balances do not impact the government's ability to pay benefits. The annual report must present information in nominal dollars, inflation-adjusted dollars, and present discounted value. The Board of Trustees must publish the economic model and relevant data used for financial projections in the Social Security report annually. Any changes to the model and data in the past 12 months must be included. A separate report to Congress with the same information must be submitted by April 1st each year starting in 2002. The amendments made by this section will apply to reports after the enactment of this Act. The Social Security Act is amended to require an annual report to Congress by the Commissioner of Social Security. The Commissioner, along with other key officials, must submit an annual report to Congress on projections and financing shortfalls of the old-age, survivors, and disability insurance program. The Board of Trustees projects that tax revenues from the program will be less than program outlays. The report should include benefit levels, tax rates, effects on national savings, and estimates of benefits for different cohorts. The amendment made by subsection (a) applies to reports for calendar years after the enactment of the Act, detailing benefit levels, tax rates, and estimates for different cohorts. Sense of Congress regarding Social Security reform legislation. Congress and the President should enact comprehensive bipartisan social security reform legislation that ensures 75-year actuarial solvency and addresses issues like program sustainability, fiscal impact, reduction of unfunded obligations, solvency under different assumptions, and comparison of retirement income provided. The proposed reform aims to address benefit reductions or tax increases in the social security program, based on estimates from the Board of Trustees. It also considers the long-term impact on workforce participation, elderly poverty, national savings, and other identified issues. Congress believes that the recommendations of the Panel should be implemented as deemed reasonable by the Board of Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, in consultation with relevant agencies and offices."
