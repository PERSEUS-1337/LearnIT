    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Private Security Officer Employment Enhancement Act of 2006\". Congress acknowledges the need for enhanced security in the United States post-9/11 attacks, leading to increased cooperation between government agencies and the private sector to protect key assets and the populace. President Bush emphasized the importance of assessing vulnerabilities and providing additional security measures in a 2003 report. The 2003 report recognized that terrorists will likely continue to target critical infrastructures owned by the private sector. As a result, the use of private security companies to guard key assets and protect the populace has significantly increased since 9/11. Businesses have also ramped up their security efforts and dedicated more internal employees to securing their facilities. The hiring and placement decisions of companies providing security services in the United States have become critical as they determine who will protect key assets and have access to them. Businesses are also improving their internal security measures and seeking more information about their security personnel. Therefore, companies need an efficient, nationwide criminal background checking system that is technologically advanced. Private security companies and businesses providing their own security require access to the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) for evaluating the criminal history of their internal security employees. This access, currently available to industries like banking and nuclear power, is essential for making safe and effective hiring decisions. By partnering with Federal, State, and local governments, these companies can contribute to the protection of the United States. The Department of Homeland Security, in collaboration with the Department of Justice, is designated to manage NCIC criminal history records for the protection of the United States. Improved criminal history records search for employment of covered private security officers. Section 6402 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 is amended to require the Secretary to provide NCIC criminal history records checks for covered employees upon request by covered employers. This includes submitting fingerprints electronically for the check. The Attorney General shall provide NCIC criminal history records checks for covered employees to assist the Secretary. The Secretary may establish a fee for conducting these checks. Covered employers are prohibited from employing covered employees for security services without a successful NCIC check. Covered employers must obtain NCIC criminal history records checks for covered employees before employing them for security services. The checks should not reveal any unpardoned felony convictions or specific offenses involving firearms or dangerous weapons. The list of offenses includes making or possessing burglary tools, buying stolen property, unlawful entry of a building, aiding prison escape, illegal drug possession, theft, and reckless endangerment. The list of offenses for covered employees includes making threats of terror, committing violence against individuals or property, attempting or conspiring to commit offenses, and any other relevant offense specified by the Secretary. The section defines a security service as guarding, protecting, or supervising assets or personnel of the employer or customers. Delayed applicability for current employees is also mentioned. The Employment Enhancement Act of 2006 allows covered employers to hire security service employees without the prohibition for six months after the effective date or a later date specified by the Secretary. Covered employers are not liable for good faith determinations regarding employee offenses. The Employment Enhancement Act of 2006 allows covered employers to make employment decisions based on criminal history records checks, with exceptions for lawful reasons not described in the act. The Employment Enhancement Act of 2006 permits covered employers to conduct criminal history records checks on employees with written consent required. The Fair Credit Reporting Act does not apply to NCIC criminal history records checks. The Employment Enhancement Act of 2006 allows covered employers to request NCIC criminal history records checks on employees with certain limitations. The Secretary must ensure accuracy and completeness of the results, and employees have the opportunity to provide feedback within 30 days. Covered employers are responsible for managing the records received. Covered employers must maintain confidentiality, avoid misuse or dissemination of criminal history check results, and destroy the results within one year of the employment decision. The results from a criminal history records check must be destroyed within one year of receiving the results or one year after the final disposition of a related claim or proceeding. The results cannot be destroyed while a claim or proceeding is pending. The Department of Homeland Security will establish procedures for using this information. The Secretary will establish procedures for using criminal history records checks to determine the suitability of covered employees for employment in the private security field. Regulations will be prescribed to carry out this section, and criminal penalties will apply to those who misuse the information obtained. For purposes of determining suitability for employment in the private security field, individuals who misuse criminal history records checks shall face imprisonment or fines as per Title 18, US Code. Covered employees are defined as those not active law enforcement officers, working for or seeking employment with security service providers, or as internal security employees in entities with over 50 employees and at least three internal security employees. The term 'covered employer' refers to nongovernmental entities providing security services, licensed to do so in each jurisdiction they operate, including interstate or foreign commerce and sites with Federal Government presence. The curr_chunk describes the criteria for a nongovernmental entity to be considered a covered employer, including having more than 50 employees with internal security personnel, being licensed to provide security services in each jurisdiction they operate, and being engaged in interstate or foreign commerce or providing services to the Federal Government. The curr_chunk defines terms such as internal security employee, NCIC criminal history records check, Secretary, and State for the purpose of the legislation. The amendment made by section 3 will be effective as of the date of enactment and will apply to employment decisions by covered employers for covered employees starting 180 days after the enactment of the Act."
