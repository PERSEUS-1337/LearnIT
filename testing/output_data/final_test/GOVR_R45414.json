This initiative stemmed from state bills over the previous five years and sought to eliminate government interference in medical choices. The effort involved highlighting individual cases, such as a seven-year-old boy with cancer in March 2014. The FDA had not approved an experimental drug that could help a boy with cancer. The manufacturer declined to provide the drug for compassionate use. The Goldwater Institute pushed for the right to try legislation, framing it as a matter of individual freedom. The Goldwater Institute, a libertarian think tank, promoted model legislation for the right to try experimental treatments for patients with advanced illnesses. 33 states enacted laws based on this model bill. In January 2017, legislators introduced the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017 to address the issue. The Right to Try Act of 2017, signed into law by President Trump, aimed to remove FDA obstacles for patient access to experimental drugs. The act discusses the FDA's expanded access program, provisions to ease access barriers, unresolved questions, and broader implications. A manufacturer must obtain FDA approval before selling a drug in the US, which involves submitting data from clinical trials to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. The process starts with an investigational new drug (IND) application, followed by three phases of clinical trials. Phase I trials test safety in human volunteers after demonstrating safety in animals. Phase I clinical trials aim to determine dosing, metabolism, and acute side effects of a drug. If successful, Phase II and Phase III trials follow to assess effectiveness and plan large-scale testing. FDA approval is required for drug distribution in the US, either through a new drug application or authorization for clinical trials under an IND. The FDA allows access to unapproved drugs or approved drugs for unapproved uses through mechanisms like expanded access or compassionate use. This allows individuals outside of sponsor-run clinical trials to obtain investigational drugs when they are unable to enroll in a trial due to specific criteria or trial limitations. The FDA's expanded access procedure allows individuals to request access to investigational drugs if there are no alternative therapies available and the risks are deemed acceptable. The FDA must determine the drug's safety and effectiveness for the individual and ensure it won't interfere with clinical trials. The FDA's expanded access procedure allows individuals to request access to investigational drugs when no alternative therapies are available. The sponsor or clinical investigator submits a clinical protocol to the FDA for approval. The requesting physician is considered the investigator and must comply with informed consent and IRB review. The manufacturer may charge for the drug, but only for direct costs. Expanded access can be used outside of clinical trials in certain situations. The FDA's expanded access procedure allows individuals to request access to investigational drugs when no alternative therapies are available. It can be used in situations such as when a drug has been withdrawn for safety reasons, during a drug shortage, or when availability is limited by a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy. The manufacturer's agreement to provide the drug is crucial as the FDA cannot compel them to participate. Many publicized accounts of individuals' struggles with life-threatening conditions and activism have influenced the debate over access to experimental drugs. The Goldwater Institute circulated a model bill in 2014. Public attitudes varied, with some finding the FDA's treatment IND process cumbersome and questioning the agency's role as a gatekeeper. Critics believe solutions lie with the FDA or pharmaceutical companies. Key obstacles and issues, both FDA- and manufacturer-related, are discussed, including whether the FDA's procedures discourage patients and physicians from seeking treatment INDs. In response to challenges with the FDA application process for individual patient expanded access, the FDA issued draft guidance in 2015, finalized in 2016. A new form was developed to streamline the process, reducing the information required from physicians by referencing the sponsor's submitted data. Emergency access for patients can be authorized by FDA over the phone or email, with a requirement for submission of an IND or protocol within 15 days. This was part of discussions leading up to the RTT Act, with an independent report commissioned by FDA on its expanded access program.

Emergency access for patients can be authorized by FDA over the phone or email, with a requirement for submission of an IND or protocol within 15 days. Preceding the RTT Act, FDA commissioned an independent report on its expanded access program. In November 2018, the commissioner announced actions to improve the program, including an enhanced webpage and an agency-wide Expanded Access Coordinating Committee. FDA has also established a work group and a Right to Try webpage for the new investigational drug access pathway. By January 2018, 39 states had passed right to try laws. Right-to-try laws allow terminally ill patients access to investigational drugs that have completed Phase I testing and are in an FDA-approved clinical trial. State laws address obstacles such as insurance coverage and physician liability. Experts have suggested improvements to the laws regarding informed consent and liability issues. Several experts suggest that state right-to-try laws may not directly increase patient access to investigational drugs. The federal RTT Act, which requires FDA approval, may preempt state laws. FDA granted 99.5% of expanded access requests from FY2010 to FY2017. Before the RTT Act, bills were introduced in Congress to allow seriously ill patients access to experimental treatments. The federal and state right-to-try laws aim to allow seriously ill patients access to experimental drugs without FDA permission after passing Phase 1 trials. However, manufacturers can still refuse to provide the drug, considering factors like profit and resource limitations. Companies must consider various factors such as supply of the drug, liability, safety, and potential impact on FDA approval when deciding on drug distribution. Manufacturers often start with small amounts for early clinical trials and only invest in large-scale production after FDA approval is likely. Redirecting manufacturing capacity involves financial, logistic, and public relations considerations. Redirecting manufacturing capacity involves financial, logistic, and public relations decisions. Some manufacturers have raised liability concerns regarding expanded access to investigational products. State right-to-try laws aim to protect manufacturers and clinicians from liability. Congress may need to intervene to address these concerns. Setting up a compassionate use program could divert focus from completing clinical trials. Setting up a compassionate use program could divert focus from completing clinical trials and launching a product into the market. One CEO denied expanded access, citing equity issues and the need to maintain ethical standards. Distributing the drug outside a clinical trial could hinder data collection for FDA approval. Clinical trials may exclude very ill subjects to analyze adverse events related to the drug. Patients seeking drugs under a right-to-try pathway are likely to be seriously ill, posing scientific and public relations challenges for manufacturers. Manufacturers may choose not to provide drugs outside of clinical trials to avoid these risks. The number of people denied access to experimental drugs is unclear. The number of individuals denied access to experimental drugs is unclear, making it challenging to address manufacturer-based obstacles. Manufacturers do not disclose the number of requests they receive, but reports suggest it exceeds successful requests submitted to the FDA. Various bills have been introduced in Congress to improve patient access to investigational drugs, with different approaches such as removing the FDA from the process or requiring manufacturers to publicize their compassionate use policies. In December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act added a new Section 561A to the FFDCA, requiring manufacturers to make their compassionate use policies publicly available. In August 2017, the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 amended the date for posting expanded access policies. The FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 amended the date for posting expanded access policies and required various actions related to clinical trial criteria and IRB review for individual patient expanded access protocols. Senator Johnson introduced the Trickett Wendler Right to Try Act of 2017, which was passed by the Senate with a substantial amendment. The Trickett Wendler Right to Try Act of 2017, introduced by Senator Johnson, was passed by the Senate with a substantial amendment. Representative Fitzpatrick later introduced a related bill, H.R. 5247, which became the Right to Try Act of 2018. The bill passed in the House and was signed into law by the President on May 30, 2018. This Act adds a new section to the FFDCA allowing for the use of investigational drugs by eligible patients with limited liability for entities providing the drugs. The new FFDCA Section 561B allows eligible patients to access investigational drugs with limited liability for providers. It operates independently from the FDA's expanded access program, defining eligibility criteria for patients and investigational drugs. The new FFDCA Section 561B allows eligible patients to access investigational drugs with limited liability for providers. It exempts certain drugs from FDA approval requirements and prohibits the Secretary from using clinical outcome data to delay drug review unless critical. The new FFDCA Section 561B allows eligible patients to access investigational drugs with limited liability for providers. It exempts certain drugs from FDA approval requirements and prohibits the Secretary from using clinical outcome data to delay drug review unless critical. The act requires sponsors to submit annual summaries to the Secretary and mandates the posting of an annual summary on the FDA website regarding the use of clinical outcomes in drug reviews. The RTT Act provides limited liability for providers allowing eligible patients to access investigational drugs. It exempts certain drugs from FDA approval requirements and defines eligibility as a person with a life-threatening disease or condition. Congress could consider provisions in the RTT Act for implementation oversight. The RTT Act defines eligibility as a person with a life-threatening disease or condition, which differs from state laws and FDA preferences. Supporters argue that the Act could allow people with chronic conditions to take extreme risks with experimental drugs. Manufacturers may see an increase in requests under the Act. If Congress revisits the RTT Act, they may consider clarifying the definition of informed consent for patients and manufacturers. The Act currently requires written informed consent from eligible patients before receiving an investigational drug, but lacks a specific definition. This could weaken patient protections provided by the FDA's expanded use policy. The Act also appears to eliminate the requirement for IRB review of investigational drug use. Congress may aim to establish a more explicit informed consent requirement and outside oversight to reduce patient risks. The Right to Try Act may need clarification on informed consent and oversight to reduce patient risks. The Act aims to protect drug sponsors by prohibiting the use of clinical outcome data to delay drug approval. The Right to Try Act prohibits the use of clinical outcome data to delay drug approval, but allows FDA to use the data if it is critical for determining the drug's safety. Drug sponsors must report serious adverse events annually, not immediately as required for approved and investigational drugs. The Right to Try Act allows FDA to use clinical outcome data if critical for safety determination, but prohibits its use to delay drug approval. Drug sponsors must report serious adverse events annually, or immediately if serious and unexpected. Clustering of reports could signal FDA to explore further. If Congress revisits the RTT Act, stakeholders could discuss ways to make data available for drug development while protecting manufacturers' interests and access for seriously ill patients. Manufacturers can charge patients for investigational drugs, but only for direct costs, not for profit or development costs. Insurers have not confirmed coverage for these drugs. Manufacturers see liability costs as an obstacle to providing investigational drugs to patients under the Right to Try Act, which includes a no-liability provision. Congress may need to examine whether patients could lose coverage for palliative or hospice care due to receiving potentially curative treatments. The Right to Try Act includes liability protections for manufacturers, but concerns remain about the extent of this protection. Patients may test these protections in court, prompting potential Congressional action. Congress could assess the impact of the Act on FDA, manufacturers, and patients by monitoring patient access to investigational drugs and the associated costs. The Right to Try Act includes liability protections for manufacturers, but concerns remain about the extent of this protection. Congress could assess the impact of the Act on FDA, manufacturers, and patients by monitoring patient access to investigational drugs and the associated costs. Congress could also determine whether the law has achieved its intended effects and address obstacles to access to investigational drugs. The Right to Try Act raises questions about its impact on the FDA, with concerns about the agency's role in implementing a law meant to remove its authority. Former FDA commissioners warn that the Act could set a dangerous precedent, potentially eroding protections for vulnerable patients. Congress may need to address the balance between helping patients and maintaining the FDA's ability to protect public health. The Right to Try Act raises concerns about its impact on the FDA, with worries about eroding protections for patients. The Act acknowledges limitations in creating new cures but emphasizes expanding patient autonomy."
