    "content": "The \"Safe and Complete Streets Act of 2008\" may be cited as the short title for this legislation. Congress acknowledges the need for better transportation options beyond automobiles, such as public transit, biking, and walking. Many State and local agencies have not prioritized these modes of transportation, leading to limited success in promoting sustainable choices. Additionally, new streets in developing areas often lack safe and equitable access for all users. The Federal Highway Administration's design guidance highlights the negative impact on bicycling and walking due to the current highway environment. A significant portion of the population, including seniors and individuals with disabilities, are unable or choose not to drive. This emphasizes the importance of providing safe and accessible transportation options beyond automobiles. Improving road network integration of all modes will increase capacity, reduce congestion, clean the air, and enhance quality of life. Accommodating nonmotorized users will enhance safety for pedestrians and cyclists. Enhancements will also allow more disabled individuals to access standard transit services, reducing the economic burden on transit systems. Public health officials advocate for more bicycle and pedestrian facilities to combat obesity. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 supports complete streets policy implementation. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Transportation. \"Complete streets\" are roadways designed to accommodate all travelers, including public transit users, bicyclists, pedestrians of all ages and abilities, and motorists. \"Complete streets policy\" and \"complete streets principles\" ensure that transportation laws and policies at various levels prioritize the safety and efficiency of all users. The term \"senior manager\" in this Act refers to the director of a State department of transportation or a designee, the director of a metropolitan planning organization or a designee. The term \"senior manager\" in this Act refers to the director of a State department of transportation, the director of a metropolitan planning organization, or the director of a regional or county transportation agency responsible for planning and approval of transportation projects. SEC. 4. COMPLETE STREETS POLICY REQUIREMENT. Beginning two years after the enactment of this Act, each State and metropolitan planning organization must have a law or policy in place requiring transportation projects to accommodate the safety and convenience of all users according to complete streets principles. The law or policy described in subsection (a) mandates that federally funded transportation projects must make roads accessible to all users, including pedestrians, bicyclists, transit vehicles, and motorists. It applies to new road construction, improvements, resurfacing projects, and outlines procedures for implementation. The law mandates that transportation projects must comply with complete streets principles, including exemptions with approval and documentation, up-to-date design standards for accessibility, fitting projects within the community context, and implementing performance standards for adherence. Exemptions from complete streets policy are allowed only under specific conditions, such as when affected roadways prohibit certain users, when compliance costs are excessively high compared to need, or when population and transit service levels are low. Project-specific exemptions must be approved accordingly. Project-specific exemptions from complete streets policy must be approved by a senior manager of the relevant transportation authority, whether it be the metropolitan planning organization, State department of transportation, or regional/county agency. Metropolitan planning organizations implementing a complete streets policy must integrate complete streets principles into all stages of transportation project development. This includes project identification, scoping procedures, design approvals, manuals, and performance measures. Each State must ensure that agencies overseeing transportation projects certify compliance with complete streets principles. Recertification is required annually until project completion. Additionally, accessibility standards are outlined in section 6. SEC. 6. ACCESSIBILITY STANDARDS. The United States Access Board must issue final standards for accessibility of new construction and alterations of pedestrian facilities for public rights-of-way within 12 months of the enactment of this Act. Until then, existing Department of Transportation Standards for Accessible Transportation Facilities apply, with the 2005 Revised Draft Guidelines for Accessible Public Rights-of-Way as a reference. SEC. 7. TECHNICAL GUIDANCE. The Secretary must provide a report on best practices for implementing complete streets principles to all State and local transportation agencies within 2 years of this Act. The report will focus on identifying user needs, facility designs, benefits, and barriers to implementation. Common barriers to implementing complete streets principles include procedures for overcoming these barriers, identifying costs, maximizing local cooperation, and assessing existing roadways for improvements."
