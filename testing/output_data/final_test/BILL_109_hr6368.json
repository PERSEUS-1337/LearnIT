    "content": "The Act titled \"Study of Ways to Improve the Accuracy of the Collection of Federal Oil, Condensate, and Natural Gas Royalties Act of 2006\" aims to study actions to enhance the precision of collecting federal oil, condensate, and natural gas royalties. The Secretary of the Interior will collaborate with the National Academy of Engineering to study and report on improving the accuracy of collecting royalties on oil, condensate, and natural gas production from Federal and Indian lands. This may involve installing digital meters for gas production and inspecting orifice plates on gas wells regularly. Requiring regular inspections of orifice plates and immediate replacement of faulty plates for accurate volume measurement and royalty payments. Mandating the removal of plug valves in natural gas gathering lines and their replacement with ball valves. All meter runs must be open for inspection at all times, with welding or closing prohibited without authorization. Installation of straightening vanes is also required. Requiring regular inspections of orifice plates and immediate replacement of faulty plates for accurate volume measurement. Mandating the installation of straightening vanes before natural gas enters each orifice meter. All master meters must be inspected and results made available to the Secretary and producers. Monthly sampling of natural gas for heating content analysis upstream of each meter is required, with records maintained and probes installed within three feet of each meter. Oil and natural gas leases must comply with heat regulations. The regulations require accurate volume measurement by inspecting orifice plates and installing straightening vanes. Monthly sampling of natural gas for heat content analysis is mandatory, with probes located near each meter. Oil and natural gas leases found with falsified heat content analysis may be canceled. Additionally, temperature and testing probes must be positioned between the natural gas sampling probe and the meter. The reinstatement of filing FERC Form 16 twice a year for natural gas pipelines is also required. The regulations require accurate volume measurement and monthly sampling of natural gas for heat content analysis. FERC Form 16 must be filed twice a year for natural gas pipelines. Administrative jurisdiction over natural gas pipelines reverts to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Dilution of natural gas with inert gases is prohibited for royalty determination. The regulations mandate accurate volume measurement and heat content analysis of natural gas at 14.72 PSI and 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Bypass pipes around gas meters are prohibited, with criminal penalties for violations. Natural gas sold to consumers must have a minimum BTU content of 960 at 14.73 PSI and 60 degrees Fahrenheit. The State of Wyoming Public Utilities Commission mandates accurate volume measurement and heat content analysis of natural gas. All natural gas sold in the USA must be on a MMBTU basis with BTU content adjusted for elevation. Rules for measuring standard volume of natural gas at the wellhead are based on industry standards like ASTM. The use of the fundamental orifice meter mass flow equation is required for calculating standard volume. Fpv must be used in standard volume measurement computations as per the 1992 American Gas guidelines. The State of Wyoming mandates accurate volume measurement and heat content analysis of natural gas based on industry standards. Gathering lines must have minimal angles, royalties must be based on independent market value, and paid on all condensate. Requiring royalties on all condensate recovered through purging gathering lines and pipelines, as well as from separators, dehydrators, and processing plants. Eliminating royalty deductions for various charges on natural gas, condensate, and oil. Mandating reporting of quantity, quality, and value of natural gas liquids to the Secretary based on fair market value. Requiring full royalties on vented or flared natural gas, payment of royalties on carbon dioxide for oil recovery, and production of carbon dioxide from Federal lands. Requiring analysis of carbon dioxide for benzene content and safe removal, royalties on nitrogen and helium extraction, and limiting elemental value to 5 percent. Requiring analysis of natural gas heating content to C<INF>15</INF>, eliminating artificial conversion from dry BTU to wet BTU, and mandating the use of natural gas filters with a minimum of 10 microns. Requiring the use of 10-15 micron filters in natural gas sampling containers and chromatographs, calibration every three months with AGA-approved containers, and selling stored natural gas based on purchase price minus storage charges. Requiring royalties on stored natural gas, penalties for nonpayment, specific location requirements for equipment, and BTU heating content analysis at specific temperatures. Requiring heating content analysis and volume measurements to match at sales and purchase points, with no allowance for discrepancies. Gas must be sold on a MMBTU basis and specific gravity verified to correspond with analysis data. Prohibiting deductions on royalty payments for marketing of natural gas, condensate, and oil by an affiliate or agent. Requiring adherence to industry standards and orders, with willful misconduct subject to lease cancellation. SEC. 3. REVIEW OF ROYALTY PAYMENTS. The Secretary of the Interior will award a contract to compare royalty payments for Federal oil and gas leases against data provided to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, retroactively from June 1, 1974. The contractor will analyze production volume and heating content to ensure accurate payments were made. The Secretary of the Interior will award a contract to compare royalty payments for Federal oil and gas leases against data provided to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, retroactively from June 1, 1974. The contractor will analyze production volume and heating content to ensure accurate payments were made, including determining if payments were adequate by comparing reported royalty values with respected market price reports like Platts or Bloombergs. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines \"covered lands\" as Federal onshore and offshore lands under the Department of the Interior's jurisdiction for oil and gas leasing, including Indian lands. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior."
