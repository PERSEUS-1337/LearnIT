    "content": "The \"Police and Fire Station Modernization Act of 2008\" is cited as the short title. It introduces qualified tax credit bonds for police and fire departments under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Police and Fire Station Modernization Act of 2008\" introduces qualified tax credit bonds for police and fire departments. Taxpayers holding these bonds on credit allowance dates can receive a credit against their tax equal to 25% of the annual credit determined based on the bond's face amount and applicable credit rate. The applicable credit rate is determined by the Secretary to allow the issuance of qualified tax credit bonds without discount or interest cost. A special rule applies for bonds issued within a 3-month period ending on a credit allowance date, where the credit amount is prorated based on the portion of the period. The credit allowed for taxable years is limited by the amount of tax, with any excess credit carried over to the following year. The credit allowed for taxable years can be carried over to the succeeding taxable year and added to the credit allowable for that year. A qualified tax credit bond is defined as a police and fire department bond meeting specific requirements. The issuer must spend project proceeds for qualified purposes within a 3-year period from the date of issuance. A binding commitment to spend at least 10 percent of the proceeds within 6 months is required. If less than 100 percent of the proceeds are spent within the timeframe, the issuer must redeem all remaining proceeds. The issuer must spend project proceeds for qualified purposes within a 3-year period from the date of issuance. If less than 100 percent of the proceeds are spent within the timeframe, the issuer shall redeem all nonqualified bonds within 90 days after the end of such period. The amount required to be redeemed shall be determined in the same manner as under section 142. The Secretary may extend the expenditure period if the issuer shows a valid reason for not spending the proceeds within the original timeframe. Qualified purposes are those specified in section 54B(a)(1). The available project proceeds of an issue can be treated as spent for a qualified purpose if used to reimburse the issuer for amounts paid after the Secretary's allocation of bond limitation. The issuer must declare intent to reimburse the expenditure with the bond proceeds before payment and adopt an official intent within 60 days after the original expenditure. The issuer of qualified tax credit bonds must reimburse expenditures with bond proceeds within 18 months. Reporting requirements are similar to those under section 149(e). Special rules apply to meeting requirements related to arbitrage and investments during the expenditure period. Special rules apply to meeting requirements related to investments during the expenditure period, including not failing to meet requirements by investing project proceeds or reserve funds in a specific manner. The maturity of bonds in an issue must not exceed the maximum term set by the Secretary, and the yield on a fund should not be higher than the discount rate determined for the issue. The present value of the obligation to repay the principal on the bond is determined using a discount rate based on the average annual interest rate of tax-exempt obligations with a term of 10 years or more. The term is rounded to the next highest whole year if not a multiple of a whole year. The term \"credit allowance date\" includes specific dates and the last day the bond is outstanding. The term 'bond' includes any obligation, and 'State' includes the District of Columbia and any possession of the United States. 'Available project proceeds' refer to the excess proceeds from the sale of an issue, minus issuance costs not exceeding 2 percent, and proceeds from investments of the excess. The credit determined under subsection (a) is treated as interest for purposes of this subtitle. The credit determined under subsection (a) is treated as interest for tax purposes. S Corporations and Partnerships holding tax credit bonds allocate the credit to shareholders as a distribution. Bonds held by Regulated Investment Companies and Real Estate Investment Trusts allow the credit to be distributed to shareholders or beneficiaries. The Secretary may prescribe procedures for this distribution. Credits may be stripped according to regulations. Credits for qualified tax credit bonds may be separated from ownership, with the credit going to the holder of the entitlement instrument. Rules similar to stripped bonds apply in such cases. This section does not apply to bonds issued after December 31, 2014. \"SEC. 54B. POLICE AND FIRE DEPARTMENT BONDS.\" Police and fire department bonds are defined as bonds issued for capital expenditures by a State or local government for police or fire departments. The maximum aggregate face amount of bonds designated by any issuer is limited, with a national limitation set at $3,000,000,000. The national police and fire department bond limitation is $3,000,000,000. The allocation of this limitation among states is based on their population, with additional allocations to large local governments based on their population compared to the state. Unused limitations are allocated back to the state. The allocation of funds to large local governments with a population of 500,000 or more can be reallocated to the state. Population for state and local governments is determined based on specific guidelines. The population of a county is not included in determining the population of a municipality that is a large local government. Reporting requirements for interest payments on qualified tax credit bonds are specified in the code. The code specifies reporting requirements for interest payments on qualified tax credit bonds. Regulations may be prescribed by the Secretary to carry out these purposes, including more frequent or detailed reporting. Conforming amendments are made to various sections of the Code by adding references to subpart I. The code is amended to include references to subpart I in reporting requirements for interest payments on qualified tax credit bonds. The amendments made by this section apply to obligations issued after December 31, 2008. Certain labor standards apply to projects financed with the proceeds of any tax credit bond."
