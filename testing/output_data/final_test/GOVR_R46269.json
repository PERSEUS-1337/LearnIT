    "content": "The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) is the main federal aid source for elementary and secondary education, with Title I-A being the largest program funded at $15.9 billion for FY2019. It provides supplementary services to low-achieving students in schools with high numbers of low-income families. The U.S. Department of Education determines grants to local educational agencies based on four funding formulas. This report details FY2019 state grant amounts under each formula. Under Title I-A, funds are allocated to LEAs via state educational agencies (SEAs) using four formulas: Basic Grants, Concentration Grants, Targeted Grants, and EFIG. In FY2019, 41% of funds were allocated through Basic Grants, 9% through Concentration Grants, and 25% each through Targeted Grants and EFIG. Once funds reach LEAs, amounts allocated under the formulas are combined and used jointly. Maximum grants are calculated based on a \"formula child count.\" The Title I-A program allocates funds to LEAs through four formulas: Basic Grants, Concentration Grants, Targeted Grants, and EFIG. Grants are determined by a \"formula child count\" and expenditure factors, with maximum grants adjusted based on available appropriations. LEAs must meet minimum criteria to be eligible for grants under specific formulas. In FY2019, Title I-A grants were calculated at the LEA level and then adjusted for state minimum grant provisions. State grants were allocated to all LEAs in the state. California received the largest total Title I-A grant amount of $2.0 billion in FY2019. California received the largest total Title I-A grant amount of $2.0 billion, representing 12.52% of all Title I-A grants. Vermont received the smallest grant amount of $36.9 million, accounting for 0.24% of the grants. Grant amounts vary among states due to different allocation formulas, with the Basic Grant formula generally receiving a larger share than the Concentration Grant formula. Factors such as population size impact grant amounts, with Texas receiving more funding than North Carolina due to a larger population of children included in the calculations. California received the largest Title I-A grant amount of $2.0 billion, while Vermont received the smallest grant amount of $36.9 million. Grant amounts vary among states due to different allocation formulas, with some formulas favoring certain states. For example, Texas received more funding than North Carolina due to a larger population of children included in the calculations. States like South Dakota, Texas, Vermont, and Wyoming received a higher percentage share of Targeted Grants compared to overall Title I-A funds, indicating the Targeted Grant formula is more favorable to them. In states that received minimum grants under all formulas, the shares under Targeted Grant and EFIG formulas are greater due to higher state minimums. If a state received the minimum grant under a Title I-A formula, it is denoted with an asterisk in Table 1."
