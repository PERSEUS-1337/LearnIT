    "content": "The U.S. Supreme Court will address whether a ne exeat right is considered a \"right of custody\" under the Hague Convention, which could impact international child custody disputes. The Fifth Circuit ruled that a ne exeat right is not a \"right of custody,\" leading to a circuit split on the issue. The Hague Convention on International Child Abduction protects children from wrongful removal across borders, but has limitations in nonsignatory nations. It facilitates the return of abducted children to their habitual residence for custody disputes to be adjudicated. The Hague Convention on International Child Abduction facilitates the return of wrongfully abducted children to their habitual residence for custody disputes to be resolved. Federal courts have jurisdiction over cases involving the Hague Convention, with procedures and remedies varying based on the parental rights infringed. The Hague Convention on International Child Abduction defines wrongful removal as breaching custody rights and requires the return of the child only if a parent's custody rights have been violated. Rights of custody include determining the child's residence, while rights of access involve taking the child for a limited period elsewhere. Parents deprived of access rights have a less robust remedy under Article 21. The Abbott family resided in Chile, where the parents separated, leading to court orders regarding custody rights. A ne exeat order was issued, preventing either parent from taking the child out of Chile without the other's consent. This order was central to the Abbott case, where the father claimed a violation of his custody rights under the Hague Convention. In August 2005, the mother removed the child to Texas without the father's consent, violating the ne exeat order and Chilean statutory law. The District Court in Texas ruled that the father did not have rights of custody under the Hague Convention, as his visitation rights were considered rights of access only. The court clarified that ne exeat rights do not fall under the definition of \"rights of custody\" in the Hague Convention. It emphasized that these rights do not involve decisions related to the care of the child, but rather pertain specifically to determining the child's place of residence. The court also highlighted the distinction between custody rights and access rights, stating that ne exeat rights do not grant authority over child-rearing issues beyond geographic location. The court concluded that ne exeat rights are not considered \"rights of custody\" under the Hague Convention. This decision was affirmed by the Fifth Circuit, citing a previous case where the Second Circuit ruled similarly. The Croll court conducted an extensive analysis to determine that ne exeat rights do not constitute \"rights of custody\" under the Hague Convention. They based their conclusion on the text of the Convention, its drafting history, and practical considerations. The court defined custody as the primary duty and ability to provide for a child's needs, concluding that the father's ne exeat rights do not grant him a primary role in his son's upbringing, therefore not constituting custody rights. The majority in the Croll court case argued that ne exeat rights do not qualify as \"rights of custody\" under the Hague Convention. They emphasized that custody involves a bundle of rights related to the care of the child, which ne exeat rights do not encompass. The court also highlighted that the right to determine a child's place of residence is a prominent example of a custody right. The court argued that the \"determine\" clause in Article 5(a) must refer to a specific place of residence within a country to be considered a right of custody. Decisional rights involve more specific choices than just determining the country of residence, such as city, suburb, or countryside. The word \"determine\" signifies the power to choose an outcome, not just the right to veto it. The court established the meaning of ne exeat rights by referencing dictionaries and Article 3. It found that the rights must be actually exercised at the time of removal for it to be considered wrongful. The majority argued that an alternative interpretation would make the Hague Convention unworkable. The court ruled that if the child is ordered to return to the home country based on a breach of ne exeat rights, Mrs. Croll would not be obligated to return with the child. Mr. Croll only has ne exeat rights, not primary care duties. The majority cited extratextual material, including a scholarly article, to support their interpretation that ne exeat rights do not constitute custody rights under the Hague Convention. The Hague Convention distinguishes between custody rights and access rights, with Judge Sotomayor arguing that \"rights of custody\" include ne exeat rights to prevent forum-shopping parents from flouting custody laws. The Hague Convention aims to ensure custody disputes are resolved in the home country to prevent lax enforcement. Judge Sotomayor argued that ne exeat rights are part of custody rights to prevent forum-shopping parents. The dissent criticized the majority for not considering the international aspect of the Convention in determining where the child will live. Judge Sotomayor disagreed with the majority's view that interpreting a ne exeat right as custody would make the Hague Convention unworkable. She argued that parental duties can arise from various sources, not just a custody order. She also questioned the fear of parents abandoning their children at airports. Most foreign courts, including the House of Lords, interpret ne exeat rights as custody rights. The Furnes court, like Judge Sotomayor in a previous case, interpreted a ne exeat right as a right of custody, emphasizing the importance of determining the child's place of residence in cases of international abduction. They argued that a ne exeat right includes the right to decide where the child lives, even down to a specific city or house. The court analyzed the ne exeat right as a right relating to the care and determination of the child's place of residence. Arguments in the Supreme Court focused on the definition of \"custody\" and whether a ne exeat right includes the ability to determine the child's specific living quarters. Mr. Abbott argued that the ne exeat right includes the ability to determine the child's \"place of residence\" internationally, allowing control over important upbringing decisions. Mrs. Abbott argued that a ne exeat right is a power of the state, not a parent, meant to preserve the state's ability to enforce the law, citing historical and theoretical underpinnings. She pointed out that the United States has codified this conception in statute. Mrs. Abbott argued that a ne exeat violation frustrates the state's jurisdiction, not a private right, citing conflicting opinions from international courts. Mr. Abbott countered with opinions from nine foreign courts supporting his interpretation. The Supreme Court will decide if the Hague Convention mandates the return of a child taken to the US in violation of a ne exeat order. Other issues surrounding the treaty's interpretation by foreign courts may arise, potentially leading to amendments in custody laws in various signatory countries. The Hague Convention may lead to amendments in custody laws in signatory countries, addressing custody rights and noncompliance issues."
