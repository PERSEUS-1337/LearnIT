Section 251A of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is amended to include considerations for reductions achieved under the authority of the Social Security Act. OMB is authorized to determine fund reductions for fiscal years 2013 through 2021 to meet deficit reduction targets. For fiscal years 2013 through 2021, OMB will allocate funds to discretionary appropriations and direct spending accounts in defense and nondefense functions. OMB will submit a report to Congress detailing fund reductions, and the President will order a sequestration.

Joint resolutions introduced in the House or Senate must be referred to the respective Budget Committees and cannot be reported before the 8th day after introduction. If a committee does not report a joint resolution within 15 days of its introduction, the committee is discharged from further consideration. The joint resolution is then placed on the House calendar. Once a joint resolution is reported or deemed discharged by the committee, any Member can move to proceed with it. The motion to proceed with the joint resolution is highly privileged in the House of Representatives and privileged in the Senate. It is not debatable, subject to amendment, or postponement. A motion to reconsider the vote on the motion is not allowed. If agreed to, the resolution remains unfinished business until disposed of. Debate on the joint resolution is limited to 10 hours, divided equally between those in favor and those opposing. Further debate limitations are in order and not debatable. Amendments, postponements, or reconsiderations of the vote are not allowed. The final vote on passage follows immediately. The final vote on passage of a joint resolution follows immediately after a 10-hour debate, with limited debate time for each side and no allowance for amendments, postponements, or reconsiderations. Appeals on procedural rulings are decided without debate, and coordination with the other house is required before passage.

The rulemaking power of the Senate and House of Representatives allows for the establishment of rules for joint resolutions, which are deemed part of each House's rules but only apply to that House's procedures for joint resolutions. The constitutional right of each House to change its rules regarding procedures is also recognized.
