    "content": "Through its investigative powers, Congress gathers necessary information to oversee existing laws or evaluate the need for new ones. This \"power of inquiry\" is crucial for the legislative function and is derived from the Constitution. Congress often seeks information from the executive branch, which may not always comply fully. The Supreme Court has recognized the need for compulsion when necessary to obtain required information. Congress can use a subpoena to compel compliance with demands when traditional negotiation fails. Compliance is legally required unless a valid privilege or justification exists. Without enforcement mechanisms, a subpoena becomes a mere request. Currently, Congress uses various methods to combat non-compliance with subpoenas. Congress can combat non-compliance with subpoenas through criminal contempt or civil enforcement. Criminal contempt allows for prosecution of individuals who refuse to comply, while civil enforcement seeks a court judgment for compliance. These methods are rarely used, as committees often obtain information through voluntary requests. Congress can use various forms of legislative leverage, including controlling agency authority, funding, and confirmation of executive officers, to obtain information from the executive branch. This can encourage compliance with subpoenas and strengthen Congress's position during investigative disputes. Recent controversies have raised concerns about the adequacy of existing mechanisms for congressional access to information from the executive branch. The House of Representatives has held executive branch officials in contempt for refusing to comply with subpoenas, but enforcement has been challenging. In some cases, the House has turned to federal courts for civil enforcement of subpoenas. The House of Representatives has faced challenges in enforcing subpoenas against executive branch officials, leading to prolonged litigation. Controversy arose over the use of criminal contempt and civil enforcement, with officials citing constitutional privilege. This report does not assess the validity of the privilege or Congress's use of contempt power, focusing instead on the legal enforcement of congressional subpoenas. This report examines the legal enforcement of congressional subpoenas, focusing on criminal contempt and civil enforcement mechanisms. The criminal contempt statute makes non-compliance a criminal offense, punishable by fines and imprisonment. Congress relies on these mechanisms to obtain information from the executive branch. The criminal contempt statute allows for the prosecution of non-compliant witnesses with fines and imprisonment for up to one year. The process involves referring the case to the Department of Justice, where the U.S. Attorney is directed to bring the matter before a grand jury. Approval from the committee's parent body may be necessary for the contempt citation. The criminal contempt statute allows for prosecution of non-compliant witnesses with fines and imprisonment. The executive branch retains discretion to determine whether to submit the violation to a grand jury. A successful contempt prosecution may result in incarceration or a fine. The use of criminal contempt is mainly as a deterrent. Congress may enforce a subpoena through civil enforcement in federal courts. The Senate can enforce a subpoena through civil enforcement in federal courts, with jurisdiction granted by federal law. The law limits jurisdiction over subpoenas issued to executive branch officials asserting governmental privilege, but some courts may still exercise jurisdiction over such claims. The House can seek court assistance to enforce a subpoena against an executive official, even though it lacks a specific statutory framework for civil enforcement lawsuits. Recent practice allows the House to authorize a committee to file a civil claim in federal court to enforce a subpoena, resulting in compliance and information disclosure. The House can seek court assistance to enforce a subpoena against an executive official, even without a specific statutory framework for civil enforcement lawsuits. In cases of continued defiance, contempt of court may result instead of contempt of Congress. An example of this occurred in 1982 when House committees issued subpoenas to EPA Administrator Anne Burford, leading to a criminal contempt citation for her failure to comply with the subpoenas. The DOJ filed a lawsuit to support Administrator Burford's withholding of documents, but it was dismissed by the court. The U.S. Attorney refused to present the criminal contempt to a grand jury, leading to two compromises being reached between both congressional parties. Two compromises were reached between congressional committees and the DOJ regarding access to subpoenaed documents, leading to the withdrawal of a contempt citation against Administrator Burford. The DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel stated that Congress cannot force the Executive to prosecute an individual and that the contempt of Congress statute does not apply to Executive Branch officials. The opinion stated that the contempt of Congress statute does not apply to Executive Branch officials asserting executive privilege. In 2007, Harriet Miers and Joshua Bolten defied subpoenas related to the dismissal of US Attorneys, with the President invoking executive privilege. The House held Harriet Miers and Joshua Bolten in criminal contempt of Congress for defying subpoenas related to the dismissal of US Attorneys. The DOJ decided not to prosecute them, citing potential infringement on executive privilege. The House Judiciary Committee filed suit to enforce subpoenas against Harriet Miers and Joshua Bolten for defying Congress. In Committee on the Judiciary v Miers, the court rejected the Administration's argument of immunity for asserting executive privilege, allowing Miers to testify but still assert privilege as needed. The House Judiciary Committee filed suit to enforce subpoenas against Harriet Miers and Joshua Bolten for defying Congress. The court directed the executive branch to provide a detailed list of documents withheld on the basis of executive privilege. After two years and an appeal, a settlement was reached where most documents were provided and Miers would testify. In a separate incident in 2012, Attorney General Eric Holder failed to comply with a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee subpoena for documents related to misleading communications by the DOJ. In response to the committee's investigation into operation Fast and Furious, the DOJ faced controversy over withholding documents. The President claimed executive privilege, leading to the Attorney General being held in contempt of Congress. The House authorized a lawsuit to enforce the subpoena in federal court after the DOJ refused to act on the contempt citation. The House committee filed a lawsuit to enforce a subpoena against the DOJ for withholding documents related to operation Fast and Furious. The D.C. District Court eventually ruled in favor of the committee, instructing the new Attorney General to comply with the subpoena and rejecting the DOJ's argument of executive privilege. The court ruled in favor of the House committee, stating that Congress's \"legitimate need\" for documents must be respected. The court also highlighted the constitutional dimension of the deliberative process privilege, potentially strengthening the privilege in certain situations. The court ruled in favor of the House committee, emphasizing Congress's \"legitimate need\" for documents and strengthening the deliberative process privilege. The court noted that the DOJ's internal deliberations had been publicly disclosed, leading to only \"incremental harm\" from disclosing the documents. The committee appealed the decision to the D.C. Circuit out of concern for the reasoning applied. The litigation involving the House committee and the Trump Administration is on hold for a potential settlement. A negotiated settlement in 2018 was dependent on vacating specific court orders, which were not vacated in October 2018. In 2013, IRS official Lois Lerner appeared before a committee regarding scrutiny of conservative groups, invoking her Fifth Amendment privilege. The House committee ruled that Lois Lerner waived her Fifth Amendment privilege by proclaiming innocence, leading to a criminal contempt citation. However, the U.S. Attorney determined she did not waive her rights, avoiding prosecution. The House committee ruled that Lois Lerner did not waive her Fifth Amendment rights, unlike other scenarios involving executive privilege. Prosecution for criminal contempt may be unlikely in certain circumstances where non-compliance is endorsed by the President. It is arguable that there is currently no credible threat of prosecution for violating 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 192 when an executive branch official refuses to comply with a congressional subpoena at the direction of the President. The executive branch may choose not to enforce a congressional citation if it determines that the official has not violated the statute or has a defense against prosecution. This limits the effectiveness of the criminal contempt statute as a deterrent for non-compliance with congressional subpoenas by executive branch officials. Enforcing congressional subpoenas through the courts can result in significant delays in obtaining information, as seen in past cases like Miers and Fast and Furious litigation. This delay, combined with changes in political landscape, can diminish the value of the information and hinder effective oversight by congressional committees. Civil enforcement also poses the risk of courts making it harder for committees to obtain information. The court decisions in cases like Miers and Fast and Furious litigation may limit congressional access to testimony by executive branch officials. Historically, Congress relied on its own power to enforce subpoenas, but court rulings could make it harder for committees to obtain information. The inherent contempt power allows Congress to unilaterally arrest and detain individuals obstructing legislative duties. It is a broader authority than the criminal contempt statute, used to enforce investigative powers historically. The inherent contempt power allows Congress to authorize the arrest and detention of individuals who obstruct legislative duties. This process involves a resolution authorizing an arrest warrant, followed by a hearing where allegations are heard and defenses raised. If found guilty, the individual may be detained until they comply with legislative demands. The goal is not punitive but to ensure compliance with information disclosure. The inherent contempt power allows Congress to detain witnesses until they disclose sought information, not exceeding the end of the Congress. It is considered an implied constitutional power necessary for legislative functions, rooted in self-preservation. The Supreme Court has upheld this power as essential for dealing with obstructions to legislative duties. Congress may exercise this power through the Necessary and Proper Clause. The criminal contempt provision of 1857 is seen as necessary for executing the powers of each House, supplementing rather than replacing inherent contempt power. The Supreme Court has affirmed Congress's essential power to punish for contempt, supported by historical practice. Each House retains the authority to arrest and detain individuals for non-compliance with subpoenas. The House has the authority to arrest and detain individuals for not complying with congressional demands for information, as seen in the 1927 case of McGrain v. Daugherty. The Senate used its inherent contempt power to arrest Mallie Daugherty for refusing to testify in a Senate investigation. The Supreme Court later reversed a district court's decision that deemed the House's action unlawful. The Supreme Court upheld the House's authority to arrest and detain witnesses to obtain information for legislative purposes, stating that it is essential for effective legislation. The Court emphasized the need for compulsion to acquire accurate and complete information when mere requests are insufficient. The Supreme Court has upheld the House's authority to use means of compulsion to obtain necessary information for legislative purposes. The Court has clarified that acts punishable for contempt must obstruct the duties of the legislature, with limitations on the power to punish in certain scenarios. In Kilbourn v. Thompson, the Court ruled that contempt power cannot be exercised if the investigation is outside the body's authority. The Supreme Court has upheld the House's authority to use means of compulsion to obtain necessary information for legislative purposes. In Kilbourn v. Thompson, the Court ruled that contempt power cannot be exercised if the investigation is outside the body's authority. The Court held the House in contempt for exceeding its authority in investigating a bankrupt real-estate pool, viewing it as interfering in a matter properly resolved in bankruptcy courts. In Marshall v. Gordon, a letter deemed \"ill-tempered\" was not considered contempt as it did not obstruct the House's powers significantly. The Marshall opinion established that contempt power is appropriate to preserve legislative authority. It can be used for physical obstruction, assault on members, obstruction of officers, preventing attendance, or refusal to obey orders. The Court found that the contempt in Marshall v. Gordon was not intrinsic to the House's duty preservation as it was in response to an \"irritating\" letter, not obstruction of legislative duty. The inherent contempt power, although not frequently used, can be employed by Congress to enforce subpoenas and ensure compliance with legislative demands. Despite being described as cumbersome and inefficient, the threat of arrest by the Sergeant-at-Arms can encourage cooperation. Senator Sam Ervin utilized this power during the investigation of the Nixon Administration. The inherent contempt power, dormant but available to Congress, can enforce subpoenas. Congress may need to explore alternative frameworks for subpoena enforcement. Foundational separation-of-powers principles are crucial in discussions about Congress's authority. The Supreme Court does not endorse absolute separation of powers, aiming for a more flexible approach. The separation of powers doctrine emphasizes separateness but interdependence among branches, with potential concerns in congressional exercise of executive or judicial powers, infringement on executive privilege, and procedural compliance. Congress may face issues when enforcing subpoenas, limiting executive discretion, or adjudicating inter-branch disputes. The Constitution grants specific powers to each branch of government, with the executive branch responsible for enforcing laws and the judicial branch for adjudicating them. The Court has ruled that Congress cannot engage in executive functions or control the execution of laws. In Bowsher v. Synar, a law delegating executive power to a legislative branch officer was struck down. The Court in Bowsher v. Synar rejected a law delegating executive power to a legislative branch officer, stating that Congress cannot constitutionally delegate such authority. The Comptroller General's functions were deemed executive in nature, and Congress cannot execute laws or enforce them. The Constitution prohibits Congress from investing itself or its members with executive power, as the enforcement of laws is assigned to the Executive branch. This principle applies to congressional investigations and contempt, where the power to investigate should not be confused with law enforcement. The executive branch retains prosecutorial discretion when enforcing laws, based on constitutional principles like separation of powers and the Take Care Clause. The Supreme Court's statement in United States v. Nixon emphasized the Executive Branch's exclusive authority in deciding whether to prosecute a case, based on separation of powers and the Take Care Clause. The executive branch's reliance on prosecutorial discretion has been seen in cases of criminal contempt of Congress, with the extent of this discretion not clearly defined. Attempts by Congress to mandate specific prosecutions have been met with opposition from the executive branch, raising constitutional questions about the separation of powers. Congress cannot enforce laws or act as a court, and may not dictate prosecutions. The Supreme Court has emphasized that Congress cannot exercise judicial powers or try individuals for crimes. The Bill of Attainder Clause prohibits Congress from determining guilt and inflicting punishment without a judicial trial, casting doubt on Congress's historical actions. When Congress enforces its subpoenas, it must distinguish between exercising its inherent contempt power as a legislative function and attempting to enforce and judge general statutory laws. The Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of Congress's inherent contempt power, viewing it as an implied legislative power rather than an exercise of executive or judicial powers. The inherent contempt power allows Congress to remedy offenses against itself, while enforcing statutory laws may infringe on executive and judicial powers. Using contempt procedures against an executive official invoking privilege could hinder the President's ability to protect confidentiality, rooted in the separation of powers. Executive privilege allows the executive branch to withhold crucial information for fulfilling its unique role and responsibilities. The Supreme Court's explanation of executive privilege in United States v. Nixon recognized a constitutional privilege protecting presidential communications, essential for the operation of government and rooted in the separation of powers. The Supreme Court's explanation of executive privilege in United States v. Nixon emphasized the importance of protecting presidential communications for the operation of government and the separation of powers. The Court recognized the need to balance the President's interest in confidentiality with the demands of due process in fair administration. The Nixon opinion established that executive privilege is not absolute but qualified, balancing competing interests and preserving essential functions of each branch. The Court viewed confidential presidential communications as presumptively privileged to protect the public interest in candid decision-making. The Supreme Court has not addressed executive privilege in any substantial way since the Nixon era. The privilege is limited to communications made in the performance of a President's responsibilities and does not apply to all presidential communications. The burden is on the party seeking information to overcome the presumption of privilege with a strong showing of need. The Supreme Court has not addressed executive privilege significantly since the Nixon era. Lower federal courts have generally avoided adjudicating disputes over executive privilege between the executive and legislative branches, encouraging political resolution instead. Judicial intervention in such disputes is suggested to be delayed until settlement possibilities are exhausted, with a warning against an adversarial approach. The D.C. Circuit's decision in Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities v. Nixon involved the Senate's attempt to obtain White House tapes during an investigation into the 1972 presidential election. The court emphasized the need for optimal accommodation between branches and ultimately sided with the President. The D.C. Circuit's opinion in Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities v. Nixon affirmed the qualified nature of the presidential privilege, stating that Congress can overcome it with a strong showing of need for critical evidence in fulfilling its investigative function, regardless of the nature of the presidential conduct revealed. The D.C. Circuit in Senate Select Committee found that the Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities failed to show a critical need for the tapes, despite arguing for oversight and legislative functions. The Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities argued for the public release of investigation results and the use of subpoenaed tapes to resolve conflicts in testimony for legislative purposes. However, the court found that the committee failed to demonstrate a critical need for the tapes as they were already in possession of another congressional committee. The court also determined that the content of the conversations was not essential for future legislation. The court found that the content of the conversations in the subpoenaed tapes was not essential for future legislation. Executive privilege does not establish an absolute bar to Congress obtaining protected information, especially when based on a \"generalized interest\" in confidentiality rather than sensitive national security secrets. The inquiry should focus on whether the information sought is \"demonstrably critical\" to a legitimate legislative function. The executive branch interprets executive privilege broadly, covering various categories of documents related to confidentiality interests. In contrast, Congress interprets it more narrowly, limiting its application to core Article II duties and presidential functions. This differing interpretation has led to frequent inter-branch disputes over executive privilege. The executive branch interprets executive privilege broadly, covering various categories of documents related to confidentiality interests. Congress interprets it more narrowly, limiting its application to core Article II duties and presidential communications. The privilege can be overcome by an adequate showing of need, but conflicts between the power of inquiry and executive privilege lack clear legal standards. The implementation of executive privilege is not governed by strict rules but involves balancing specific interests in a dispute. The legal standard for evaluating an executive privilege claim depends on the type of information being protected. Courts prioritize protecting military or diplomatic secrets over a President's general interest in confidentiality. The President's interest in confidentiality is given high deference in executive privilege claims. Different aspects of executive privilege, like the deliberative process privilege, are assessed differently in the face of Congress's investigative powers. How Congress enforces a subpoena for privileged information will impact the resolution of executive privilege assertions. The framework for enforcement, whether criminal contempt or civil enforcement, determines the final arbiter of executive privilege scope. The application of executive privilege is subject to judicial review, with different enforcement frameworks determining the final arbiter of its scope. Constitutional questions may arise regarding the power of a single house to trigger legal consequences without bicameralism and presentment compliance. The Constitution requires Congress to follow specific procedures before legislation becomes law, including approval by both houses and presentation to the President. In INS v. Chadha, the Court used these requirements to invalidate provisions allowing one house to veto executive branch authority. The Supreme Court invalidated the \"legislative veto\" in INS v. Chadha, ruling that all legislative acts must comply with bicameralism and presentment requirements. Congressional actions with the \"force of law\" must follow the Constitution's process of passage by both houses and presentment to the President. The Supreme Court invalidated the \"legislative veto\" in INS v. Chadha, ruling that all legislative acts must comply with bicameralism and presentment requirements. The Constitution's impeachment provisions and Senate advice and consent powers are examples of provisions conferring special powers on one House. Each House has the power to act alone in determining specified internal matters, indicating the Framers' intent for Congress to not act in any legally binding manner outside a closely circumscribed legislative arena. The contempt power does not fit neatly into the Chadha mold. The Court may have overlooked the inherent contempt power in Chadha's bicameralism exceptions. The Constitution doesn't explicitly confer contempt or inquiry powers to each house, but they are implied as essential to legislative power. No court has found single-house contempt power inconsistent with bicameralism. The DOJ argues that requiring a contempt citation before a grand jury would be inconsistent. The DOJ argues that requiring a contempt citation before a grand jury would be inconsistent with Chadha, as it would allow one house to place a legal requirement on a U.S. Attorney. Most congressional requests for information are complied with, and disputes are generally resolved through negotiations between the committee and the executive agency. The report considers possible subpoena-enforcement frameworks and the legal issues they raise in light of separation-of-powers principles. In most cases, disputes between congressional committees and executive agencies are resolved through negotiations, leading to a resolution acceptable to both parties. While Congress has the power to enforce subpoenas, it is rarely necessary as information is usually obtained through negotiation. However, if prosecution is needed to compel compliance, criminal contempt may not be a reliable enforcement method. Congress may have to rely on negotiation, accommodation, or other constitutional powers like the power of the purse, confirmation power, impeachment, etc. The authority of Congress to enforce subpoenas and ensure compliance by executive branch officials includes utilizing civil enforcement in the courts. This method aligns with the judiciary's power to interpret executive privilege and the executive branch's acknowledgment of civil enforcement as a valid approach to resolving information access disputes. However, reliance on civil enforcement may have drawbacks. The use of civil enforcement in resolving oversight disputes between Congress and the executive branch may have drawbacks, including lengthy judicial resolution and potential weakening of Congress's oversight authority. Despite recent district court opinions supporting justiciability, the executive branch still argues against it. If an appellate court were to adopt the executive's position, it could limit the effectiveness of existing enforcement avenues against executive branch officials. Congress could potentially alter its approach to enforcing committee subpoenas issued to executive branch officials by expediting the civil enforcement process through establishing timetables for review or urging speedy judicial consideration. H.R. 4010 in the 115th Congress aimed to amend 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365a to prioritize federal courts advancing on civil subpoena-enforcement cases filed by the House or Senate. The bill aimed to expedite civil enforcement lawsuits related to committee subpoenas by prioritizing their disposition in federal courts. It proposed the option of a three-judge panel and direct appeal to the Supreme Court, which falls within Congress's authority over federal court procedures. Various expedited review procedures already exist in federal law, including for Senate-filed lawsuits to enforce subpoenas. Establishing expedited judicial review of congressional subpoena-enforcement actions may mitigate some drawbacks of the current civil enforcement process. However, there is a risk that a reviewing court could issue a decision adverse to the legislative branch's investigative and oversight interests. Some commentators suggest that seeking court assistance weakens the legislative branch, and the House or Senate may also use inherent contempt power to enforce compliance with subpoenas issued to executive branch officials. The Supreme Court has confirmed the House and Senate's authority to arrest and detain individuals to enforce compliance with subpoenas. Procedures could be established for the exercise of inherent contempt power, including actions of the Sergeant-at-Arms and the \"trial\" process. This power has been used to detain executive branch officials for non-compliance with subpoenas. The House has the authority to arrest and detain individuals for non-compliance with subpoenas, as confirmed by the Supreme Court. This power was demonstrated in cases involving George F. Seward and U.S. Attorney Snowden Marshall. The Supreme Court ordered Marshall released, reaffirming the contempt power but deeming it invalid in his case. The Court did not address the impact of Marshall's status as an executive branch official on the House's power. This suggests that Congress may use inherent contempt to enforce subpoenas on the executive branch, but without considering executive privilege constraints. The use of inherent contempt authority by Congress to detain an executive official for privileged documents raises unique concerns, including the possibility of a standoff with executive branch law enforcement. This issue is relevant in high-stakes separation-of-powers disputes. The 1984 OLC opinion concluded that applying criminal contempt of Congress to an executive official asserting executive privilege would burden the President's ability to carry out constitutional functions. The opinion extended this to Congress's use of inherent contempt to punish an official invoking executive privilege. The OLC opinion argued that applying criminal contempt of Congress to an executive official asserting executive privilege would hinder the President's constitutional functions, extending this to Congress's use of inherent contempt. The viability of Congress's inherent contempt authority against senior executive officials has not been tested in court. The OLC's position may not align entirely with the historical use of inherent contempt. While 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 192 and its predecessors focus on non-compliance with congressional subpoenas, the inherent contempt power has a broader scope in addressing actions that threaten Congress's legislative function. The Supreme Court distinguishes between the two powers, noting they are separately exercised. Inherent contempt is not always punitive but rather remedial, with detention typically lifted upon compliance with a subpoena. The Court has historically not extended restraint beyond the witness's willingness to testify. The Court recognizes Congress's authority to use inherent contempt power for punishment, especially in conflicts with the President's privilege to protect confidential communications. Historical debates on this issue date back to the first Congress, with President Washington asserting the executive branch's obligation to comply with congressional requests while also protecting sensitive information. In conflicts between the President's executive privilege and Congress's inherent contempt power, historical practice and limited case law suggest that a resolution should involve good-faith negotiations between the political branches. If negotiations fail and Congress invokes inherent contempt against an executive claiming privilege, a court would likely need to intervene. The court would likely engage in a fact-based balancing of interests to resolve the dispute. The court would balance Congress's need for information against the Executive's confidentiality, cautioning against using inherent contempt power to detain executive officials asserting privilege. This could lead to acrimony between branches and a constitutional crisis, as seen in the Miers case. Congress may consider imposing less severe penalties on executive branch officials found guilty of contempt, such as fines instead of detention. The Supreme Court's dicta in Kilbourn v. Thompson could support the existence of this power. The Supreme Court established that the House has the authority to punish its Members for disorderly behavior and potentially others in certain investigations. Punishment for contempt as a witness may include a fine, drawing parallels to the judiciary's power to punish for contempt with a fine. The Supreme Court suggested that courts have the authority to punish contemptuous conduct with fines or imprisonment, even without a specific statute. This implies that the power to fine for inherent contempt may also apply to Congress. The Supreme Court suggested that courts have the authority to punish contemptuous conduct with fines or imprisonment, even without a specific statute. Anderson's opinion indicates that Congress's power for inherent contempt may be limited to imprisonment, with monetary penalties seen as less severe. The Supreme Court has suggested that fines are viewed as a lesser punishment than imprisonment for contempt. However, the authority of Congress to impose fines on a witness in contempt remains uncertain, with the lack of precedent potentially influencing a court's decision. The implementation and extent of such fines, if allowed, are also unclear. The authority of Congress to impose fines on a witness in contempt remains uncertain, with proposed alternatives including appointing an independent official for prosecuting criminal contempt of Congress citations against executive branch officials. This would create an independent prosecutor with reduced influence from the President and the DOJ, similar to the expired Office of Independent Counsel. The proposed office for prosecuting criminal contempt of Congress would be modeled after the expired Office of Independent Counsel, established in the Independent Counsel Act of 1978. The appointment process involved the Attorney General conducting a preliminary investigation and then applying to a three-judge panel for further investigation. The Attorney General had to apply to a three-judge panel for the appointment of an Independent Counsel. The Independent Counsel had full power and authority to conduct investigations and prosecutions independently. The Independent Counsel, appointed by a three-judge panel, had significant powers and independence in conducting investigations and prosecutions. The Independent Counsel could only be removed for specific reasons by the Attorney General, as established in the Independent Counsel Act upheld in Morrison v. Olson. The Court determined that the Independent Counsel was an inferior officer and could be appointed by the courts of law, not requiring Senate approval. Congress could grant the Independent Counsel autonomy and protection from removal, ensuring sufficient executive branch control. The Morrison opinion upheld the Independent Counsel's autonomy and protection from removal, ensuring executive branch control. While subject to criticism, it has not been overturned by the Supreme Court. Congress could consider a similar framework for an independent office for prosecuting criminal contempt of Congress. The breadth of the independent counsel statute was a chief criticism leading to its expiration. The Independent Counsel statute allowed for a wide range of jurisdiction, leading to its expiration. To address concerns, limiting the jurisdiction to specific crimes without expansion options could be a solution. Congress may also consider changing the appointment process for an independent counsel. The appointment process for an independent counsel may be changed to prevent the Attorney General from blocking appointments based on legal merit. This alteration could raise constitutional concerns as it removes the Attorney General's discretion in triggering appointments, which was deemed important by the Court in the Morrison case. The special division cannot appoint an independent counsel \"sua sponte\" as the Attorney General retains authority over the appointment, giving the executive control. Removing the Attorney General's discretionary authority could lead to legal challenges. Congress may consider establishing a contingent contempt framework for executive branch officials. One approach to enforce Congress's investigative subpoena power is to tie agency funding to compliance with contempt citations. For instance, a law could withhold a percentage of an agency's funds until the subpoena is obeyed, using the power of the purse to incentivize cooperation. An approach to enforce Congress's investigative subpoena power is through contingent legislation, which uses funding as leverage to encourage agency cooperation with committee subpoenas. This type of legislation allows Congress to delegate the timing of enforcement to the executive branch, ensuring effective implementation. A statute delegating the determination of contempt to a single house of Congress could be seen as an improper exercise of legislative or executive power. This arrangement may violate the principles outlined in Chadha, which limits Congress's authority to make legislative decisions without following the constitutional process of bicameralism and presentment. The Chadha decision limits Congress's ability to delegate contempt authority to a single house, as it goes against the constitutional process of bicameralism and presentment. This could create tension with the principle that Congress cannot override or alter authority delegated to the executive branch. The executive branch has objected to proposals for a contingent contempt framework that would impose legal duties on them, arguing it would contradict the Chadha decision. The Chadha decision limits Congress's ability to delegate contempt authority to a single house, as it goes against the constitutional process of bicameralism and presentment. In the investigative and oversight context, there may be arguments that the restrictions of Chadha are either inapplicable or apply with less force. Existing investigative authorities allow a single house or committee to alter legal rights and obligations, such as issuing subpoenas or using inherent contempt power. The legal mechanisms for enforcing compliance with congressional investigations include the inherent contempt power, criminal contempt statute, and federal immunity statute. Federal appellate courts have recognized Congress's authority to unilaterally investigate executive officials without full legislative procedures. The argument that laws incidental to enforcing congressional subpoenas should not be subject to bicameralism and presentment limitations, as it could represent an impermissible exercise of executive power by a single house of Congress. This is based on the principles of Bowsher v. Synar, where the Court invalidated a law empowering a legislative branch officer to mandate executive branch spending reductions. The Court concluded that Congress unconstitutionally intruded into the executive function by vesting ultimate authority in one of its officers to interpret and implement the law. Congress can only indirectly control the execution of its enactment through new legislation. It could be argued that tying budgetary reductions to a contempt resolution would give the House and Senate impermissible control. However, the Comptroller General's authority in Bowsher could be distinguished from that of the House or Senate in a contingent contempt framework. The Bowsher Court focused on the fact that the Comptroller General used his own interpretation and judgment in exercising executive authority. The House and Senate would not have discretion in determining budget cuts under a contingent contempt framework. The executive branch would implement the budget restrictions in a ministerial manner. Implementation obstacles may arise, similar to enforcing subpoenas through criminal contempt of Congress. The executive branch may object to using spending power to enforce compliance with investigative demands, citing infringement on the President's constitutional authority. In a contempt dispute involving executive privilege, the President could direct the OMB not to withhold funding if he sees it as a burden on his ability to assert executive privilege. To assert executive privilege, the President could direct the OMB not to withhold funding. Congress may create a framework to reward agency compliance with subpoenas by offering additional funding instead of punishment. This approach could incentivize the executive branch to disclose subpoenaed information. The text suggests a solution to potential constitutional concerns regarding Congress controlling agency funding levels. It proposes the introduction of a joint resolution allowing for the withholding of funding upon approval of a contempt citation, satisfying bicameralism and presentment requirements without the legislative branch executing the law. The joint resolution proposed would allow for withholding funding upon approval of a contempt citation, satisfying constitutional concerns without the legislative branch executing the law. Congress's ability to issue and enforce subpoenas is crucial for its legislative function. The mechanisms of criminal contempt of Congress and civil enforcement have limitations in ensuring compliance with congressional subpoenas by executive branch officials. Alternatives to the current framework exist, but reform efforts would need to consider constitutional separation of powers and practical limitations in resolving information access disputes."
