    "content": "U.S. pharmaceutical manufacturers spend billions on special assistance programs to help consumers with prescription drug costs. These programs include discount coupons, patient assistance programs (PAPs), and donations to nonprofit foundations or charities. PAPs provide free drugs or financial aid based on factors like income and medical necessity. Pharmaceutical companies may qualify for tax deductions for donations. Pharmaceutical manufacturers have significantly increased their assistance programs, with giving by PAPs rising from $376 million in 2001 to $6.1 billion in 2014. Independent charity PAPs also saw a substantial increase in giving, from $2 million in 2001 to $868 million in 2014. This rise in assistance programs is seen as a commitment to ensuring affordable prescription drugs. Pharmaceutical manufacturers have increased assistance programs, with PAPs rising from $376 million in 2001 to $6.1 billion in 2014. Independent charity PAPs also saw a substantial increase in giving, from $2 million in 2001 to $868 million in 2014. This rise in assistance programs shows a commitment to ensuring affordable prescription drugs. Insured consumers face challenges with prescription costs, especially for high-cost specialty drugs. Coupons and PAPs help reduce out-of-pocket expenses, improving adherence and potentially enhancing health outcomes. The increased use of drug discount coupons can make products more affordable for patients but may raise costs for other beneficiaries in a health care plan. Health payers warn that coupons can lead to higher expenses by encouraging the use of brand-name drugs over cheaper alternatives. Assistance programs expand access to drugs but also drive up prescription prices. While coupons reduce out-of-pocket costs for consumers, they do not lower the price charged to insurers or government programs. When consumers use drug discount coupons, it can make medications more affordable for them, but it may increase costs for other beneficiaries in a health care plan. Coupons do not lower the price charged to insurers or government programs, and they may reduce market constraint on drug prices. Restrictions exist on using pharmaceutical assistance, such as coupons not being usable with federal programs like Medicare Part D due to anti-kickback laws. Manufacturer-sponsored PAPs cannot offer cost-sharing assistance to enrollees in federal programs. Pharmaceutical assistance programs (PAPs) operated by independent charities can assist federal beneficiaries if they comply with certain conditions. Some health care payers and PBMs have restricted the use of manufacturer coupons for certain drugs. This report outlines consumer spending on prescription drugs, the difference between drug coupons and PAPs, and federal laws and private-sector policies related to coupons and PAPs. PAPs developed in the 1990s in response to concerns about high drug prices and have grown substantially since then. Consumer out-of-pocket spending on prescription drugs has decreased due to the widespread adoption of low-cost generic drugs and the expansion of health insurance drug coverage through programs like Medicare Part D and the Affordable Care Act. Generic drug use now makes up a large portion of filled prescriptions and total drug spending. This has led to a decline in consumer out-of-pocket spending, which includes cash payments, deductibles, coinsurance, and co-payments. Consumer out-of-pocket spending on prescription drugs has decreased significantly from 1990 to 2015, with health plan deductibles, coinsurance, and co-payments declining. Spending by commercial payers and taxpayer-financed health programs has increased, leading to a rise in out-of-pocket expenditures. Per capita out-of-pocket spending is expected to rise by 4% annually from 2016 to 2025, but is projected to decrease to 11% of per capita drug spending by 2025. Manufacturer assistance has increased despite the moderation in out-of-pocket spending. Individual consumers can face significant drug costs depending on their health plan design and diagnosis. A growing number of individuals are experiencing high out-of-pocket spending for specialty drugs. Pharmaceutical deductibles are more common, and the development of charity PAPs in the early 2000s allows manufacturers to assist Medicare Part D enrollees without violating anti-kickback statutes. Part D enrollees with high drug costs struggle to afford medications during the deductible phase and coverage gap. Manufacturers and drug marketers often provide aid to consumers. The recent expansion of health coverage has improved consumer access to pharmaceuticals, leading to increased drug utilization and lower costs for uninsured or underinsured consumers. The Affordable Care Act has reduced the number of consumers skipping prescriptions due to cost concerns. However, the use of high-cost drugs, including specialty drugs, is on the rise, resulting in significant cost sharing for individuals as health payers increase co-payments and coinsurance. The trend in employer-sponsored health plans is shifting more drug costs onto enrollees through increased co-payments, coinsurance, and deductibles. This includes the use of tiered pricing, with higher tiers for expensive or less effective drugs. The number of plans with four or more drug tiers has increased, including a specialty drug tier. Additionally, the share of plans with a drug deductible has risen significantly. These changes have led to a decrease in average out-of-pocket spending but an increase for enrollees with chronic conditions or high-cost prescriptions. Out-of-pocket spending for specialty drugs increased from $41 in 2003 to $77 in 2014, while spending on non-specialty medications decreased. Average out-of-pocket spending in large employer-sponsored health plans decreased to $144 in 2014, with 3% of enrollees having high costs exceeding $1,000. Manufacturer coupons and PAP assistance help cover some out-of-pocket costs. Manufacturer coupons are increasingly used to offset patient out-of-pocket costs for brand-name prescriptions, with coupons utilized for one out of every five prescriptions in 2016. These coupons help create demand for new drugs, improve consumer adherence, and support brand-name drugs facing competition from generics. Manufacturer coupons are used to offset patient out-of-pocket costs for brand-name prescriptions facing competition from generics. A coupon can limit out-of-pocket costs for a brand-name drug to $100 per 30-day refill for a 12-month period, compared to $250 without the coupon. The manufacturer covers the remaining coinsurance up to the maximum subsidy amount. Manufacturer coupons are used to offset patient out-of-pocket costs for brand-name prescriptions. Coupons can be printed in magazines, offered electronically, or presented as a debit-type card. They are built into manufacturers' budget and pricing strategies and target specific offers. Starter cards may be provided for initial prescription fills at no cost while waiting for coverage decisions. Coupons cannot be used by individuals enrolled in federal health programs. When a consumer presents a prescription at a pharmacy, the pharmacist uses an electronic system to submit a claim to the PBM for processing. The PBM determines the patient's cost-sharing obligation and may submit secondary claims to other payers, including insurance policies or manufacturer coupons. After all payments are processed, the consumer covers any remaining co-payment. Manufacturer discounts not processed electronically may be in the form of rebates or discounts after the sale. Consumers can use coupons to reduce co-payments for prescriptions not covered by insurance. Data shows a significant increase in coupon programs, costing manufacturers over $5 billion annually. The average co-payment for coupon users was over $30 in January 2016. Over 14 million patients used co-payment coupons or vouchers in a 12-month period. Co-payment coupons were utilized by more than 14 million patients in a year, with 90% using one program and 10% using multiple programs, mainly by patients with chronic conditions. The average savings for patients using coupons was $40. Manufacturers renew coupon offers to build brand loyalty and keep prices higher for brand-name drugs even after generic substitutes enter the market. Pharmaceutical coupons are used as part of a marketing strategy to increase drug adherence. Coupon programs increase drug adherence and therapy duration, generate patient data for pricing and marketing strategies, and offer a good return on investment. Electronic health records help manufacturers and marketers reach doctors and patients more efficiently. Some pharmacies, nonprofit organizations, and PBMs offer their own prescription drug cards or programs that cannot be used with government benefits or private insurance. Health plans with high deductibles have led to an increase in offers for drug benefits through coupons and discount cards. Consumer organizations note that while drugstore discount cards can be beneficial, it can be challenging to determine if consumers are getting the best price. Websites like Good Rx help consumers compare drug prices, while Express Scripts' subsidiary Inside Rx offers discount cards for certain prescription drugs. Co-payment coupons cannot be used with federal health benefits due to anti-kickback statutes. Pharmaceutical companies may face liability under federal anti-kickback statutes for offering coupons to induce drug purchases paid for by federal health care programs. Retailers submitting claims for items or services resulting from anti-kickback violations may also be penalized under the False Claims Act. Enrollees in private health plans like those sold through the FEHB Program can use drug discount coupons with their insurance benefits. Former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius addressed the use of drug discount coupons with qualified health plans sold under the ACA. Former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius clarified that qualified health plans, tax subsidies, and cost-sharing assistance under the ACA are not considered federal programs. Individuals covered by federal health plans can purchase prescription drugs outside their benefits. Medicare Part D beneficiaries can pay cash for drugs at retail pharmacies if it's cheaper than through their plan. Coupons for drugs like Lipitor are available to Part D beneficiaries, but only the actual price paid minus discounts counts towards out-of-pocket spending limits. The 2014 HHS OIG report highlighted concerns about pharmaceutical manufacturers not having consistent safeguards to prevent Medicare Part D beneficiaries from using co-payment coupons with program benefits. Some manufacturer offers do not include disclaimers prohibiting the use of coupons by individuals enrolled in federal health care programs. Manufacturers redeeming coupons through PBM systems have implemented edits to identify individuals enrolled in federal programs like Medicare. The HHS OIG report found that the system for processing prescription drug claims can make it difficult for entities to identify coupons as they move through the pharmacy transaction system. Coupons redeemed after the point of sale may not be detected by electronic safeguard systems, leading to potential penalties for manufacturers. Some large employers and commercial payers restrict coupon use for federal health care programs to control costs. UnitedHealthcare and Express Scripts have limitations on co-payment coupons for certain drugs. Manufacturers may offer debit cards and rebates to bypass plan restrictions. Pharmaceutical companies use debit cards and rebate offers to help patients bypass plan restrictions on co-payment coupons. One company successfully retained patients by implementing a debit card system after a payer prohibited co-payment cards for a specific drug. Patient Assistance Programs (PAPs) operated by pharmaceutical manufacturers, state governments, and charities aim to assist uninsured or underinsured individuals with prescription drug costs. Many PAPs are structured as nonprofit organizations. Pharmaceutical companies set up 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations to provide prescription drugs or financial subsidies to qualified patients. These organizations are exempt from federal income taxes and can receive tax-deductible contributions. Different types of Patient Assistance Programs (PAPs) include Pharmaceutical Manufacturer PAPs and Independent Charity PAPs. Manufacturer PAPs distribute drugs to uninsured individuals and those with insurance, while Independent Charity PAPs operate separately from drug manufacturers. Independent Charity PAPs offer financial assistance to uninsured or underinsured consumers. Some well-known charity PAPs include the Patient Access Network Foundation, HealthWell Foundation, and Caring Voice Coalition. State PAPs (SPAPs) operated by 19 state governments aim to help uninsured residents or fill gaps in insurance coverage. State Pharmaceutical Assistance Programs (SPAPs) are designed for lower-income individuals as a last resort payer for prescription drugs. SPAP rules and coverage vary by state, targeting seniors or specific disease groups like HIV/AIDs. 501(c)(3) organizations qualify for federal tax-exempt status by primarily operating for charitable or educational purposes. 501(c)(3) organizations must primarily serve a public interest and not benefit private industry to maintain their tax-exempt status. Earnings cannot benefit private individuals, and any private inurement may jeopardize their status. They are classified as public charities or private foundations, with public charities providing charitable services directly to the intended beneficiaries. Private foundations, unlike public charities, are tightly controlled entities that receive significant funding from a small group of donors. They make grants to other organizations instead of directly providing charitable services. Due to the potential for self-dealing, private foundations are more closely regulated and subject to penalty taxes for various violations. To be classified as a public charity, 501(c)(3) organizations must demonstrate how they meet support and control tests to the IRS. The IRS determines public charity status based on support and control tests. Consumer eligibility for assistance is typically based on income, insurance status, physician endorsement, prescription information, and proof of citizenship. Income limits for manufacturer and charitable Patient Assistance Programs (PAPs) are often tied to the federal poverty level. PAPs may set different income limits for different drugs and provide support for a limited time period, allowing individuals to reapply for assistance. Patient Assistance Programs (PAPs) provide drugs or aid directly to patients through healthcare providers. Legal constraints exist for using PAP funding with federal health programs. Manufacturer-based PAPs can operate outside Medicare Part D, while independent charities offering cost-sharing assistance do not raise anti-kickback concerns. The HHS OIG guidance limits data dissemination from Patient Assistance Programs (PAPs), preventing detailed data that would reveal how donated funds are used by pharmaceutical firms. Pharmaceutical manufacturers cannot solicit or receive this data. The HHS OIG updated its guidance in May 2014 to increase scrutiny of independent charity PAPs that narrowly define specific diseases or limit assistance to certain expensive drugs. Charities have been seeking advisory opinions to cover only specialty pharmaceuticals. The HHS OIG updated its guidance in 2014 to scrutinize charity PAPs limiting assistance to expensive drugs. They warned that steering patients to high-cost drugs could be harmful and that financial support should not be based solely on drug cost. Charitable PAPs made operational changes in response to the updated guidance. In response to the HHS OIG's 2014 updated guidance, charitable PAPs made operational changes. Some charitable PAPs received approval for new proposed operations in early 2016. Companies like Celgene and Gilead Sciences received subpoenas regarding their relationships with independent charity PAPs in 2015 and 2016. The IRS Form 990 series is a primary source of data for patient assistance programs (PAPs) as it requires 501(c)(3) organizations to disclose financial information. There is no centralized database for PAPs, making it challenging to determine the total value of assistance provided or the number of beneficiaries each year. Patient assistance programs (PAPs) must file Form 990-T and pay tax on earnings unrelated to their exempt purpose. Form 990 and Schedule B donor information may not be publicly disclosed unless the entity is a private foundation. The content of Form 990s varies, with some providing aggregate data on donations while others offer detailed information on specific drugs or cash. Companies can deduct donations of cash or pharmaceuticals under IRC Section 170. Donations of non-inventory property can be deducted at fair market value, with special rules for inventory donations. C corporations donating inventory may deduct the lesser of their basis plus 50% of appreciated value or two times the basis, known as an enhanced deduction. The enhanced deduction for donations made by C corporations allows them to deduct the lesser of their basis plus 50% of appreciated value or two times the basis. The donation must be made to a qualified 501(c)(3) organization and used solely for the care of the ill, needy, or infants. The donee must not exchange the donation for money, property, or services, and written statements confirming compliance are required. Donated inventory must meet safety standards, and there has been an apparent increase in contributions and revenues from Pharmaceutical Assistance Programs (PAPs) in recent years. In recent years, contributions and revenues from Pharmaceutical Assistance Programs (PAPs) have increased significantly. A 2016 study found that charitable expenditures by leading manufacturer PAPs rose from $376 million in 2001 to $6.1 billion in 2014. Some of the largest manufacturer PAPs include Abbvie Patient Assistance Foundation, Johnson & Johnson Patient Assistance Foundation, and Bristol Myers Squibb Patient Assistance Foundation. The Patient Access Network Foundation, an independent charity PAP, also saw a substantial increase in grants and donations from $38 million in 2010 to $942 million in 2015. In 2015, giving by manufacturer PAPs declined slightly, while giving by charitable assistance PAPs grew. Studies have shown mixed results on the effectiveness of PAPs in helping patients access drugs due to various limitations such as complex application processes, unexpected program changes, and difficult income-documentation requirements. Some research suggests that PAPs could improve patient outcomes and drug affordability, but data remains inconclusive and challenging to compare. Several pharmaceutical firms have expanded patient assistance in response to consumer complaints about rising prices for certain drugs. For example, in August 2016, pharmaceutical manufacturer Mylan increased coupon discounts and expanded eligibility for its PAP after an outcry about the price of its EpiPen for treating allergic reactions. Studies have looked at the impact of coupons on drug pricing and utilization, but few have detailed the impact of PAPs. The use of manufacturer coupons increased prescription adherence but led to higher out-of-pocket spending for consumers and increased costs for insurance plans. Studies have shown that coupons helped consumers save money on specialty drugs, increased retail sales for brand-name drugs, and resulted in increased overall spending on medications. The introduction of generic drugs led to increased spending of $30-$120 million for the average drug studied. Studies have examined the use of coupons for higher-priced drugs with lower-cost substitutes available. Health care consultants promote patient assistance programs (PAPs) for brand-name drugs, claiming benefits in improving consumer loyalty and increasing drug sales. Sonexus Health is a division of health care consulting. Sonexus Health, a division of Cardinal Health, emphasizes manufacturer investment in PAPs as crucial for drug uptake. Kantar highlights the positive impact of a high PAP image on oncologists' behavior. Independent charity PAPs mention financial returns to attract donations. The Chronic Disease Fund, now Good Days, calculated ROI from PAP donations. The HealthWell Foundation emphasizes manufacturer donations to independent charities. HealthWell Foundation states that manufacturer donations to independent charity PAPs offer significant advantages over other strategies like direct-to-patient discounts or rebates."
