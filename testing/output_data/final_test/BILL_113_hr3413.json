Congress recognizes the importance of the trucking industry to the economy, with millions of Americans employed in trucking-related jobs. Federal regulations for commercial truck drivers should be based on thorough research. The new restart rule, implemented in 2013, is costly for the industry and affects productivity. The restart rule implemented in 2013 is costly for the trucking industry, impacting driver pay and increasing delivery costs. It should not have become effective before a thorough operational study required by the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act. The GAO will conduct assessments. The Comptroller General will assess the methodology used by the Secretary of Transportation for the MAP-21 Restart Study to ensure data representativeness, statistical validity, and adherence to the study plan. The Comptroller General will assess the Regulatory Impact Analysis of the final rule on \"Hours of Service of Drivers\" to evaluate the methodology and data used by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. The Comptroller General will assess the validity and representativeness of driver data used to evaluate the impacts of the new 34-hour restart rule for commercial motor vehicle operators. This includes analyzing the methodology for safety and health benefits, reviewing the implications of the rule on safety, health, cost, and operations, and examining the potential impact on road congestion during morning commutes. The Comptroller General will review the research used to justify the new restart rule, focusing on the use of a laboratory test instead of an operational test in the field. A final report will be submitted to Congress within one year of the Act's enactment, including any recommendations. SEC. 4. DELAY IN APPLICATION OF RULE.\n\nEffective as of the date of enactment of this Act, the restart rule published by the Department of Transportation in December 2011 will be delayed until 6 months after the study report required by this Act is submitted to Congress. During this period, the 34-hour restart rule issued in April 2003 will be in effect. The Secretary will not apply the December 2011 rule if the operational study completed under MAP-21 does not support the conclusions of the laboratory study on which the rule was based."
