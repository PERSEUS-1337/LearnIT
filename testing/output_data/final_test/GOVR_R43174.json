    "content": "The U.S. government's national security system involves decision-making, budgeting, planning, and oversight of national security activities. Key elements include national security strategic guidance documents like the President's national security strategy and the Secretary of Defense's national defense strategy. These documents guide policy decisions and convey intent to internal and external audiences. The national defense strategy (NDS) and its associated quadrennial defense review (QDR) report, along with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's national military strategy (NMS), are key documents that guide national security activities. Other agencies have similar review processes like the Quadrennial Homeland Security Review (QHSR) and the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR), all falling under the umbrella of national security. The concept of \"national security\" has been broadened in recent years, including economic, energy, and environmental security. Critics argue that executive branch strategy development processes are flawed, lacking clear priorities, fiscal constraints consideration, and agency roles and responsibilities assignment. The executive branch's strategic reviews and submission of strategic guidance documents to Congress may not always fully comply with legislative mandates. Congress can provide oversight by enacting or amending requirements for these processes, holding hearings, and shaping strategy through public statements or correspondence with the executive. This report provides an overview of mandates for national security strategic reviews, assesses recent execution, and raises issues for Congress to consider during oversight activities. Strategy articulates \"ends\" and links \"means\" and \"ways\" in a plan to achieve goals. Strategy can be narrowly targeted or broad, addressing multiple objectives and initiatives. Strategy is iterative, with feedback loops. National security strategy is crucial for success in the marketplace. It provides guidance for departments and agencies in budgeting, planning, and executing strategies. It also helps the executive branch make internal decisions and justify resources to Congress. Additionally, it informs the public about the strategic vision of the U.S. The U.S. government's national security strategy is essential for guiding departments and agencies in budgeting, planning, and executing strategies. It helps the executive branch make internal decisions, justify resources to Congress, and inform the public about its strategic vision. Congress has requirements for strategic reviews and documents, but executive branch compliance varies over time. Congressional oversight of executive branch strategy-making effectiveness may depend on this compliance. The National Security Strategy (NSS) is a report issued by the President to Congress, required annually by the Goldwater-Nichols Act. It outlines U.S. interests, goals, policies, commitments, and capabilities. It must be submitted in both classified and unclassified forms within 150 days of a new President taking office. The National Security Strategy (NSS) is a report issued annually by the President to Congress, outlining U.S. interests, goals, policies, commitments, and capabilities. It must be submitted within 150 days of a new President taking office. NSS reports have described objectives and activities to meet those objectives, without directly addressing risk or prioritizing objectives. Quadrennial defense reviews are internal DOD processes for formulating strategies. Quadrennial defense reviews are internal DOD processes designed to formulate national defense strategy and policies in support of national security strategy. The original mandate was provided by the National Defense Authorization Act for FY1997 and has been amended multiple times. The QDR was preceded by other attempts to assess defense strategy, including the Base Force work led by Colin Powell. The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) is a review process conducted during the first year of every presidential administration to formulate national defense strategy and policies. It takes a 20-year outlook and is resource-unconstrained, aiming to delineate a national defense strategy, determine force structure, modernization plans, infrastructure requirements, and craft an associated budget plan. The Secretary of Defense delivers a report to Congress based on the review. The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) requires the Secretary of Defense to deliver a report to Congress addressing specific points, with no specified classification level. Reports have been submitted in 1997, 2001, 2006, and 2010, with the next one due in February 2014. Compliance with congressional intent has been mixed, as reports often lack detailed information on specific military platforms and defense objectives prioritization. The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) process does not prioritize defense objectives or delineate roles within the Department. The 2014 QDR process is underway, but its scope may be affected by the Strategic Choices and Management Review. The national defense strategy outlines DOD's goals and methods. Title 10, U.S. Code, \u00a7118 mandates the QDR to include a national defense strategy discussion. There is no separate requirement for a National Defense Strategy (NDS). The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) process includes the submission of the National Defense Strategy (NDS) to the Armed Services Committees every four years. The 2006 and 2010 QDR reports did not include a NDS, but stand-alone NDSs were issued in 2005 and 2008. The 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance (DSG) is expected to form the basis for the 2014 QDR report. Many have questioned the DSG's relevance due to its lack of consideration for defense budget pressures associated with sequestration-level cuts. The National Defense Strategy (NDS) is a requirement introduced in the NDAA for FY2004, codified in Title 10, U.S. Code. The NDS involves the organized application of military means to support national goals, with responsibility assigned to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS). In the early 1990s, a temporary NDS requirement was enacted, highlighting the need for a military strategy. \u00a71032 of the NDAA for FY1991 mandated the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) to submit a strategic military plan annually from 1991 to 1993. The plan addressed various scenarios, strategic threats, requirements, roles of Military Services, and force structure. CJCS issued unclassified National Military Strategies (NMSs) in 1995 and 1997 after the temporary mandate expired. The CJCS is required to submit a new National Military Strategy (NMS) or update every two years, consistent with national security guidance. The NMS must address strategic challenges, military objectives, force planning, interagency partnerships, and resource constraints. The Secretary of Defense is required to include comments with the National Military Strategy transmittal. The 2004 NMS supported the National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy. The 2011 NMS followed the release of an NSS and QDR report. Law and practice recognize the value of assessing roles and missions within DOD. The requirement for a separate QRM review by the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with CJCS, is found in Title 10, U.S. Code,\u00a7118b, as amended by \u00a7941 of the NDAA for FY2008, P.L. 110-181. An earlier requirement for a roles and missions review by CJCS was created by the Goldwater-Nichols Act, \u00a7201, which amended Title 10, U.S. Code to include the requirement, in \u00a7153(b), that CJCS provide the Secretary of Defense a report on the assignment of roles and missions to the armed forces. The report was to be produced not less than once every three years, or at the request of the President or the Secretary. It was to take into account threats, changes in technology, and the need to prevent unnecessary duplication of effort. The NDAA for FY2001, P.L. 107-107, preserved the premise that CJCS should assess roles and missions but made that responsibility part of the Chairman's assessment of the QDR\u2014thus mandating that the assessment. The current QRM mandate requires the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with CJCS, to conduct a roles and missions review every four years. The Secretary must identify core mission areas, required capabilities, responsibility within DOD, and address any gaps or duplication of effort. This is mandated by Title 10, U.S. Code,\u00a7118b, as amended by \u00a7941 of the NDAA for FY2008. The QRM mandate requires the Secretary of Defense to conduct a roles and missions review every four years, as mandated by Title 10, U.S. Code. DOD has complied with the mandated timelines, submitting reports in 2009 and 2012. Some observers noted a lack of rigor in the 2012 report, which appeared to draw heavily from the DSG. Questions have been raised about the division of labor between the QRM and the QDR. The next QRM report is due in 2016. The QRM mandates a roles and missions review every four years, with the next report due in 2016. The assessment of defense strategy and division of labor is crucial, but de-linking the NDS from the QDR may distort the timeline. CJCS must regularly assess the risk associated with the NMS. CJCS regularly assesses the risk associated with the NMS as required by Title 10, U.S. Code, \u00a7153(b). The requirement for this assessment was introduced in the NDAA for FY2000, P.L. 106-65, \u00a71033. If significant risk is identified, a plan for mitigation must be included in the report to Congress. This requirement predates the statutory requirement for an NMS. The NDAA for FY2003 re-designated the CRA provision as \u00a7153(b) and made the mandate biennial. The NDAA for FY2012 refined the content of the CRA, while the NDAA for FY2013 re-organized \u00a7153 of Title 10, U.S. Code, changing the CRA back to an annual requirement. CJCS is required to prepare an assessment of risks associated with the most current NMS every year and submit it to the Armed Services Committees. The Secretary of Defense must submit a Comprehensive Risk Assessment (CRA) to Congress by February 15, addressing strategic and military risks to U.S. interests. The CRA must distinguish between probability and severity of risks, consider fiscal constraints, and outline risk mitigation steps in a Risk Mitigation Plan (RMP). Despite timeline adjustments, the Department of Defense has frequently submitted CRAs to Congress over the past decade. The Department of Defense has submitted Comprehensive Risk Assessments (CRAs) to Congress frequently, with the most recent one in April 2013. The CRAs define strategic and military risks in various ways, impacting the issues included. Risk Mitigation Plans (RMPs) have struggled to differentiate between risks and threats, often focusing on ways to address threats instead. Many suggest a competition of ideas to enhance the rigor and creativity of risk mitigation efforts. The current NDP requirement, mandated by Title 10 U.S. Code, aims to foster a competition of ideas for the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR). This requirement stems from prior mandates and emphasizes the importance of internal or external competitions to improve the strategic review process. The 2006 John Warner NDAA established a permanent mandate for a QDR independent panel to assess the DOD's review process and conduct an alternative force structure assessment. In 2010, Congress provided one-time guidance on panel membership and duties for the QDRIP. In 2010, Congress provided one-time guidance for the QDRIP in support of the 2010 QDR process, renaming it the National Defense Panel with a mandate to review the Secretary's terms of reference, assess the QDR report, conduct an independent assessment of force structures, and compare resource requirements. The National Defense Panel (NDP) must be established by February 1 in a QDR year, with ten members appointed by various officials. The original NDP for the 1997 QDR did not meet legal requirements, focusing on \"transformation\" instead. The 2010 QDRIP, renamed NDP, completed its report in July 2010, presenting findings to Congress. The 2010 QDRIP assessed the QDR process and recommended its discontinuation in favor of normal DOD planning cycles. The NDP, supporting the 2014 QDR, was delayed to allow new Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel to appoint leadership. The QHSR, modeled after the QDR, was created in response to the 9/11 attacks. The QHSR, modeled after the QDR, was established by the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007. It requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to conduct a review of the nation's homeland security every four years, outlining missions, cooperation, budget plans, organizational alignment, and DHS procedures. The QHSR, established by the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007, requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to review homeland security every four years. The report must be consistent with the National Strategy for Homeland Security and submitted to Congress by December 31. The first report was submitted in February 2010, with a disclaimer stating it is not a comprehensive assessment. The first QHSR report in February 2010 included a disclaimer stating it is not a resource prioritization document. The report identified key mission areas for priority focus but did not detail roles and responsibilities. Strategic reviews and guidance can be conducted by departments and agencies independently, raising oversight questions for Congress. DOD's 2011 comprehensive review, led by Secretaries Gates and Panetta, was driven by strategic and budgetary imperatives. The 2011 comprehensive review led by Secretaries Gates and Panetta was prompted by executive and legislative actions, including President Obama's directive to identify $400 billion in defense budget savings. The review was jumpstarted by the Budget Control Act of 2011, which established budget caps. The mandate included both strategy and resources, with a focus on strategic considerations for achieving savings. In 2011, a comprehensive review led by Secretaries Gates and Panetta was initiated to identify $400 billion in defense budget savings. The review focused on strategic considerations for achieving savings and involved key questions about essential military missions, strategic risks, and financial costs. DOD officials confirmed the launch of a robust review process based on the President's guidance. The SCMR, initiated by Secretary Hagel in March 2013, was internally-driven and focused on strategy and resourcing. Deputy Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter was tasked with leading the review, with OSD CAPE managing the process. The deadline for completion was set for May 31, 2013. The SCMR, led by Deputy Secretary Carter, was budget-driven and aimed to examine DOD spending. It considered three budget scenarios and focused on management efficiencies, compensation reforms, and force structure changes. The SCMR, led by Deputy Secretary Carter, focused on budget-driven reforms including management efficiencies, compensation changes, and force structure adjustments. The review concluded that drastic options could help DOD meet sequester-level budget caps. The SCMR, led by Deputy Secretary Carter, focused on budget-driven reforms to help DOD meet sequester-level topline caps. DOD officials emphasized that the SCMR generated ideas, not decisions, and the 2014 QDR process would be crucial for making tough strategic choices amidst fiscal constraints. Some suggest that increased austerity may prompt a reevaluation of defense strategy and the U.S. role on the world stage. In 2010, the Department of State and USAID issued the first QDDR report, initiated by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The QDDR process, directed by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, was based on the QDR and QHSR. The report proposed a reform agenda for the State Department, aligning with the 2010 NSS. There are no immediate plans for a second QDDR. The national intelligence architecture was overhauled post-9/11, but did not explicitly include a requirement for the QDDR. The lack of external mandate for the QICR and its classification have led to less attention compared to quadrennial reviews in national security debates. Congress has shown interest in potentially creating a statutory mandate for the QICR. Intelligence has conducted quadrennial intelligence reviews (QICR) modeled on the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR). There is no statutory mandate for a national intelligence strategy (NIS) to guide the QICR. QICRs have been executed in 2001, 2005, and 2009, with the 2009 review focusing on scenario-based exercises looking ahead to 2025. The 2009 QICR report described scenarios for future missions. Debate has focused on the role of strategy in national security, including decision-making, budgeting, planning, and oversight. Congress has raised issues about strategic reviews and reports, and the executive branch's execution of these activities. Key questions for evaluating performance and proposing changes have been highlighted. The optimal frequency for national security strategic reviews should balance updating strategic thinking with continuity for effective execution. In the defense arena, Congress requires submission of national security, defense, and military strategies periodically. Some suggest the need for more frequently updated internal guidance in today's fast-paced globalized age. Some question the need for annual National Security Strategies (NSS), suggesting they be issued less frequently, like once every four years, to avoid routinization and ensure responses to specific global changes are captured in policies. The frequency of strategy-crafting revisions is complicated by administrations not always complying with mandated frequency. Non-compliance makes it hard to assess the value of strategy mandates. How often should key strategic reviews be conducted, and does the level of strategy impact the need for revision frequency? The curr_chunk discusses the costs of revising a strategy too frequently or taking too long to revise it, as well as the challenges of complying with mandated submission frequencies. It also raises questions about the value of iterative strategy-generation and the appropriate oversight responsibility for national security strategy. The synchronization of strategic reviews, including the NSS, QDR, NDS, NMS, and CRA, is crucial to avoid disconnects and overlaps. Timelines for conducting reviews must align to facilitate this synchronization. Strategic reviews may inform each other by occurring concurrently or slightly earlier. The QDR report and defense strategy timelines align with submission deadlines for strategic reviews like the NSS and NMS to ensure coordination and avoid overlaps. The NMS development timelines have not always aligned with the submission of the QDR report and NDS, leading to gaps and inconsistencies in the defense strategy process. For example, the 2001 QDR Report was issued before the NSS, and the NMS was published in 2004, followed closely by the 2005 NDS. This lack of coherence in timeline sequencing has been a challenge in the national security defense arena. The QDR Report was published before the NSS in March 2006, raising questions about the importance of alignment in national security-related strategic efforts. Observers emphasize the need for prioritization and clear roles and responsibilities for effective strategy implementation. The importance of prioritization and clear roles and responsibilities in national security-related strategic efforts is emphasized for effective strategy implementation. Providing a framework for decision-making and communication with key audiences is crucial. Different agencies or components may perform various missions, requiring clear assignment of roles and responsibilities. Effective strategy implementation in national security-related efforts requires clear assignment of roles and responsibilities to prevent duplication of effort and ensure no gaps in responsibility. Prioritization of objectives and missions is crucial for agencies to plan and resource effectively. Most recent strategic efforts have lacked prioritization and assignment of roles, leading to potential inefficiencies in strategy implementation. The Defense Strategy Guidance (DSG) identified ten \"priority missions\" without prioritizing or assigning specific responsibilities. Some suggest the lack of specificity in strategy documents is due to the challenge of balancing detailed guidance for implementation with the need to communicate a strategic vision to the public. Calls have been made to institutionalize national security planning guidance to address the frustration over the lack of prioritization and assignment of roles. Calls for institutionalizing national security planning guidance (NSPG) have arisen to address the lack of prioritization and assignment of roles in strategy documents. This guidance could be a product of a strategic review process, similar to DOD processes, that generates both classified internal guidance and unclassified strategic guidance documents to satisfy internal and external audiences. Calls for institutionalizing national security planning guidance (NSPG) have emerged to address the lack of prioritization and role assignment in strategy documents. The Center for Strategic and International Studies proposed a Quadrennial National Security Review (QNSR) to produce NSPG and unclassified national security strategy. The 2006 QDR also emphasized the need for NSPG. Congress mandated national security planning guidance in the NDAA for FY2012, focusing on counter-terrorism priorities and roles. The question remains whether current national security strategic efforts effectively prioritize national interests, objectives, and approaches, as well as assign roles and responsibilities. The text discusses the need for strategic efforts to prioritize national interests, objectives, and roles effectively. It questions the potential benefits and drawbacks of incorporating prioritization and role assignment into strategic reviews and reports. The relationship between strategy-making and resourcing is also explored, with differing opinions on how they should inform each other. Some argue that strategy should consider fiscal realities, while others believe it should focus on objectives first. Statutory mandates for strategic reviews do not always require fiscal constraints, with some reports being unconstrained by budget parameters. Some observers recommend a more unified approach to linking national security budgeting with strategy. They question the advantages and disadvantages of using fiscal constraints to shape strategy reviews and reports. Suggestions include ensuring that strategic reviews directly influence policy and resource decisions through competitions of ideas like internal \"red team\" assessments. The use of red teams and internal competitions of ideas, such as President Eisenhower's \"Project Solarium,\" are recommended to challenge assumptions and conclusions in the formal review process. This approach involves multiple groups working on the same assignment to present their strategies for evaluation. A competition of ideas can take an external form, with external reviews conducted in parallel with a formal process. The national defense panel (NDP) is mandated to produce alternative force structures. The QDR independent panel (QDRIP) recommended the creation of a standing Independent Strategic Review Panel to assess the national security environment and current NSS. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of incorporating a competition of ideas into the national security strategy process. It raises questions about the advantages of internal and external competitions, as well as the significance of impartial adjudication for the competition's effectiveness."
