    "content": "The \"Healthy School Meals Act of 2010\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. The findings and purpose of the Act are outlined in Section 2. The findings show a significant increase in obesity prevalence among children aged 2 to 19 years. A study found that 70 percent of schools serve meals with high levels of saturated fat, linked to chronic diseases. The Centers for Disease Control predicts one in three children born in 2000 will develop diabetes. A Yale University study found that 25% of overweight and obese children aged 4 to 10 had impaired glucose tolerance, indicating a risk of diabetes. Healthy school meals are crucial in preventing weight and diet-related issues. Plant-based foods like vegetables, fruits, and legumes are recommended by medical associations for their low saturated fat and cholesterol content. Plant-based foods, including vegetables, fruits, legumes, grains, and dairy alternatives, are recommended for school meals. Many families in the US choose plant-based diets for health, ethical, or religious reasons. Studies show that plant-based diets are nutritionally adequate for everyone, including children, and offer health benefits. Soymilk fortified with calcium carbonate is a good alternative to cow's milk for calcium intake. The Department of Agriculture includes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes in its commodities. The Act aims to improve the health of American schoolchildren by promoting plant-based meals and dairy alternatives in schools to provide healthful options for school lunches. These ingredients are often underutilized or unavailable in many schools, but access to them is crucial for children's health. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"plant-based alternate protein product\" refers to a product meeting nutritional requirements without animal-based ingredients. \"Plant-based meat alternate\" is a meat substitute meeting nutritional requirements without animal-based ingredients. A plant-based entree is a main course that meets nutritional requirements for school lunches and contains no animal-based foods or products. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture. A substitute for fluid milk is a nondairy alternative that is nutritionally equivalent to dairy milk, meeting specific nutritional standards set by the Secretary of Agriculture. SEC. 4. HEALTHY SCHOOL MEALS PILOT PROGRAM. The Secretary will select school food authorities for a pilot program evaluating plant-based protein products and milk substitutes in school meal programs. Selection will be based on national representation in terms of size, location, and student socioeconomic levels. The Secretary will provide plant-based alternate protein products and substitute for fluid milk products to selected school food authorities for no cost, for use in school meal programs. The pilot program will evaluate the effectiveness of these products within 24 months of enactment. The Secretary will evaluate the pilot program to assess the cost-effectiveness, marketability, ease of preparation, and acceptance by children of plant-based alternate protein products and substitute for fluid milk products in schools. Additionally, any other factors and outcomes associated with increasing the availability of these products will be determined. The Secretary of Treasury will transfer $4,000,000 to the Secretary of Agriculture by October 15, 2011, for implementing the pilot program. The funds will be accepted without further appropriation. SEC. 5. PURCHASE OF PLANT-BASED COMMODITIES. The Secretary will deliver plant-based alternate protein products and substitute for fluid milk products to school lunch and breakfast programs within 24 months of the Act's enactment. Training materials on the nutritional benefits and preparation of these products will be provided to schools and food authorities. SEC. 6. COMMODITY ASSISTANCE FOR PLANT-BASED OPTIONS. The Secretary will provide plant-based alternate protein products and substitute for fluid milk products to school lunch and breakfast programs within 24 months of the Act's enactment. Training materials on the nutritional benefits and preparation of these products will be given to schools and food authorities. The Secretary will promulgate rules within 24 months of the Act's enactment to increase consumption of plant-based foods in school nutrition programs. This includes plant-based meat alternates and entrees, with specific recommendations based on Dietary Guidelines. Distribution will be provided to schools where at least two-thirds of students are offered plant-based entrees. The Secretary will require schools to offer a plant-based entree as part of the daily lunch menu, using a portion of commodity assistance or cash to purchase plant-based food products. The section authorizes appropriations for providing assistance or cash to school food authorities for offering plant-based entrees on daily school lunch menus. SEC. 7. SUBSTITUTE FOR FLUID MILK. Amendment to the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act allows schools to offer students a variety of fluid milk options, including flavored, unflavored, lactose-free, and nondairy substitutes that are nutritionally equivalent. The amendment to the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act allows schools to provide students with non-dairy milk options that meet nutritional standards for those with special dietary needs or disabilities. The amendment allows schools to provide non-dairy milk options for students with special dietary needs. Expenses for substitutions not covered by reimbursements will be paid by the school food authority. The amendment will take effect within 24 months of the enactment of the Act."
