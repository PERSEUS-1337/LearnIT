    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Magnetic Levitation (MAGLEV) Transportation Technology Deployment Act of 1997\". Congress finds that new transportation technologies are needed to develop environmentally sound and energy-efficient modes of transportation. MAGLEV technology is considered the best option for the traveling public and high-value freight shippers in distance corridors of 40 to 600 miles. MAGLEV is energy efficient, safe, and can help reduce accidents and costs associated with accidents on highways and rail lines. MAGLEV technology is efficient and safe for transportation, reducing accidents on highways and rail lines. It is unaffected by weather conditions, making it reliable for freight and passenger carriers. MAGLEV also utilizes existing highway rights-of-way and requires less land for infrastructure compared to roadways. Commercial feasibility studies show potential for public-private partnerships in high-speed ground transportation. The United States aims to establish a MAGLEV transportation system along Federal-aid highways and other rights-of-way as part of the national transportation system. Studies show potential for public-private partnerships in high-speed ground transportation networks.

The text introduces a new section in Chapter 3 of title 23, United States Code, for a Magnetic Levitation Transportation Technology Deployment Program. It defines eligible project costs and full project costs for MAGLEV projects. The Magnetic Levitation Transportation Technology Deployment Program defines eligible project costs for MAGLEV projects, including stations, vehicles, and equipment. It also clarifies terms like MAGLEV, partnership potential, and recognized pilot project. The Magnetic Levitation Transportation Technology Deployment Program mandates the establishment of a High-Speed Ground Transportation Office to coordinate and administer high-speed rail and MAGLEV programs, providing financial assistance for project costs. The Federal share of project costs for eligible MAGLEV projects shall not exceed 2/3. Financial assistance can only be used for eligible project costs. The Secretary will solicit applications for financial assistance for planning, design, and construction of MAGLEV projects from States or designated authorities. Project eligibility criteria will determine the recipients of financial assistance. To be eligible for financial assistance, a high-speed ground transportation project must involve a corridor with partnership potential or be part of a recognized pilot project. The project should not exceed specified federal and state funding limits, result in a revenue-producing transportation facility, and be a public-private partnership with at least 1/3 of costs covered by non-federal funds. The high-speed ground transportation project must use non-Federal funds, meet planning requirements, be approved by the Secretary, involve technology transfer if using non-U.S. MAGLEV technology, and use materials mostly manufactured in the U.S. Project selection criteria will be established by the Secretary to determine financial assistance recipients based on specific factors. The Secretary will establish criteria for selecting financial assistance recipients based on factors such as national significance, congestion reduction, job creation, financial contributions from states and localities, and fostering public-private partnerships for infrastructure development. The Secretary will evaluate eligible projects based on selection criteria and select one or more for financial assistance within 90 days of the application deadline. Joint ventures involving US and non-US entities can receive financial assistance if they meet eligibility requirements and are selected. The Secretary will conduct research grants and contracts for MAGLEV technology, safety, domestic technology development, and infrastructure. A report must be submitted within 180 days of the enactment of the Magnetic Levitation (MAGLEV) Transportation Technology Deployment Act of 1997. The Secretary will submit a report on progress in implementing the Magnetic Levitation (MAGLEV) Transportation Technology Deployment Act of 1997, including the establishment of the High-Speed Ground Transportation Office, applications for assistance, and public-private partnerships. Authorization of appropriations from the Highway Trust Fund for fiscal years is specified. The Magnetic Levitation (MAGLEV) Transportation Technology Deployment Act of 1997 authorizes appropriations for research grants and contracts totaling $200 million for fiscal year 1999, $200 million each for fiscal years 2000 and 2001, and $250 million each for fiscal years 2002 and 2003. Funds allocated shall remain available until expended, and approval of eligible projects is considered a contractual obligation of the United States. Additionally, $10 million is designated for research grants and contracts from fiscal years 1998 through 2003. The Surface Transportation Program and the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program can be used by the State to fund eligible projects without the need for non-Federal funds. Eligible projects selected under this section are also eligible for various forms of financial assistance authorized for highway projects. Additionally, a MAGLEV facility is considered eligible for tax-exempt bond financing under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. A MAGLEV facility is classified as a high-speed intercity rail facility with an average speed exceeding 150 miles per hour under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. An amendment is made to the analysis for chapter 3 of title 23, United States Code to reflect this classification. The curr_chunk is about the deployment program for magnetic levitation transportation technology."
