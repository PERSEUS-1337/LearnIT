The \"Revitalizing America's Commercial Entrepreneurs for Space Act\" allows the Secretary of Defense to assist the Secretary of Transportation in promoting private sector involvement in commercial space activities and public-private partnerships related to space transportation infrastructure. This includes maximizing the use and efficiency of the Department of Defense's space transportation infrastructure by the private sector in the United States. The \"Revitalizing America's Commercial Entrepreneurs for Space Act\" empowers the Secretary of Defense to collaborate with covered entities to reduce costs, encourage investment, and foster cooperation in the Department of Defense's space transportation infrastructure. The Secretary may enter into agreements with covered entities to provide support and services related to the infrastructure. The Secretary of Defense can collaborate with covered entities to provide support and services for space launch and reentry range support requirements, as long as it benefits the Federal Government, does not interfere with Department of Defense requirements, and does not compete with commercial space activities unless it is in the national security interests of the United States. The Secretary of Defense can enter into contracts with covered entities for contributions of funds, services, and equipment to support space launch and reentry range activities. Contributions must have full non-Federal funding and be used only for specified objectives.
