    "content": "The \"Helping College Students Cross the Finish Line Act\" allows grants to institutions to provide awards to undergraduate and vocational students with financial need to assist in completing degree and certificate programs. The Secretary awards grants to institutions of higher education to establish financial assistance programs for eligible students. Institutions must award funds to at least 100 students per academic year who are enrolled at least half-time as undergraduates or vocational students. The Secretary awards grants to institutions of higher education for financial assistance programs for eligible students. Students must be enrolled at least half-time, academically able to complete their program within a year, in good academic standing, have outstanding tuition payment, and have previously maintained good academic standing. The institution of higher education provides financial assistance to eligible students who are at risk of discontinuing their degree program due to inability to pay tuition. The grant amount is capped at $1,000 or the amount of tuition the student cannot afford for the semester. Students can only receive one award under this program. Each institution of higher education receiving a grant under subsection (a) must provide information to covered students on financial assistance available from sources other than this section. Covered students are defined as those receiving awards under the institution's financial assistance program. The Secretary will create a financial literacy survey for students receiving awards from higher education institutions. The survey will cover topics like budgeting, saving, student loan debt, and career planning. Each institution receiving a grant must submit an annual report to the Secretary. The annual report must include the number of students who received financial assistance, completed their program, enrolled in a higher-level program, and their subsequent enrollment status. The Secretary shall annually submit to Congress a report on the implementation of the program, including aggregate data from all institutions of higher education, analysis of the grant program, and any other necessary information. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2015 through 2020 is provided for the implementation of the program."
