    "content": "Thousands of oil and chemical spills occur in the United States each year, with state and local officials being the first responders. The National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP) guides federal response to these incidents, covering oil discharges into U.S. waters and releases of hazardous substances. The NCP includes hundreds of designated hazardous substances and is authorized by federal statutes. The National Contingency Plan (NCP) is codified in federal regulation and authorized by multiple statutes. Unlike other emergency response plans, the NCP's regulations have the force of law. It was developed after the 1967 Torrey Canyon oil spill and later formalized by the Clean Water Act in 1972 to address oil spills and hazardous substance releases in U.S. waters. The National Contingency Plan (NCP) was explicitly directed to carry out federal authorities and has been revised multiple times since 1968 to implement additional statutory authorities. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) was enacted in response to contaminated sites like Love Canal, addressing hazardous substance releases. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) was enacted after the Exxon Valdez oil spill to address oil spills separately from CERCLA. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) clarified and expanded oil spill response authorities, extending to U.S. waters within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and directing revisions to the National Contingency Plan (NCP). The NCP is routinely applied to respond to various incidents involving oil discharges and hazardous substances across the United States. Coordination of respondents and availability of resources are common issues in responding to incidents of different magnitudes and complexities. The NCP provides background information on federal response to incidents like the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. It discusses federal statutes, reporting mechanisms, coordination of federal, state, and local roles, funding mechanisms, and integration with the National Contingency Plan. The National Contingency Plan (NCP) has been revised multiple times since 1968 to establish procedures for responding to incidents involving oil discharge or hazardous substance release. The NCP may be integrated within the National Response Framework (NRF) for major disasters or emergencies. The Appendix provides a chronology of NCP development, and funding and liability details are discussed in the report. The 1972 amendments to the Clean Water Act added Section 311 to provide authority for the President to respond to oil or hazardous substance discharges into US waters. The NCP was expanded to cover both oil and hazardous substances, with requirements for coordination between federal, state, and local entities. CERCLA in 1980 further empowered the President to respond to releases. CERCLA expanded federal response authority to address releases of pollutants and contaminants into the environment that may pose a significant danger to public health. It directed the President to revise the NCP to include a plan for responding to such incidents. The NCP was revised to include a plan for responding to incidents, as directed by CERCLA. SARA further amended the NCP to expand criteria for evaluating contaminated sites for the NPL. The primary purpose of the NPL is to identify the most threatening sites for federal involvement in long-term remediation. Sites needing short-term response actions do not require NPL listing for federal involvement. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 clarified the President's authorities under the Clean Water Act to respond to incidents. The President's authorities under Section 311 of the Clean Water Act, as amended by OPA, direct the revision of the NCP to develop procedures for oil spill response. Executive orders delegate these response authorities to federal departments and agencies for implementing the NCP. Executive Order 12580 and Executive Order 12777 delegated the President's authorities to respond to hazardous substances and oil discharges, respectively. EPA and the U.S. Coast Guard are generally responsible for coordinating federal responses within the inland and coastal zones, as defined in the NCP. The NCP defines the inland and coastal zones for coordinating federal responses to hazardous substances and oil discharges. EPA has sole responsibility for revising the NCP regulations, consulting with the U.S. Coast Guard and other federal agencies before proposing revisions for public comment. Executive Order 12580 established lead agency roles for responding to hazardous substance releases at federal facilities and vessels, delegating response authorities to the Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Energy (DOE). Revisions to the National Contingency Plan (NCP) are subject to the federal rulemaking process and review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The Department of Defense (DOD) is responsible for responding to incidents involving the removal of military weapons and munitions under its jurisdiction. Other federal agencies may lead the response under CERCLA in nonemergency situations. The U.S. Coast Guard retains the lead role in responding to oil discharges from federal facilities or vessels within the coastal zone. The EPA leads responses to incidents at federal facilities or vessels in the inland zone, while the U.S. Coast Guard or EPA directs responses within their respective zones. The NCP designates federal departments' lead roles in responding to oil discharges or hazardous substance releases, triggered by incident reporting to the National Response Center. The U.S. Coast Guard administers the National Response Center, collects data on incidents, and notifies federal departments. Parties must report oil discharges or hazardous substance releases exceeding allowable amounts to the National Response Center. Oil discharges include those violating water quality standards or causing sheens on water surfaces. Reportable quantities of hazardous substances vary by individual substance in pounds (and kilograms), and in curies (and becquerels) for individual radionuclides designated as hazardous substances. State or local officials, or members of the public, who witness a discharge or release may report the incident. State or local officials acting as first responders on-site may contact the National Response Center for federal attention. The National Response System (NRS) coordinates the federal response to incidents. The National Response System (NRS) is a multi-tiered framework for coordinating the federal response to oil discharges or hazardous substance releases. It establishes the roles of federal, state, and local governments, as well as private entities contributing resources. The NRS can expand or contract based on the incident's size and complexity. The National Response Team (NRT) comprises 15 federal departments and agencies. The National Response Team (NRT) is made up of 15 federal departments and agencies, with the Environmental Protection Agency serving as the Chair and the U.S. Coast Guard as the Vice-Chair. Each department has a specific role outlined in the National Contingency Plan (NCP) for responding to oil discharges or hazardous substance releases. The U.S. Coast Guard can act as the Chair for a federal response as delegated by the President's executive order. The U.S. Coast Guard becomes the \"acting\" Chair of the NRT for a federal response to oil discharge or hazardous substance release in the coastal zone, with EPA as the acting Vice-Chair. EPA remains the Chair for responses in the inland zone. NRT departments have skilled personnel and specialized equipment for an effective federal response, including HHS expertise in assessing public health threats. The CDC assesses public health threats from oil discharges, particularly in incidents like the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. Federal departments and agencies are part of the NRT to respond to hazardous incidents related to their activities. The U.S. Navy Supervisor of Salvage has specialized equipment to respond to pollution incidents involving naval vessels, which can also be used for civilian incidents in ocean environments. The NCP allows various government entities to participate in the federal response to incidents through Regional Response Teams. Each region has a designated official from federal departments or agencies, and governors can also appoint officials. The NCP allows government officials from states, territories, and Indian tribes to participate in Regional Response Teams. These officials are expected to be the first responders at the scene of a discharge or release to take initial response actions, including conducting evacuations if necessary. The NCP allows state, territorial, or local officials to conduct evacuations as first responders and notify the National Response Center for federal involvement. The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) mandates the creation of State Emergency Response Commissions (SERC), Local Emergency Planning Committees (LEPCs), and local emergency response plans integrated into area-specific response plans. Area Committees support these efforts. Area Committees support Regional Response Teams in preparing for oil or hazardous substance discharges into U.S. waters. The President designates qualified personnel from federal, state, territorial, and local agencies to serve on these committees. Their primary function is to prepare an Area Contingency Plan (ACP) for a designated geographic area within a region, ensuring an effective response to discharges from vessels, offshore facilities, or onshore facilities. CERCLA does not explicitly authorize Area Committees for hazardous substance releases. The Regional Response Teams may fulfill the planning functions of Area Committees in inland areas not covered by the Clean Water Act. A high-level federal official directs and coordinates on-the-ground actions at the scene of a discharge of oil or hazardous substances, with a pre-designated On-Scene Coordinator overseeing the development of Area Contingency Plans for consistency with regulatory procedures. The development of ACPs by Area Committees ensures consistency with NCP regulatory procedures. EPA designates OSCs for oil discharge incidents inland, while the U.S. Coast Guard does so in coastal zones. OSCs, typically U.S. Coast Guard Captains of the Port, coordinate responses to oil discharges in coastal areas. Lead agency roles were established by the NCP in line with executive orders delegating response authorities. OSCs make final decisions on federal response actions. The OSC determines federal response actions, allocates funds, delegates responsibilities, and decides when the response is complete under the NCP. State and local officials can participate in federal responses, but can also act under their own authorities. EPA and the U.S. Coast Guard usually serve as OSCs, but the Secretary of Homeland Security can lead responses under the NCP. The Secretary of Homeland Security can take the lead in directing a response under the NCP in specific situations, including in the coastal zone and as the principal federal official for incident management in response to terrorist attacks or disasters. This authority is granted by Homeland Security Presidential Directive 5 issued in 2003. The Secretary of Homeland Security can take the lead in responding to incidents under the National Contingency Plan (NCP) in certain situations, such as when multiple federal agencies are involved, or when directed by the President. The Secretary's involvement is typically reserved for larger, more complex incidents, like the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The NCP establishes differing roles for responding to incidents, with the Administrator of EPA responsible for designating a SONS in the inland zone and the Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard responsible for the coastal zone. Appointed officials assist the OSC in coordinating resources and communicating with affected parties and the public. The U.S. Coast Guard may appoint a National Incident Commander (NIC) to assume the role of the OSC in certain situations. This designation does not change oil response procedures or provide additional funds. The Deepwater Horizon spill in 2010 was classified as a SONS, with Admiral Thad Allen appointed as the NIC. Non-governmental entities may also participate in federal responses under the direction of the OSC. Private contractors, general public, and industry groups are involved in oil spill response efforts as per the Clean Water Act. Facilities and vessels must have response plans in place to address oil or hazardous substance discharges. Contracts with oil spill removal organizations are common for planning requirements. Nongovernmental entities are encouraged to commit resources for federal response operations. Nongovernmental entities, individual volunteers, and dedicated trust funds are involved in federal response operations for oil spills and hazardous substance releases. Area Committees establish procedures for volunteer participation, and Congress has established trust funds to finance response costs. The U.S. Coast Guard administers the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, funded by a per-barrel tax on oil, to respond to oil discharges. The EPA administers the Hazardous Substance Superfund Trust Fund, financed by Treasury revenues, to respond to hazardous substance releases. The Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund and Superfund Trust Fund differ in how funds are made available for response actions. The Oil Spill Trust Fund has mandatory appropriations, while the Superfund Trust Fund requires discretionary appropriations before funds can be used. The Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund and Superfund Trust Fund differ in funding availability for response actions. Congress appropriates funds annually from the trust fund to EPA's Superfund account for response capabilities. Separate portions are reserved for emergency \"removal\" and long-term \"remedial\" actions. Recovered funds from responsible parties go back into the respective trust fund. If responsible parties are not financially viable, the trust fund may pay for federal response actions. The Oil Pollution Act (OPA) and Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) establish financial liability for parties responsible for oil discharges and hazardous substance releases. OPA covers response costs, natural resource damages, and economic damages, while CERCLA includes response costs, natural resource damages, and federal public health study costs. Unlike OPA, CERCLA does not have a separate category for economic damages. CERCLA does not cover economic damages from hazardous substance releases, but the federal government can still respond to incidents using funds from the Stafford Act. The Stafford Act can be used to pay for federal response to oil spills or hazardous substance releases during disasters or emergencies when there is no responsible party to pursue. The National Response Framework coordinates federal response plans for all types of hazards. The National Response Framework (NRF) coordinates federal response plans for various hazards, but it is not an operational plan like the National Contingency Plan (NCP). Through Emergency Support Function (ESF) #10 of the NRF, the Secretary of Homeland Security can apply the NCP for incidents involving oil spills or hazardous material releases that require a coordinated federal response. This may occur during major disasters or emergencies declared under the Stafford Act when state and local authorities are overwhelmed and federal assistance is requested. The National Response Framework (NRF) coordinates federal response plans for various hazards, but it is not an operational plan like the National Contingency Plan (NCP). The NCP is applied by the Secretary of Homeland Security under ESF #10 for incidents involving oil spills or hazardous material releases that require a coordinated federal response. This may occur during major disasters or emergencies when state and local authorities are overwhelmed and federal assistance is requested. The National Contingency Plan (NCP) is applied as a stand-alone regulatory authority for incidents like the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, regardless of involvement in other federal response plans under the National Response Framework (NRF). The NCP, established in 1968, has been revised multiple times to address oil spills and hazardous substance releases. The National Contingency Plan (NCP) was established in the Johnson Administration to address oil and hazardous materials pollution incidents. The plan included a Joint Operations Center, national and regional reaction teams, and was later revised in April 1970 under the Water Quality Improvement Act to include specific details for oil removal and response coordination. The act granted the President authority to act for oil removal if necessary. In June 1970, the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) published the National Oil and Hazardous Materials Pollution Contingency Plan, establishing the National Response Center and roles for response teams. In August 1971, CEQ modified the plan, renaming it the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan and assigning roles to the EPA and NOAA. In October 1972, the Clean Water Act amended the NCP to address hazardous substances and oil. In August 1973, Executive Order 11735 delegated authorities to federal agencies, including EPA and the Coast Guard. CEQ published a revised NCP in August 1973, codified in 40 C.F.R. Part 1510. CEQ issued a revised NCP in February 1975 based on feedback from the 1973 version. In December 1977, the Clean Water Act Amendments required revisions to the NCP to address \"imminent threats\" of oil and hazardous substance discharges. In March 1980, the NCP was revised based on the 1977 amendments and experiences with high-profile spills. The 1980 changes included state participation, local contingency plans, and a national pollution equipment inventory. In December 1980, the CERCLA required procedures for prioritizing and responding to releases of hazardous substances to be incorporated into the NCP. Executive Order 12316 in August 1981 delegated authority to EPA to amend the NCP. EPA issued a revised version of the NCP in July 1982. In July 1982, EPA issued a revised National Contingency Plan (NCP) pursuant to CERCLA, largely unchanged but with added regulations addressing hazardous substance response activities. In November 1985, the NCP was further revised to include \"applicable or relevant and appropriate requirements\" (ARARs) during response activities. The Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) in October 1986 amended various provisions of CERCLA and directed the President to revise the NCP accordingly. Executive Order 12580 in January 1987 delegated functions assigned to the President in CERCLA, as amended by SARA. EPA revised the NCP in March 1990 based on Executive Order 12580. In October 1990, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) was enacted in response to the Exxon Valdez oil spill, granting the President authority to initiate cleanup using federal resources. Executive Order 12777 in October 1991 delegated functions from OPA, and in September 1994, the NCP was revised by EPA based on OPA and Clean Water Act amendments. In September 1994, the EPA revised the National Contingency Plan (NCP) based on the Oil Pollution Act (OPA) and Clean Water Act amendments. The modifications included new authorities for the President to direct oil spill responses, as well as provisions for the National Strike Force Coordination Center, Area Committees, Area Contingency Plans (ACPs), and response planning requirements for vessels and facilities."
