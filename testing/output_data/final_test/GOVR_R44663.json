He found a negative relationship between unemployment and wage growth in the UK and US, showing that wages tended to grow faster when the unemployment rate was lower. This was attributed to supply and demand dynamics in the labor market. The Phillips curve, named after economist A. W. Phillips, established a negative relationship between unemployment and inflation. This led policymakers in the 1960s to believe they could control unemployment and inflation rates. However, economists later criticized the model as too simplistic. The Phillips curve established a negative relationship between unemployment and inflation, leading policymakers to believe they could control both. Critics argued the model was too simplistic and would break down in the presence of persistent positive inflation. This led to the development of the natural rate model, which suggests a certain level of unemployment is consistent with stable inflation, known as the natural rate of unemployment. The natural rate of unemployment, also known as NAIRU, is the level at which inflation is stable. If the unemployment rate is below this level, inflation is expected to accelerate, and if it exceeds it, inflation is expected to decelerate. The natural rate model gained support in the 1970s due to events like stagflation, where high unemployment and high inflation occurred simultaneously. The economy's potential output depends on capital, labor, and technology in the long run. The economy's potential output is determined by capital, labor, and technology in the long run. Actual output is influenced by demand for goods and services, which can vary from potential output. Equilibrium is reached when actual output matches potential output, ensuring stability. Inflation becomes less stable as actual output deviates from potential output. When actual output diverges from potential output, inflation becomes less stable. A positive output gap is created when actual output exceeds potential output, leading to inflation acceleration. Conversely, a negative output gap is generated when actual output is below potential output, causing inflation to decelerate. The natural rate of unemployment in the natural rate model ensures stable inflation when actual output equals potential output. During an economic expansion, total demand can surpass potential output, creating a positive output gap. Firms hire additional employees to meet the increased demand as it takes time to expand production capacity. During economic expansions, firms hire more workers to meet increased demand, leading to higher wages. This results in upward pressure on prices as labor costs rise. Conversely, in economic downturns, firms reduce hiring or lay off employees, causing the unemployment rate to rise and weakening workers' bargaining power for higher wages. During economic expansions, firms hire more workers to meet increased demand, leading to higher wages. This results in upward pressure on prices as labor costs rise. Conversely, in economic downturns, firms reduce hiring or lay off employees, causing the unemployment rate to rise and weakening workers' bargaining power for higher wages. As the rate rises, workers have less bargaining power for higher wages, making them easier to replace. Firms can delay price increases as wages become cheaper, resulting in decreased inflation. The natural rate of unemployment is not constant and is influenced by factors such as labor market composition, institutions, productivity growth, and long-term unemployment rates. Changes in the economy can alter the natural unemployment rate. Individual worker's characteristics, such as age, education, and work experience, can impact the natural rate of unemployment. Younger workers with less experience tend to have higher unemployment levels, while those with higher education levels find it easier to find work. Labor market institutions and public policies also play a role in influencing individuals' ability to find employment. Improving individuals' ability to find work can decrease the natural rate of unemployment. Factors like apprenticeship programs and productivity growth impact this rate. Compensation growth tied to productivity can affect inflation. The natural rate of unemployment can be influenced by factors such as compensation growth, productivity growth, and long-term unemployment levels. Workers may resist slower wage growth, leading to layoffs and higher unemployment rates. On the other hand, increased productivity can lower unemployment by boosting profits and creating more job opportunities. Long periods of unemployment can decrease skills and make individuals less attractive to employers. The natural rate of unemployment is affected by factors like compensation and productivity growth, as well as long-term unemployment levels. Long breaks in employment can signal low labor market commitment or worker quality, leading to fewer job offers. Understanding the relationship between the current unemployment rate and the natural rate is crucial for designing economic policy, especially considering that the natural rate can shift over time. The estimated natural rate has been relatively stable, with inflection points due to changes in the labor force and productivity growth. The natural rate of unemployment, as shown in Figure 1, increased in the late 1950s to early 1970s due to inexperienced workers entering the labor force. It began to decrease in the 1980s, with a sharp decline in the early 1990s attributed to productivity growth. The rise in productivity was mainly driven by advancements in technology like computers and the Internet. From 2008, the natural rate started to increase again. The natural rate of unemployment sharply increased after 2007 due to changes in the labor force and government policy. The rise was also influenced by a significant number of long-term unemployed individuals after the 2007-2009 recession. Research suggests that extended unemployment benefits may have contributed to the increase. Additionally, a decrease in productivity growth may have played a role in the rise of the natural rate of unemployment. The decrease in productivity growth to 0.7% between 2009 and 2016 impacted inflation rates. Expected inflation and supply shocks also influence inflation. Expectations of future inflation affect economic decisions, such as salary increases and price setting by firms. An increase in expected inflation leads to an actual increase in inflation as wages and prices adjust. Economic events affecting the supply of goods or services also impact inflation. Supply shocks, like a reduction in oil supply, can impact inflation by increasing prices. Policymakers focus on negative supply shocks, but positive ones can reduce inflation. Events post-2007 recession question the relationship between unemployment gap and inflation. During the U.S. 2007-2009 recession, the unemployment rate rose above 10%, remaining elevated compared to the natural rate. Inflation decreased modestly from 2% to 1.4%, defying expectations of a more drastic decline. Various hypotheses exist regarding the relationship between unemployment gap and inflation post-crisis. The U.S. economy has become more integrated with the global economy, leading to the suggestion that global economic forces play a larger role in domestic inflation dynamics. Trade has significantly expanded in the United States since the 1980s, increasing from less than 20% of GDP to more than 30%. The United States' trade has expanded significantly, reaching over 30% of GDP between 2011 and 2013. The output gap in the US after the 2007-2009 recession was larger than in other advanced economies, potentially impacting inflation dynamics. Researchers have found mixed evidence on the global output gap's influence on domestic inflation. Researchers have found mixed evidence on the impact of the global output gap on domestic inflation dynamics, with some suggesting a link while others finding no relationship. The strength of this influence does not appear to be related to changes in trade openness. Despite the smaller output gap abroad and changes in trade openness, there was a modest decrease in inflation after the 2007-2009 recession, with alternative explanations pointing to the global financial crisis and decreased external access. After the 2007-2009 recession, the global financial crisis led to decreased access to external financing for businesses. Some economists argue that this decreased supply of external financing increased borrowing costs for businesses, causing them to raise prices to remain solvent. Limited empirical evidence supports this behavior during the recession, which may explain the modest decrease in inflation following the crisis. Changes in inflation expectations post-recession, influenced by shifts in Federal Reserve policy, may have contributed to the moderate decrease in inflation rates. Previously, economic shocks would lead to higher inflation and expectations, causing a cycle of further inflation. However, the Fed's focus on stable inflation post-1980s led to less volatile inflation fluctuations. The Federal Reserve's policy regime post-1980s led to decreased volatility in inflation rates during economic shocks. Economic actors believed the Fed would stabilize inflation changes, resulting in a more stable inflation environment. In the 1990s, the Fed began targeting a specific inflation rate of 2.5% core inflation per year to further stabilize inflation expectations. The Federal Reserve's inflation target has led to anchored inflation expectations, with core inflation hovering around 2% since the 1990s. This anchoring effect creates a positive feedback loop, pushing actual inflation back to the target rate after any shocks. The increased level of inflation anchoring post-2007-2009 recession may impact future policymaking. If inflation becomes more anchored, policymakers can use monetary and fiscal policy more freely. However, loss of confidence in the Federal Reserve could lead to unanchored inflation expectations and increased volatility. The global financial crisis saw a significant rise in long-term unemployment. The percentage of unemployed individuals jobless for over 26 weeks rose to over 45% after the 2007-2008 recession, significantly higher than any other post-WWII era. Some economists argue that inflation dynamics are driven by short-term unemployment rather than total unemployment, leading to long-term unemployed being essentially removed from contention for job opportunities. The long-term unemployed have less impact on wage-setting decisions compared to the short-term unemployed, leading to a lesser impact on inflation. Following the 2007-2009 recession, the total unemployment rate remained elevated for about seven and a half years due to the unprecedented increase in long-term unemployment. Short-term unemployment fell to pre-recession levels quicker than long-term unemployment. Research suggests that using the short-term unemployment gap rather than the total unemployment gap for forecasting inflation post-recession leads to more accurate predictions. Policymakers are advised to consider weighting the short-term unemployment rate more heavily than the long-term rate when evaluating the impact of monetary or fiscal policies on inflation. The natural rate model for estimating inflation post-financial crisis may be inadequate. Researchers are exploring alternative indicators, such as a new measure of economic slack based on recent minimum unemployment rates, to forecast inflation more accurately. This measure calculates the difference between the current unemployment rate and the minimum rate over the past 11 quarters, showing a relationship where inflation tends to decrease as the current unemployment rate rises above the minimum rate. The relationship between inflation and unemployment post-financial crisis is being reevaluated. Researchers are investigating reasons for the mild decrease in inflation, with various explanations being considered, such as increased financing costs and changes in the financial markets. Researchers are exploring the reasons for the mild decrease in inflation post-financial crisis, including changes in financial markets and the impact of long-term unemployment. The natural rate model suggests limitations to fiscal and monetary policies in spurring higher employment and alternative policies for economic growth. According to the natural rate model, maintaining an unemployment rate below the natural rate will lead to increasing inflation until unemployment returns to its natural rate, resulting in more volatile growth. Higher inflation levels can hinder economic growth, limiting expansionary economic policies in the long run. The impact of inflation on economic growth is discussed further in the following section. The relationship between unemployment and the natural rate is used as a benchmark to determine positive or negative output gaps. The unemployment gap is a reliable measure of the overall output gap. Policymakers avoid targeting unemployment below the natural rate to prevent accelerating inflation, which disrupts pricing mechanisms and leads to suboptimal economic decisions. Economic actors divert resources to protect themselves from inflation, impacting productivity. Inflation's impact on economic growth is more pronounced at higher levels than recent decades in the United States. Inefficient decisions due to inflation reduce incomes, economic growth, and living standards. It is generally accepted that keeping inflation low minimizes distortions in the economy. Zero inflation may lead to deflation, which is considered more costly as decreasing prices discourage consumer spending. The Federal Reserve aims for a low inflation rate around 2% to balance risks of deflation and decreased aggregate demand. The relationship between unemployment gap and inflation has weakened, despite expansionary policies in place. Inflation's impact on economic growth is more significant at higher levels, with low inflation minimizing distortions in the economy. The current state of the economy suggests a weakened relationship between inflation and the unemployment rate, which has implications for economic policy. This may allow for more aggressive fiscal and monetary policies without accelerating inflation as expected. However, if inflation were to accelerate, a longer period of elevated unemployment may be needed to stabilize inflation. Further research and time are necessary to understand this relationship. Further research is needed to determine if the weakened relationship between inflation and unemployment is temporary or a more enduring shift. The Federal Reserve's inability to meet their inflation target despite falling unemployment rates suggests the unemployment gap may no longer accurately reflect the output gap. Persistent slack in the labor market from the 2007-2009 recession may be contributing to the difference between the two gaps. Persistent slack in the labor market post-2007-2009 recession, not reflected in official unemployment rate. Alternative measures show lingering weakness, with labor force participation rate dropping. Unemployment rate doesn't account for those who stopped looking for work, potentially understating economic slack. CBO estimates current output gap, while unemployment gap appears to have vanished. Multiple labor market measures may be beneficial post-recession damage. After the 2007-2009 recession, using multiple labor market measures is beneficial to assess unemployment and output gap. Alternative economic policies can target higher output without accelerating inflation by reducing the natural rate of unemployment. Factors affecting the natural rate include labor force composition, market institutions, productivity growth, and long-term unemployment levels. Improving the labor force and matching process efficiency can lower the natural rate of unemployment. Policies like job training programs and infrastructure investment can lower the natural rate of unemployment. Government interventions during economic downturns can prevent long-term unemployment spikes."
