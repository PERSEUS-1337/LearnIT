    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The California POLST eRegistry Pilot Act, known as Section 4788, establishes the POLST eRegistry Pilot for electronic submission and transmission of Physician Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment (POLST) information to authorized users. The California POLST eRegistry Pilot Act establishes a pilot project for an electronic registry system to collect and disseminate patient's POLST information. The authority will implement this section after ensuring sufficient nonstate funds are available for development, startup costs, and evaluation of the pilot. The POLST eRegistry Pilot will be coordinated by the authority and operated as part of health information exchange networks or by an independent contractor. It may test various methods of electronically providing POLST information and will inform the permanent statewide operation of a POLST eRegistry. The authority will establish guidelines for the POLST eRegistry Pilot, seeking input from stakeholders and holding public meetings. The guidelines will cover submitting and withdrawing POLST information electronically, disseminating information to authorized users, and verifying user identity. The procedures for verifying user identity and protecting the confidentiality of POLST information submitted to the eRegistry Pilot, including the requirement for patients to receive confirmation of receipt. Patients and their decisionmakers can modify or withdraw information with their healthcare provider. Prior to implementation, a detailed plan must be submitted to the Legislature explaining how the eRegistry Pilot will operate. The plan for the POLST eRegistry Pilot must comply with state and federal privacy laws, including the Confidentiality of Medical Information Act and HIPAA regulations. When the POLST eRegistry Pilot is operational in their area, a physician must include POLST information in the patient's medical record and submit a copy to the eRegistry, unless the patient opts out. When the POLST eRegistry Pilot is operational, healthcare providers must make electronic POLST information available through the eRegistry to other providers in the same geographic area. In accordance with Section 4782, a health care provider honoring a patient's request from the POLST eRegistry Pilot is protected from legal sanctions if acting in good faith. An independent contractor will evaluate the pilot program, which is set to be repealed on January 1, 2020 unless extended by a new statute."
