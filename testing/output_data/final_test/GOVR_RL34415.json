    "content": "At a NATO summit in Bucharest, Romania in April 2008, the issue of membership for Albania, Croatia, and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was discussed. This marked the third round of enlargement since the Cold War. Previous enlargements in 1999 and 2004 included countries like Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Slovenia, and Slovakia. These expansions were strategic due to their location and historical conflicts. At a NATO summit in Bucharest, Albania and Croatia were invited to join the alliance, but Greece blocked Macedonia's invitation due to a name dispute. NATO's purpose now includes missions against terrorism and weapons proliferation, requiring a global military reach. The allies are urged to develop more deployable forces, while small member states focus on niche capabilities like special forces. NATO also conducts collective security missions, such as peacekeeping in Kosovo. Albania and Croatia, small countries with small militaries, have aspirations to join the European Union and NATO. Despite their limited resources, they have made consistent contributions to NATO operations. Albania and Croatia, small countries with aspirations to join the European Union and NATO, have made consistent contributions to NATO operations. The continuing instability in the region, exacerbated by Serbia's and Russia's negative reactions to Kosovo's independence, highlights the potential role of these two countries in stabilizing southeastern Europe. The report will discuss the selection process for candidate states, including the responsibilities of Congress and allied governments in approving Albania and Croatia. It will also analyze political factors for qualification, external issues such as Russia's views, and current conditions in the nominated states. Additionally, there will be a brief analysis of the debate over Georgia and Ukraine's qualifications for NATO's Membership Action Plan. The NATO founding instrument, the Washington Treaty of 1949, outlines general qualifications for membership, including democracy, rule of law, military strength, and peaceful dispute resolution. The process for joining NATO has evolved since the Cold War, with the Membership Action Plan (MAP) providing guidelines for aspiring candidates. Georgia and Ukraine were not granted the MAP at Bucharest due to alliance division. An appendix will review key enlargement legislation from the past fifteen years. Since the end of the Cold War, NATO's membership process has evolved. In 1994, NATO established the Partnership for Peace (PFP) program for non-member states to train with NATO forces and seek closer ties. The 1995 Study on NATO Enlargement outlined requirements for candidate states, including democratic structures, market economy, human rights respect, and settling disputes with neighbors. The Balkan conflicts of the 1990s emphasized the importance of resolving disputes for NATO membership. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO evolved into a collective security and defense organization. Prospective members must develop military forces trained for peacekeeping, state-building, and collective defense. The Membership Action Plan (MAP) outlines specific steps for countries to follow to become a member, such as civilian oversight of the military and resolving border disputes. The admission of Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary in 1999 led to a more detailed process for prospective members. The Membership Action Plan (MAP) is evaluated by allies, with some criticism that it is influenced by the United States. Critics argue that the decision on MAP requirements is mainly made in Washington, and the process is more political than based on actual qualifications. U.S. officials disagree, stating that consensus among member governments is needed for inviting candidate states to join NATO. In Bucharest, consensus among member governments was crucial for approving invitations to join NATO. Greece's opposition to Macedonia hindered Skopje's invitation. Albania and Macedonia faced governance issues, but had made progress in military reform and had strong public support for NATO membership. Croatia had a stable political environment with increasing public support for NATO membership. The NATO membership issue was discussed at a foreign ministers' meeting in March 2008, but a decision was delayed due to unresolved issues, including Macedonia's name. France and Germany had reservations about offering Membership Action Plans (MAP) to Georgia and Ukraine, with Spain and Italy sharing their views. A protocol for Albania and Croatia is expected to be signed by July 2008, outlining NATO's expectations for the prospective members. Member governments will then amend the Washington Treaty to admit new states. NATO is in the process of amending the Washington Treaty to admit new states. Different member states have varying processes for approving new entries, with the United States Senate having the authority to give its consent by a two-thirds majority. The next NATO summit, scheduled for late 2009 on the French-German border, aims to admit prospective candidate states. The United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee holds authority to consider the issue of NATO enlargement. Hearings are held to discuss the costs, qualifications, and implications of enlargement, as well as NATO's future missions. The Bush Administration supports keeping the door to NATO open to qualified states. The United States supports NATO enlargement and believes in keeping the door open to qualified states. NATO has evolved beyond defense to include political agendas such as energy security and disaster relief. The US plays a leading role in the MAP process, requiring candidate states to develop professional military, democratic structures, and civilian control of the military. The Bush Administration also advocates for NATO governments to join the European Union for stability. Some NATO members feel the Bush Administration is less committed to the alliance than previous administrations. The Bush Administration's view on NATO has evolved, with a shift towards engaging all allied governments in decision-making. Meetings of the North Atlantic Council have become more productive, and the Administration supported invitations to Albania, Croatia, and Macedonia at Bucharest. The US acknowledges the need for these states to improve their militaries and political institutions. The Bush Administration supports the idea of a \"NATO with global partners\" to improve political stabilization in southeastern Europe. They engage countries like Australia, New Zealand, and Japan in efforts to stabilize Afghanistan without actively promoting their NATO membership. Some allies questioned inviting Georgia and Ukraine to join the MAP process at Bucharest. President Bush made a visible tour of Georgia before the summit. President Bush promoted Georgia and Ukraine for NATO Membership Action Plan (MAP) despite opposition from some allies. The Administration supports extending Partnership for Peace to central Asian governments for logistical support in Afghanistan and energy security reasons. The considerations for candidate states' NATO membership include political factors like stability in southeastern Europe, Russia's role in European security, and bilateral relations. NATO's actions in Kosovo and the EU's decision on Kosovo's independence are examples of how enlargement can contribute to regional stability. Serbia and Russia strongly opposed Kosovo's independence in 2008. The US and most EU countries recognized Kosovo's independence, leading to violent reactions in Serbia. Serbian leaders refuse to accept Kosovo's independence, with some possibly inciting unrest among the Serbian minority in northern Kosovo. NATO Secretary General described Serbia as nationalistic. Albania and Croatia recognized Kosovo, with Macedonia expected to follow. Croatia has acted as a mediator between the US, Europe, and Serbia. Croatia has resettled half of the 300,000 Serb refugees who fled during the Balkan conflicts of the 1990s. European governments report minimal discrimination against Serbians in Croatia. Some member states believe the ability of candidate states to reconcile with Serbia from the 1990s conflicts could stabilize southeastern Europe. Others argue NATO should accommodate Belgrade before absorbing new members. Russia's role in European security is a concern for the US and its allies. Russia's opposition to the inclusion of candidate states in NATO, particularly Ukraine and Georgia, is a significant concern for the United States and its allies. President Putin has made threats against Ukraine, including targeting nuclear weapons, and has reduced natural gas supplies to both countries in the past. However, Russia's claims that the membership of these states would be detrimental to its interests are less credible, as none of the candidates have territorial proximity to Russia or were part of the Warsaw Pact. Additionally, Albania, Croatia, and Macedonia, the other candidate states, do not possess significant military capabilities or natural resources. Gazprom, Russia's government-owned energy company led by President-elect Dmitri Medvedev, has been trying to buy distribution networks in Europe. NATO discussed energy security at the Bucharest summit, with some European governments believing the alliance must address energy cut-offs before closer ties with vulnerable states like Georgia and Ukraine. Russia has posed obstacles to improved relations with NATO, including cyber attacks on Estonian banks and government offices. Moscow opposes the Bush Administration's missile defense system in Europe and rejects proposals to involve Russia. Some European governments advocate for open communication with Russia but also assert that Russia should not have veto power over NATO enlargement. EU members believe that NATO membership accelerates EU accession and want a slower pace of Union enlargement. The recent Lisbon reform treaty aims to simplify EU decision-making. The EU is working on a treaty to improve decision-making processes before allowing more states to join. Croatia is making progress in negotiations, while Albania and Macedonia are still in early stages of implementing anti-corruption measures. Concerns arise from Bulgaria and Romania's poor implementation of legislation after joining the EU in 2007. The EU is considering suspending Albania and Macedonia for poor implementation of legislation to fight organized crime and corruption. Some EU states believe more progress is needed before admission to NATO and the EU. Several allied governments think NATO enlargement should proceed more slowly, addressing issues like nationalist emotions in Serbia and energy security before considering further expansion. Albania's NATO membership candidacy is being evaluated based on political and economic reforms, public support, defense capabilities, and regional role. NATO member states will make a political judgment on whether Albania's membership enhances their security. The main challenges to Albania's candidacy are concerns about the pace of political reforms. Other countries like Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Cyprus, and Serbia are also potential candidates for NATO membership. Albania's candidacy for NATO membership faces challenges regarding the pace of political reforms. The current government, led by Prime Minister Sali Berisha of the Democratic Party of Albania, has been criticized for his leadership style. Albanian politics have been marked by conflict and factional struggles since the country's first multiparty election in 1991. In 1997, public order collapsed after the failure of financial pyramid schemes during Berisha's previous tenure as Prime Minister. Since 1991, Albanian elections have faced fraud allegations, with the DPA and Socialist Party refusing to concede defeat. The OSCE has criticized the elections for not meeting international standards. U.S. and EU leaders urge Albanian leaders to improve political civility and address legal and institutional shortcomings, focusing on electoral and judicial reform. Albania is working on drafting new legislation for electoral and judicial reform, but progress is slow. The country also faces challenges with organized crime and corruption, with strong crime links. Despite ranking poorly in corruption perceptions, public support for NATO membership is high. Military reforms have been successful, but Albania's small size and poverty may hinder further progress. Albania is making progress in military reforms with the assistance of the United States and NATO. The country's armed forces currently consist of 11,020 troops, but this will be reduced to about 10,000 by 2010. Albania is allocating a significant portion of its limited resources to defense spending, with a defense budget of $208 million in 2007, representing 1.8% of GDP. In 2008, Albania plans to spend 2.01% of GDP on defense, slightly above the NATO recommendation of 2%. NATO has encouraged Albania to develop specialized military capabilities. Albania is focusing on developing niche military capabilities to assist NATO missions, including a Rapid Reaction Brigade, military police, special operations forces, explosive ordnance disposal teams, engineers, and medical support units. They aim to have 40% of their land forces ready for international missions, with 8% deployable at any one time. Despite facing practical and financial limitations, Albania is committed to these reforms and has already acted as a de facto NATO ally by participating in SFOR and the current EU force in Bosnia. Albania has deployed forces in Afghanistan and Iraq as part of international missions, relying on bilateral assistance due to logistical limitations. A tragic explosion at an Albanian army ammunition dump in 2008 resulted in casualties and destruction during disposal efforts. Albanian Defense Minister resigned after an explosion during disposal of communist-era artillery shells. Three charged with negligence. Incident may reveal weaknesses in government and defense establishment. Albania recognized Kosovo's independence early, straining relations with Serbia. Leaders oppose merging with Kosovo and Albanian-majority parts of Macedonia. Praise for moderate stance on Kosovo from U.S. and EU officials. Albania's participation in U.S.-sponsored Adriatic Charter, along with Croatia and Macedonia, aims to boost NATO membership prospects. They also engage in regional defense cooperation through SEDM and SEEBRIG. Albanian officials believe NATO membership will stabilize the region and counter extremist forces in Serbia, while encouraging pro-Western forces. Albania received an invitation to join NATO at the Bucharest summit. NATO countries evaluated Croatia's request for membership based on various criteria, including political and economic reforms, public support, defense capabilities, and regional role. The Allies will press Albania to address reform concerns, while Croatia's membership will be determined by its contribution to security. Croatia's progress on political and economic reforms is seen as positive for its NATO candidacy and EU membership negotiations. The European Commission praised Croatia's efforts in reforming its judiciary and fighting corruption but noted that more progress is needed. Transparency International ranked Croatia 64th in its Corruption Perceptions Index. Croatia has made strides in minority issues as well. Croatia has made progress in minority rights and the return of Serb refugees, with over 300,000 refugees fleeing during the 1991-1995 war. The EU emphasized the need for further progress on these issues, as well as the prosecution of war criminals. Croatia is recognized as a functioning market economy but requires structural reforms and less state interference. Public support is identified as a significant weakness. Public support for Croatia's NATO membership candidacy has been a significant weakness, with polls showing initial low support that increased to over 70% after an attack on the Croatian embassy in Belgrade. Opposition to NATO membership stems from concerns about being dragged into international conflicts and NATO demanding bases in Croatia. The Croatian government, particularly the Croatian Democratic Community (HDZ), strongly supports NATO membership and reassures citizens that these outcomes will not occur. The HDZ in Croatia has evolved from a nationalist party to a pro-European center-right force. The leading opposition party, Social Democratic Party, supports NATO membership but called for a referendum. Prime Minister Sanader ruled out a referendum during the 2007 elections. Efforts for a referendum by anti-NATO activists failed. Croatia has made progress on defense reforms. Croatia has made progress on defense reforms, transitioning to a smaller, more professional armed forces. The goal is to have 40% of forces deployable for international missions, with defense expenditures expected to reach 1.8% of GDP in 2008 and 2% by 2010, in line with NATO recommendations. NATO encourages candidate states like Croatia to develop niche capabilities to support alliance missions. Croatia is developing niche capabilities for NATO missions, including special operations and demining platoons, helicopters, and infantry units. Some assessments question Croatia's financial commitment to these reforms. Croatia has troops in Afghanistan as part of the NATO-led ISAF force and plans to increase its presence. Croatia did not support the U.S. invasion of Iraq and has no troops in the coalition there. Croatia has no major conflicts with its neighbors and has improved relations with Serbia. In 2008, Croatia resolved an issue over a coastal zone with Slovenia and Italy. Croatia plays a positive role in Bosnia and Herzegovina by encouraging ethnic Croats to work within the Bosnian political system. In 2008, Croatia resolved a maritime boundary dispute with Slovenia and Italy. Croatia initially delayed recognizing Kosovo's independence but later extended diplomatic recognition. Serbia warned of downgrading relations with countries recognizing Kosovo. Croatia participates in the U.S.-sponsored Adriatic Charter with Albania and Macedonia. Albania, Macedonia, and Croatia are part of the U.S.-sponsored Adriatic Charter to boost NATO membership prospects. Croatia also participates in other regional defense fora. Macedonia has been working closely with NATO since joining the Membership Action Plan in 1999, with strong domestic support for NATO membership. Croatia received an invitation to join NATO at the Bucharest summit, and Macedonia is expected to join after a protocol of accession is concluded. Macedonia hosts a NATO liaison office in Skopje providing advice on military reforms and support to NATO-led Balkan operations. NATO representatives praised Macedonia's progress in implementing political, economic, and military reforms but noted that more needs to be accomplished. The state of political reforms has weighed on Macedonia's NATO candidacy prospects, with identified reform priorities including meeting democratic standards, reducing corruption and organized crime, judicial reform, and improving public services. In 2007, political conflict in Macedonia caused deadlock in parliament, hindering key reform measures. International officials criticized the antagonistic political relations and lack of constructive dialogue. The government almost collapsed before the Bucharest summit due to an ethnic Albanian party briefly leaving the coalition. The government in Macedonia faced a crisis when an ethnic Albanian party briefly left the coalition, leading to a vote to dissolve parliament and hold snap elections. Prime Minister Gruevski remains popular, and his party is expected to perform well in the upcoming vote. However, concerns remain about the impact of the election on domestic reforms and resolving the name dispute. NATO's reform priorities for Macedonia align with its EU accession prospects, but political tensions have delayed important reforms. Macedonia is an EU candidate country awaiting accession negotiations with Brussels. Macedonia's unfulfilled goal of EU accession talks in 2008 remains a priority, with concerns about political and legal reforms delaying progress. The Army of the Republic of Macedonia is undergoing a major restructuring effort to become a smaller, lighter, and fully professional force with niche capabilities for allied operations. The goal is to downsize forces to about 8,000 active troops by the end of 2008 and eliminate conscription. Macedonia has exceeded NATO's defense budget benchmark, allocating over $153 million in 2007, about 2.3% of GDP, with a focus on military modernization. It actively contributes to international missions, with troops in Kabul, Afghanistan, Bosnia, and Iraq, and plans to send a second platoon to Iraq in 2008. The Army is undergoing restructuring to become a smaller, professional force with specialized capabilities for allied operations. Macedonia's dispute with Greece over the name \"Macedonia\" has been ongoing since 1991. Talks with U.N. Envoy Matthew Nimetz in 2008 failed to produce an agreement, despite new proposals being floated. The dispute between Macedonia and Greece over the name issue remained unresolved despite talks and efforts to find a solution before the Bucharest summit. Greece linked its support for Macedonia's NATO candidacy to resolving the name issue, while Macedonia argued that its accession prospects should not be tied to the bilateral dispute. NATO representatives urged for a resolution, and after the summit, continued efforts were made to encourage both parties to engage in the Nimetz process. Despite upcoming early elections, the Macedonian government plans to resume talks under the Nimetz process to reach a compromise agreement. Macedonia aims to stabilize the conflict between Serbia and Kosovo, with Kosovo declaring independence in 2008. The US and EU countries recognize Kosovo's independence, and Macedonia is expected to follow suit due to their shared border and ethnic links. Concerns arise over potential unrest in Kosovo spilling over into Macedonia. Observers note that Kosovo has not been the cause of recent political tensions in Macedonia, with some believing that Macedonia's experience in inter-ethnic accommodation could serve as a model for Kosovo. The Macedonian government supports the Ahtisaari plan for Kosovo's settlement, but concerns about regional stability persist due to Kosovo's changed status. There are fears that instability in Kosovo could impact Macedonia's NATO aspirations. NATO's decision at the Bucharest summit to invite only Albania and Croatia for accession talks caused deep disappointment for Macedonia. The alliance expressed regret over the unresolved name issue and stated that an invitation would be extended once a solution is reached. The Macedonian delegation left the summit early, and President Bush further expressed regret at a follow-on meeting in Croatia. President Bush expressed regret in Croatia for excluding Macedonia from NATO and reiterated support for its entry. NATO member states contribute to the alliance through their armed forces, funded by national budgets. Commonly conducted activities are paid for from three NATO-run budgets, funded by member states based on per capita GDP. NATO staff are recalculating cost shares for all members due to new state invitations, resulting in minor reductions in existing member contributions. The cost projections for NATO enlargement in Central and Eastern Europe varied from $10 billion to $125 billion. Some Members of Congress were concerned about the potential financial burden on the United States. However, a NATO study estimated that enlargement would only require $1.5 billion in common funds expenditures over 10 years, with the 2004 round of enlargement expected to cost a similar amount. The 2004 round of NATO enlargement was expected to cost a similar amount, with potential benefits to U.S. security. The inclusion of ten new contributors reduced the percentage shares of established members. Estimates for the cost and implications of a new round of enlargement are being prepared for the Bucharest summit in 2008. U.S. officials believe prior cost estimation methodologies are still valid and any new members in 2008 would not incur significant costs, except for specific projects like secure communications. In recent years, the focus has been on specialized capabilities that new and existing members bring to NATO, as well as their willingness to contribute military assets to alliance operations. Georgia, after its \"rose revolution\" in late 2003, prioritized integration with NATO and has been actively supporting NATO forces in Kosovo and Afghanistan. Georgia, a significant contributor to coalition operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, has been actively seeking NATO membership since 2002. In 2008, Georgia formally requested participation in NATO's Membership Action Plan. Georgia formally requested participation in NATO's Membership Action Plan in 2008. The Senate approved a resolution urging NATO to award a MAP to Georgia and Ukraine. Georgia's path to alliance membership depends on democratization, economic development, military professionalism, and resolving conflicts. Concerns were raised about Georgia's democratization after a government crackdown on demonstrators in 2007. De Hoop Scheffer criticized the government's actions as not in line with Euro-Atlantic values. The closure of media outlets in Georgia by the government was criticized as not aligning with Euro-Atlantic values. President Saakashvili resigned and sought re-election after facing domestic and international criticism. NATO welcomed his re-election in 2008, but some allies urged delaying a decision on a Membership Action Plan (MAP) for Georgia. Despite economic growth, trade restrictions imposed by Russia continue to hinder Georgia's economy. The Georgian economy is still affected by trade restrictions from Russia and poverty has led to civil unrest. Despite efforts to combat corruption, it remains a significant issue. The military is upgrading its equipment to align with NATO standards and aims to contribute to NATO operations. A civilian defense minister was appointed to improve civil-military relations. In 2004, a civilian defense minister was appointed in Georgia to lead a ministry increasingly staffed by civilians. Concerns have been raised about non-transparent military budgeting and lack of legislative oversight. There are differing opinions on Georgia's path to NATO membership, with some emphasizing the need to resolve separatist conflicts, while others argue that Georgia should not be excluded due to conflicts fueled by Russia. President Saakashvili has pledged to use peaceful means to regain control over Abkhazia and South Ossetia, with hopes that progress towards NATO membership will encourage re-integration of breakaway regions. NATO's deliberations over a Membership Action Plan (MAP) for Georgia were influenced by the country's poor relations with Russia. Despite opposition from some Allies, NATO maintains that Russia does not have a \"veto\" over offering membership to Georgia. At the Bucharest summit, Germany argued that Georgia does not meet the requirement of being a contributor to Alliance security due to its involvement in Abkhazia. Political instability in Georgia was also a concern raised by German officials. Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier expressed concerns about Georgia's political instability and its unsuitability for a Membership Action Plan (MAP) at the NATO Summit. European relations with Russia were strained due to various policies, including the recognition of Kosovo's independence. French Prime Minister Francois Fillon emphasized the need for a European dialogue with Russia before considering a MAP for Georgia. Energy ties with Russia also influenced European views on Georgia's MAP. Despite these concerns, the Allies praised Georgia's contributions to Alliance operations and expressed support for its eventual membership. The Alliance pledged Georgia's eventual NATO membership and called for free and fair elections in May 2008. Continued dialogue with Georgia was emphasized until outstanding questions regarding its MAP application were resolved. Concerns were raised about Russia's military bases in Georgia and regional conflicts in the South. The Communique at the NATO Summit raised concerns about regional conflicts in the South Caucasus, emphasizing the peaceful settlement of conflicts while acknowledging Georgia's territorial integrity. President Saakashvili welcomed the language stating Georgia \"will become a member of NATO,\" viewing it as a direct obligation by the Alliance. Georgian Foreign Minister Davit Bakradze warned of potential Russian destabilization efforts to hinder Georgia's NATO membership prospects. President Putin reacted negatively to NATO's pledge of eventual membership for Georgia. On April 16, 2008, President Putin directed his government to establish ties with Abkhazia and South Ossetia, which Georgia and NATO protested as undermining Georgia's sovereignty. Ukraine seeks NATO membership through the Partnership for Peace program and requested a Membership Action Plan at the NATO summit. Sarkozy reiterates Ukraine's request for a MAP to show support for its Euro-Atlantic aspirations. Ukraine's potential NATO membership is seen as a way to integrate the country into the democratic values of the Euro-Atlantic community and as a safeguard against Russian threats. However, Ukraine faces challenges due to a lack of consensus on NATO membership among its population. Ukrainian public opinion on NATO membership is split along regional lines. People in southern and eastern Ukraine, who are Russian-speaking and support close ties with Russia, tend to oppose NATO membership. In contrast, supporters of NATO membership are mainly from western Ukraine, where Ukrainian-speakers dominate and support a Western orientation for Ukraine. Many in eastern Ukraine have bad memories of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, which contributes to their opposition to NATO membership. Ukrainian draftees fear NATO membership due to past Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. President Yushchenko supports NATO, while tensions between him and PM Tymoshenko affect government unity. Party of Regions and Communists oppose NATO. The Party of Regions and the Communists strongly oppose NATO membership in Ukraine. They blocked the parliament from conducting business in protest against Yatsenyuk's signature of a document in January 2008. The parliament resumed operations in March 2008, passing a resolution to consider NATO membership only after a public referendum. Ukrainian leaders recognize the need for a public information campaign to increase support for NATO membership. President Yushchenko stated in February 2008 that Ukraine will not allow NATO bases on its soil to address domestic and Russian criticism. Ukraine's President stated that the country will not allow NATO bases on its soil due to constitutional restrictions. The US emphasized the need for broad government support, defense reforms, and public education on NATO before considering membership. Despite a letter to the NATO Secretary General in January 2008 addressing some concerns, US Secretary of State refrained from public endorsement before and after a NATO meeting in March 2008. At the Bucharest summit in March 2008, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice did not publicly support a Membership Action Plan (MAP) for Ukraine, citing NATO's performance-based approach. President Bush, however, backed granting a MAP to Ukraine. European NATO allies were hesitant due to concerns about Ukraine's qualifications and relations with Russia. German Foreign Minister expressed skepticism, while French and other European leaders emphasized the importance of good relations with Moscow. Russian leaders have been hostile to Ukraine's possible NATO membership, viewing it as within their sphere of influence. President Putin warned of military countermeasures if Ukraine joined NATO. Russia could incite regional conflicts in Ukraine and encourage anti-NATO groups. Russia could use various tactics to destabilize Ukraine, such as intensifying anti-NATO campaigns, promoting the use of Russian as an official language in certain regions, and exploiting economic ties by cutting off gas supplies or increasing prices. These actions may not always yield the desired results and could lead to backlash from Ukrainians who value sovereignty and territorial integrity. Russia has used similar tactics in disputes with Moldova and Georgia, both seeking closer ties with the EU or NATO. Russian ability to \"punish\" Ukraine politically and economically may exceed NATO's response. Russia may reluctantly accept NATO membership for Ukraine, but many believe this is less likely due to Ukraine's ties to Russia. Russia's assertive foreign policy in recent years is fueled by high energy revenues. The Russian government has used anti-NATO and anti-U.S. rhetoric to gain domestic support. Allies did not offer Ukraine a MAP at the Bucharest summit but expressed support for Ukraine's application. The summit communique stated that Ukraine will become a NATO member, causing mixed reactions in Ukraine. President Yushchenko hailed the summit as a step towards NATO membership. Russian leaders, including President Putin and Foreign Minister Lavrov, expressed dissatisfaction with the NATO summit outcome regarding Ukraine. They warned of potential consequences, with Lavrov stating Russia would do everything to prevent Ukraine's NATO membership and General Baluyevsky threatening military action if Ukraine joined the alliance. Other countries in the Partnership for Peace program, like Serbia, Montenegro, and Bosnia-Herzegovina, could seek full NATO membership in the future. Montenegro and Bosnia-Herzegovina were invited to start an Intensified Dialogue with NATO at the Bucharest summit, while Kosovo may also seek closer ties with NATO. The summit did not make significant decisions on enlargement, but allies believe Albania and Croatia's membership could bring stability to southeastern Europe. NATO's enlargement to include Albania and Croatia is seen as a potential stabilizing factor in southeastern Europe, especially with Kosovo's recent independence and Serbia's hostility towards NATO. The alliance's focus on stabilizing Afghanistan is a key concern, with expectations for new members to develop niche capabilities. Financial assistance to Afghanistan is crucial for both stability and demonstrating solidarity within NATO. Future challenges, such as energy security, may influence future rounds of enlargement. Energy security, particularly in relation to Russia's control over Europe's oil and gas distribution network, is a key concern for NATO's future rounds of enlargement. Gazprom's ability to disrupt energy supply to customer countries highlights the need for countermeasures such as new pipelines and conservation efforts. Some allies believe that enhancing energy security is necessary before extending invitations to new vulnerable members. Relations with Russia are likely to be a focal point of European allies' policy moving forward. Relations with Russia and improving NATO-EU coordination are key strategic considerations for European allies. The two organizations are working closely together on stabilizing Kosovo, but have different decision-making processes. While NATO decisions can be complicated, EU policymaking involves internal compromises and quicker decision-making. Both NATO and the EU share the objective of stabilizing the region. The Senate and Congress have played active roles in NATO's eastward expansion since the Cold War. Legislation in the 1990s and early 2000s authorized assistance to former Soviet Bloc countries to become NATO members and provided military support. Congress endorsed NATO's enlargement and outlined conditions for it. The Senate imposed conditions on NATO enlargement, requiring detailed reports on countries seeking membership to be submitted before accession talks and updated before signing any protocols. These reports evaluate how a country will contribute to NATO's principles and security in the North Atlantic area, including military readiness. The Senate imposed conditions on NATO enlargement, requiring detailed reports on countries seeking membership to be submitted before accession talks and updated before signing any protocols. These reports evaluate the country's eligibility for membership, military readiness, national security impact on the US, common-funded military requirements, costs, and budgetary implications. Senator Richard Lugar introduced the Freedom Consolidation Act of 2006, supporting NATO enlargement and designating Albania, Croatia, Georgia, and Macedonia as eligible for assistance under the NATO Participation Act of 2004. The NATO Participation Act of 2004 was passed by the Senate in 2006. In the 110th Congress, the NATO Freedom Consolidation Act of 2007 was passed by both the Senate and House, reaffirming the commitment to NATO enlargement. President Bush signed the act into law on April 9, 2007. The NATO Freedom Consolidation Act of 2007 calls for the timely admission of Albania, Croatia, Georgia, Macedonia, and Ukraine to NATO, contingent upon their democratic, defense, and economic reform progress and willingness to meet membership responsibilities. It recognizes advancements made by these countries and authorizes support for their candidacies. The NATO Freedom Consolidation Act of 2007 authorizes security assistance to Croatia, Georgia, Macedonia, and Ukraine, in line with conditions set by the NATO Participation Act of 1994. Assistance includes transfer of defense articles, military education and training, and military financing to promote joint planning, training, and interoperability with NATO forces. Both the Senate and House support this initiative. The Senate and House express support for strengthening Allied relations with Georgia and Ukraine, advocating for NATO to enter a Membership Action Plan with both countries. This is in response to concerns about the cost, burdensharing, and relations with Russia regarding NATO enlargement. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that NATO expansion to five countries would cost the United States $30 million over 2008-2012. Concerns about burden-sharing within the alliance and relations with Russia have been raised by Members of Congress. Officials from the United States have discussed NATO expansion with European counterparts and officials from Albania, Croatia, and Macedonia."
