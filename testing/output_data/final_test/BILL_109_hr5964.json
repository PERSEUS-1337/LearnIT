The curr_chunk defines key terms related to forest management, including the Northwest Forest Plan, emerging markets, and forest health. The curr_chunk defines terms related to forest management, such as late-successional reserve, low-impact equipment, and old growth forests. These terms are crucial for understanding sustainable forest practices. The curr_chunk defines terms related to forest management, such as successional and mature multi-storied conifer forest stands, rural areas, value-added processing, and young managed stands. These terms are important for sustainable forest practices. A managed stand of trees where the overstory has been removed and the stand has been regenerated artificially. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\" is a concise statement indicating that there are findings related to the managed stand of trees where the overstory has been removed and the stand has been regenerated artificially. Congress finds that the Northwest Forest Plan can be better implemented to improve protection for native forest ecosystems and wildlife, increase sustainable timber production, and create economic opportunities for rural areas. Regeneration logging of old-growth forests diminishes biodiversity and habitat for rare species, making forests less healthy and resilient. To improve habitat and forest conditions, the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management should implement accelerated thinning in young managed stands and fire-suppressed stands at risk of severe disturbance. There are significant unmet thinning needs across the Northwest Forest Plan area, with over one million acres of young managed stands designated as Late-Successional Reserves. The Forest Service estimates that thinning millions of acres of young managed stands in Oregon and Washington could produce over 6 billion board-feet of commercial timber in the next two decades. Thinning in drier forests could also reduce fire risk, create more desirable forests, and increase their resiliency and durability. The timber industry in the Northwest Forest Plan area has adapted to process smaller-diameter timber from managed stands, reducing reliance on old-growth trees. Intensive thinning in young stands could double timber production. Olympic and Siuslaw National Forests in Oregon represent 9% of National Forest System land. The Siuslaw National Forest in Oregon generates 20 million board-feet annually from second-growth stands, with the potential to produce 50 million board-feet. This results in millions of dollars for restoration projects, forest accounts, local counties, and the Federal treasury. The Gifford Pinchot National Forest also has high productivity due to thinning efforts and collaborative initiatives. The Gifford Pinchot National Forest in Washington has increased timber production to 18 million board-feet annually by focusing on thinning second-growth stands and collaborative restoration. This shift has reduced controversy, appeals, and litigation. Thinning young managed stands and restoring drier forests can improve forest health, water quality, wildlife diversity, and old-growth ecosystems. Thinning young managed stands and developing locally owned manufacturing could create jobs in rural areas within the Northwest Forest Plan range. Protecting old-growth forests is important for old-growth dependent species, but not necessary for managing young stands. Commercial logging of old-growth stands is no longer required for surveys of old-growth dependent species. SEC. 4. MANAGEMENT DIRECTIVES. Forest Health Projects within the Northwest Forest Plan administrative units prioritize projects to enhance forest health through thinning treatments in young stands. Projects must avoid impacts on slopes, aquatic systems, and soils, while complying with late-successional reserve guidelines. Improvement of forest health in young managed stands within late-successional reserves may occur up to 120 years of age, with thinning prescriptions tailored to site-specific factors. Priority is given to projects enhancing durability and resiliency in dry forest types with historically frequent fire events by restoring forest structure and composition. Projects aim to improve forest conditions by restoring durable forest structure and composition to maintain old-growth features during fires. Thinning prescriptions are site-specific, considering factors like slope aspect, soil type, and vegetation composition. Innovative management techniques may be tested in adaptive management areas, avoiding impacts on unstable slopes, streams, soils, and old growth forests. The Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management are not required to implement surveys from previous decisions. Surveys may be done at their discretion. No timber harvest in old-growth stands unless for noncommercial use, emergency purposes, or to improve forest health. Other projects must align with the Northwest Forest Plan. SEC. 5. RURAL EMPLOYMENT DIRECTIVES. The Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management will consider best value contracting criteria for restoring young managed stands to maximize employment in rural areas. Criteria include ecological objectives, low-impact techniques, local economic benefits, and wood utilization. In awarding Federal contracts for projects, the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management will consider the offeror's ability to process wood locally and create value-added products for existing or emerging markets. They will also prioritize local contractors from economically disadvantaged rural areas, including those historically dependent on timber, to retain and create jobs. SEC. 6. PREPARATION OF PROGRAMMATIC ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTATION. Each Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management unit with land managed under the Northwest Forest Plan may prepare programmatic environmental documentation under NEPA to study significant environmental effects of major Federal actions in authorized projects. This allows for the elimination of repetitive discussions and focus on actual decision-making issues in subsequent environmental reviews. The programmatic environmental document summarizes issues discussed in the broader statement and incorporates discussions by reference. SEC. 7. IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS AND AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. This Act supplements the Northwest Forest Plan for projects on land managed under it. $50,000,000 is authorized annually for project planning and implementation. Proceeds from certain projects are subject to specific treatment. The Act allows administrative units to keep proceeds from timber sales for future projects under the Northwest Forest Plan. It does not impact other forest receipt laws or obligations related to sales of forest products from Federal land."
