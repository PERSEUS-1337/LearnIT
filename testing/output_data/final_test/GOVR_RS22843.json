    "content": "Medicaid is a program that finances medical services and long-term care, with states designing their own versions under federal rules. The federal government and states jointly finance Medicaid, with the federal government reimbursing states based on the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP), which varies by state. The state share of Medicaid expenditures is funded through various sources, with 40-60% coming from state and local governments. In SFY 2014, states reported that 74% of the state share was financed by state general funds, while the remaining 26% came from other funds. Provider taxes are commonly used by states to finance part of their Medicaid expenditures. In SFY2016, 49 states and the District of Columbia use provider taxes to finance Medicaid, with the tax burden falling on health care providers. States must impose broad-based and uniform taxes on all providers within a specified class to qualify for federal matching funds. Provider tax revenue is often used to increase Medicaid payment rates for providers, allowing states to fund rate increases without using state funds. The report discusses how states use provider taxes to finance Medicaid, funded by provider tax revenue and federal matching funds. It explains the history of provider taxes in the 1980s and relevant federal regulations from the early 1990s. The report also examines the impact of past and present proposals on Medicaid provider taxes. In the 1980s, states used provider taxes to finance Medicaid, with revenue from taxes and donations funding a portion of Medicaid expenditures. Medicaid providers would agree to pay taxes or donate funds, which states used to raise Medicaid payment rates. Provider tax arrangements were designed to protect providers from the cost of taxes or donations. For example, hospitals could pay $10 million in taxes, and the state would increase Medicaid reimbursement rates by $20 million, resulting in $12 million in federal matching funds. States used provider taxes to finance Medicaid in the 1980s, with hospitals paying taxes or donating funds to increase Medicaid payment rates. This allowed states to draw down federal funds and reimburse providers, making the tax mechanisms politically viable. However, these financing arrangements became a point of contention between the federal government and states. In the 1980s, states used provider taxes and donations to finance Medicaid, allowing them to draw down federal funds and reimburse providers. However, this led to congressional action in 1991 to restrict states' use of provider taxes and donations in financing Medicaid. The law defined provider taxes and imposed restrictions on their use to claim federal matching payments. The 1991 law imposed restrictions on provider taxes for Medicaid financing, requiring them to be broad-based and uniform across all providers. States cannot guarantee providers receive their money back. The HHS Secretary can waive these requirements if the tax is \"generally redistributive\" and not directly tied to Medicaid payments. According to regulations, a provider tax is redistributive if the burden is the same for Medicaid providers with or without a waiver. The tax is more redistributive when it falls heavily on providers with fewer Medicaid patients. 19 classes of providers must be included in tax programs to ensure they are broad-based. These providers offer various services such as inpatient hospital care, outpatient services, nursing facility services, and physician services. Prior to the 1991 law, provider taxes were often imposed only on Medicaid providers. These provider tax arrangements were agreed to by Medicaid providers because they could be held harmless from the cost of the tax through increased Medicaid payment rates. However, taxing all providers within a class dampened the appeal of provider taxes as non-Medicaid providers could not be easily held harmless from the cost. Non-Medicaid providers face challenges with provider taxes as they cannot be easily held harmless from the cost. Regulations outline three tests to determine if taxpayers are held harmless, including a positive correlation test and a Medicaid payment test. Taxes failing these tests violate the law. The guarantee test is violated if Medicaid payments vary based on tax amounts. Indirect guarantees are determined through a two-prong test related to tax rates and the \"75/75 rule\" for provider taxes exceeding 6%. The provider tax is subject to the guarantee test, with a threshold amount currently at 6%. If the tax revenue exceeds this threshold, it must not violate the \"75/75 rule\" where more than 75% of taxpayers receive 75% or more of the tax cost back through enhanced Medicaid payments. If this rule is violated, the full tax amount is considered to violate the hold harmless test. If the provider tax revenue exceeds the 6% threshold amount and violates the \"75/75 rule\" (where more than 75% of taxpayers receive 75% or more of the tax cost back through enhanced Medicaid rates), the tax revenue would offset from the state's Medicaid expenditures. This means the provider tax revenue could still fund Medicaid, but federal matching funds couldn't be drawn on it. No state has imposed a provider tax above the threshold amount. States use provider tax revenue to increase Medicaid payment rates for providers who pay the tax. In SFY2016, 49 states and the District of Columbia use provider taxes to finance Medicaid, allowing them to increase payment rates without using state general funds. This strategy involves collecting tax revenue from providers, such as nursing homes, and then using it to boost Medicaid reimbursement rates, drawing down federal matching funds in the process. This approach enables states to allocate funds for other Medicaid or non-Medicaid purposes. States use provider taxes to finance Medicaid, allowing them to increase payment rates without using state general funds. Taxes can be imposed on 19 classes of providers, with nursing facilities, hospitals, and ICF/ID facilities being the most common. The full amount of provider tax revenues used by states is unknown, with data collection by CMS and NASBO being incomplete. The provider taxes collected by states for Medicaid funding are inconsistently reported to CMS, with underreporting likely. NASBO's State Expenditure Report details Medicaid expenditure shares from state general funds and \"other state funds,\" including provider taxes, tobacco tax revenue, donations, and local funds. NASBO's State Expenditure Report details the use of \"other state funds\" for Medicaid expenditures, including provider taxes, fees, donations, and local funds. The data shows an increasing trend in the use of \"other state funds\" as a percentage of the state share of Medicaid expenditures since SFY1990. In SFY2015, \"other state funds\" accounted for 26% of the state share of Medicaid expenditures. A Government Accountability Office analysis found that provider taxes made up 34% of these funds in SFY2012. The number of states with Medicaid provider taxes has increased, with 32 states having three or more provider taxes in place in SFY2015. The GAO questionnaire highlighted states' use of revenue from new Medicaid provider taxes, including funding Medicaid provider payment rates, non-DSH supplemental payments, DSH payments, avoiding benefit cuts, and expanding benefits. Some states planned to use the revenue for the ACA Medicaid expansion. CMS oversees compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements for provider taxes, with waivers needed for certain requirements. From 2008 to 2012, CMS approved provider tax waivers in 29 states. Recently, the House Energy and Commerce Committee marked up a bill (H.R. 4725) that includes a Medicaid provider tax provision. Proposals to limit states' ability to use provider taxes in financing the state share of Medicaid expenditures usually focus on lowering the threshold for provider taxes, which would decrease federal Medicaid payments to states. This would shift more of the Medicaid program's costs to the states, forcing them to consider maintaining current Medicaid reimbursement and service levels against other state priorities. States may need to make tough decisions on Medicaid spending, such as reducing provider payment rates, limiting benefits, or restricting eligibility. These changes could impact access to quality medical care for Medicaid enrollees. The President's FY2013 budget proposed lowering the Medicaid provider tax threshold from 6% to 3.5% from FY2015 to FY2017, aiming to reduce federal Medicaid expenditures. The President's budget proposed reducing federal Medicaid expenditures by $21.8 billion from FY2015 through FY2022. A survey found that 41 states and the District of Columbia would lower provider tax rates due to this proposal. The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform recommended limiting states' use of provider taxes, estimating a $44 billion reduction in federal Medicaid expenditures from FY2012 through FY2020. The House Energy and Commerce Committee marked up the Common Sense Savings Act of 2016, which includes reducing the Medicaid provider tax threshold from 6% to 5.5%, potentially saving $4.6 billion from FY2016 through FY2026. The provision aims to reduce federal Medicaid expenditures by $4.6 billion from FY2016 through FY2026. Most states use provider taxes to fund Medicaid, with nursing home taxes being the most common type. Hospital and ICF/ID provider taxes are also widely used, along with other types of provider taxes in some states."
