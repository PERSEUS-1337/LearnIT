    "content": "The Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act, enacted in 1937, provides funding for states to support conservation projects for wild birds and mammals, hunter education, and safety training. Funding is generated through excise taxes on firearms and archery equipment, administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act, enacted in 1937, provides funding for states for conservation projects, hunter education, and safety training. Funds are apportioned directly among states and territories, totaling over $18.8 billion since its creation. This report outlines the programs supporting wildlife restoration and hunter education, including apportionment formulas and related issues for Congress. This report focuses on formula-based programs within the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act that provide funding for states and territories. Funds are allocated for program administration, Wildlife Restoration, Hunter Education and Safety, and Conservation Grants. Three programs receive funds based on apportionment formulas considering state acreage, hunting licenses sold, and population. Territories receive a set allocation. Pittman-Robertson funding is allocated to states and territories based on apportionment formulas considering state acreage, hunting licenses sold, and population. The funding comes from excise taxes on firearms, ammunition, and archery equipment, with tax rates ranging from 10% to 11%. This funding supports wildlife and hunter safety projects, conservation grants, and program administration. Excise taxes on firearms, ammunition, and archery equipment range from 10% to 11%. Revenues are deposited into the Federal Aid to Wildlife Restoration Fund and support various wildlife and hunter safety projects. From FY2007 to FY2016, $6.2 billion in revenue was reported, with ammunition accounting for 34%, firearms for 32%, pistols and revolvers for 27%, and archery equipment for 8% of the total. Excise taxes on pistols, revolvers, and archery equipment contribute to 17% of total revenue for apportionments in the Basic Hunter Education and Safety program from FY2008 to FY2017. The remaining 83% of revenues from FY2007 to FY2016 fund Wildlife Restoration, Enhanced Hunter Education, Multistate Conservation Grant programs, and administration. Amounts available for apportionment fluctuate based on program-specific revenues. Between FY1939 and FY2019, FWS disbursed $18.8 billion for wildlife restoration and hunter education activities to states and territories. Annual apportionments have increased over time, with fluctuations of over $100 million in recent years. For FY2015 through FY2019, FWS disbursed $3.8 billion to states and territories, with individual states receiving between $4.5 million and $34.7 million on average. The Wildlife Restoration program, also known as Section 4(b), is the largest funding stream within Pittman-Robertson. From FY2015 through FY2019, states and territories received an average of $606 million annually for this program. American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands, and the Virgin Islands each received $1.3 million per year, on average, while Puerto Rico received $3.3 million per year, on average. Total funding available for the Wildlife Restoration program is determined after deducting amounts for administration and other programs. The Wildlife Restoration program, funded by excise taxes on firearms and equipment, provides grants to states and territories for conservation projects. States can use up to 75% of the funding for projects, with the remaining cost covered by non-Pittman-Robertson funds. The apportionment formula is based on the state's area compared to the total. Funds are available for the current and following fiscal year. The Wildlife Restoration program provides grants to states and territories for conservation projects funded by excise taxes on firearms and equipment. The apportionment formula is based on the state's area and number of hunting licenses sold compared to the total for all 50 states. Territories have set caps for apportionments, with Puerto Rico receiving up to 0.5% and other territories up to 0.17% of the total funds apportioned. FWS calculates state area based on land and inland water areas, excluding coastal and territorial waters. The U.S. has 3.6 million square miles of land and inland water. States' areas range from 0.03% (Rhode Island) to over 16% (Alaska) of the total. The number of paid hunting-license holders from the second fiscal year before apportionment is used for calculations. During 2015-2019, states collectively sold 15.4 million hunting licenses per year in the US. Rhode Island sold the fewest licenses (8,404/year on average) while Texas sold the most (1.1 million/year on average). The number of licenses sold varies annually, affecting apportionment levels for Wildlife Restoration program funding. During 2015-2019, states collectively sold 15.4 million hunting licenses per year in the US. 40 states received varying apportionments of Wildlife Restoration program funding, with 8 states receiving the minimum allocation and 2 states receiving the maximum of 5%. Texas and Alaska received the maximum apportionment, despite differing significantly in license sales. Two programs within Pittman-Robertson support states and territories for hunter education and safety projects. The apportionment for the Basic Hunter Education and Safety program is based on annual revenues from excise taxes on firearms and archery equipment. The Enhanced Hunter Education and Safety Grants program receives a fixed amount of $8 million per year. States and territories receive funding based on their population ratio to the total US population, with a minimum and maximum apportionment cap. Each eligible territory receives a small percentage of the total funding. States can use their funding for up to 75% of project costs. Based on the 2010 decennial census, states receive apportionments based on their population percentage, with a minimum of 1% and a maximum of 3%. California is the most populous state with 12.1% of the total U.S. population. Apportionments are constant between decennial censuses but can fluctuate based on excise tax revenues. Between FY2015 and FY2019, states and territories received apportionments for the Basic Hunter Education and Safety program based on their population percentage, with 3% being the cap. The program is funded by half of the excise taxes collected on pistols, revolvers, and archery equipment. The total average annual apportionments for the program amounted to $136 million, representing 18.2% of the total average annual apportionments disbursed under Pittman-Robertson programs. In FY2019, states and territories received either the minimum or maximum allocation under the Basic Hunter Education and Safety program. States received 1% ($1.4 million on average) or 3% ($4.1 million on average) as required by law, while territories received 0.17% ($227,473 on average). Funding can be used for hunter safety programs and public target ranges. Congress added the Enhanced Hunter Education and Safety Grants program in 2000, allocating $8.0 million annually since FY2003. Since FY2003, $8.0 million annually is allocated for firearm and bow hunter education and safety grants under the Pittman-Robertson program. States or territories can use these funds for enhancing hunter education programs, safety programs, interstate coordination, shooting range programs, archery education, and construction/updating of shooting ranges if they have not utilized all funds from the Basic Hunter Education and Safety program. States and territories can use Enhanced Hunter Education and Safety Grants funding for authorized purposes under the Pittman-Robertson program if they have exhausted their Basic Hunter Education and Safety program funds. The grants are apportioned annually by the FWS, with each state receiving between 1% and 3% of the total amount allocated. Territories receive 0.17% on average. The distribution formula for these grants follows the same pattern as the Basic Hunter Education and Safety program. The Enhanced Hunter Education and Safety Grant program provides funds for states and territories to use for authorized purposes under the Pittman-Robertson program. Congress has considered various issues related to the program, including eligible uses of funds, funding structure, and apportionment formulas. Some proposed amendments aim to allow additional uses like hunter recruitment and retention, while others focus on modifying the federal share and eligible uses of funds for activities such as public target ranges. Several bills in recent Congresses would allow states to use funds provided through Pittman-Robertson for promoting hunting and recreational shooting, recruitment and retention of hunters and shooters, and public relations. The number of hunters in the United States declined by 16% from 2011 to 2016. These bills aim to allow states to use funds for hunter and recreational shooter recruitment and retention. The proposed bills would amend the Pittman-Robertson Act to allow states to use funds for promoting hunting, recruitment, and retention of hunters and shooters. Proponents argue that this flexibility is needed to increase participation in hunting and shooting sports, ultimately boosting excise tax revenues. Wildlife restoration would remain the primary purpose of the act even with these amendments. The proposed bills would amend the Pittman-Robertson Act to allow states to use funds for promoting hunting, recruitment, and retention of hunters and shooters. Concerns have been raised that these bills could diminish wildlife restoration activities by reallocating funds. Other legislation in previous Congresses aimed to change how states can use Pittman-Robertson allocations for public target ranges. Currently, funds can be used for the construction and maintenance of public target ranges under certain programs. The proposed bills aim to amend the Pittman-Robertson Act to allow states to use funds for promoting hunting and shooting activities, including the development and safety features of shooting ranges. There is a 75% cap for federal funding, and proposed changes would allow states to use funds for land acquisition and construction related to target ranges. The proposed bills aim to amend the Pittman-Robertson Act to allow states and territories to use up to 90% of the total cost of a shooting range project, instead of the current 75% federal cost-share cap. This would extend the obligation and expenditure window for Enhanced Hunter Education and Safety Grants program apportionments used for shooting ranges to up to five fiscal years. Proponents argue that this legislation would increase public target range availability, promote hunting and shooting sports, and provide economic benefits. The proposed legislation aims to lower the state matching requirement for target range-related projects and extend funding windows. Some stakeholders are concerned that this may divert funds from wildlife restoration activities funded by the Federal Aid to Wildlife Restoration Fund. Some stakeholders propose amending the Pittman-Robertson Act to include a more stable funding source, not solely reliant on hunters and shooters. Congress structured revenue sources for wildlife restoration from excise taxes on firearms and ammunition. In 1970, Congress enacted legislation to deposit revenues from excise taxes on pistols, revolvers, bows, and arrows into the Federal Aid to Wildlife Restoration Fund to support wildlife restoration and hunter safety programs. This aimed to increase revenues for these purposes and ensure a more stable funding source for the Pittman-Robertson Act. Some stakeholders and Congress have discussed funding for Pittman-Robertson, proposing an excise tax on outdoor recreation items like backpacks and bicycles. This \"backpack tax\" debate has been ongoing for decades, with proponents arguing for fairer support for wildlife conservation and opponents concerned about industry burden and higher costs for consumers. Congress has not expanded the excise tax base for Pittman-Robertson beyond firearms, ammunition, and archery equipment. In FY2001, a subaccount was added to provide extra funding for wildlife restoration and conservation. $50 million was allocated for this purpose, but funding was only provided in FY2001. Some Members of Congress have introduced bills to repurpose this subaccount in recent sessions. In recent sessions, bills were introduced to transfer up to $1.3 billion annually into a subaccount of the Pittman-Robertson Act from revenues under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act and Mineral Leasing Act. These funds would support conservation and restoration activities for states and territories. Congress may explore other funding sources for Pittman-Robertson in the 116th Congress to enhance conservation efforts and provide a secure funding stream. Proponents argue that additional funds could benefit federal agencies, tribal partners, and conservation of threatened species. Congress may consider amending Pittman-Robertson's apportionment structure for conservation and restoration funding. Currently, states and territories are treated differently, with states receiving funds based on area, population, and hunting licenses, while territories receive funding based on set percentages. States receive a minimum of 0.5% for Wildlife Restoration, Puerto Rico receives up to 0.5%, and other territories receive up to 0.17%. For Hunter Education programs, states receive at least 1% of funding. Under current law, states receive at least 1% of apportionments for Hunter Education programs, while territories receive 0.17%. Washington, DC, does not receive funding through these programs but received funding in FY2001 through a different account. Congress may consider amending apportionment formulas for parity between states and territories, including minimum and maximum allocations. Stakeholders have expressed concern over the discrepancy in funding between states and territories. Stakeholders argue for greater parity between states and territories in apportionment allocations under Pittman-Robertson programs. Some suggest tribes should also be eligible for funding."
