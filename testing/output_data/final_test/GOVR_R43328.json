    "content": "Medicaid is a significant provider of long-term services and supports (LTSS) for eligible aged and disabled individuals, with spending totaling $149.4 billion in 2015. LTSS recipients make up a small share of the total Medicaid population, but account for 31% of all Medicaid spending. Medicaid funds LTSS in institutional and home-based settings, with services varying by state. State Medicaid programs cover certain LTSS for eligible beneficiaries, including nursing facility care. States have options for LTSS coverage of home and community-based services based on need, leading to variation in benefit packages. Medicaid LTSS coverage is perceived to favor institutional care, with federal law originally entitling beneficiaries to nursing facility care. In recent decades, federal Medicaid authority has expanded to include optional HCBS, such as the Section 1915(c) HCBS waiver. Legislative and administrative actions have furthered Medicaid HCBS coverage, prompted by the Olmstead v. L.C. Supreme Court decision. States have a range of coverage options for LTSS programs, with Medicaid LTSS spending for HCBS increasing significantly over time. HCBS has significantly increased over time, accounting for 53% of total Medicaid LTSS spending in FY2014. The ACA expanded options for states to pursue HCBS coverage expansion, including the Section 1915(i) HCBS state plan option. In FY2016 and FY2017, most states used HCBS waiver programs or the Section 1915(i) HCBS state plan option to expand their offerings. About half of states plan to implement or expand Medicaid LTSS through managed care arrangements. The report describes Medicaid LTSS financing and delivery through managed care in several states. Some states are closing institutional settings to focus on community placements. It includes legislative provisions for LTSS coverage under Medicaid, a history of LTSS coverage, and ACA's impact on Medicaid law. State information on Medicaid optional benefits and grant programs for HCBS expansion is also provided. Medicaid is a state-operated program that finances healthcare for low-income individuals. The federal government determines the funding for Medicaid services based on the FMAP rates. To qualify for Medicaid LTSS, individuals must meet state-defined criteria. Delivery systems include services in different settings. Medicaid LTSS delivery systems offer services in institutional and home/community-based settings. States must provide certain institutional services, while most HCBS offerings are optional. States have authorities under Medicaid law to offer LTSS, including through the state plan or waiver program. The Medicaid state plan and waiver authorities allow states to cover LTSS, with the state plan serving as a contract between states and the federal government outlining how Medicaid is administered. States can update their state plans through state plan amendments approved by CMS. The Medicaid state plan allows states to cover LTSS through state plan amendments approved by CMS. States must meet federal guidelines for mandatory and optional benefits, ensuring services are sufficient in amount, duration, and scope to achieve their purpose. States can place limits based on medical necessity or level-of-care, and services must be equal for all enrollees within a state. The Medicaid state plan requires benefits to be equal in amount, duration, and scope, known as the \"comparability\" requirement. Waiver programs allow states to provide benefits outside of these rules and test new ways to deliver services. Waiver benefits are time-limited and must be renewed by the state. States have the option to design LTSS benefit packages for eligible beneficiaries through state plan and waiver authorities. Medicaid state plan benefits include nursing facility services and home health, which states must cover but can determine the amount, duration, and scope. Waiver programs allow states to provide benefits outside of Medicaid rules, with benefits being time-limited and requiring renewal by the state. Medicaid covers nursing facility services for beneficiaries ages 21 and over, with states having the option to cover services for those under 21. Beneficiaries must meet state-defined eligibility criteria. Services include nursing care, dietary services, physician services, rehabilitation services, emergency dental care, and pharmacy services. Room and board are also included. Home health services are mandatory for certain individuals receiving nursing facility care. Home health services are a required benefit for Medicaid beneficiaries under age 21, regardless of the need for institutional care or skilled nursing. The benefit includes nursing services, home health aide services, and medical supplies. States can also offer additional therapeutic services like physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech pathology, and audiology. The Medicaid home health benefit includes physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech pathology, and audiology services. States must provide these services to all Medicaid beneficiaries entitled to nursing facility services. Home health services must be ordered by a physician and reviewed every 60 days. Optional long-term services and supports (LTSS) benefits are available for older individuals and persons with disabilities living in the community, including case management and personal care. States have the authority to cover packages of home and community-based services. States may offer case management services to assist individuals in community settings or transitioning from institutions. This includes comprehensive assessments, tailored care plans, and monitoring of services. For state-specific information on optional benefit coverage, refer to Appendix B, Table B-1. States can offer case management services to assist individuals in community settings or transitioning from institutions. This includes planning, monitoring of services, and assistance with obtaining non-Medicaid benefits like SNAP, energy assistance, and emergency housing. States have the option to offer targeted case management to a specified beneficiary population within a specific geographic area to help individuals access needed services. Eligibility criteria must be met for either benefit option. Forty-eight states and DC offered optional targeted case management services in 2012. The Intermediate Care Facilities for individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (ICFs/ID) provide health and rehabilitative services to Medicaid beneficiaries with intellectual disabilities. These facilities must offer nursing, physician, dental, pharmacy, and laboratory services. Beneficiaries in ICFs/ID often have additional disabilities like seizure disorders and mental illness. Medicaid requires ICFs/ID to provide \"active treatment,\" defined as a comprehensive program of training, treatment, and health services. In 2012, 47 states and DC offered services in an Institution for Mental Disease (IMD) for individuals with mental diseases, including those for substance use and addiction. IMD services include diagnosis, medical treatment, nursing care, and related services under the direction of a physician. In 2012, 45 states and DC provided inpatient psychiatric care services in IMDs for individuals aged 65 and over, as well as for eligible beneficiaries under age 21 known as \"Psych Under 21.\" Services were offered in psychiatric hospitals, units in general hospitals, and psychiatric residential treatment facilities (PRTFs) for comprehensive mental health treatment. PRTF programs aim to successfully reintegrate youth into the community. Additionally, all states and DC offered inpatient psychiatric care benefits to eligible beneficiaries under age 21, and personal care services were available as an optional Medicaid state plan benefit for older individuals and persons with disabilities. Personal care services under Medicaid state plan benefit include assistance with activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) for older individuals and persons with disabilities. This assistance can be hands-on or through prompting individuals to perform tasks independently, including light housework, meal preparation, and transportation. Personal care services under Medicaid state plan benefit must be authorized by a physician and offered statewide. Services can be provided at home or in other settings, excluding hospitals, nursing facilities, ICFs/ID, or psychiatric institutions. Qualified providers, excluding legally liable relatives, can offer these services, which can be directed by the beneficiary. Private duty nursing services under Medicaid can be provided to eligible beneficiaries who require more individual and continuous care than what is available from a visiting nurse or nursing staff in an institutional setting. This intensive care may include 24-hour coverage for technology-dependent individuals needing medical interventions like mechanical ventilation or tube feedings. Skilled nursing services are provided by registered or licensed practical nurses under the direction of the beneficiary's physician. Private duty nursing services under Medicaid can be provided to eligible beneficiaries who require intensive care, including 24-hour coverage for technology-dependent individuals. Skilled nursing services are offered in institutional or community-based settings under the direction of the beneficiary's physician. States can also offer a rehabilitative services benefit for individuals with physical or mental health conditions, recommended by a licensed practitioner for maximum reduction of disability and restoration to functional levels. The optional Medicaid rehabilitative benefit offers services in community settings by professionals and paraprofessionals without the need for a physician's direction. It includes a wide range of treatments from physical rehabilitation to behavioral health and substance abuse treatment, assisting beneficiaries with mental health conditions. States can provide physical, occupational, and speech therapy, as well as comprehensive services for substance abuse disorders. In 2012, all states and DC covered rehabilitative services as an optional benefit for individuals recovering from substance abuse disorders. Section 1915(i) of the SSA allows states to offer a broad range of HCBS under their Medicaid state plan without a waiver. Eligible beneficiaries must meet specific financial and needs-based criteria, with incomes less than 150% of the federal poverty level and a level-of-care need lower than that required in an institution. States may extend eligibility up to 300% of the maximum Supplemental. The Section 1915(i) benefit extends to beneficiaries with incomes up to 300% of the maximum SSI benefit for HCBS under waiver programs. States can customize benefit packages for specific populations for five-year periods without capping the number of beneficiaries. States have flexibility in designing benefit packages for the Section 1915(i) program, offering services like case management, personal care, and mental health treatment without prior approval. States have flexibility in designing benefit packages for the Section 1915(i) program, offering services like case management, personal care, and mental health treatment without prior approval. State variation exists in naming conventions and service definitions for HCBS state plan and waiver services. As of December 2015, 16 states and DC have implemented a Section 1915(i) state plan HCBS option. States can also provide self-directed personal care assistance services under Section 1915(j) of the SSA, allowing for personal care and related home and community-based services. Participation in self-directed PAS is voluntary and states may limit the number of individuals who self-direct. States have the option to disburse cash to participants who direct their PAS and allow them to hire legally liable relatives for care. Service plans are based on need and developed with a person-centered approach. Six states participated in the Section 1915(j) PAS state plan option in FY2014. States can also offer community-based attendant services and supports under Section 1915(k) of the SSA. The Section 1915(k) of the SSA allows states to offer community-based attendant services and supports as an optional Medicaid state plan benefit. Eligible beneficiaries must meet certain criteria and receive services in an integrated community-based setting. Services include assistance with daily living tasks and must be delivered under a person-centered plan of care. The Section 1915(k) of the SSA allows states to offer community-based attendant services and supports as an optional Medicaid state plan benefit. These services must be delivered under a person-centered plan of care, with attendants selected, managed, and dismissed by the recipient. The benefit may also cover transition expenses for moving from a nursing facility to a community-based setting, including security deposits, bedding, and kitchen supplies. States may provide services to increase independence, such as non-medical transportation or purchasing essential items like a microwave oven. Additional requirements for states offering the CFC optional benefit include collaborating with a state-established Development and Implementation Council. The Section 1915(k) of the SSA allows states to offer community-based attendant services and supports as an optional Medicaid state plan benefit. States may provide services to increase independence, such as non-medical transportation or purchasing essential items like a microwave oven. States must collaborate with a state-established Development and Implementation Council for the CFC optional benefit. As of January 2017, eight states have a CFC option in place, with CMS providing technical assistance to additional states considering the benefit. Beneficiaries aged 65 or over, determined to be functionally disabled and eligible for Medicaid coverage, can receive covered home and community care benefits under Section 1915(k) of the SSA. Services must align with an individual community care plan overseen by a qualified case manager. States may cover various services like homemaker/home health aide, personal care, and adult day care. For individuals with chronic mental illness, additional services like day treatment and psychosocial rehabilitation may be covered. States have the flexibility to waive certain requirements and approve other services as deemed necessary by the HHS Secretary. Under Section 1915(k) of the SSA, beneficiaries aged 65 or over who are functionally disabled and eligible for Medicaid can receive covered home and community care benefits. States have the flexibility to cover various services like homemaker/home health aide, personal care, and adult day care. Additional services may be covered for individuals with chronic mental illness. Texas offers personal care services under Section 1929, the only state to do so. Medicaid waivers for HCBS options show the variation in coverage within the program. States have discretion in determining the HCBS benefit package, leading to variation in service types and definitions. This variation makes it challenging to compare state Medicaid HCBS offerings nationally. The Medicaid law allows the HHS Secretary to offer a broad range of home and community-based services (HCBS) to individuals with disabilities under Medicaid \"waiver\" programs. States can request waivers to provide HCBS through Section 1915(c) and Section 1115 waiver authorities. Section 1915(c) waivers, known as HCBS waivers, allow states to provide home and community-based care to individuals who would otherwise need Medicaid-covered institutional care. These waivers go beyond medical benefits to include nonmedical, social, and supportive services for independent living. Services may include case management, homemaker/home health aide, and personal care. Section 1915(c) waivers, also known as HCBS waivers, allow states to offer a variety of services to individuals, including case management, homemaker/home health aide, personal care, adult day health, habilitation, rehabilitation, and respite care. States have the flexibility to add more services with approval from the HHS Secretary. These waivers do not cover room and board in community-based settings like assisted living facilities, and there is significant variation in service names and definitions across states. States have varying naming conventions and service definitions for Section 1915(c) waiver programs, targeting specific populations like individuals with disabilities or mental illness. CMS now allows states to combine target groups within one waiver program, offering specialized HCBS packages. States have the flexibility to combine waiver target groups into one program for individuals with disabilities or mental illness. Eligible participants must meet financial and level-of-care criteria demonstrating the need for LTSS. The HHS Secretary can waive requirements for offering HCBS in limited areas. States have the flexibility to combine waiver target groups into one program for individuals with disabilities or mental illness. The HHS Secretary may waive the \"comparability\" requirement for services under the Section 1915(c) waiver, allowing states to cap enrollment and implement cost-containment strategies. Waiver approvals are time-limited and subject to reporting and evaluation requirements, including a cost-neutrality test. In 2013, 1.5 million Medicaid beneficiaries received services under Section 1915(c) HCBS waivers in 47 states and DC. There were 289 active waivers with expenditures totaling $41.5 billion in FY2014. Waivers primarily target aged and disabled populations (48%) and individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (41%). Other populations such as those with physical disabilities, special health care needs, traumatic brain injuries, HIV/AIDS, and mental health needs make up the remaining 11%. Section 1115 of the SSA allows the HHS Secretary to waive certain Medicaid requirements for states to conduct research and demonstration projects. States must submit proposals to CMS for approval before implementing these programs, with costs financed through federal and state matching funds. Section 1115 waivers for Medicaid programs must be \"budget neutral\" to the federal government, with costs offset by savings within the program. States use various methods to achieve this, such as limiting benefits, providing targeted services, and implementing enrollment caps. Waivers are time-limited and subject to reporting and evaluation requirements. Some states use Section 1115 waivers to provide HCBS to targeted populations, offering additional flexibilities compared to Section 1915(c) waivers. This includes allowing beneficiaries to self-direct their LTSS and obtain individual budgets for services. In 2013, several states utilized Section 1115 waivers for Medicaid programs that included Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS), either statewide or in specific areas. These waivers allowed for changes in Medicaid eligibility requirements and payment structures. Medicaid expenditures for HCBS under managed care authorities, including Section 1115 waivers, totaled $5.9 billion in FY2014. Before the enactment of Medicaid in 1965, homes for the aged and public institutions were funded through a combination of direct payments and vendor payments. The Kerr-Mills Medical Assistance to the Aged program, enacted in 1960, allowed states to provide medical services, including skilled nursing care, to those not eligible for Old Age Assistance cash payments. When Kerr-Mills was integrated into Medicaid in 1965, an entitlement to skilled nursing facility care for beneficiaries age 21 and older was created, requiring all states to offer this service. In 1987, Congress eliminated the distinction between skilled nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities in the Medicaid program, now collectively referred to as nursing facilities. This legislative change stimulated growth in the nursing home industry, leading to a significant increase in the number of nursing homes and beds from 1960 to 1970. Since 1970, the number of nursing homes nationwide has decreased, but the number of beds has significantly increased. In 2014, there were 15,600 nursing homes with about 1.7 million beds. Home care services, including home health care, were established as optional services under Medicaid in 1965. Congress later required states to provide home health care to those entitled to skilled nursing facility care, leading to the authorization of other home and community-based services over time. In 1981, Congress authorized the Medicaid Section 1915(c) Home and Community-Based Waiver Program to expand HCBS, responding to the desire of individuals with disabilities to stay in their homes. The Section 1915(c) waiver program was established by Congress to address the lack of federal funding for home and community-based care. It allowed states to cover nonmedical services to assist individuals with independent living. In 1999, the U.S. Supreme Court's Olmstead Decision ruled that institutionalizing individuals who could be cared for in community settings was a violation of Title II. The Olmstead Decision in 1999 ruled that institutionalizing individuals who could be cared for in community settings was a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. This led to federal activities promoting expanded Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) for persons with disabilities. States have since adopted HCBS waiver programs to offer LTSS beneficiaries community-based care. Congress provided funding for the Real Choice Systems Change Grants for Community Living Program to support Medicaid LTSS transformation towards HCBS. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 established optional state plan Medicaid benefits for covering certain HCBS. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 established two optional state plan Medicaid benefits for covering Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS). One option allows states to cover HCBS without requiring a waiver, targeting specific populations to prevent institutional care. The second option enables states to offer consumer-directed personal care services with individual budgets and non-traditional goods and services, giving states greater flexibility in providing HCBS while controlling spending. The DRA established the Money Follows the Person Program to help Medicaid beneficiaries move from institutional settings back to their homes. The ACA provided new options under Medicaid to increase coverage of HCBS, including the Community First Choice Option and expanded HCBS state plan options. The ACA expanded Medicaid options for HCBS, including increasing income limits, allowing states to target specific populations, adding new services, creating a new eligibility pathway, and establishing incentive programs like BIP and MFP. The ACA expanded Medicaid options for HCBS, including increasing income limits, targeting specific populations, adding new services, creating a new eligibility pathway, and establishing incentive programs like BIP and MFP. Additionally, funding was provided through 2016 to support state grantees and award grants to additional states."
