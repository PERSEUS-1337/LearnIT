    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Carbon Capture Improvement Act of 2017\". Congress acknowledges the importance of carbon dioxide capture and storage from various industries to protect the environment and enhance the economy and national security of the United States. The country leads in this technology but faces high costs that need to be reduced for widespread implementation. Lowering financing costs for carbon dioxide capture projects through tax-exempt private activity bonds can accelerate technology deployment. This can further improve economic prospects if the captured carbon dioxide is sold for industrial use, such as enhanced oil recovery operations. Allow tax-exempt financing for capital equipment used in carbon dioxide capture to reduce project costs and speed up deployment. Accelerating deployment of carbon dioxide capture technology can help the United States achieve environmental, economic, and national security goals. SEC. 3. CARBON DIOXIDE CAPTURE FACILITIES. SEC. 3 amends Section 142 of the Internal Revenue Code to include qualified carbon dioxide capture facilities as eligible components of industrial carbon dioxide facilities. The term 'eligible component' refers to equipment in an industrial carbon dioxide facility used for capture, treatment, purification, compression, transportation, or on-site storage of carbon dioxide. It also includes equipment integral or functionally related to a specific process. An industrial carbon dioxide facility emits carbon dioxide from various processes such as fuel combustion, gasification, bioindustrial, fermentation, and manufacturing industries. An industrial carbon dioxide facility does not include geological gas facilities or air separation units that do not qualify as gasification equipment or are not necessary for an oxy-fuel combustion process. The term 'geological gas facility' refers to a facility that produces gas or mixed gas and liquid from a geological formation, removes impurities, or separates the product into its parts. Industrial carbon dioxide facilities must meet a capture and storage requirement. The capture and storage percentage for industrial carbon dioxide facilities must be equal to or greater than 65 percent. If the facility's percentage is less than 65 percent, the financing with tax-exempt bonds cannot exceed the capture and storage percentage. The annual metric tons of carbon dioxide captured, transported, and injected into geologic storage or enhanced oil recovery wells, divided by the total metric tons of industrial greenhouse gas emissions, must be equal to or greater than 65 percent for eligibility for financing with tax-exempt bonds. The industrial carbon dioxide facility must capture and store at least 65 percent of greenhouse gas emissions to be eligible for financing with tax-exempt bonds. Eligible components designed for specific emission sources within the facility will have capture and storage percentages determined based on those sources. Amendments are made to the Volume Cap section of the Code. Amendments are made to the tax code regarding private business use and qualified carbon dioxide capture facilities owned by governmental units. The effective date for these amendments is after December 31, 2017."
