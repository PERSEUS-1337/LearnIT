    "title": "AB 1423",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature recognizes the fundamental right of adults in state prison to control their own health care decisions, including the choice to withhold life-sustaining treatment. Capacity for informed consent should be determined at the institution where the patient is housed. Existing protections for health care decision-making for these adults are deemed inadequate due to their confinement and frequent movement between institutions. The Legislature acknowledges the need for adults in state prison to have their capacity issues addressed by a neutral third party. A new section in the Penal Code establishes a presumption that adults in state prison have the capacity to make health care decisions, with exceptions. A licensed physician or dentist treating an adult inmate in state prison may file a petition with the Office of Administrative Hearings to determine the patient's capacity to give informed consent or make health care decisions, and request appointment of a surrogate decisionmaker if necessary. Preference is given to next of kin or family members as surrogate decisionmakers for inmate patients, unless they are unsuitable or unable to serve. The petition must include the inmate's current physical and mental health conditions, as well as deficits in mental functions. (4) Explanation of how deficits identified affect inmate patient's ability to participate in healthcare decisions.\n(5) Discussion on whether deficits are transient, fixed, or likely to change during court order.\n(6) Efforts to obtain informed consent or refusal from inmate patient.\n(7) Efforts to locate next of kin as surrogate decisionmaker, including names and addresses if found. (8) Consider the impact of appointing a surrogate decisionmaker for the inmate patient, including their ability to act in the patient's best interests and make healthcare decisions. (9) Discuss the inmate patient's desires, any advance directives or POLST forms, and how these may influence the decision-making process. The petitioner must recommend a surrogate decisionmaker for the inmate patient and provide reasons for the recommendation. The petition must be served on the inmate patient and their counsel, filed with the Office of Administrative Hearings, and counsel appointed. The inmate patient must be informed of their rights, including the right to be present at the hearing, be represented by counsel, present evidence, cross-examine witnesses, and seek reconsideration of the judge's decision once per year. The inmate patient's counsel has the right to access relevant medical and central file records, health care appeals, and certain legal filings. This includes the right to file petitions for writ of administrative mandamus and habeas corpus in superior court. The inmate patient is entitled to a hearing before an administrative law judge within 30 days of filing a petition. The inmate patient or their counsel must file a response within 14 days of the petition, unless a shorter time is requested by the physician or dentist and ordered by the judge. The response must be served to all parties involved. In an emergency, the inmate patient's physician or dentist can administer a medical intervention requiring informed consent before the administrative hearing. The inmate patient can contest a decision authorizing a surrogate decisionmaker by filing a petition for writ of administrative mandamus. In an initial or renewal proceeding, a party can file one motion for reconsideration per year in front of the administrative law judge regarding an inmate patient's capacity for informed consent or health care decisions. The motion can review the need for a surrogate decisionmaker or the appointed individual without requiring a formal rehearing unless ordered by the judge. To renew an existing order appointing a surrogate decisionmaker, a renewal petition must be filed by the current physician or dentist. The renewal is for an additional year at a time, with a renewal hearing conducted before the expiration of the current order. The inmate patient is brought before an administrative law judge for a review of their medical and mental health condition. The renewal petition is served on the inmate patient and their counsel, and filed with the Office of Administrative Hearings on the same day. The renewal hearing is held in accordance with specific guidelines. The renewal hearing for appointing a surrogate decisionmaker is conducted before the expiration of the current order. The inmate patient is provided with counsel and written notice of their rights, including the right to be present, represented by counsel, present evidence, cross-examine witnesses, seek reconsideration, and file petitions for review in superior court. The inmate patient's counsel has access to relevant medical records and health care appeals. The renewal petition for appointing a surrogate decisionmaker must be reviewed by an administrative law judge and include the current status of the inmate patient's elements, need for a surrogate decisionmaker, and capacity to make health care decisions. (l) A licensed physician or dentist can administer care without a court order under Section 3201 of the Probate Code. (m) Inmate patients lacking capacity can seek judicial relief through a petition for writ of administrative mandamus or habeas corpus regarding their treatment decisions. The decisions and actions of a licensed physician, surrogate decision-maker, and administrative law judge in accordance with inmate patient's desires or best interests are protected from liability. Determinations made must be documented in the inmate patient's medical record. The administrative law judge must provide a written order determining if clear and convincing evidence supports specific occurrences in petitions filed. The written decision for an inmate patient's health care must include efforts to obtain informed consent, lack of capacity for decision-making, identification of surrogate decision-makers, and any advance directives or desires regarding health care. The administrative law judge appoints a surrogate decisionmaker for health care for inmate patients based on findings and considerations of best interests, timeliness, and urgency. Family members or relatives are preferred, excluding Department of Corrections employees or peace officers unless specific conditions apply. The administrative law judge appoints a surrogate decisionmaker for health care for inmate patients, preferably a family member or relative who will act in the inmate patient's best interests and consider their personal values and wishes. The administrative law judge appoints a surrogate decisionmaker for health care for inmate patients, preferably a family member or relative who will act in the inmate patient's best interests and consider their personal values and wishes. The appointed surrogate decisionmaker may be specified by their functional role at the institution, such as \"Chief Physician and Surgeon\" or \"Chief Medical Executive,\" to provide clarity and anticipate potential personnel changes. The surrogate decisionmaker appointed by an administrative law judge for inmate patients must follow the inmate's personal values and wishes, as well as any advance directives or documented desires. The decision and order appointing the surrogate decisionmaker will be placed in the inmate patient's health care record. An order appointing a surrogate decisionmaker for an inmate patient lacking capacity is valid for one year in California state correctional facilities. The sending institution must inform the receiving institution of the order if the inmate is moved. The section does not apply to emergency health care or care for unemancipated minors. It cannot be used for inmate control over finances, marital status, convulsive treatment, psychosurgery, sterilization, abortion, or involuntary psychiatric medication. The Secretary of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation may create regulations for this section."
