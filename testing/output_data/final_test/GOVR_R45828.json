    "content": "Congress chartered Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), to promote homeownership by providing liquidity to the secondary markets for residential mortgages. The GSEs guarantee single-family mortgages and issue mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) to investors, who assume prepayment risk. MBSs are more liquid than original mortgages, allowing for quicker trading or selling for cash. The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) supervises the GSEs to ensure their safety and soundness, especially after experiencing losses due to mortgage defaults and spikes in borrowing rates. This oversight helps make homeownership more affordable by increasing funds available for mortgages. The GSEs were placed under conservatorship by the FHFA after experiencing losses from mortgage defaults and borrowing rate spikes. The FHFA has management powers until the GSEs' financial safety is restored. Three conservatorship goals aim to restore confidence in the GSEs and reduce credit risk to taxpayers. The GSEs must promote a stable housing finance market, increase private capital's role, and develop a modern securitization infrastructure. The PSPAs outline conditions for U.S. Treasury financial support. The PSPAs stipulate conditions for U.S. Treasury financial support to the GSEs under conservatorship, including dividend payments to Treasury, portfolio size reduction, and uncertainty about future support. Congressional interest in the GSEs persists due to market uncertainties, with potential impacts on mortgage availability if the GSEs are reformed or replaced. During the 116th Congress, there was significant interest in housing finance reform, with proposals from the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and a memorandum from President Donald J. Trump directing federal agencies to develop a plan. The FHFA has been focusing on managing the credit and liquidity risks of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, including sharing more credit risk linked to single-family mortgage purchases. The GSEs are required to share credit risk with the private sector to reduce taxpayer burden and standardize processes for MBS liquidity. Policy implications include harmonizing business models and ensuring legal protections for loan originators. The ability to meet affordable housing goals may depend on borrower risk characteristics eligible for securitization. The GSEs purchase conforming mortgages from loan originators in the secondary market, and the expiration of the GSE patch (or QM patch) in January 2021 may impact how secondary-market participants respond. Borrowers obtain mortgages from loan originators in the primary market, as the GSEs cannot originate mortgages directly to borrowers. The GSEs acquire conforming mortgages through cash payments or swap agreements with loan originators. They issue MBSs to investors, which are derivative products containing financial risks from the original mortgages. Investors receive a coupon composed of principal and interest repayments. An MBS investor receives a coupon, which is the yield from borrowers' principal and interest repayments, net of various fees. The GSEs act as financial intermediaries, matching mortgage borrowers with lenders, similar to banks in a traditional banking model. The GSEs create profitable lending spreads by issuing debt securities with shorter maturities to investors, financing assets retained in their lending portfolios and conforming mortgages held in MBS trusts. This allows them to retain all profits generated by lending spreads if financial risks are kept on their balance sheet. The GSEs issue debentures to fund their lending portfolios and MBS trusts, creating lending spreads. They also issue MBSs in the TBA market, acting like bond insurers by retaining credit risk. A guarantee fee is deducted to compensate for credit risk. The GSEs charge a guarantee fee to cover the risk of borrower default on mortgage loans, benefiting MBS investors. In case of default, the GSEs ensure timely payment to MBS investors by purchasing the defaulted mortgage from the MBS trust. This prevents investors from losing their initial investments. Prepayment risk is transferred from the GSEs to MBS investors. Prepayment risk is transferred from the GSEs to MBS investors, who face the risk of borrowers repaying mortgages early, leading to lower interest revenue. This risk is passed on when borrowers refinance at lower rates or move, reducing MBS coupons. GSEs separate mortgage risks, retaining default risk for a fee and transferring prepayment risk to investors. MBSs are considered derivative securities as they only contain one of the original mortgage risks. The risks associated with MBS trusts are often linked to the underlying mortgages. Bonds and derivatives trade over-the-counter, with varying trade sizes causing valuation challenges. Illiquid securities may require a liquidity premium for trading. Widening bid-ask spreads indicate the inclusion of a liquidity premium in securities prices. The GSEs' MBSs trade in the OTC market and are almost as liquid as U.S. Treasury bonds. Prior to conservatorship, the GSEs could actively trade their own MBSs to maintain market liquidity and reduce mortgage costs for borrowers. Persistent liquidity premiums could lead to higher mortgage rates if investors demand greater compensation for the risk of selling MBSs at lower prices in the future. The TBA market allows for the purchase of MBSs in advance, with investors paying higher costs to hedge against adverse interest rate movements. Investors pay higher costs to cover liquidity premiums before settlement date, impacting borrowers' interest rates. GSEs' high-volume trading narrows bid-ask MBS spreads in TBA and OTC markets. The $250 billion cap on GSEs' lending portfolios limits their market influence. The Federal Reserve's MBS purchases are retained in its portfolio, reducing GSEs' active trading. Since conservatorship, the FHFA has focused on credit risks and liquidity of MBS issuances by GSEs. Initiatives include requiring GSEs to pay dividends to the Treasury, reduce credit risk, and increase private sector's role in risk sharing. Various programs aim to achieve these objectives. The FHFA has focused on credit risks and liquidity of MBS issuances by GSEs since conservatorship. Various programs aim to reduce credit risk and increase the private sector's role in risk sharing. Additional credit enhancements are required for mortgages with an LTV above 80%. Borrowers can purchase private mortgage insurance to cover the first 20% of losses in case of default. The FHFA requires GSEs to pay PMI initially and be reimbursed later by borrowers via interest rate adjustments on their loans. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have programs for PMI with select PMI providers to reduce counterparty risk. GSEs can increase g-fees to generate revenues and cover potential credit losses. In December 2011, Congress directed the FHFA to increase the ongoing guarantee fees for all loans by 10 basis points, which took effect on December 1, 2012. The FHFA also increased guarantee fees in 2013. In 2017, the average guarantee fee was reported to be 56 basis points, unchanged from 2016. Additionally, in July 2013, the GSEs initiated new credit risk transfer programs to share credit risk with the private sector. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have introduced credit risk transfer (CRT) instruments, such as Connecticut Avenue Securities (CAS) and Structural Agency Credit Risk (STACR), to shift credit risk to investors. These instruments function similarly to MBSs but focus on credit risk rather than prepayment risk. The GSEs transfer credit risk for mortgages with high LTVs to investors, who receive reduced coupons after defaults. This allows the private sector to earn revenue by assuming credit risk previously held by the GSEs. The GSEs use credit risk transfer (CRT) programs to shift credit risk to investors, reducing their exposure to mortgage credit risk. These programs have grown rapidly, filling the gap left by the private-label MBS market pre-2008. However, the Congressional Budget Office reports that the GSEs' CRT transactions may not necessarily reduce taxpayers' costs. The FHFA suspended the GSEs' capital requirements during conservatorship, allowing them to pay dividends only to the Treasury. Feedback is being solicited on establishing a prospective capital framework for the GSEs to operate after a financial crisis. The statutory minimum leverage capital requirement is 2.5% of on-balance sheet assets. The FHFA has the authority to increase capital standards above the statutory minimum for the GSEs. Initiatives have been introduced to standardize operations, including mortgage data collection, securitization processes, and mortgage servicing policies. Standardization aims to increase transparency, reduce origination and securitization processes, and enhance liquidity and pricing of MBS and CRT issuances. The FHFA's mortgage data standardization initiative requires the GSEs to support standardizing single-family mortgage data information. In 2012, FHFA mandated the GSEs to jointly develop a new platform, the Common Securitization Solutions (CSS), to modernize their securitization processes. The GSEs continue to acquire mortgages and establish loss-mitigation practices for delinquent and defaulted mortgages. The GSEs utilize the Common Securitization Solutions (CSS) as a technology service provider to standardize mortgage data and modernize securitization processes. In the TBA market, loan originators sell mortgages to the GSEs in exchange for MBS at a future date, with specific features negotiated in advance. MBSs meeting criteria can be delivered as long as underlying MBS pools are compliant. MBSs meeting criteria can be delivered if the underlying pools are fungible. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac MBSs have not been interchangeable, with Freddie Mac's MBSs trading at lower prices due to faster prepayment rates, leading to higher prepayment risk for investors. The persistent pricing differential between Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac MBSs led to an exploitable arbitrage opportunity for large originators. Freddie Mac responded by lowering its g-fees to remain competitive. This pricing difference, combined with Freddie Mac's lower MBS issuance and trading activity, arguably creates a taxpayer subsidy for larger loan originators. Under the single security initiative, the FHFA has directed the GSEs to align their key contractual and business practices by acquiring mortgages with similar prepayment speeds. Harmonizing the financial characteristics of their mortgage purchases would allow the GSEs' MBS trusts to generate similar cash-flow predictability and prepayment speeds, facilitating the creation of uniform securities when issued through the CSP. The GSEs must align their prepayment speeds to avoid material misalignment, with a maximum deviation of 2% over a three-month interval. The FHFA has directed the GSEs to issue a uniform mortgage-backed security (UMBS) through the CSP to enhance market liquidity and eliminate pricing differentials. UMBS issuances began on June 3, 2019, with FHFA monitoring GSEs' underwriting policies to maintain UMBS fungibility. Congress established GSEs with a public policy mission to support affordable housing and implemented new mortgage market underwriting requirements post-Great Recession to mitigate systemic risks. The GSEs are under conservatorship and face challenges in meeting statutory single- and multi-family goals for affordable housing. They must satisfy housing goals for low and extremely low-income families, develop duty to serve plans for underserved markets, and make cash contributions to promote affordable housing. The GSEs are required by HERA to contribute to the Housing Trust Fund (HTF) and the Capital Magnet Fund (CMF) to support affordable rental housing for low-income families. They must set aside a percentage of mortgage purchases for these funds, but face challenges in meeting affordable housing goals while under conservatorship. The FHFA suspended the GSEs' contributions to the HTF and CMF between 2008 and 2014, reinstating the requirement in 2015. The PSPA caps limit the GSEs' ability to purchase mortgages with nonstandardized characteristics. Changing market conditions may prompt the GSEs to be more deliberate in allocating their portfolios for specific purposes, potentially affecting their ability to securitize mortgages supporting affordable housing goals. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau implemented the ability-to-repay requirement of the Dodd-Frank Act on January 10, 2014, requiring lenders to verify borrowers' ability to repay with documentation. The final rule provides ways for loan originators to comply, including originating a qualified mortgage (QM) with safe harbor legal protection. QM loans have underwriting requirements, such as a 43% debt-to-income ratio limit. Loans with DTI over 43% can still receive QM status with federal agency guarantee. The QM patch allows GSEs to operate under their own QM rules until January 10, 2021. The Federal Housing Administration, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and United States Department of Agriculture did not adopt a 43% DTI requirement for the mortgages they guarantee. Instead, they created their own QM definitions, excluding certain product features. The CFPB's QM rule exempted mortgages eligible for purchase by the GSEs from the 43% DTI cap. Loan originations acquired by the GSEs or guaranteed by federal agencies receive QM status. The market has diminished, and the roles of GSEs and federal agencies in guaranteeing or issuing residential mortgage loans have increased. Originators are focusing on making QM loans to avoid legal risks, especially since the 1994 HOEPA law. HOEPA lending declined after new regulations expanded the definition of high-cost mortgages. After the Georgia Anti-Predatory Lending Act of 2002, GSEs stopped purchasing mortgages in Georgia to avoid legal risks. Mortgage originators are now mainly offering QM safe harbor loans. The future purchase of non-QM loans by GSEs is uncertain if the QM patch expires. This could impact borrower access to mortgage credit and increase costs. If the QM patch expires, borrower access to mortgage credit may be affected, leading to increased costs. MBS and CRT financial markets could become more volatile post January 2021."
