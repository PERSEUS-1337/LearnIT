    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Military Voters' Equal Access to Voter Registration Act of 2009\". Congress finds that military voters face significant challenges in voting due to their transient nature and frequent deployments, often resulting in disenfranchisement. Military voters are typically absent from their home voting jurisdictions on election day and must vote by absentee ballot. In 1986, Congress passed the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act to help military voters vote by absentee ballot in federal elections. However, the system has consistently failed to ensure military voters receive their ballots on time. In 1993, Congress enacted the National Voter Registration Act to improve voter registration opportunities. The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act aimed to provide voting assistance to citizens, but military voters often lack access to voter registration help due to their service taking them away from their home jurisdictions. The Inspector General of the Department of Defense found that military voters do not receive enough information and assistance to register and request absentee ballots. Millions of military voters have been disenfranchised due to the current system's failure to provide them with voting information and assistance. In the 2006 election, only 22 percent of military voters were able to successfully vote, representing half of the overall national population that voted. In the 2008 Presidential election, a study by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission revealed that a small fraction of military voters were able to request absentee ballots, with many ballots sent to outdated addresses. Only 21.9 percent of eligible military voters in the 6 States with the largest military population were able to request absentee ballots. The military voters faced challenges in receiving absentee ballots due to outdated addresses. Improved efforts by the Armed Forces to provide voting information and assistance during address changes would enhance military voters' participation in the democratic process. This would increase the ability of military voters to request and obtain absentee ballots, ensuring local election officials have updated addresses for sending out ballots. SEC. 3. TREATMENT OF ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY INSTALLATIONS. Section 7 of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 is amended to include a new subsection requiring each Secretary of a military department to designate an office on each military installation to assist individuals in registering to vote, updating voter registration information, and requesting absentee ballots under the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act. The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act specifies individuals eligible for assistance with voter registration, including members of the Armed Forces undergoing duty changes or overseas deployment of at least 6 months, and their dependents over 18 years old requesting voter registration assistance. The assistance for voter registration is provided to members of the Armed Forces aged 18 and above during duty changes or deployment, upon arrival, deployment, return, or upon request. The Secretary of a military department designates an office to assist members of the Armed Forces with voter registration upon request. SEC. 4. OUTREACH FOR MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS. The Secretary of each military department must inform Armed Forces members and their dependents about voter registration assistance under the National Voter Registration Act, including where and how to access it. A report on implementation status is required within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Secretary of each military department must submit a report to Congress on the implementation status of section 7(d) of the National Voter Registration Act, including specific steps taken and office designations. Additionally, a report on the utilization of voter registration assistance is required. The Secretary of each military department must report to Congress on the implementation of voter registration assistance programs, including details on specific programs and the number of military members and dependents who utilized them. The Secretary of each military department must report to Congress on voter registration assistance programs, including details on programs and the number of military members and dependents who used them. Relevant committees of Congress are defined as specific committees in the Senate and House of Representatives."
