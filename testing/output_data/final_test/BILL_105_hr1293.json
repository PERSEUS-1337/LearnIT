    "content": "The \"Demilitarization Act of 1997\" may be cited as the official title. Key findings are outlined in the Act. The Congress finds that global military spending of $840 billion annually, supporting 23 million soldiers, poses a threat to security by diverting funds from essential programs like health and education. Developed nations, led by the United States, are responsible for 77% of military expenditures and 94% of arms transfers to developing countries. The United States and other developed nations control international financial institutions that subsidize excessive military spending in various countries. Developing nations also contribute significantly to high military expenditures, surpassing foreign aid receipts. In the developing world, military spending rivals education spending, despite a large population unable to read or write. In the developing world, military spending exceeds health spending, leading to preventable deaths from infectious diseases. Lack of transparency in military budgets fuels corruption and hinders efforts for good governance. Armed forces' involvement in the civilian economy distorts prices and undermines economic stability in countries like Chile, China, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Indonesia. Ecuador, Guatemala, and Indonesia's military involvement in the civilian economy distorts prices, reduces competition, and increases political power, posing a threat to economic and political freedom in the developing world. Top-ranking officials have recognized the need to reduce world military spending, with Congress and the President making it a goal of US foreign policy. The US government has enacted various measures to promote reductions in military spending through international financial institutions, as outlined in specific acts and sections. The US government has enacted measures to promote reductions in military spending through international financial institutions, as outlined in specific acts and sections such as the Financing and Related Programs Appropriations Act of 1994 and the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act of 1997. These acts require reporting on countries' efforts to reduce military spending and take into account recipient countries' commitment to accurate military spending data and ending military involvement in the civilian economy. The 1997 Act mandates the US Executive Director of international financial institutions to oppose funding for countries without civilian audit systems for military spending. Despite high-level statements and requirements in law, little progress has been made in establishing mechanisms for regional talks on mutual military reductions or verifying military budgets through accepted auditing procedures. Dr. Oscar Arias, former President of Costa Rica and Nobel Peace Laureate, has joined over 80 citizens in advocating for these changes. Dr. Oscar Arias, 1987 Nobel Peace Laureate, has teamed up with 80 citizens' groups worldwide to propose The Year 2000 Campaign to Redirect World Military Spending to Human Development. The plan includes 6 proposals aimed at reducing military threats and expenditures by the year 2000. Special envoys appointed by the UN Secretary-General organize demilitarization talks in different regions. Nations meet with their regional envoy to discuss plans for reduced force levels and participate in negotiations to identify military capacities and implement mutual force reductions. These negotiations aim to reduce the threat posed by nations due to the size, proximity, and technological sophistication of their armed forces. Savings from reduced military spending are used to implement economic reforms in cooperation with grassroots organizations. Industrialized nations support demilitarization efforts in developing countries by conditioning aid to promote demilitarization. This includes debt forgiveness for military conversion, special funding for demilitarization programs, transparency in military budgets, and ending military involvement in the civilian economy. The Arias Peace Pledge is being signed by citizens worldwide, supporting The Year 2000 Campaign's proposal to redirect world military spending to human development. The United Nations is expected to consider crucial components of this 6-point plan. The Act aims to enhance international security by utilizing international financial institutions and the United Nations to shift global military spending towards human development. Special envoys for mutual disarmament will be appointed. The President will direct the US Ambassador to the UN to support resolutions for appointing special envoys for conflict prevention and organizing disarmament talks worldwide. Member states must meet with regional envoys to discuss confidence-building measures within 3 months of appointment. The President will direct the US Ambassador to the UN to support resolutions appointing special envoys for conflict prevention and organizing disarmament talks worldwide. Member states must meet with regional envoys to discuss confidence-building measures with the goal of significant cuts in military spending by 2000. SEC. 5. ALTERNATIVE SECURITY PLAN. The President must submit a report to Congress and the UN detailing changes in global military forces to achieve a significant reduction in US military spending by 2000. SEC. 6. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS. The Congress believes the US should not provide aid or arms to foreign governments opposed by the US at international financial institutions. The President should assign USAID to lead determinations and report annually on integrating military spending issues. Integrating military spending issues into the loan review process of international financial institutions."
