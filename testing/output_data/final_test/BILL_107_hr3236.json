    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Patient and Physician Safety and Protection Act of 2001\". Congress acknowledges that the Federal government spends $8 billion annually on training resident-physicians through Medicare. Resident-physicians often engage in non-educational activities, work excessive hours, and suffer from sleep deprivation, leading to cognitive impairment. Excessive work hours for resident-physicians lead to medical errors, accidents, depression, and pregnancy complications. The medical community has not effectively addressed this issue. Different medical specialties have varying patient care considerations, but sleep deprivation affects resident-physicians across all specialties. The Federal government has regulated work hours in other industries for safety reasons. SEC. 3. REVISION OF MEDICARE HOSPITAL CONDITIONS OF PARTICIPATION REGARDING WORKING HOURS OF RESIDENTS. The Medicare Hospital Conditions of Participation are being revised to include limits on working hours for physicians and postgraduate trainees to ensure quality medical care in hospitals. Hospitals must establish limits on working hours for medical staff and postgraduate trainees, including a maximum of 80 hours per week and 24 hours per shift for trainees. Trainees must have at least 10 hours between shifts, one full day off every 7 days, one full weekend off per month, no more than 12 continuous hours in the emergency department, and on-call duty no more often than every third night. The Secretary will establish regulations to ensure quality care during the transfer of patient care between postgraduate trainees every 24 hours. Work hour limitations do not apply during a state of emergency. Regulations will monitor and supervise trainees for quality patient care. Hospitals must inform trainees of these regulations. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will designate an individual to handle complaints from postgraduate trainees reporting violations of work hour requirements. Trainees must be informed of their rights, including whistle-blower protections, and the effects of sleep deprivation on themselves and patients. (2) Grievance rights allow postgraduate trainees or physician residents to file complaints anonymously with the Secretary of Health and Human Services for violations. The Secretary can investigate and take corrective action. (3) Hospitals violating these requirements may face civil money penalties up to $100,000 per resident training program every 6 months. (4) Violations must be disclosed, and annual reports are required. The individual designated under paragraph (1) shall provide for annual anonymous surveys of postgraduate trainees to determine compliance with requirements, conduct on-site investigations based on survey results, disclose violations and compliance publicly, and make an annual report to Congress on hospital compliance. Whistleblower protections for hospitals covered by specific requirements include prohibiting penalties, discrimination, or retaliation against employees who report violations in good faith to regulatory agencies or hospital management. Employees are protected from penalties, discrimination, or retaliation for reporting violations in good faith to regulatory agencies or hospital management. Good faith is defined as believing the reported information is true. The amendments require that reported information is true and indicate a violation may occur. The effective date is at least 1 year after enactment. Additional funding is appropriated to the Secretary of Health and Human Services for hospitals to cover additional costs incurred to comply with the Act."
