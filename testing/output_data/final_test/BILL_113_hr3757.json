The text discusses a 20 percent credit for payments made to a biotechnology research consortium for biotechnology research. The amendment limits the amounts that can be considered for this credit to 20 percent of the payments made by the taxpayer to the consortium during the taxable year. The text introduces amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 regarding biotechnology research consortiums. It includes changes to contract research expenses and defines a biotechnology research consortium as an organization involved in biotechnology research. A biotechnology research consortium is defined as an organization primarily conducting biotechnology research in the public interest, exempt from tax under section 501(c)(3), not a private foundation, and with at least 3 unrelated persons contributing to expenses. The taxable year of a biotechnology research consortium begins with contributions limited to no single person exceeding 50% of total amounts received for research. Applicable rules similar to those for tax-exempt organizations apply. The amendments made by this section shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2013. The term 'biotechnology research' excludes research that is not qualified research or energy research. The Energy Research Consortium now requires only 3 unrelated persons instead of 5."
