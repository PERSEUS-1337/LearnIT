    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Seniors' Medication Copayment Reduction Act of 2009\". Congress finds that patient-level financial barriers, like copayments, reduce the use of high-value medical services and prescription medications. Reducing cost-sharing can improve health outcomes and lower medical expenses. Financial barriers to high-value medications should be minimized to enhance medication adherence. Value-Based Insurance Design acknowledges the varying clinical benefits of medical services and medications, suggesting adjustments to patient out-of-pocket costs. Value-Based Insurance Design for Medicare medications can optimize clinical gains for each dollar spent, benefiting seniors and responsibly using taxpayer dollars by adjusting patient out-of-pocket costs according to the value of services provided. SEC. 3. DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a demonstration program to test Value-Based Insurance Design for Medicare beneficiaries with chronic conditions. At least 2 Medicare Advantage plans will be selected to participate initially, meeting specific requirements such as offering a coordinated Part D drug benefit. The Secretary will establish a 5-year demonstration program to test Value-Based Insurance Design for Medicare beneficiaries with chronic conditions. If the program reduces Medicare expenditures or improves the quality of healthcare services, it may be expanded. The Secretary may expand the existing Value-Based Insurance Design demonstration program if it proves beneficial to the Medicare program. Utilizing this methodology, the Secretary will identify medications for which copayments or coinsurance should be reduced or eliminated. Value-Based Insurance Design is a methodology to reduce copayments for specific high-value medications used to treat conditions like asthma, atrial fibrillation, deep venous thrombosis, COPD, and chronic renal failure. The report on the implementation of the demonstration program under this section must be submitted to Congress by the Secretary within 1 year of the Act's enactment. The report should include a statement listing each medication identified in subsection (d)(1). The Secretary will contract with an independent entity to review and assess the implementation of the demonstration program. This includes assessing the utilization of methodologies and analyzing the impact of reducing or eliminating copayments for medications. The Secretary will contract with an independent entity to review and assess the implementation of the demonstration program, including analyzing the impact of reducing or eliminating copayments for medications. The entity will conduct an analysis on medication adherence, health outcomes, cost savings, and any other relevant matters as deemed appropriate by the Secretary. The entity will submit a report to the Secretary for inclusion in the overall assessment report. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress within 3 years of the Act's enactment, detailing the review and assessment results. Recommendations will be provided to improve Medicare beneficiaries' access to medications and enhance healthcare quality. The Secretary may waive provisions of the Social Security Act to carry out a demonstration program for Medicare. Funding for the program will be transferred from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Supplementary Insurance Trust Fund as determined appropriate by the Secretary."
