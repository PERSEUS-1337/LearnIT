    "content": "The Senate passed the STOCK Act in 2012, which included Title II, known as the Public Corruption Prosecution Improvements Act. This title closely mirrored H.R. 2572, approved by the House Judiciary Committee. However, the House removed Title II from the final bill. Federal officials prosecute corruption\u2014public and private; federal, state, local, territorial, and tribal\u2014under various statutes outlawing bribery, mail fraud, and wire fraud. Proposed bills aim to expand these statutes, increase penalties, and streamline prosecution procedures. The bills merge previous efforts in response to limitations on honest services fraud prosecutions and general concerns over public corruption. The Senate Judiciary Committee introduced similar provisions in the past. The mail fraud and wire fraud statutes have a long history in federal public corruption statutes, dating back to the dawn of the Republic. These statutes were used to prosecute corrupt state and local officials, protecting the public's right to honest services. The statutes have been applied to both tangible and intangible property, including the right of an employer or the public to the honest services of an employee or public official. The Supreme Court limited the scope of honest services fraud in response to challenges, leading to the enactment of 18 U.S.C. 1346 to define the term \"scheme to defraud\" in mail and wire fraud statutes. The lower federal courts created standards to restrict the application of honest services mail and wire fraud, but the Supreme Court in Skilling opted for a narrow interpretation. The Supreme Court in Skilling narrowed the definition of honest services fraud to include schemes involving bribes and kickbacks. Proposed legislation aims to expand the definition to include undisclosed self-dealing by public officials, covering federal, state, and local levels. The proposed legislation aims to expand the definition of honest services fraud to include undisclosed self-dealing by public officials, involving actions that further their financial interests and failure to disclose required information. The legislation aims to include undisclosed self-dealing by public officials, where actions further their financial interests without disclosure. The terms \"material,\" \"financial interest,\" and \"thing of value\" are defined in a way that emphasizes the importance of intent in benefiting a financial interest. The terms \"thing of value\" and \"anything of value\" in federal criminal law refer to a wide range of tangible and intangible benefits, including campaign contributions, employment, and more. The term \"financial interest\" is not commonly defined in federal criminal law but is familiar in conflict of interest provisions. The proposed undisclosed self-dealing section draws from the federal conflict-of-interest statute and only applies to financial interests that public officials are required to disclose. Prosecution under the proposed statute would require knowing concealment and specific intent to defraud. The proposal for an undisclosed self-dealing section requires knowing concealment and specific intent to defraud, criticized by a representative of the criminal defense bar as constitutionally suspect and overly simplistic. He raised concerns about First Amendment implications, overcriminalization, and intruding upon state prerogatives. The proposal was seen as at odds with part-time legislators and other officials, despite existing laws reaching bribery and kickbacks. The proposal adds unreported self-dealing in public corruption cases, seeking to overcome judicial interpretations of federal bribery statutes. It distinguishes between soliciting or offering anything of value in exchange for an official act and in gratitude for the performance of an official act. The issue in Sun Diamond was whether illegal gratuities conviction could be based solely on gifts given to a public official because of his office. The Court unanimously concluded that to establish a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7201(c)(1)(A), the Government must prove a link between a thing of value given to a public official and a specific 'official act' for which it was given. Justice Scalia asserted that this requirement helps avoid unintended application of the gratuities subsection by defining a qualifying \"official act.\" The official act requirement is crucial in preventing absurdities in the law. The bills aim to expand the illegal gratuities prohibition and redefine \"official acts\" to prevent unintended consequences. They propose amending subsection 201(c) to prohibit gifts given because of an official's position, including \"status\" and \"good will\" gifts, without the need to link them to a specific official act. This would enhance the scope of the illegal gratuities subsection. The proposed amendments aim to expand the illegal gratuities prohibition by prohibiting gifts given due to an official's position, without the need to link them to a specific official act. This would prevent unintended consequences and enhance the scope of the illegal gratuities subsection. The amendments also include creating a safe harbor for gifts and campaign contributions permitted by rule or regulation to avoid potential issues. The bills propose changes to illegal gratuities offenses, including establishing a $1,000 threshold and amending the definition of official act to address ambiguity and prevent unintended consequences. The Court of Appeals reversed the conviction of Valdes for bribery, stating that the definition of official act in the bribery statute refers to questions or matters determined by the government. The bills aim to clarify the definition of official act and ensure that the bribery statute applies to all conduct within the range of a public official's duties. The bills aim to clarify the definition of official act and ensure that the bribery statute applies to all conduct within the range of a public official's duties. The proposed changes include adding the term \"course of conduct\" to the definition of official act, with a focus on bribery and illegal gratuity offenses. The House bill would change the word \"means\" to \"includes,\" while the Senate bill would not. Section 666 outlaws bribery, embezzlement, and theft related to federal programs, with proposed language changes to lower the threshold for prosecution. The bills propose changes to Section 666, including lowering the threshold for federal prosecution to $1,000 and increasing the maximum term of imprisonment to 20 years. This aligns with statutes on embezzlement and bribery of federal officials. Section 641 outlaws theft of money or property belonging to the United States. The bills aim to address bribery, embezzlement, and theft related to federal programs. The bills aim to increase penalties for theft and embezzlement of federal property, including property of the D.C. government. The proposed changes would raise the maximum term of imprisonment from 10 to 20 years for violations of Section 641. The committee believes that harsher penalties are necessary to deter public corruption-related offenses. The House and Senate bills propose increasing penalties for federal public corruption offenses, including bribery and theft, to send a message of severe consequences for breaching public trust. The defense bar argues that the proposals would significantly lengthen prison sentences without evidence of necessity or cost considerations. The bills would raise maximum imprisonment terms for various offenses, such as bribery/theft relating to a federal program and theft of U.S. property. The House and Senate bills aim to increase penalties for federal public corruption offenses, including bribery and theft, to emphasize the seriousness of breaching public trust. H.R. 2572 would raise penalties for bribery of U.S. officials and illegal gratuities, while also directing the United States Sentencing Commission to review and potentially increase penalties for related offenses. The statute of limitations for federal crimes is typically five years, but certain offenses like capital crimes and child abduction have no time limit for prosecution. The proposed bills would establish a six-year statute of limitations for public corruption offenses involving bribery, theft, mail fraud, wire fraud, and extortion. The proposed bills would establish a six-year statute of limitations for public corruption offenses involving bribery, theft, mail fraud, wire fraud, and extortion, including specific federal statutes such as the Hobbs Act and RICO. The bills have certain drafting peculiarities, such as different limitations for various offenses and the inclusion of attempt crimes where applicable. The proposed bills aim to establish a six-year statute of limitations for public corruption offenses, including bribery, theft, mail fraud, wire fraud, and extortion. It is not a separate crime to attempt to violate certain statutes, but the proposal sets a uniform statute of limitations. The bills also address venue issues, allowing for trials in districts where conduct elements of the offense occur. The bills propose a change in venue statute to allow trials in districts where offenses involving mail, interstate commerce, or entry into the US are committed. This would apply to federal public corruption offenses and other federal crimes related to interstate commerce or mail use. Concerns were raised about potential unfairness to the accused and forum shopping. The Constitution may limit the scope of the proposal to acts that are conduct elements of the offense. The House and Senate bills propose venue changes for federal public corruption cases and other offenses related to mail or interstate commerce. The bills aim to allow trials in districts where the crimes were committed, addressing concerns about fairness and forum shopping. The proposed amendments would expand the scope of venue options for prosecuting offenses like witness tampering and obstruction of justice. The proposed amendments in the House and Senate bills aim to expand venue options for federal public corruption cases and offenses related to mail or interstate commerce. They also include changes to prosecution of obstructions under various statutes and wiretap authority for intercepting communications. The bills aim to expand venue options for federal public corruption cases and offenses related to mail or interstate commerce. They would add offenses under specific sections such as theft of federal property and major fraud against the United States. The Justice Department has expressed the need for these tools in such cases. The bills also address certification requirements for appeals by the Government, allowing certification by various high-ranking officials. H.R. 2572 and Title II are nearly identical in content. H.R. 2572 and Title II aim to expand venue options for federal public corruption cases and related offenses. H.R. 2572 proposes increasing the maximum imprisonment terms for bribery and illegal gratuities, while Title II would leave the penalties unchanged. Both bills would extend the illegal gratuities offense to include status gifts valued at $1,000 or more. H.R. 2572 aims to expand venue options for federal public corruption cases and related offenses by increasing maximum imprisonment terms for bribery and illegal gratuities. It would also extend the illegal gratuities offense to include status gifts valued at $1,000 or more, and expand Section 641 to cover property of the District of Columbia. Changes in the provisions include additional RICO predicates, the Cleveland fix, and penalty increases for certain public corruption offenses. The RICO Act targets enterprises involved in criminal activities affecting interstate commerce, with violations punishable by up to 20 years in prison and property confiscation. Proposed changes would expand the list of predicate offenses to include theft of federal property, bribery in federally assisted programs, and major fraud against the United States. Mail and wire fraud statutes prohibit using mail or wire communications to defraud others. The Supreme Court in Cleveland ruled that fraudulent schemes to induce a state to issue licenses are not covered by statutes targeting schemes involving money or property. Proposed legislation aimed to address this limitation, but current bills lack similar provisions."
