    "content": "The third in a series of CRS reports on pit manufacturing discusses the production of war reserve pits at the Rocky Flats Plant during the Cold War. Production halted in 1989, and the United States has made 29 war reserve pits for replacement in W88 submarine-launched ballistic missile warheads between 2007 and 2011. The Department of Defense stated the need for National Nuclear Security. The Department of Defense (DOD) stated the need for the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) to have the capacity to produce 50 to 80 pits per year to support nuclear weapon programs. Pits are to be made at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) in the PF-4 building, with Congress focusing on increasing production capacity through construction requirements. In the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015, Congress directed NNSA to increase pit production to 80 pits per year by 2027. The focus is on moving towards this production rate, requiring sufficient Material At Risk (MAR) and space. MAR is defined as radioactive materials vulnerable to physical stress, crucial for disaster preparedness. The report discusses the concept of space margin and MAR margin in relation to pit production at PF-4, which has 60,000 square feet of laboratory space. Various plutonium missions are supported, including pit fabrication and purifying plutonium for use in pits, as well as preparing plutonium-238 for space probes. PF-4 at Los Alamos National Laboratory is used for various plutonium missions, including pit fabrication, plutonium purification, and surveillance of pits. The facility has a ceiling of 1,800 kilograms Pu-239 equivalent for Material-At-Risk (MAR) usage. Analytical chemistry techniques are used to analyze plutonium samples for impurities and isotopes. The Radiological Laboratory-Utility-Office Building (RLUOB) near PF-4 houses analytical chemistry equipment for plutonium missions. RLUOB has 19,500 square feet of space for this purpose, with a MAR ceiling of 38.6 g Pu-239 equivalent. NNSA is considering increasing the MAR ceiling to 400 g. Options to increase margin for pit production are being evaluated, but figures for space and MAR required to produce 80 pits per year have never been calculated rigorously. The report presents a progression of options to increase feasibility for producing 80 pits per year by 2027. However, the time to implement these options is uncertain due to potential hurdles and construction delays. Detailed procedures and extensive analysis are required for any modifications to the pit production processes or structural changes to PF-4. Various organizations may contest proposed changes to regulations or assumptions used in the process. Efforts to develop new technologies may face challenges, including potential lawsuits and time-consuming implementation of changes. This report considers 16 options to meet the congressional requirement of producing 80 pits per year by 2027. Factors influencing the choice among options include reducing costs, accelerating schedule, increasing throughput, improving worker safety, and reducing public risk from radiation exposure. The report considers 16 options to meet the goal of producing 80 pits per year by 2027. One option aims to reduce space requirements, costs, and accelerate the schedule. The Department of Defense has emphasized the need for NNSA to have the capacity to manufacture 50 to 80 pits per year. The Nuclear Weapons Council considered utilizing existing infrastructure at Los Alamos to meet pit operational requirements, with a capacity of 50 to 80 pits per year. Uncertainty remains regarding the need for 80 pits per year or if 50 pits per year would suffice, especially with the potential increase in capacity with a second shift. NNSA's decision to defer the delivery of the first interoperable warhead adds to this uncertainty. The delivery of the first production unit of the first interoperable warhead (IW-1) may use a newly manufactured pit since 2011. There is a possibility of reusing retired pits to reduce the need for newly manufactured pits. Estimates of pit lifetime have increased, with some studies suggesting a lifespan of over 100 years. Installing equipment to manufacture 50 pits per year with a single shift could reduce costs and space compared to equipment for 80 pits per year. Space reduction is crucial for enabling pit production in PF-4 without the need for additional modules, potentially saving billions of dollars. Building capacity for 50 pits per year to reach 80 pits per year has disadvantages, including increased strain on equipment and difficulty in surging production beyond 80 pits if necessary. Increasing PF-4's capacity would require layout changes and compliance with regulations. Reorganizing space in PF-4 to increase capacity for pit production would be time-consuming and costly due to regulations and requirements. It would be more efficient and cost-effective to reorganize space for 50 pits per year rather than 80 pits per year. This option has the potential to increase production capacity faster and at a lower cost than new construction. Los Alamos National Laboratory is located on one side of Los Alamos Canyon, with the city of Los Alamos on the other side. The Royal Crest trailer park is the closest non-lab inhabited structures to PF-4, about 3,500 feet away. Structures on Trinity Drive in the city of Los Alamos are about 6,000 feet from PF-4. The Royal Crest trailer park is the closest non-lab inhabited structure to PF-4, located about 3,500 feet away. If Royal Crest were no longer the location of the maximally-exposed offsite individual (MEOI), the next closest inhabited structure would be 2,500 feet farther away. The quantity of radioactive particles decreases with distance from the source due to spreading out. The dispersion of radioactive materials from PF-4 in an accident would result in a reduction in dose to the maximally-exposed offsite individual (MEOI) at different locations. If the MEOI is at E. Jemez Road, dose would be reduced by 4%, and at the southern border of Los Alamos city, dose would be reduced by 40%. This reduction in dose could allow for an increase in Maximum Allowable Release (MAR) in PF-4. Relocating Royal Crest could potentially increase PF-4 MAR faster and at a lower cost than new construction. Using a different computer model and assumptions on plutonium dispersion could drastically reduce calculated dose, allowing for a significant increase in MAR at PF-4 with minimal cost. NNSA calculates dose to the maximally-exposed offsite individual (MEOI) using computer models and assumptions on plutonium. LANL uses computer models at PF-4 to calculate plutonium dispersion in the atmosphere. Changes in accident modeling, such as using a different atmospheric transport model and adjusting assumptions on door opening times during evacuations, result in lower doses of plutonium reaching the maximally-exposed offsite individual (MEOI). The new calculation at PF-4 reduces door opening times during evacuations based on historical data. Dispersion of plutonium is lower at night due to calmer winds, resulting in less risk to MEOI. Adjusting assumptions on time of day and material-at-risk reduces calculated dose significantly. The new calculation at PF-4 could significantly reduce the calculated dose to the MEOI, allowing for a higher MAR permitted in PF-4. Changing to a more realistic model and assumptions would be faster and less costly than building a new plutonium building. Congress must consider whether this change would increase public risk and if the benefits outweigh the added risk. Public perception is also a concern, as NNSA's motives could be questioned. This option has the potential to improve worker safety by reducing the risk of contamination. The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (DNFSB) monitors health and safety issues at DOE defense nuclear facilities, providing advice and recommendations. A report highlighted degraded conditions in PF-4 gloveboxes, posing contamination risks. LANL management lacks a plan to remove these gloveboxes, which could free up space and eliminate hazards. Removing the gloveboxes is crucial due to the high radioactivity of Pu-238. Removing the gloveboxes in PF-4 is important to reduce contamination risks and increase room availability for pit production. It would also free up space and decrease the risk of a contamination accident. While the cost of removal is a drawback, it is necessary for decontamination and decommissioning in the future. This option could significantly increase permitted MAR in PF-4. The analysis shows a way to increase permitted MAR in PF-4 without construction, by changing assumptions instead of building a new plutonium building. This tradeoff considers costs, benefits, and risks, posing a question for Congress on the value of marginal costs versus benefits for risk reduction. The MAR limit is uniquely imposed for each building to ensure safety. The Documented Safety Analysis limits Maximum Accident Release (MAR) to control radiation dose from disasters at DOE facilities. Dose is calculated using a ten-factor equation with variables like damage, plutonium release, and breathing rate. NNSA assigns conservative values to variables to keep dose below specified levels. In 2014, Kamiar Jamali from NNSA discussed the consequences of using worst-case values for multiple variables in safety analyses. Extreme conservatism in safety analyses can lead to significantly higher safety costs. Jamali discussed the consequences of extreme conservatism in safety analyses, which can lead to prohibitively expensive costs for nuclear facilities. The mean value is proposed as a metric consistent with reasonable conservatism in nuclear safety analysis, with increasing uncertainty moving the product of the equation towards the 95th percentile. Excessive conservatism exaggerates risks and creates unreasonable safety bounds. Excessive conservatism in safety analyses can skew a facility's safety envelope by exaggerating risks and creating unreasonable bounds. This can lead to costly preventive measures that offer little real safety improvement and may even be counterproductive. The assumptions used in calculating health effects from radiation doses can greatly impact projected outcomes. The probability of a catastrophic event occurring is much lower than the probability of the initiating event, such as an earthquake causing a building collapse followed by fire. The likelihood of a catastrophic event involving plutonium dispersion is extremely low, requiring a series of highly improbable events such as a building collapse, fire, plutonium spill, small oxide particles reaching the lungs, wind direction, and individual exposure. If an earthquake occurs once in 10,000 years, the concatenation of these events would occur even less frequently. The odds of multiple catastrophic events occurring simultaneously at PF-4 are very low. Safeguarding against worst-case scenarios comes with high costs for stringent safety measures and construction. Options include building multiple modules at $1 billion each or using median values for key variables in safety calculations. Using mean or median values for safety calculations at LANL is sufficient as they are very close together. Increasing the MAR ceiling in PF-4 could allow for production of 80 pits per year and benefit analytical chemistry. This change, along with other MAR reduction measures, may be enough to meet requirements without addressing space needs. Increasing the MAR ceiling in PF-4 could allow for production of 80 pits per year and benefit analytical chemistry. DOE's regulations limit \"radiological facilities\" like RLUOB to 38.6 g Pu-239 equivalent, but increasing the ceiling by a factor of 40 or less might permit RLUOB to support production needs. Table 2 shows the relationship between MAR and dose, with different assumptions affecting dose calculations. Equation 1, following DOE guidelines, shows a PF-4 MAR of 2,600 kilograms producing a dose of 166 rem in a worst-case accident. Equation 2 discusses the cumulative dose received over 50 years from plutonium oxide particles inhaled during an accident. The MAR ceiling in PF-4 could be increased to allow for production benefits. Increasing the ceiling by a factor of 40 or less might permit RLUOB to support production needs. Different assumptions affect dose calculations, with Equation 1 showing a PF-4 MAR of 2,600 kilograms producing a dose of 166 rem in a worst-case accident. Equation 2 discusses the cumulative dose received over 50 years from plutonium oxide particles inhaled during an accident. The divergence between calculated and actual effects of radioactive release was seen in the Fukushima Daiichi accident in March 2011. The authors found that exposure to radioactivity from the Fukushima Daiichi accident may result in cancer mortalities and morbidities worldwide, with higher risks in Japan. Workers at the plant may also face an increased risk of cancer. However, a report by the U.N. Scientific Committee in May 2013 stated that no radiation-related deaths or acute diseases have been observed among those exposed. Doses to the general public are generally low. Additive manufacturing (AM), also known as 3-D printing, is seen as transformative for manufacturing. It has the potential to reduce turnaround time and costs. The technology allows for the creation of complex objects that cannot be made using traditional methods. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory highlights the design capabilities of AM for metal parts. The technology's applications for pit production are being considered by Congress. Additive manufacturing (AM) is set to revolutionize the design and production of metal parts in the next decade or two. It will complement traditional methods, reduce time, cost, and energy consumption. Specific scientific and technical challenges need to be addressed for full implementation. Industry, like General Electric, is already using AM to produce high-precision parts with high reliability, such as fuel nozzles for jet engines, which reduces material usage and production costs. General Electric is utilizing additive manufacturing with laser-powered 3-D printers to create parts more efficiently and cost-effectively. This method reduces material waste, production costs, and yields significant fuel savings for airlines. The process involves melting metal alloy in desired areas to create complex shapes in 20-micrometer-thick layers. Siemens is using advanced manufacturing tools like additive manufacturing (AM) to produce complex components for gas turbines, cutting costs and time needed for replacement. AM technology allows for precise hole incorporation during production, reducing the need for expensive drilling afterwards. Siemens aims to reduce the delivery time for turbine blades from 44 weeks to possibly four weeks. Siemens is utilizing additive manufacturing (AM) to create complex components for gas turbines, aiming to reduce costs and production time. AM technology allows for precise hole incorporation during production, cutting the need for expensive drilling afterwards. This technology can save time, space, and money, reduce waste, and make parts on demand. While not suitable for all materials, AM is attracting more R&D funding due to its potential to transform manufacturing processes. The Appropriations Act for FY2015 allocated $12.6 million for additive manufacturing (AM) in the nuclear weapons program. NNSA was directed to provide a ten-year strategic plan for using AM to reduce costs at production facilities while meeting qualification requirements. NNSA is exploring AM applications in the nuclear weapons complex, with over half of new fixtures at the Kansas City National Security Campus made using AM processes. A classified report on this plan is expected to be transmitted to Congress in a few weeks. The new approach for producing tooling using additive manufacturing (AM) consolidates 5 parts into 1, eliminating 12 welds and reducing waste. NNSA sites estimate that 50 percent of its tools could be made using AM in five years, reducing production costs by 75 percent, development time by 80 percent, and production time by 60 percent. Additionally, AM allows for rapid prototyping and on-demand printing, reducing inventory and freeing up space. Iteration 4 of the tooling made using additive manufacturing (AM) features a plastic material with a different color, a metal piece made in a machine shop, and an additional indent as per customer's request. Sandia National Laboratories took two days to make each iteration at $77 apiece, compared to 42 days and $500 apiece from an outside machine shop. AM parts offer strength and weight advantages, with potential cost savings for tooling used in pit production. Additive manufacturing (AM) for tooling in pit manufacturing can offer time savings and increase throughput. Livermore suggests exploring tooling used in conjunction with pit production to reduce risk, cost, and waste. The electrorefining process for purifying plutonium involves breaking a ring of purified plutonium into pieces for melting down. This process faces challenges with crucibles made of magnesium oxide. The electrorefining process for purifying plutonium faces challenges with crucibles made of magnesium oxide, leading to problems such as failed runs, waste generation, and increased costs. The breaking operation of a plutonium ring in a glovebox produces metal chunks, shards, and grains that pose risks to technicians and require reprocessing through the chloride recovery line, adding steps and increasing costs. The United Kingdom's Atomic Weapons Establishment is developing a new crucible to address challenges in the electrorefining process for purifying plutonium. The crucible, made in one piece with ridges for depositing molten purified plutonium, eliminates the need for a separate glovebox and reduces waste and costs. Made using the \"slip casting\" process, the crucible aims to increase throughput and support a higher pit production rate. The new crucible made of magnesium oxide slurry is designed for electrorefining plutonium, eliminating the need for a separate glovebox. It is created using slip casting, with the potential to improve worker safety and reduce risks. However, its development is not complete, and operational experience is lacking, so a decision on its use awaits additional data. Plutonium in PF-4 can be \"at risk\" if exposed to an event like an earthquake followed by a fire, leading to plutonium release. To reduce this risk, placing plutonium in containers designed to withstand accidents is crucial. By ensuring only 10% of plutonium may escape from a container, the Material At Risk (MAR) is reduced by 90%. The damage ratio indicates the fraction of plutonium expected to escape, with a lower ratio indicating less risk. Containers must undergo rigorous testing to qualify for a specific damage ratio, which must be credited in PF-4's safety analysis to limit MAR. The SAVY-4000 containers have a damage ratio of 0.01, designed for long-term storage of plutonium in PF-4. Testing involves dropping them from a height, exposing them to extreme conditions, and measuring particulate release. Using qualified containers can reduce Material At Risk (MAR) in the facility. Containers designed for use on the pit production line in PF-4 need to be small, heavy, and easy to open. They must undergo various tests to ensure they meet damage ratio standards. Containers holding Pu-238, which is highly radioactive, have a significant impact on MAR fluctuations in PF-4. Pu-238 is mainly used in space probes for generating electricity through radioactive decay. The intense heat from Pu-238's radioactive decay is converted to electricity. Pu-238 is turned into a powder through ball milling in a robust container with a damage ratio of 0.01. Tests are needed to credit the container in the safety analysis. Plutonium casting is a major source of Material At Risk (MAR) in PF-4, and minimizing MAR from casting is crucial, especially in a ramp-up to 80 pits per year. Upgrading the containers for plutonium casting in a credited container is crucial to reduce the risk of a catastrophic accident. This would involve adding a tight and sturdy lid and conducting various tests to qualify the containers. The advantage of this passive approach is that it does not rely on electrical or plumbing systems to function. The passive approach for plutonium casting containers does not rely on electrical or plumbing systems, reducing the risk of a catastrophic accident. Pit production involves detailed plutonium characterization using analytical chemistry on metal samples from various stages, including purified metal and waste streams. Samples are dissolved in acid for analysis, with many containing small quantities of plutonium. The Rocky Flats Plant and LANL conducted plutonium analysis by taking metal samples per pit. LANL's plutonium analysis is mainly done in the CMR building, which is in poor condition and planned to be replaced by the RLUOB. However, it is uncertain if RLUOB has enough space and capacity to support the required analysis for pit production. Reducing the number of samples per pit or the amount of plutonium per sample could help reduce space and capacity requirements for analysis. Reducing the number of samples per pit or the amount of plutonium per sample for plutonium analysis could decrease equipment needs, space requirements, and waste generation. This would also increase the likelihood of RLUOB meeting analysis needs, reducing the burden on AC and waste processing. New equipment could provide confidence with smaller samples, reducing the need for larger sample sizes. LANL is developing techniques to reduce the quantity of plutonium per sample for certain analyses, which can increase throughput. Different techniques can be used for isotopic analysis, with some taking 7 to 10 days and others only 2 to 3 days. The concern about reducing sample size or accuracy is a decrease in precision, but this can be addressed in various ways. Not all pit production process steps require the highest level of precision. Plutonium in hemishells needs the greatest accuracy. Alternative methods or fewer samples could be used for initial supply of plutonium. Characterization of plutonium metal from salts may not need highest accuracy. Samples for waste processing do not need same level of accuracy as weapon certification. As pit production rate increases, fewer samples per pit can be taken. As pit production rate increases, fewer samples per pit would suffice to demonstrate proper operation. Technician experience level would increase with production rate, reducing rework and increasing sample analysis throughput. Plutonium must undergo purification steps to remove impurities before use in pits, including radioactive decay yielding uranium, americium, and neptunium. This option has the potential to reduce costs, waste, increase throughput, and create more space. The final step in purifying plutonium for weapons use is electrorefining, where an ingot of impure plutonium is placed in a crucible with a salt mixture electrolyte and an electric current is used to draw plutonium atoms to a cathode, forming metallic plutonium. The United States has used this process for decades, making it well-characterized. The purification process of plutonium involves drawing impurities from an ingot, resulting in a purified plutonium ring and two byproducts. The impurities are concentrated in the inner crucible, forming a \"heel,\" while the remaining plutonium is dissolved in hydrochloric acid to recover the plutonium. PF-4 utilizes two process lines involving hydrochloric and nitric acid to dissolve plutonium-bearing salts or oxide. The process of electrorefining plutonium involves dissolving plutonium-bearing salts or oxide in acid and recovering plutonium from the liquid. A study at Los Alamos from 1964 to 1977 showed that 9.2% of plutonium remains at the anode, 10.7% in the salt, and 78.8% purified in the product ring. There is a possibility of discarding the Pu-salt mixture or the heel to avoid the need for aqueous processes, although this would result in some plutonium loss. The U.S. has a surplus of plutonium, with 43.4 metric tons exceeding defense needs. Existing plutonium could supply needs for many decades by recycling pits and melting stored pits for purification. The need for plutonium has decreased since 1988 due to a smaller nuclear stockpile. The surplus of plutonium in the U.S. could be recycled for future use by reusing retired pits or sending Pu-salt mixture to storage repositories like WIPP. Plutonium-containing waste bound for WIPP must meet specific criteria before being shipped in drums. This process has been well-established and performed numerous times. Shipping plutonium directly to WIPP would avoid the need for aqueous processes, potentially reducing space and MAR needed. This option may increase pit production rates but would require more shipments to WIPP and work at that facility. Congress should consider tradeoffs and potential benefits of recovering nuclear material from waste streams to reduce costs, waste, and increase throughput. Electrorefining using sodium chloride and potassium chloride has challenges such as reduced yield of pure plutonium, increased time, space, equipment, cost, and worker exposure. Hydrochloric acid processing for plutonium recovery generates a significant waste stream that requires further treatment and monitoring for material control and accountability. Criticality concerns arise from plutonium concentration in waste, with aqueous processes historically involved in criticality accidents. Using calcium chloride as the electrolyte for plutonium-contaminated waste disposal offers advantages over sodium chloride and potassium chloride. This method, utilized by LLNL and AWE, results in higher plutonium yield due to different electrochemical behavior. This reduces the need for gloveboxes, freeing up space in PF-4 or allowing for increased pit production rates. The use of calcium chloride in electrolyte for plutonium-contaminated waste disposal allows for higher plutonium yield, reducing the need for gloveboxes and freeing up space in PF-4 for increased pit production rates. By utilizing a \"salt scrub\" method, most of the plutonium can be removed, leaving very little plutonium in the remaining salt waste. This process enables the equipment to produce more plutonium, supporting a higher rate of pit production. LANL plans to revisit the option of using calcium chloride in electrolyte for plutonium-contaminated waste disposal. If successful, they will convert to using calcium chloride instead of sodium chloride and potassium chloride when electrorefining in PF-4 resumes. This process would require a dry atmosphere in the gloveboxes, a facility for producing dry calcium chloride, and equipment for moving calcium chloride in dry conditions. LANL will draw on LLNL and AWE resources and experience for this effort. LANL plans to draw on LLNL and AWE resources and experience to reduce worker exposure to radiation, MAR, and cost in PF-4. Weapons-grade plutonium consists of mainly Pu-239 and other isotopes that decay over time, changing the composition of WGPu. Pu-241 decays rapidly into Am-241 and then into Np-237, while other isotopes decay into uranium isotopes. The composition of weapons-grade plutonium (WGPu) and its decay products change over time. Workers handling aged WGPu in gloveboxes are mainly exposed to gamma rays from americium-241. Purifying plutonium for weapons use involves chemical processes like electrorefining, which may be inefficient for purifying plutonium with a large fraction of impurities. The metal chlorination process removes most americium from impure plutonium, leaving uranium, neptunium, and other impurities. This process involves bubbling chlorine gas through molten plutonium to produce salts that can be easily removed. The recovered plutonium is then processed through electrorefining to purify it further. The United States produced or acquired 111.7 metric tons of plutonium, with an inventory of 95.4 MT and 14.0 MT removed. Uncertainties exist about the amount produced and discarded, leading to no official average age for plutonium in the DOE inventory. Based on preliminary calculations by Los Alamos, the average age of plutonium in the inventory is about 50 years. After passing aged plutonium through a final run of metal chlorination to remove Am-241, little Pu-241 would remain, making weapons with pits that old acceptable for use. This final run would reduce worker exposure to radiation and lower operating costs. The option to reduce cost and space by processing old pits at Los Alamos for purification holds potential. Pu-241 has the shortest half-life among plutonium isotopes in WGPu, with Pu-239 being the most abundant. Concerns include the impact of changing WGPu composition on implosion performance. Uranium ingrowth in WGPu continues for millennia, with U-235 accounting for 79% after 50 years. The U.S. stockpile includes old weapons like the B61 bomb from 1966 and the W76 warhead from 1978. The NNSA plans a B61 life extension program using existing pits, with the first production unit expected in FY2020. The W76 warhead is also undergoing a life extension program without using new pits. The W76 warhead, manufactured in 1978, is currently undergoing a life extension program that does not involve new pits. A 2007 report by the JASON group evaluated studies on pit lifetime and found that most primary types have credible minimum lifetimes exceeding 100 years. There is no evidence of plutonium aging mechanisms affecting primary performance on timescales of a century or less. This suggests that there may not be a need to purify plutonium for pits for decades, with potential benefits from delaying the process. Livermore notes a difference between. Livermore notes a difference between uranium in aged pits and in pits made from purified plutonium. The uranium present in existing pits is formed within the plutonium lattice and does not significantly affect the nuclear or mechanical properties. If plutonium is recovered from an existing weapon and recast, the uranium is likely to go to the plutonium grain boundaries, affecting mechanical properties. There is a tradeoff between purifying aged plutonium to remove Am-241 and delaying purification. Capacity and space could be reduced if weapon designers accept a larger maximum allowable uranium content in the WGPu specification. Acceptance would depend on detailed metallurgical studies. The current method to cast hemishells involves pouring molten plutonium between an inner and outer mold, solidifying it, separating the molds, and heat-treating the part. Machining the cast part produces plutonium chips that can be recycled through purification processes like metal chlorination and electrorefining. This option has the potential to reduce MAR, waste, and cost. Near net shape casting (NNSC) involves thinner molds for casting plutonium, reducing the amount needed and minimizing machining. However, this may lead to a higher reject rate, which can be offset by using electronic techniques for precise alignment and material removal, such as in-process inspection. With traditional casting, hemishells are measured after machining to ensure dimensional specifications are met. In-process inspection allows for realignment during production, reducing errors and excess material. NNSC would use less plutonium per hemishell, produce less scrap, and reduce demand on purification equipment, enabling higher production rates. Using less plutonium per pit would reduce waste, material control burden, worker exposure, MAR, and cost. LANL has conducted R&D into NNSC using gravity feed and plans to use this method in the future. It is included in LANL's planning basis for future pit manufacture. Livermore has been working on developing NNSC since 1994, demonstrating it through plutonium die casting to reduce the amount of plutonium needed per casting. Concerns have been raised about the seismic threat to PF-4, with newer studies suggesting a potential collapse in a major earthquake. Concerns have been raised about the seismic threat to PF-4, a facility built in the late 1970s, due to its brittleness and lack of ductility. DNFSB member Jack Mansfield highlighted the potential for collapse in a major earthquake, with the risk of great loss of life and dispersal of plutonium. Previous upgrades were deemed insufficient to address these vulnerabilities. LANL took steps to protect PF-4 against collapse and fire by reducing plutonium allowance, adding a drag strut to the roof, and strengthening the facility against seismic shaking. LANL strengthened PF-4 against collapse by wrapping columns in carbon fiber and reinforcing ties between girders to prevent potential disasters in the event of a collapse. LANL strengthened PF-4 against collapse by upgrading structural elements to reduce plutonium release in case of a major earthquake. The calculated radiation dose to the maximally exposed off-site individual was reduced from 2,100 rem to less than 25 rem TEDE through structural upgrades and repairs by April 2012. LANL also took steps to reduce the risk of fire by removing 20 tons of material. LANL has taken steps to reduce the risk of fire at PF-4 by removing combustible material and enhancing the fire water loop. Some buildings in TA-55 are not seismically qualified and LANL plans to provide them with their own separate fire water supply. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, P.L. 113-235 allocates $1,000,000 for TA-55 seismic safety mitigation in FY2015 to create more space in PF-4 and reduce public risk. Pu-238, 277 times more radioactive than Pu-239, is used in deep space probes for electricity generation due to its high radioactivity. PF-4 previously held 1.6 kg of Pu-238, accounting for 24.5% of the building's MAR. One approach to creating more space in PF-4 for pit fabrication is to build modules with lab space connected by tunnels. NNSA plans to construct modular structures by 2027 to accommodate Pu-238 programs, potentially freeing up space for pit production. Building one module may offer advantages such as providing experience and lessons to reduce costs for additional modules. A review of the Uranium Processing Facility recommended smaller \"new builds\" over a large building approach. Modules would have a basic design and be customized for specific missions, reducing costs compared to a large multi-mission building. Retrofitting subsequent modules after building one is more cost-effective than fixing problems in a big box building. The NNSA states that building a module offers advantages such as scalability and quicker adaptation to program requirements. The module would be buried to contain plutonium better in case of an earthquake, reducing risk to the public. However, there are concerns about potential increased costs if design flaws or size adjustments are needed for future modules. The report also discusses alternative measures to increase capacity without building modules. The NNSA is exploring options to increase capacity for manufacturing pits at a rate of 80 per year. Various techniques such as seismic strengthening, special containers for plutonium storage, and relocating the Royal Crest trailer park are being considered to optimize goals like margin, cost, and worker safety. Congress will need to evaluate and approve a package of options to address these challenges. Some techniques may provide more margin than relocating Royal Crest, potentially doubling the MAR allowance at PF-4 with no extra cost. Increasing space margin could involve removing contaminated gloveboxes, optimizing production lines, and building a module for Pu-238 work. The most cost-effective combination of techniques to increase MAR allowance needs to be determined. Building a Pu-238 module at Los Alamos or elsewhere could free up space in PF-4 and reduce the need for aqueous processes. Using calcium chloride and near net shape casting in electrorefining can also decrease the amount of plutonium to be recovered. The cost-effectiveness of recovering remaining plutonium in salt and impure ingots after electrorefining runs should be considered. The impure plutonium ingots from electrorefining runs could be packaged and shipped to WIPP. Techniques like removing contaminated gloveboxes can increase space and MAR margin with little to no cost. Using conservative assumptions in dose calculations could reduce the need for costly physical changes. Removing contaminated gloveboxes is cost-effective and avoids contamination accidents. Various options could boost U.S. pit production capacity towards the mandated 80 pits per year. The curr_chunk discusses key terms related to nuclear material safety, including Material At Risk (MAR), Airborne Release Fraction (ARF), Respirable Fraction (RF), and Damage Ratio (DR). MAR is the amount of material acted upon by an event, ARF is the fraction released into the air, RF is the fraction that remains in the lungs when inhaled, and DR measures damage to a structure. These terms are crucial for assessing the impact of events involving plutonium. The curr_chunk discusses key terms related to nuclear material safety, including Leak Path Factor (LPF), Chi/Q, Breathing Rate (BR), and Specific Activity (SA). LPF is the fraction of material that escapes a building, Chi/Q is the rate at which plutonium particles are deposited, BR is the volume of air breathed in, and SA measures the radioactivity of a substance. These terms are important for assessing the impact of events involving plutonium. The higher the dose, the greater the Specific Activity (SA) of a material, measured in curies per gram. Dose Conversion Factor (DCF) converts SA to dose in rem, a unit for radiation absorbed by human tissue."
