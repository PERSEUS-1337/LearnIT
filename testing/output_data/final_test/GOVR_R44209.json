    "content": "Genetic engineering involves introducing new traits to an organism, creating tolerance to herbicides, resistance to viruses, increasing yields, and altering acidic content. Genetically engineered foods (GE foods), also known as genetically modified foods (GMO foods), are derived from these methods. Common GE plants include corn, canola, soybean, and cotton, used in various food products. The FDA and World Health Organization have found GE foods to be nutritious and safe. The World Health Organization states that genetically engineered (GE) foods currently on the market are safe for human consumption. Despite public opposition, federal law does not require specific labeling for GE foods, as they follow the same guidelines as non-GE foods under the Federal Food, Drug, & Cosmetic Act. The FDA believes that additional labeling for GE foods is unnecessary, as existing regulations protect consumers. For more information on federal labeling of GE foods, refer to CRS Report R43705. Several states have passed laws imposing specific labeling requirements on genetically engineered (GE) food, including Vermont, Connecticut, and Maine. Vermont's GE labeling act will take effect on July 1, 2016. Connecticut and Maine statutes state that the labeling requirements will only be enforced if a requisite number of states pass similar legislation. Connecticut's Act Concerning the Labeling of Genetically-Engineered Food was enacted in 2013. Maine's Act requires labeling of genetically engineered (GE) food as \"Produced with Genetic Engineering\" for retail sale, with sanctions for non-compliance. Vermont also mandates labeling of GE food for retail sale, exempting certain products and prohibiting private enforcement. Vermont's labeling laws require food produced with genetic engineering to be labeled as such for retail sale, with specific phrases to be used. The state attorney general has the authority to enforce these provisions to promote public health and food safety by informing consumers about potential health risks. Certain products are exempt from these labeling requirements, and private enforcement is prohibited. The statute in Vermont aims to reduce consumer confusion by prohibiting labeling of genetically engineered products as 'natural' and promoting factual information on food labels. It also aims to protect religious practices by providing data for informed decisions. Legal challenges were filed claiming violations of the First Amendment, Commerce Clause, and Supremacy Clause. The plaintiffs sought relief through a preliminary injunction to stop Act 120 from taking effect, while Vermont filed a motion to dismiss the case. The district court ruled against the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction in April 2015. In GMA v. Sorrell, the court found that plaintiffs had a strong case against Act 120's restrictions on labels and GE disclosure requirements. However, they failed to show irreparable harm without an injunction due to lack of evidence of using \"natural\" labels. The court also noted that exemptions in Act 120 reduced the harm for preemption claims. The district court dismissed the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction regarding Act 120's labeling requirements. The plaintiffs have appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, arguing that Act 120 violates their First Amendment right. The district court granted in part and denied in part the defendant's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. The district court dismissed most of the plaintiffs' claims regarding Act 120's validity under the Commerce and Supremacy Clauses, stating they did not state a sufficient claim for relief. However, the court allowed the plaintiffs' First Amendment claims to proceed to trial, specifically focusing on the prohibition of the term \"natural\" in GE labeling. The court's evaluation of the plaintiffs' First Amendment, Supremacy Clause, and dormant Commerce Clause claims in the context of state GE labeling laws is analyzed in GMA v. Sorrell. The constitutional implications of state GE labeling laws, including Vermont's Act 120, are discussed in relation to freedom of speech under the First Amendment. Different types of speech receive varying levels of protection under the First Amendment. When evaluating First Amendment claims, courts use a hierarchy of standards to balance the government's interest with freedom of speech. Different types of speech receive varying levels of protection under the First Amendment, with strict scrutiny being the most severe and rational basis review being the least. In the complaint against the State of Vermont, the Grocery Manufacturers Association and other plaintiffs challenged Act 120. The State of Vermont and plaintiffs argued that Act 120's mandatory GE labeling requirements violate the First Amendment by restricting truthful speech on labels. They also claimed that the act compels manufacturers to convey an opinion they disagree with, thus violating the First Amendment. The plaintiffs argued for strict scrutiny, while the defendants argued for a lower standard. Act 120's provisions on \"natural\" prohibition and mandatory GE labeling involve commercial and compelled speech. Courts differ on the level of scrutiny for First Amendment protection. Commercial speech balances information availability with consumer interest. Courts apply intermediate scrutiny to laws restricting commercial speech, following a four-step analysis from Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission of New York. Factors considered include whether the speech is protected by the First Amendment, the government's substantial interest, direct advancement of that interest, and the necessity of the restriction. The state law should directly advance the state interest involved. The Supreme Court explained that state laws should directly advance the state interest involved and cannot regulate speech that poses no danger to that interest. In Sorrell v. IMS Health, the Court applied heightened judicial scrutiny to a Vermont statute restricting the sale of pharmacy records revealing prescribing practices of doctors, deeming it a violation of the First Amendment. The Supreme Court applied heightened judicial scrutiny to a Vermont statute targeting prescriber-identifying information and pharmaceutical marketers, citing viewpoint discrimination and favoritism of state message. The Court emphasized the importance of protecting commercial speech for consumer information in the field of public health. In GMA v. Sorrell, plaintiffs challenged Vermont's Act 120 for restricting the use of \"natural\" on GE food labels, claiming it violated the First Amendment. Vermont argued the ban was necessary to protect consumers from deceptive language, but the court sided with the plaintiffs, allowing their claim to proceed. The court sided with the plaintiffs in GMA v. Sorrell, allowing their claim against Vermont's Act 120, which restricts the use of \"natural\" on GE food labels, to proceed. The court found that the state failed to provide sufficient evidence of deception to support an outright ban on commercial speech, concluding that potentially misleading speech may be protected by the First Amendment. The court ruled against Vermont's Act 120, stating that the ban on using \"natural\" terminology in GE food labeling lacks substantial state interest and may be too broad or narrow without a clear definition. The court found that the prohibition does not directly advance a state interest and is more extensive than necessary. The court ruled against Vermont's Act 120, stating that the ban on using \"natural\" terminology in GE food labeling lacks substantial state interest and may be too broad or narrow without a clear definition. The court concluded that the plaintiffs have a plausible claim that the natural restriction is invalid under the First Amendment, allowing their First Amendment claim to proceed to trial. The court focused on the large scope of the ban and the absence of a state interest in banning potentially misleading words. The court ruled against Vermont's Act 120, stating that the ban on using \"natural\" terminology in GE food labeling lacks substantial state interest and may be too broad or narrow without a clear definition. The plaintiffs may challenge similar bans on labeling as a First Amendment violation, citing the right to speak freely and the right to refrain from speaking. The Supreme Court has generally invalidated government attempts to compel speech, as seen in the Wooley v. Maynard case. The Supreme Court ruled against Vermont's Act 120, finding that the state's aims could have been more narrowly achieved and that the ban on using \"natural\" terminology in GE food labeling lacked substantial state interest. The Court also noted that compelled speech in the commercial context is subject to a lower standard, as seen in the Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel case. The Supreme Court ruled against Vermont's Act 120, stating that the state's requirement for contingent-fee advertisements to disclose client liability for costs is reasonably related to protecting consumers from deception. Compelled speech in commercial contexts is subject to lower scrutiny, as seen in the Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel case. The court focused on determining the level of scrutiny to apply in evaluating the plaintiffs' claim that Act 120's GE disclosure requirements violate the First Amendment. The court rejected the argument for strict scrutiny, stating that Act 120's association with the GE food labeling debate does not transform the disclosure into political speech. The requirement was not considered viewpoint discrimination as it mandates the disclosure of facts. The court rejected strict scrutiny for Act 120's GE disclosure requirement, stating it mandates factual disclosure, not preferred messages. It also dismissed intermediate scrutiny, deeming the requirement as factual commercial speech with insubstantial state interest. The plaintiffs argued it's not commercial due to food safety debate, but the court disagreed. The court focused on the labeling requirements as factual disclosure related to food purchase and sale, stating it is not controversial. It ruled that Act 120's GE disclosure requirement does not gratify consumer curiosity and cannot withstand First Amendment scrutiny based on Second Circuit precedent. The court found Vermont's requirement to disclose the use of synthetic bovine hormone in milk production unconstitutional under the First Amendment. Consumer curiosity was not considered a strong enough state interest, and the court questioned the reasonable relationship test for the disclosure requirement. The Supreme Court in Zauderer held that First Amendment rights are protected as long as disclosure requirements are reasonably related to the state's interest in preventing consumer deception. The district court analyzed the reasonable relationship test in the context of government interest. It concluded that although Zauderer may apply, the requirement does not have to address all facets of the issue to be reasonable. The court also determined that the application of intermediate scrutiny is debatable as a question of law. The court held that plaintiffs' First Amendment claims regarding Act 120's disclosure requirements survived the motion to dismiss, allowing the claims to proceed to trial. The plaintiffs allege that Act 120 is preempted by federal laws, as federal laws take precedence over conflicting state laws. The court's primary inquiry for preemption claims is to determine Congress's intent through the text, structure, or purpose of the statute. There are three types of preemption: express, conflict, and field, with a presumption that state police powers are not to be superseded by federal law unless Congress clearly intended it. Food and beverage labeling, typically regulated by states, falls within this realm. The district court in GMA v. Sorrell analyzed three types of preemption: express, conflict, and field. The plaintiffs argue that the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act (NLEA) preempts Act 120's labeling requirements. NLEA contains five express preemption clauses to ensure uniform national standards for food labeling. The district court analyzed the plaintiffs' argument that the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act (NLEA) preempts Act 120's labeling requirements by requiring uniform national standards for food labeling. The plaintiffs must show that Act 120's labeling requirements are different from the FFDCA and that a specific FFDCA requirement has preemptive effect. The plaintiffs claim Act 120's GE labeling requirements are not identical to the FFDCA's mandatory labeling requirements. The plaintiffs argued that Act 120's GE labeling requirements are not identical to the FFDCA's mandatory labeling requirements. The district court disagreed, stating that NLEA does not preempt any state law unless expressly preempted. The court held that NLEA does not preempt state law unless expressly preempted. Despite disagreement over the scope of \"not identical to,\" the plaintiffs failed to show Act 120's labeling requirements are sufficiently different from FFDCA requirements to trigger preemption. The court dismissed the express preemption claim, emphasizing the lack of federal prohibition on Act 120's GE disclosure requirement. Conflict preemption occurs when it is impossible for a private party to comply with both state and federal requirements or when state law obstructs the objectives of Congress. The Supreme Court provided an example in Florida Lime & Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, highlighting conflicting avocado oil content regulations. Courts assess whether state laws impede Congress's objectives for conflict preemption. It is emphasized that a high threshold must be met for state laws to be preempted, as it is Congress's responsibility, not the courts', to preempt state law. The Supreme Court emphasized that a high threshold must be met for state laws to be preempted, as it is Congress's responsibility, not the courts', to preempt state law. In a complaint against Vermont, plaintiffs argued that Act 120 conflicts with the purpose of FFDCA and NLEA to promote national uniformity in food labeling. They claimed that a uniform national labeling scheme is necessary for efficient marketing. However, the court disagreed with the plaintiffs' arguments, stating that economic reasons alone are not enough to justify preemption in an area traditionally overseen by states. The court emphasized a presumption against preemption in areas traditionally overseen by states, stating that Act 120's labeling requirements can coexist with federal regulations. Conflict preemption claims were dismissed for failure to state a plausible claim, as congressional intent to supersede state laws must be clear for field preemption to occur. When considering field preemption, courts look for clear and manifest congressional intent to supersede state laws. The volume and complexity of agency regulations can indicate implicit intent to displace all state law in a specific area. Absence of congressional action in a known state law field can also be significant in preemption cases. For example, in Chacanaca v. Quaker Oats Co., the absence of an FDA policy on the term \"wholesome\" was crucial in determining that the NLEA did not preempt state law claims related to misleading food labeling. Courts tend to rely on the presumption against preemption when considering field preemption in the context of food labeling. In Holk v. Snapple Beverage Corp., the court did not find field preemption, stating that federal law did not preempt state consumer protection claims against Snapple's use of \"All Natural\" on its labels. The Third Circuit emphasized that Congress has not regulated comprehensively in the food and beverage or juice fields, indicating no clear intent to occupy the field of food labeling. The court pointed out that the NLEA prohibits implied preemption and includes a savings clause preserving state laws unless expressly preempted under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The plaintiffs could not reasonably allege field preemption against Vermont, as outlined in Holk v. Snapple Beverage Corp. The court in Holk v. Snapple Beverage Corp. explained that Congress has not regulated food and beverage labeling comprehensively, allowing a role for states. Field preemption claim in this context would not succeed due to the absence of congressional intent to supplant state law. The Commerce Clause allows Congress to regulate commerce, and the dormant Commerce Clause implies limits on state actions. The Supreme Court has long held that the Commerce Clause prohibits states from unduly burdening interstate commerce. If a state law directly regulates or discriminates against interstate commerce, it is unconstitutional. In Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., the Court ruled that if a statute has only indirect effects on interstate commerce and regulates evenhandedly, the state's interest must be legitimate and the burden on interstate commerce must clearly exceed the local benefits. The plaintiffs alleged that Act 120 violates the Commerce Clause, specifically the dormant Commerce Clause. The plaintiffs alleged that Act 120 violates the Commerce Clause, specifically the dormant Commerce Clause, by imposing labeling requirements that burden out-of-state companies. They argued that these costs discriminate against interstate commerce, favoring Vermont interests. The district court dismissed the Commerce Clause claims for failing to state a plausible claim. The district court dismissed the Commerce Clause claims made by the plaintiff, stating that Act 120 did not discriminate against out-of-state products either on its face or in its effect. The court found no evidence to support the claim that Vermont enacted Act 120 to favor in-state products over those from other states. The court dismissed the plaintiffs' Commerce Clause claims regarding the disproportionate costs and burden on out-of-state companies, citing a lack of discriminatory effects. In a similar case, the Second Circuit ruled that a state's regulation of Internet activities can violate the dormant Commerce Clause by projecting its legislation into other states. The district court dismissed the plaintiffs' Commerce Clause claim in relation to Act 120, stating that it did not impose a burden on interstate commerce that is different from intrastate commerce. The court referenced a previous case where a state's regulation of Internet activities was found to violate the dormant Commerce Clause by projecting its legislation into other states. The court dismissed the majority of the plaintiffs' dormant Commerce Clause claims, except for the charge against Act 120's \"natural\" prohibition on signage and advertising. The court emphasized that potential changes to product labeling to comply with Vermont law are not discriminatory. It also noted that the lack of uniformity in state GE labeling laws does not create a patchwork of requirements. However, conflicting state GE laws may strengthen a claim of discrimination. The Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act of 2015 (SAFLA) would impact state legislation regulating the labeling of GE foods, including Vermont's Act 120. SAFLA would establish certification programs and labeling requirements overseen by the FDA and USDA. It directs the FDA to continue premarket consultation for food from new plant varieties, including GE plants, and may require labeling to inform consumers of any material differences between GE and non-GE foods. SAFLA would amend the Plant Protection Act to create a notification program for introducing GE plants for food use. It would establish a voluntary GE food certification program within the USDA for labeling claims. Additionally, it would deem a food misbranded if its labeling contains an express or implied claim. SAFLA would amend the Plant Protection Act to create a notification program for introducing GE plants for food use. It would establish a voluntary GE food certification program within the USDA for labeling claims. FFDCA deems a food misbranded if its labeling contains an express or implied claim that such food is \"natural,\" unless defined by FDA regulations. SAFLA also includes preemption provisions that could impact state regulation of GE food labeling, including Vermont's Act 120. Section 113 of SAFLA prohibits placing GE plants in interstate commerce without approval from the Department of Health and Human Services. It may restrict states from imposing additional safety requirements on GE foods reviewed under Section 111 but allows for parallel laws to federal standards. States can create additional remedies to enforce federal GE safety standards. SAFLA's Section 203 preemption provision prevents states from establishing conflicting requirements for covered products in interstate commerce. Section 203 of SAFLA preempts states from imposing labeling requirements on GE plants in interstate commerce, except for voluntary programs following federal standards. States have limited discretion in setting standards for GE food labels, preventing them from implying the use of genetic engineering. The SAFLA's Section 303 includes a preemption clause that would prevent states from establishing labeling requirements for food in interstate commerce that are not identical to federal standards. This clause aims to ensure consistency in food labeling regulations across states. The SAFLA's Section 303 preemption clause prohibits states from passing labeling laws that are not \"identical\" to federal standards. This provision allows states to enforce federal standards with \"different or additional remedies,\" addressing issues like the use of the word \"natural\" on food labels."
