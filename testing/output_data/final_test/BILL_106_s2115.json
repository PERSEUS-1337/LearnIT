    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"China-World Trade Organization Compliance Act\". Congress finds that the United States Trade Representative completed a bilateral agreement with China for its accession to the World Trade Organization. To receive the benefits of this agreement, Congress must grant China permanent normal trade relations status. China, a centrally planned economy since 1949, has made progress in opening up its economy since 1978. Granting permanent normal trade relations to China would help solidify economic reforms and support Chinese leaders committed to reform. Despite progress, China remains a nonmarket economy and has yet to meet international standards of transparency and legal accountability. Adherence to bilateral and multilateral commitments is crucial for the credibility of the World Trade Organization and the global trading system. The United States needs new mechanisms to monitor and enforce China's commitments at the World Trade Organization due to the inadequacy of current trade monitoring and enforcement mechanisms. The Chinese economic structure and decentralized nature of government pose challenges to ensuring compliance with trade agreements. The decentralized nature of Chinese Government economic management and new commitments under the World Trade Organization require a comprehensive multiagency effort to monitor China's compliance. Various Federal agencies should be assigned different aspects of monitoring China's commitments.

The President must submit a detailed plan to Congress within 90 days of China joining the World Trade Organization, outlining how to monitor China's compliance with its commitments. The plan should assign specific tasks to Federal agencies and include a mechanism for public participation in evaluating China's compliance. Additionally, an estimate of the costs for monitoring activities must be provided to Congress. The President must submit an annual updated plan to Congress, including the cost estimate for monitoring activities. The Comptroller General of the United States will survey 50 US companies doing business with China to assess compliance with WTO commitments. The Comptroller General will survey US companies engaged in trade with China to evaluate WTO compliance. A report on the survey results will be submitted to Congress. The International Trade Commission will also provide annual reports on US-China bilateral trade statistics, aiming to reconcile any discrepancies in data sources. The United States Trade Representative will submit an annual report to Congress on China's compliance with WTO commitments. The report will include monitoring results and conclusions from relevant Federal agencies. Public participation will be sought through notice publication and public hearings. The Committee on Finance and the Committee on Ways and Means can instruct the United States Trade Representative to take action under the Trade Act of 1974 if the rights of the United States under any trade agreement are being denied. The Committees can instruct the US Trade Representative to take action if China's actions violate trade agreements or harm US commerce. This includes initiating action before the Dispute Settlement Body. The US Trade Representative can take adverse action against a foreign country if they fail to cooperate in an investigation. This includes making affirmative determinations regarding trade agreements, such as with the People's Republic of China. The US Trade Representative can initiate action before the Dispute Settlement Body of the World Trade Organization if a foreign country fails to cooperate in an investigation. Before taking action, consultation with Congress is required. SEC. 6. SPECIAL WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION REVIEW OF CHINA. The sense of Congress is for a special multilateral process at the World Trade Organization to review China's compliance annually. The USTR is directed to propose an expanded review of China's trade policies within the Trade Policy Review Mechanism, including onsite visits and active participation by WTO members. SEC. 7. INSTITUTION-BUILDING IN CHINA. The President must submit a plan to Congress within 90 days of China joining the World Trade Organization to assist China in meeting its WTO obligations. The plan should detail personnel and budget requirements for providing assistance through bilateral and multilateral mechanisms, including cost-sharing with U.S. businesses. China's compliance with WTO obligations will be supported through cost-sharing with the private sector. Appropriations of up to $5,000,000 annually or one-tenth of one percent of goods and services exported to China will be authorized. Authorization of appropriations is granted to carry out the provisions of the Act, excluding section 7."
