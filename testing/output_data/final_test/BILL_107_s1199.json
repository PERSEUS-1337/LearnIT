    "content": "The purpose of this section is to prevent the abandonment of marginal oil and gas wells responsible for half of the domestic production of oil and gas in the United States by providing a tax credit for producing oil and gas from these wells. The marginal well production credit under section 38 allows for a credit amount of $3 per barrel of qualified crude oil production and 50 cents per 1,000 cubic feet of qualified natural gas production, reducing as oil and gas prices increase. The inflation-adjusted dollar amounts for the marginal well production credit are determined based on the reference price for the preceding calendar year, with adjustments made for inflation starting from 2002. The reference price for qualified crude oil and natural gas production is determined based on the inflation-adjusted dollar amount multiplied by the inflation adjustment factor for the calendar year, with specific criteria for each type of production. Qualified crude oil and natural gas production refers to domestic production from marginal wells, with a limit of 1,095 barrels per year per well to qualify. Definitions for marginal well are provided, stating that it refers to domestic wells with production limitations based on the number of days in a taxable year. A domestic well with limited production is considered a marginal well if it meets specific criteria, including average daily production not exceeding 25 barrel equivalents and producing water at a rate of at least 95 percent of total well effluent. The term 'barrel equivalent' for natural gas is defined as 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas to 1 barrel of crude oil. For marginal wells with multiple owners, the taxpayer's revenue interest determines the qualifying production. The production credit is based on the revenue interests of operating interest owners. It applies only to production from operating interests and excludes production from nonconventional sources. The credit is treated as a business credit under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The production credit is based on revenue interests of operating interest owners and applies only to production from operating interests. A new paragraph has been added regarding the marginal oil and gas well production credit under section 45G(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Special rules for this credit are outlined in subsection (c) of section 38, including separate application of sections 38 and 39 for the credit. The marginal oil and gas well production credit is defined as a credit allowed under subsection (a) for the taxable year, excluding the marginal oil and gas well production credit. The marginal oil and gas well production credit, defined as a credit under subsection (a) by section 45G(a), is subject to a 10-year carryback provision according to a new paragraph in section 39 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The business credit, excluding the marginal oil and gas well production credit, is subject to changes in the number of taxable years for application. Section 29(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to allow taxpayers to elect certain provisions. (g) Clerical Amendment - The table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended. The amendments made by this section apply to production in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2001. Additionally, there is an election to expense geological and geophysical expenditures and delay rental payments. The purpose of this section is to allow taxpayers to deduct geological and geophysical expenditures for domestic oil and gas wells as ordinary business expenses in the year they are incurred. Taxpayers can elect to expense these costs instead of capitalizing them. The amendments allow taxpayers to deduct expenses for domestic oil and gas wells in the year they are incurred, with a transition rule for expenses paid or incurred before the enactment date. The amendments allow taxpayers to deduct expenses for domestic oil and gas wells in the year they are incurred, with a transition rule for expenses paid or incurred before the enactment date. Taxpayers may elect to expense delay rental payments for domestic oil and gas wells. Taxpayers can elect to treat delay rental payments for developing oil or gas in the US as deductible expenses in the year they are paid or incurred. This applies to payments made for deferring drilling under an oil or gas lease. The amendments also include a conforming amendment to the tax code and are effective for payments made or incurred. The taxpayer may elect to amortize the suspended portion of expenses over a 36-month period for expenses described in section 263(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The taxpayer can elect to amortize the suspended expenses over a 36-month period if they have not been included in the cost of a property or deducted."
