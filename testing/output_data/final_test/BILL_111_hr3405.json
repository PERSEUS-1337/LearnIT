Beginning in 2009, the Secretary shall mint and issue these coins for sale.

The coins must replicate the original designs by Augustus Saint-Gaudens on the 1907 Double Eagle ultra-high relief gold piece, with raised lettering on the edge.

If the Secretary chooses to mint and issue a gold bullion coin with the same design as the ultra-high relief numismatic coins, each palladium coin may only be issued in a set containing one of each coin.

They will be legal tender and considered numismatic items. The Secretary may issue coins in proof and uncirculated versions, and consider protective covers to preserve the coins and prevent counterfeiting. The Comptroller General, in consultation with relevant agencies and committees, must submit a report to the Committee on Financial Services to prevent counterfeiting of coins, including collectible and rare coins. The Comptroller General must submit a report to the Committee on Financial Services and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs detailing the extent of counterfeiting of rare, collectible, or numismatic coins in the United States, regardless of their origin or where the counterfeiting occurs. The report submitted shall describe the extent, source, distribution, and effects of counterfeiting of coins and numismatic items within and outside the United States. The report will detail counterfeiting of coins and numismatic items by the US Mint, including potential counterfeiting of coin-grading materials. Recommendations for legislative action may be included to address counterfeiting issues."
