    "content": "The Act titled \"Encourage Initiative and Promote Self-Esteem Act of 2008\" amends Section 222 of the Social Security Act to include special rules for benefits based on waxing and waning medical conditions. For qualifying disabled individuals, special rules apply to the termination month and extent of benefits under sections 223 and 202 of the Social Security Act. Monthly insurance benefits during the special entitlement period are capped at the maximum benefit payment determined under paragraph (4). The special rules for qualifying disabled individuals limit monthly insurance benefits to the maximum amount determined under paragraph (4). The Commissioner will not review the individual's disability if they earn over $350 in a month. A qualifying disabled individual is someone entitled to disability insurance benefits and whose disability is based on a waxing and waning medical condition. The special entitlement period for qualifying disabled individuals begins when they become entitled to benefits and ends when the Commissioner determines their impairment is no longer disabling. Benefits are reduced by 2/3 of excess trial earnings after the 7th month of entitlement. The term 'waxing and waning medical condition' refers to a medical condition that alternates between periods of being able to work and periods of being unable to work due to a lack of assistive technology. Excess trial earnings are the amount earned by an individual that exceeds a certain threshold. The term 'trial earnings threshold' is the average amount earned by an individual from services performed each month during a test period, compared to the trial earnings threshold for that month. The test period is the first 3 calendar months of the 6 calendar months preceding the month in question. The trial earnings threshold is the greater of $670 or a calculated amount. The trial earnings threshold is calculated by multiplying the specified dollar amount by the ratio of the national average wage index for the first of the 2 preceding calendar years to the index for calendar year 2006. The product is rounded to the nearest multiple of $10. The Secretary determines and publishes the trial earnings threshold for each month in November of the preceding year. Amendments are made to the Social Security Act regarding the termination month. Amendments are made to the Social Security Act regarding the termination month for qualifying disabled individuals. Amendments to the Social Security Act specify the termination month for qualifying disabled individuals. Amendments to the Social Security Act extend periods of eligibility for disability insurance benefits, child's insurance benefits, and wife's or husband's insurance benefits for individuals with ongoing trial work periods. Amendment to Title XVI of the Social Security Act includes special rules for disability benefits based on waxing and waning medical conditions. Special rules for disability benefits for qualifying disabled individuals include determining benefit payments without considering ability to work, limiting monthly benefit amounts, and avoiding disability reviews if the individual earns over a certain amount from services. The special rules for disability benefits for qualifying disabled individuals include determining benefit payments based on a waxing and waning medical condition, with a special entitlement period beginning when entitled to benefits and ending when the impairment ceases or is no longer disabling. The benefit for a qualifying disabled individual under this title is limited to the amount otherwise payable, reduced by 2/3 of excess trial earnings. A waxing and waning medical condition is defined as a certified condition that may reasonably affect the individual's disability eligibility. The term 'excess trial earnings' refers to the amount deducted from a disabled individual's benefit, while 'waxing and waning medical condition' is a certified condition affecting disability eligibility. The amendment made by subsection (a) applies to benefits payable after the enactment of this Act."
