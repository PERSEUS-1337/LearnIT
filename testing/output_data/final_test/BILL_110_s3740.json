This includes converter boxes, antennas, and other necessary equipment for basic broadcast television service. Eligibility is open to any household or individual. Eligibility for the coupon program includes households or individuals who were eligible for a digital-to-analog converter box coupon under the previous program. The Assistant Secretary will establish minimum standards for eligible companies within 30 days. The coupon program eligibility criteria must be established within 30 days of the Act's enactment. No household or individual can participate if they were receiving purchased broadcast television from a multichannel video programming distributor before the Act or if they purchase television broadcasts (excluding basic broadcast TV) from a distributor after the Act. The coupon program allows households or individuals to request coupons with a value determined by the Assistant Secretary, not exceeding $80 each. Coupons expire 90 days after program termination. The program established under this section will terminate 18 months after the first coupon is issued. The Assistant Secretary will develop an Internet website and a toll-free hotline to assist consumers with digital television reception issues after the transition to digital television on February 17, 2009.

The Commission must create rules for multichannel video distributors to provide basic broadcast television service to eligible consumers in local markets, with immunity from certain prohibitions and civil liability. The distributor is immune from civil liability for fulfilling requirements under paragraph (1). The Commission requires television broadcast stations to grant consent for retransmission and waive fees for fulfilling these requirements.

An eligible consumer is defined as someone whose primary residence is in a market where a TV station has reported signal loss due to the digital TV transition. The rule states that if an eligible consumer purchases additional channel service from a multichannel video programming distributor after buying basic broadcast television service, they can no longer purchase the basic service. The cost of basic broadcast television service should not exceed $10 per month and may be adjusted annually based on the Consumer Price Index. The rule prohibits excessive fees for basic broadcast service and installation costs. The Commission must report to Congress on the number of eligible consumers and any issues they face. The Commission must report to Congress on the problems faced by eligible consumers and distributors in adhering to the requirements of the rule, along with any other relevant information. The report will be made publicly available on the Commission's website, and this section can only be terminated by an Act of Congress. The Commission is required to conduct an outreach campaign to address the challenges faced by eligible consumers and distributors in complying with the rule. The Commission, in consultation with various agencies and organizations, will conduct an education and outreach campaign to inform consumers about the programs and requirements of the Act. The campaign will involve dissemination of information through various media channels. The Act requires agencies to maintain program information on their websites and educate consumers, especially those in vulnerable populations, about the transition from analog to digital television. The Act mandates agencies to provide program information on their websites and educate consumers, particularly those in vulnerable populations, about the upcoming transition to digital television on February 17, 2009. The Commission may allocate funds to various organizations for an education and outreach campaign, while Federal agencies must ensure the operation of a single website for public access to information related to the Act and its programs. SEC. 6. FUNDING. Authorization of $75,000,000 for fiscal years 2009 and 2010. Any remaining funds in the Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Fund will be used for this Act after the digital-to-analog converter box program expires."
