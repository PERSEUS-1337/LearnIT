Section 319(b) of the Clean Air Act is amended to clarify the process for submitting an exceptional event demonstration to the Administrator. The Clean Air Act is amended to clarify the process for submitting an exceptional event demonstration to the Administrator, including specific criteria for evidence, analyses, and documentation to minimize discretion in approval or disapproval. The Administrator will develop these criteria in conjunction with input from the States. The criteria for exceptional event demonstrations under the Clean Air Act will consider technical expertise, resources, and data availability in State and local agencies. The Administrator will also explore expedited approval processes and conditions for suitable exceptional event demonstrations. The Administrator must approve, disapprove, or request additional information for an exceptional event demonstration within 90 days of submission by a State. The Administrator must approve, disapprove, or request additional information for an exceptional event demonstration within 90 days of submission by a State. If additional information is requested, the Administrator must make a decision within 90 days of receiving that information. The regulations require the Administrator to approve or disapprove an exceptional event demonstration within 90 days. If no decision is made within this timeframe, the demonstration is considered approved. The burden of proof for approval or disapproval is based on a preponderance of the evidence. The Administrator must approve or disapprove an exceptional event demonstration within 90 days based on a preponderance of the evidence. Substantial deference is given to State findings, and the EPA can use additional analyses if developed by them. Appeals for disapproval are subject to specific conditions. The Administrator's disapproval of an exceptional event demonstration is final and can be judicially reviewed. However, only the State that submitted the demonstration can appeal the disapproval. Approval of such demonstrations rests with the Administrator. The Administrator's decision on an exceptional event demonstration is final and cannot be appealed or subject to judicial action. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency must revise regulations under the Clean Air Act within 180 days of this Act's enactment."
