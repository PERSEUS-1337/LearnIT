    "content": "The Act titled \"Environmental Priorities Act of 1998\" allows for the recapture of savings from retail electricity competition. The Act titled \"Environmental Priorities Act of 1998\" requires all State regulated and nonregulated electric utilities to establish retail electric service choice for customers before January 1, 2001. Each provider of retail electric services in a State must contribute to the fiscal agent for the Environmental Priorities Act of 1998. The State contributes 10 percent of total consumer savings to the Environmental Priorities Board. Consumer savings is the difference between potential and current rates multiplied by total consumption. The term \"current rate\" refers to the average kilowatt-hour rate paid by customers of a provider in a specific consumer sector in a State for the 12 months following the effective date of the Act, recalculated annually. The term \"potential rate\" for any provider of retail electric services in a State and consumer sector means the average kilowatt-hour rate paid by the provider's customers in that sector during the 12-month period before retail electric service choice was established. The Secretary of Energy will adjust the average kilowatt-hour rate for inflation annually. For sectors not serviced by the provider, the Secretary will estimate or measure the rate. Regulations will be established to determine the potential rate fairly in cases of phased-in retail choice. The Secretary of Energy will establish regulations to determine the potential rate fairly for sectors where a provider did not serve for the full 12-month period preceding the establishment of retail electric service choice. SEC. 3. USE OF CONTRIBUTIONS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PRIORITIES. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will establish a National Environmental Priorities Board composed of 3 federal officers and 4 State commissioners. Within 180 days, rules and procedures for the Board will be finalized, including the selection of a non-Federal fiscal agent. The Administrator will oversee the Board. The Administrator will oversee the National Environmental Priorities Board, which will establish regulations for an Environmental Priorities Program to support State projects such as wastewater treatment plants, river protection, and air quality improvement. The National Environmental Priorities Board will support projects like wastewater treatment, river protection, and air quality improvement. The Board will work with a non-Federal fiscal agent to receive and disburse contributions for environmental programs established by participating States with retail electric service choice. Matching funds can only be used for eligible environmental priorities programs. The National Environmental Priorities Board supports projects such as wastewater treatment, river protection, and air quality improvement. States are not required to participate in the Environmental Priorities Program or fund specific projects. The fiscal agent distributes contributions to States for eligible environmental priorities programs. Matching funds are solicited from States annually for environmental projects. The National Environmental Priorities Board supports projects like wastewater treatment, river protection, and air quality improvement. States must apply for matching funds for eligible environmental programs before the start of the calendar year. The Board calculates the necessary funds to match the state's projected support for the programs. The amount of matching funds required is communicated to the fiscal agent for distribution. The fiscal agent distributes matching funds to states for eligible environmental programs designated by the state. Funds must be used solely for these programs. Matching funds requested by states are reduced proportionally if they exceed the total available amount."
