    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Memorial to Noncitizen Patriots Act\". Congressional findings are also included in the Act. The \"Memorial to Noncitizen Patriots Act\" acknowledges the long history of noncitizens serving in the US Armed Forces, dating back to the Colonial period. Noncitizens, including George Washington and the Marquis de Lafayette, have played crucial roles in American battles. From the War of 1812 to World War I, noncitizens have made significant contributions to the country's defense. According to a recent study, over 20% of Medal of Honor recipients in the Armed Forces were immigrants. Currently, there are 36,177 noncitizen members in the Armed Forces, with about a third coming from Spanish-speaking countries. These individuals, born in other countries, now serve honorably in the US military. Noncitizen members of the Armed Forces from various countries have made sacrifices in Operation Iraqi Freedom, with some losing their lives in the line of duty. Their dedication and service to the United States deserve special recognition and appreciation. Establishment of a memorial for noncitizens killed while serving in the US Armed Forces is a special recognition deserving of appreciation. The Secretary of the Army, in consultation with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, will construct a memorial marker at Arlington National Cemetery to honor noncitizens killed while serving in the US Armed Forces. $500,000 is authorized for the design and construction of the memorial. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs may accept donations for constructing a memorial to noncitizens killed in the line of duty. They can transfer accepted services, money, or property to the Secretary of the Army for the construction of the memorial marker at Arlington National Cemetery. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs can accept gifts and donations for constructing a memorial to noncitizens killed in the line of duty. The authority to accept gifts expires five years after the enactment of the Act."
