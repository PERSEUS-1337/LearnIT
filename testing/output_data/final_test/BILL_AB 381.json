    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 361.3 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to give preferential consideration to placing a child with a relative, regardless of their immigration status, when removed from parental custody. Factors considered include the child's best interest, parental and child wishes, and relevant Family Code provisions. When considering placement of a child with a relative, factors such as the good moral character of the relative, the relationship between the child and relative, and the relative's ability to provide a safe environment are taken into account. When placing a child with a relative, factors such as the relative's good moral character, relationship with the child, and ability to provide a safe environment are considered. The relative's home must be approved for placement, and various steps are taken to protect the child's well-being, including facilitating reunification efforts with parents and legal permanence if reunification fails. Additionally, appropriate and safe child care arrangements are made as needed. The Legislature declares that physical disability is not a barrier to raising children. County social workers assess disabled relatives based on their ability to care for children. The court orders parents to provide information on relatives for potential placement, but it does not guarantee placement. Social workers contact preferred relatives for placement and assess them based on specific factors. These efforts are documented. The county social worker assesses relatives for placement based on specific factors and documents these efforts. The court authorizes disclosure of information to relatives regarding the child's custody and likely return home date. This investigation does not justify a continuance of the dispositional hearing. Preferential consideration for placement of a child with a relative means that the relative seeking placement will be the first to be considered and investigated. This does not limit the county social worker's ability to place the child with an appropriate relative or nonrelative extended family member while other relatives are being considered. (2) \"Relative\" refers to an adult related to the child within the fifth degree of kinship, including stepparents, stepsiblings, and certain relatives like grandparents, aunts, uncles, or siblings who are given preferential consideration for the child's placement. After a hearing, if a new placement is needed, relatives who meet requirements and are not deemed unsuitable should be considered again. The county social worker must report and the court must consider additional factors for placement. The court must consider various factors when determining placement for a child with a relative, including the relationship with the child, length of time in current placement, progress towards permanency, and the child's placement preference. The Judicial Council must establish rules for this process by January 1, 2017. If the court decides not to place the child with a relative, they must provide reasons for the decision on record. With respect to a child who meets certain criteria, the department and licensed adoption agencies can search for and provide identifying information to relatives if it is believed to benefit the child's welfare. This applies to children who were previously dependents of the court and had their adoptions disrupted or set aside. \"Relative\" includes both birth family members and nonrelated extended family members, even if parental rights were terminated. The child does not have a known potential caretaker from the adoptive family or birth parents' voluntary relinquishment. The act may increase costs for local agencies, but funding must be provided by the state. The Legislature aims to enact legislation to ensure the best outcome for children removed from their parents' custody, as stated in Section 1 of the California Constitution."
