The Act \"Emergency Mortgage Loan Modification Act of 2008\" establishes standards for loan modifications or workout plans for pooled residential mortgage loans. Servicers must act in the best interest of all investors and holders of beneficial interests in the pooled loans when dealing with loans in default or at risk of default. The Act \"Emergency Mortgage Loan Modification Act of 2008\" sets standards for loan modifications or workout plans for pooled residential mortgage loans. Loan servicers must make efforts to implement modifications or engage in loss mitigation when default is imminent, aiming to maximize net present value and avoid foreclosure. Servicers acting in accordance with these duties are provided a safe harbor. Loan servicers, in line with their duty, are protected from liability when entering into qualified loan modifications or workout plans for residential mortgage loans or interests in mortgage loan pools or securities. This protection extends to persons obligated to make payments on loans or interests through derivatives instruments, as well as those insuring such loans or interests under US or state regulations. For loan servicers, the ability to enter into loan modifications or workout plans is not limited by this section. A qualified loan modification or workout plan must remain in place until the borrower sells or refinances the property, not result in negative amortization, and not require additional points and fees from the borrower. The term \"negative amortization\" excludes the capitalization of delinquent interest and arrearages. A \"residential mortgage loan\" is defined as a loan secured by a lien on an owner-occupied residential dwelling. A \"securitization vehicle\" refers to a structure that issues mortgage-backed securities backed by residential mortgage loans. The section applies to qualified loan modification or workout plans initiated before January 1, 2011 for residential mortgage loans held by the entity."
