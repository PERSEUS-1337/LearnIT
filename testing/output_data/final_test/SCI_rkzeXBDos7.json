Residual connections are similar to spectral subtraction, while highway networks combine spectral masking and subtraction. This study aims to investigate the role of these connections in deep neural networks for speech enhancement. In speech enhancement systems, the study explores the role of residual and skip connections in deep neural networks. Visualizing the outputs of these connections in models trained for speech denoising shows that skip connections may not necessarily improve performance. In speech enhancement, skip connections are used to improve activation and gradient flow in deep neural networks. Two common approaches are spectral subtraction and spectral masking for predicting noise in corrupted signals. In speech enhancement, skip connections like spectral masking aim to block or scale down noisy time-frequency cells to match the clean signal. Recent work explores using skip connections and spectral estimation in neural networks for better noise reduction. The study aims to compare skip connections in neural networks for speech enhancement with traditional DSP approaches like spectral subtraction and spectral masking. It also investigates the performance of skip connections when used once or multiple times in network blocks, similar to highway and residual networks. Highway and residual networks are related, with residual networks being a special case of highway networks. Different types of skip connections, including masking, are tested in the study. In this paper, a masking block skip connection is tested for speech enhancement using stacked GRUs and a feedforward output layer. The goal is to mimic spectral masking for noise estimation models in speech enhancement. In speech enhancement, models predict noise magnitude spectrum based on past input frames, similar to residual blocks and models by BID6. Spectral masking predicts noise-dominated time-frequency cells and creates masks. Binary or ratio masks can be used, with ratio masks potentially improving speech quality. Highway networks combine spectral masking and subtraction by summing masked input and predicted signals. Experiments in the paper utilized these techniques for enhancement. The dataset used for experiments in the paper is a single speaker dataset with 720 phonetically balanced sentences. The dataset was split into training, validation, and testing sets. Training and validation sentences were mixed with noises at different SNRs, while testing sentences were mixed with different noises at varying SNRs. The NOISEX dataset BID10 was used for experiments at various SNRs. Signal energy for speech signals was computed according to the P.56 standard, while noise signals were computed by their overall RMS value. The training, validation, and test sets contained different numbers of sentences. A dereverberation dataset was also constructed using simulated room impulse responses. The training, validation, and test sets for the RIR dataset have 35150, 1850, and 3700 sentences respectively. Input representation used log-magnitude spectrum of signal's short-time Fourier transform. Models had 3 layers of GRUs with 256 hidden units each. Two types of skip connections were tried. Models were trained using Adam BID2 for 100 epochs with a mini-batch size of 32. Visualization was used to understand the output of each block. Visualization was used to understand the output of each block in the model. Skip connections perform operations between the output of each block and its input, visualized using the output layer to bring them back to the STFT domain. Earlier blocks show less frequency selectivity, while the last block specializes strongly in certain frequencies. The signal components take shape from lower to higher frequencies across the blocks. The masking model also shows predicted masks with linear masks that can flip the sign of time-frequency cells. The visualization of the model's output reveals that the highway model improves speech structure in all layers, with some frequency bands having their signs flipped. The interpretation of the model is complex due to the linear combination of elements. The masks used can alter the sign of time-frequency cells, making visualization challenging. Different colormaps are used to represent the masks, with values close to zero in white, negative numbers in blue, and positive numbers in red. The visualization of the model's output shows that the highway model enhances speech structure in all layers, with some frequency bands having their signs flipped. The interpretation is complicated due to the linear combination of elements, and the masks used can change the sign of time-frequency cells, making visualization difficult. The T(x) plots indicate regions where the model trusts its internal estimate more than the input, with green and yellow representing stronger confidence, and dark blue indicating dominance by the input. The model's behavior in rejecting input and using its own estimate varies across blocks, with the last layer relying more on its internal estimate despite higher noise levels. The evaluation of different models for denoising and reverberation showed that while there was not a significant improvement over the baseline, residual or masking models were more interpretable. Direct comparison between models was challenging due to varying numbers of parameters. In a preliminary study, various models were evaluated for speech enhancement, with baseline, masking, residual, and highway models compared in terms of parameters. These models were found to be less competitive with state-of-the-art models. While skip connections did not significantly impact model performance, they could enhance interpretability by identifying individual layer contributions. Future research will explore more complex models like those based on the UNet architecture. Future research will explore more complex models, such as those based on the UNet architecture and employing a temporal context window at the input, in line with state-of-the-art models in the literature."
