    "content": "The Obama Administration's foreign assistance programming was based on the 2010 Presidential Policy Directive on Global Development, which aimed to elevate global development as a key aspect of American foreign policy. It focused on economic growth, democratic governance, and key initiatives like the Global Health Initiative, Global Climate Change Initiative, and Global Food Security Initiative. This approach followed a period of active U.S. support for global development under the George W. Bush Administration. Under the George W. Bush Administration, foreign assistance levels doubled, creating the Millennium Challenge Corporation and the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. The Obama Administration continued these efforts amidst budget constraints and political challenges. The Republican Party's majority control in the House of Representatives led to reduced spending levels, limiting new investments in development assistance programs. The Obama Administration focused on reconfiguring existing aid programs due to budget constraints and political challenges. Funding for global health, climate change, and food security initiatives was requested in the FY2011 budget, with ongoing support provided in FY2010 appropriations. Congress has generally supported these initiatives to varying degrees. The Obama Administration increased economic aid for development and environment programs, following a trend from the Bush Administration. The focus was on improving aid effectiveness by building partner country capacity and shifting towards preventive measures. This included initiatives like \"fast track\" countries in the Global Health Initiative and \"focus countries\" in Feed the Future. The Obama Administration prioritized development-focused research to incentivize game-changing innovations like new vaccines and clean energy technology through initiatives such as the U.S. Global Development Lab and the Food Security Innovation Center. The Food Security Innovation Center (FSIC) was established at USAID as part of Feed the Future, overseeing collaborative research programs involving multiple U.S. government agencies to improve efficiency and effectiveness of international activities. The approach to international development initiatives has faced coordination challenges due to varying congressional committee jurisdictions and lack of authority for cross-agency cooperation. The use of metrics to measure progress and accountability of recipients was emphasized, aligning with the Government Performance and Results Act. The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993, updated in 2010, established requirements for U.S. government agencies to set goals, measure performance, and report to Congress. The Obama Administration focused on evaluating foreign aid impact, leading to updated evaluation policies for USAID, State, and MCC. Congress passed the Foreign Aid Transparency and Accountability Act in 2016 to enforce new evaluation and reporting standards. However, measuring outcomes of U.S. aid interventions remains challenging, with reported results often being selective and lacking rigorous evaluation. The initiatives mentioned lack evaluations using control groups to determine impact. They originated from multilateral efforts like the G8 food security summit and the U.N Framework Convention on Climate Change. Each initiative involves working with private sector partners to address development challenges. The Obama Administration aimed to expand the multilateral aspects of these initiatives by leveraging U.S. resources through partnerships with other donors and private sector entities. Congress has shown less support for these efforts. The Obama administration's development approach emphasized working across sectors to address foreign assistance challenges. The global health initiative recognized the importance of nutrition, clean water, and women's empowerment in addition to vaccines and drugs. Agricultural development activities also contribute to community resilience to climate change. There are opportunities for synergies among the initiatives, but confusion exists over funding attribution. U.S. investments in global health increased significantly under the George W. Bush Administration through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). President Obama later launched the Global Health Initiative (GHI) in 2009, focusing on integrating and coordinating ongoing global health efforts. The GHI aimed to improve health outcomes by strengthening health systems and increasing investments in maternal and child health, family planning, nutrition, and infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. The Global Health Initiative (GHI) was launched in 2009 by President Obama to improve health outcomes by focusing on child health, family planning, nutrition, and infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. The approach emphasized treating patients, not just diseases, and identified eight \"fast-track\" countries for additional support. Streamlining efforts across agencies and program silos was a key focus of GHI. The Global Health Initiative (GHI) was launched in 2009 by President Obama to improve health outcomes by focusing on child health, family planning, nutrition, and infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. The GHI office closed in 2012, and its activities were integrated into the State Department's Office of Global Health Diplomacy. The Administration described this change as an elevation, citing successful integration of GHI principles into country development plans. Others criticized the office as ineffective due to lack of authority and funding to resolve interagency conflicts. Most agency reports on global health stopped mentioning GHI after 2012. The Global Health Initiative (GHI) was not established in legislation and relied on existing authorities in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and the PEPFAR authorization. GHI exists in 2016 as a funding framework within the international affairs budget, primarily funded through the State, Foreign Operations and Related Programs appropriation. Congress appropriates funds for Global Health Programs, established in FY2007. Global Health Programs, established in FY2007, combined appropriations for PEPFAR and the Maternal Health and Child Survival account. Global health funding continued to grow early in the Obama Administration, leveling out after 2010 but remaining historically high. Total global health funding did not meet the initial GHI goal of $63 million over five years. For detailed funding trends, refer to CRS Report R43115. During the Obama Administration, Congress provided more funds than requested for global health, with funding for maternal and child health steadily increasing. Disparities between the Administration and Congress on specific global health priorities were resolved, and funding for malaria, tuberculosis, and reproductive health also saw increases. Global health funding priorities shifted during the Obama Administration, with a slight decrease in funding for HIV/AIDS programs and an increase in multilateral health aid, including contributions to the Global Fund to Fight HIV, TB, and Malaria. Nutrition programs were integrated into global health initiatives, receiving steady funding increases. During the Obama Administration, Global Fund contributions increased, reflecting a focus on partnerships and health outcomes. The Global Health Initiative (GHI) emphasized goals in eight primary areas, with progress continuing in individual program areas post-GHI. However, the GHI strategy and results framework faded over time, but global health outcomes improved since the Bush Administration. During the Obama Administration, global health outcomes improved, with some acceleration from the Bush Administration. The Global Health Initiative (GHI) faced criticism for poor management, but U.S. global health programs remained strong. The Obama Administration's global food security initiative was a response to the 2007-2008 global food price crisis, with a pledge of $3.5 billion in investments. Congress's strong support indicates global health will remain a key development sector. President Obama pledged $3.5 billion over three years for a global hunger and food security initiative at a summit where G20 countries committed over $20 billion. This marked a return to 1960s and 1970s development policies focusing on agricultural and rural development. The Feed the Future initiative was launched in 2010, with a Bureau for Food Security established within USAID to lead its implementation. The Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP) was also created in 2010 to support agricultural development. The Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP), administered by the World Bank, was established to fulfill G8 Summit commitments. Feed the Future focuses on inclusive growth in agriculture, improving nutrition, and coordinating donor efforts. Feed the Future is a U.S. agricultural development initiative that provides assistance to focus countries with the greatest needs and potential for agricultural-led growth. It is the only Obama Administration initiative specifically authorized in law, with activities authorized under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. Congressional legislation was introduced to permanently authorize the initiative. For more detailed background information, refer to CRS Report R44216. The Global Food Security Act of 2016, enacted as P.L. 114-195, established a statutory foundation for global food security assistance, requiring a whole-of-government strategy and funding of over $1 billion per year for FY2017 and FY2018. The Administration met its Aquila pledge by developing a strategy for FY2017-FY2021, with Congress funding Feed the Future programs primarily through the SFOPS appropriations bill. The Global Food Security Act of 2016 established funding for global food security assistance, with Congress allocating funds for bilateral food security and agricultural development activities. The Administration determines how to allocate these funds within the Feed the Future framework, including contributions to the GAFSP. In the early years of the initiative, Administration requests for Feed the Future and congressional appropriations for food security and agricultural development showed interesting trends. Since FY2013, appropriations have matched or exceeded Administration requests, with agricultural development aid becoming a higher priority within the foreign assistance budget. In FY2015, agricultural development aid became a higher priority in the foreign assistance budget, increasing from 2.2% to 4.5% compared to FY2005. Feed the Future initiative established impact and output indicators to track progress, showing some success in poverty reduction and stunting. Feed the Future initiative has shown success in focusing agricultural development aid in select countries, but lacks transparency and country ownership. The GFSA aims to address these issues by calling for presidential coordination and detailed accounting of food security activities across agencies, although funding authorization remains with USAID. The Global Climate Change Initiative (GCCI) expanded U.S. climate-related aid to developing countries, building on existing efforts under previous administrations. It remains uncertain if these programs will be a priority for the new administration and the 115th Congress. The Global Climate Change Initiative (GCCI) increased U.S. climate aid to developing countries in line with international agreements. The initiative focused on investing in clean energy technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Funding was expected to be channeled through the World Bank's Climate Investment Funds. The Obama Administration committed $1 billion from 2010 to 2012 to support country plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+), as part of the Global Climate Change Initiative. This pillar aimed to promote sustainable landscapes and provide sustainable development benefits. Additionally, efforts were made to support climate change resilience and adaptation in vulnerable low-income countries by integrating climate change considerations into development activities. The Obama Administration established the Global Climate Change Initiative (GCCI) to promote sustainable development and address climate change. The GCCI focused on promoting country ownership, climate solutions for economic growth, sustainability of economic gains, governance, inclusive planning, and investing in science and technology. An Office of the Special Envoy for Climate Change was created within the State Department, and USAID coordinated GCCI activities through the Office for Global Climate Change. Several bills supporting Obama's climate change policy were introduced in Congress during his administration. Several bills supporting Obama's climate change policy were introduced in the 111th Congress, including the International Climate Change Investment Act of 2009 (S. 2835) by Senator John Kerry. The bill aimed to establish an interagency board on climate change, reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, and develop a climate adaptation and global security program. However, no action was taken on the legislation or other bills related to GCCI activities. Relevant authority for GCCI programs exists in the Foreign Assistance Act sections on development assistance. The GCCI programs under the Foreign Assistance Act include sections on development assistance and the economic support fund. Congress does not specify annual funding levels for GCCI, but funds are allocated for initiatives like REDD+ and sustainable landscapes. The Administration utilizes funds from various accounts to support environmental protection activities. Additionally, Treasury Department accounts and a portion of Millennium Challenge Corporation funding contribute to GCCI, along with development finance from OPIC and export credits. Total appropriated funding for GCCI peaked in FY2011, fell 34% in FY2012, and rose again in FY2015. Clean energy programs received the highest funding every year, with a 17% increase in funding between FY2014 and FY2015. U.S. contributions to multilateral components are requested and appropriated separately, allowing for a comparison of funds. Comparing requested and actual funding shows the Administration aiming high in its funding goals. In FY2016, the Administration aimed to increase multilateral climate change funding by requesting $500 million for a new Green Climate Fund, following a trend of Congress providing less than requested. The fund was intended to succeed contributions to previous Climate Investment Funds, but the FY2016 appropriation did not specify funding for it. The Administration proposed $750 million for the Green Climate Fund in FY2017 budget request, replacing previous Climate Investment Funds. Congress has yet to finalize appropriations for FY2017, with the House SFOPS committee-approved bill prohibiting funds for the GCF and the Senate committee-approved bill allowing for it. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) received a proposed $750 million in the FY2017 budget request. The Senate committee-approved bill allowed for a GCF contribution up to $500 million. The Global Climate Change Initiative (GCCI) did not establish specific numeric goals but provided support through various initiatives. USAID reported impacts of the GCCI in their Climate Action Review, with climate change incorporated into 62% of their strategies between 2011 and 2015. Beginning in 2015, USAID started addressing climate risks and considering mitigation opportunities in all new country strategies. Even activities without designated climate change funding integrated climate change elements, with 18.5% in 2015 compared to 8% in 2009. USAID asserts that over $1 billion in funding has contributed to climate change objectives, beyond designated GCCI funding. The 2015 Paris Agreement, aiming to keep global temperatures below 2\u00b0C, was partially successful due to GCCI efforts. Bilateral funds have helped partner countries develop plans for greenhouse gas abatement commitments. The Obama Administration's global development initiatives focused on climate change, global health, food security, and agricultural development. Critics argue that relying on executive action for climate policy made progress vulnerable to dismantlement. Budget pressures, coordination issues, and lack of congressional support may have limited the initiatives' full potential. The lasting legacy may be more about the \"how\" of development rather than the \"what.\" The Obama Administration's global development initiatives focused on climate change, global health, food security, and agricultural development. The principles emphasized in the PPD\u2014elevation of development, partnership and accountability, innovation, evaluation, local procurement, data driven development policy, and interagency cooperation\u2014may be the Administration's unique global development legacy. The \"why\" aspect of the initiatives, framed in terms of promoting U.S. national security, could be reexamined by the new Administration and Congress. Congressional interest in global health, food security, and climate change may keep these issues prominent in global development policy discussions."
