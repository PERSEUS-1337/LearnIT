It includes limitations on underwriting to ensure fair treatment for these individuals. The \"Insurance Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence Act\" prohibits health insurance discrimination based on abuse history or seeking protection from abuse. Insurers cannot deny coverage, cancel policies, or adjust premiums for individuals or groups affected by domestic violence. \"SEC. 2702. ESTABLISHMENT OF STANDARDS.\" The Secretary will request the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to develop model standards within 9 months, in consultation with domestic violence advocacy groups, incorporating underwriting limitations and enforcement procedures, including a private right of action. If recommended regulations are developed, the Secretary will review them within 90 days. If the Association fails to develop model regulations within 9 months, or if the Secretary deems the regulations inadequate, the Secretary will establish standards within 15 months. Each State must report on their implementation and enforcement of these standards to the Secretary. Each State must report on their implementation and enforcement of standards established under this section with respect to insurers and health insurance coverage. If a State fails to submit a report by the deadline or does not adequately enforce the standards, the Secretary will notify the State and provide a 60-day period to submit the report. After the deadline for submitting a report, if the Secretary finds that a State has not corrected its failure to enforce standards, the Secretary will establish an enforcement mechanism and may impose a $10,000 civil penalty on insurers for each day of violation. The Secretary may impose a penalty on insurers for violating requirements, with liability starting 30 days after notice of noncompliance. The enforcement mechanism will be effective 3 months after the Secretary's finding and will remain until the deficiency is corrected. Additionally, a federal civil right of action is available. Federal civil right of action allows individuals affected by prohibited conduct under section 2701 to sue insurers in US district court for civil penalties, injunctive relief, compensatory and punitive damages, and legal fees. The federal civil right of action allows individuals affected by prohibited conduct to sue insurers for compensatory damages, with the option to recover statutory damages of $5,000 for each violation before final judgment. \"SEC. 2703. APPLICATION TO GROUP HEALTH PLANS AND ENFORCEMENT.\" The prohibitions in section 2701 and standards in section 2702 apply to group health plans like insurers.

References to State or HHS in section 2702 are deemed as references to the Secretary of Labor, and references to insurer or health insurance coverage are deemed as references to group health plan and health coverage.

The Secretary of Labor has regulatory authority in this regard. \"SEC. 2704.
