    "content": "The Affordable Care Act imposed a 2.3% excise tax on certain medical devices, effective from December 31, 2012. Congress has debated delaying or repealing the tax due to concerns about compliance issues. The Department of the Treasury issued final regulations on the tax in December 2012. The excise tax on medical devices, imposed by the Affordable Care Act, is 2.3% of the sale price. The Treasury's regulations clarify that manufacturers, producers, or importers are liable for the tax. The rules define these terms and outline the scope of products covered by the tax. The medical device excise tax, imposed by the Affordable Care Act, is levied on the sale of taxable medical devices. The definition of a manufacturer includes producers and importers, with courts interpreting it broadly to encompass various activities involving physical changes to taxable articles. The term \"medical device\" is defined broadly in the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, covering a wide range of devices regulated by the FDA. The FDA regulates a range of devices from tongue depressors to artificial hearts. The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 defines a \"taxable medical device\" broadly. Treasury Regulations explain that it includes devices registered with the FDA. Efforts to narrow the definition were resisted, maintaining a broad scope for devices subject to the excise tax. The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 defines a \"taxable medical device\" broadly, including devices registered with the FDA. Congress excluded eyeglasses, contact lenses, and hearing aids from the excise tax. The Treasury regulations provide a framework for exempting certain medical devices from the 2.3% excise tax. The new Treasury regulations provide a two-prong test to determine if a device qualifies for the retail exemption from the excise tax. Factors are outlined to assess if a device is regularly available for purchase by individual consumers and not primarily intended for medical professionals or institutions. The analysis considers all relevant facts and circumstances to determine eligibility for the exemption. The Treasury regulations provide a two-prong test to determine if a device qualifies for the retail exemption from the excise tax. Factors include the ability of end consumers to purchase the device in person, the need for medical professional assistance, and FDA classification. Adhesive bandages are an example of a device regularly available for purchase by individual consumers. Treasury issued factors to determine if a device is for medical use, including FDA classification and cost. Adhesive bandages do not require medical assistance and are inexpensive, not primarily for medical use. Adhesive bandages are considered to fall within the retail exemption to the medical device excise tax due to their availability for individual purchase and lack of complexity. Factors like packaging or labeling do not affect this classification. The December 7, 2012, Treasury regulations provide a list of \"safe harbor\" devices that qualify for the retail exemption from the medical device excise tax. This includes OTC medical devices like pregnancy test kits and certain durable medical equipment eligible for Medicare part B payment. The Treasury regulations provide examples of devices that qualify for the retail exemption from the medical device excise tax, including therapeutic shoes, absorbent tipped applicators, snake bite suction kits, and prosthetic legs. The regulations also list safe harbor provisions for devices like pregnancy test kits, blood glucose monitors, and urinary ileostomy bags. The new Treasury regulations clarify that certain medical devices, such as therapeutic shoes and absorbent tipped applicators, are exempt from the medical device excise tax. However, devices like mobile x-ray systems and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging systems are not exempt. The regulations aim to provide clarity but the impact on the medical technology industry remains uncertain. The new Treasury regulations clarify exemptions from the medical device excise tax for certain products, but ambiguity remains regarding which products are subject to the tax. Treasury identified issues requiring separate guidance, including the treatment of licensing software and \"kits.\" The Treasury Department issued regulations clarifying exemptions from the medical device excise tax, but ambiguity remains about which products are subject to the tax. Further guidance may be needed, including on the treatment of licensing software and kits. Congress has debated repealing the tax, with the Senate voting on an amendment to repeal it in 2014. The White House previously threatened to veto a repeal, and the Senate majority leader has expressed doubts about the likelihood of repeal. The Senate majority leader doubts the repeal of the medical device tax, which imposes a 2.3 percent tax on taxable medical devices. The tax excludes items like eyeglasses, contact lenses, and hearing aids. The medical device tax is 2.3 percent of the price for which a manufacturer, producer, or importer sold the taxable medical device. It applies to sales made after December 31, 2012, with some transition relief for certain long-term contracts. Funds from the tax go into the general treasury, and the disposition of these funds is governed by the Miscellaneous Receipts Statute. The Miscellaneous Receipts Statute governs the disposition of funds collected from the medical device tax, requiring the IRS to deposit all funds received in the Treasury without deductions. The tax applies to manufacturers, producers, or importers of medical devices intended for humans, as defined by FDA regulations. The medical device tax applies to all devices intended for humans, with exemptions for certain items like eyeglasses and hearing aids. The Treasury regulations provide examples of devices exempt from the tax, such as absorbent tipped applicators, adhesive bandages, and prosthetic legs. The FDA has listed certain \"safe harbor\" items exempt from the medical device tax, but there is no complete list of exempt devices due to the flexible nature of the retail exemption. Tax liability must be reported and paid quarterly to the IRS using form 720. Entities liable for excise taxes are required to make semimonthly tax deposits. Failure to deposit the tax can result in penalties under section 6656 of the Internal Revenue Code. The IRS has waived penalties for delinquent taxpayers for the first three quarters of 2013. The medical device tax does not regulate consumer receipts. A software glitch at Cabela's led to an additional charge on receipts labeled as a \"medical excise tax,\" not mandated by HCERA. Emails circulated suggesting HCERA imposed excise taxes on hunting and fishing equipment and gas. HCERA imposed excise taxes on various items including hunting and fishing equipment, gas guzzler automobiles, vaccines, tires, and coal. Two main excise taxes were the medical device excise tax and a forty percent excise tax on health insurance benefits exceeding a certain threshold. These taxes were added to existing excise taxes under the Internal Revenue Code. Table 1 summarizes the origins of some of these taxes, while Table 2 lists bills to repeal the medical device excise tax in the 112th and 113th Congresses."
