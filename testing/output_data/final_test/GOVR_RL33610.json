    "content": "In the 1994 general election, Republicans gained a majority in the House for the first time since 1953. The majority party in the House has the power to elect the Speaker, chair committees, set the legislative agenda, and write and change the House rules. Unlike the Senate, the House must adopt rules at the start of each new Congress. The House relies on formal rules rather than informal procedures, and each new House makes changes to the existing rules. The new House adopts changes to rules that strengthen majority control over the legislative process and bestow rights on the minority party. Republican majorities made changes to various aspects of the legislative process, budget process, committee organization, and ethical standards. These changes were not solely based on the 1994 elections but drew on various experiences and sources. The Republican majority in the House made significant changes to rules, committees, budget process, and ethics standards. These changes were based on years of critique of Democratic management and various experiences. The report identifies sources of rule changes in the 104th Congress and subsequent Congresses, organizing them by topic and explaining them in simple terms. These changes were included in rules resolutions, special orders, and policy announcements. The report catalogs and explains rules changes made by the Republican majority in the House, covering committees, budget process, and ethics standards. It supplements the House Rules and Manual by detailing specific changes over different Congresses. The report details rules changes made by the Republican majority in the House, including committees, budget process, and ethics standards. It supplements the House Rules and Manual by describing specific changes across different Congresses. Between the 104th and 109th Congresses, various committees were created, abolished, or had their names changed. The report outlines rules changes made by the Republican majority in the House, including procedures for fast-track legislation and impacts of Democratic Caucus and Republican Conference decisions on House rules implementation. Selected references to relevant bills and resolutions are provided in footnotes. During the 105th Congress, a Rules Committee task force completed the first recodification of House rules since the 1880s. Citations in this report refer only to the recodified rules, with parliamentarian's notes tracing specific provisions and changes. This report is part of a series on House rules changes, with a second report covering changes for the 110th through 112th Congresses. The House rules changes in the 104th Congress reflected a Republican frame of reference built over many years as the minority party, focusing on democratic floor processes, minority party rights, accountability, and streamlining of House operations. Subsequent Republican-organized Congresses continued to build on this frame of reference while incorporating current House management experiences. Republican Members, having been in the minority for 40 years, were less attached to the House's status quo. In the 104th Congress, Republican Members, who had been in the minority for 40 years, had some investment in the House's status quo. Their interests influenced the rules package, with criticisms dating back to changes made after the 1974 election. The Committee Reform Amendments abolished proxy voting in committees and allocated one-third of staff to the minority. The rules in the 94th Congress restored proxy voting but required it to be in writing and abrogated the staff allocation. In the 94th Congress, proxy voting was restored but required to be in writing, and the committee staff allocation formula was abrogated. The Democratic majority introduced special rules in the 1970s and 1980s to favor their policy outcomes, leading Republican Members to form groups like the Conservative Opportunity Society and the Republican '92 Group to challenge Democratic legislative management by proposing conservative alternatives. The Conservative Opportunity Society, founded by Newt Gingrich in 1983, promoted conservative proposals as an alternative to the welfare state. The '92 Group, founded by Republican moderates like Olympia Snowe and Tom Tauke, aimed to elect a Republican majority in the House in 1992 and proposed conservative alternatives to Democratic legislation. Scandals in the 102nd and 103rd Congresses exposed special treatment and self-dealing by Members of Congress, leading to a sense of disconnection with constituents. Investigations into embezzlement and drug dealing at the House post office revealed allegations of cash transactions disguised as stamp purchases involving Members of Congress. In 1994, Representative Dan Rostenkowski, chair of the Ways and Means Committee, was indicted on 17 criminal charges including embezzlement and fraud. A General Accounting Office audit in 1991 found Members had written 8,331 bad checks at the House bank. Over 250 Members were in arrears for bills at House restaurants for over $255,000. In 1992, the House voted to release bad check audit data with Members' names. Additionally, a ranking Republican Member of the House Appropriations Committee and a Democratic Member from Massachusetts were separately indicted on bribery charges. In 1992, a Democratic Member from Massachusetts was indicted on charges of extortion, racketeering, and tax evasion. The 102nd and 103rd Congresses saw an increased number of Members investigated for ethics violations. Scandals, including the House bank scandal, led to many Representatives not seeking reelection or being defeated in the 1992 elections. This contributed to the Democrats losing their 40-year majority in the House in the 1994 election. Voters were motivated by a desire for change and responded to the Republicans' campaign. The Republicans' 104th Congress rules package and subsequent exercises of rulemaking authority were influenced by the Contract with America, the Republican alternative rules package in the 103rd Congress, and the recommendations of the Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress. The Democratic Caucus also made rules changes in response to scandals, leading to the loss of their majority in the House in the 1994 election. The Democratic rules package for the 103rd Congress, presented in January 1993, included changes such as giving voting rights in the Committee of the Whole to Delegates and the Puerto Rican Resident Commissioner. This allowed them to chair the Committee and have a re-vote in the House if their vote impacted the outcome. They were not given a vote in regular House meetings. The Democratic rules package for the 103rd Congress included changes giving voting rights in the Committee of the Whole to Delegates and the Puerto Rican Resident Commissioner. This was seen as a matter of fairness and democracy in action, with the argument that their votes could not affect the outcome in the House. Other proposed rules changes were aimed at legislative efficiency and productivity. Republicans proposed rules changes allowing committees to meet while the House was sitting under the five-minute rule without seeking permission. Committee records determined the presence of a quorum to report a measure, reducing floor point of order opportunities. Moribund general teller vote procedures in the Committee of the Whole were eliminated, with recorded tellers as a backup. The Speaker could declare short recesses throughout a Congress. The Speaker was authorized to declare short recesses throughout a Congress, allowing immediate consideration of House privileges raised by leaders. Debate time on privileges of the House would be divided between the proponent and the opposition leadership as determined by the Speaker. This change also allowed the Speaker to schedule debate on privileges resolutions within two legislative days. The change in debate rules allowed the chair of the authorizing committee to intervene in motions related to legislative language in appropriation bills. This change sparked debate on whether it protected House prerogatives or favored specific committees. The motion could delay a conference report without proposing a solution, leading to a one-hour debate divided between proponents of the motion to insist on disagreement and proponents of the motion to change existing law. The House rules were amended to give the Speaker authority to appoint and remove Members from conference committees and select committees. Changes were made to the Office of Fair Employment Practices procedures. The Select Committee on Aging's permanent authorization was repealed, and three select committees' temporary authorizations were not renewed, leading to their termination. A proposed rule limiting special orders to three hours or 9:00 p.m. was dropped from the rules package. In the 103rd Congress, the House rules were amended to give the Speaker authority over committee appointments. Special orders were regulated by the Speaker's policies, with the majority party often setting rules while the minority party critiques them. Republicans argued against proposed rules, citing the need for change after the 1992 election. Representative Gerald Solomon criticized Democrats for misreading voters' message. Many Republican Members opposed allowing Delegates and the Resident Commissioner to vote in the Committee of the Whole, citing constitutional objections and disparities in population among territories. They argued that the votes of Delegates and the Resident Commissioner could be used to build a majority. The change allowing Delegates and the Resident Commissioner to vote in the Committee of the Whole reduced Republican election gains by half. Minority Leader Robert Michel criticized the proposal, stating that a rolling quorum undermines collective decision making in Congress. The proposed change to the rule in the House could allow legislation to be passed through a rolling quorum concept, where votes can take place over hours, days, weeks, or months. The Republican minority also prepared an alternate package of rules changes during the debate on the proposed rules package. The Republican minority prepared an alternate rules package during the debate on the proposed rules package, but they were unable to offer it as an amendment due to House rules. The alternate package included proposals from previous Congresses and was supported by documentation in the Congressional Record. Representative Gerald Solomon motioned to refer the majority's rules package to a special committee for study. Gerald Solomon motioned to refer the resolution to a special committee to study the constitutionality of giving voting rights to Delegates and the Resident Commissioner in the Committee of the Whole. A motion by Representative Michel to commit the resolution to a select committee with amendments was defeated. The Republicans' alternate rules package became a key source for rules changes in subsequent Congresses. The Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress was created during the 102nd Congress to study and recommend improvements for the organization and operation of the United States Congress. Their goal was to strengthen effectiveness, simplify operations, improve relationships with other branches of government, and enhance the consideration of legislation. The study by the Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress will examine the organization and operation of each House of Congress, relationships between committees, the two Houses, and the executive branch. It will also compare resources available to the legislative and executive branches, assess leadership responsibilities, and recommend changes for House and Senate organization and operations. The House subcommittee's recommendations for the Senate include requiring all standing House committees to prepare an oversight agenda at the beginning of each Congress and hold oversight hearings on executive branch reports. The House Administration Committee would coordinate oversight activities and publish agendas, with committees directed to eliminate unnecessary reporting requirements. The Speaker could appoint ad hoc oversight committees with House approval. The Speaker may appoint ad hoc oversight committees. Committees should develop dialogue between legislative and judicial branches. Members' committee assignments limited to two standing committees and four subcommittees. Waivers require House approval after party caucus recommendation. Rules Committee to abolish committees with less than half the Members. Members can serve on Intelligence Committee for eight years. Chair can serve an additional term in final term. The proposed changes include limiting the number of subcommittees for exclusive or major committees, requiring a \"primary\" committee of jurisdiction for legislation referral, prohibiting subcommittees from meeting when the parent committee is meeting without permission, and mandating a week's notice for committee meetings. Committee reports must include roll-call votes or a list of members present for voice votes. Committees are directed to publish attendance and voting records. Committees should publish attendance and voting records semiannually in the Congressional Record. Standing committees must create an oversight agenda each Congress and report on its fulfillment. Reports will influence committee funding decisions. Members should have the right to reference Senate actions in debate. The House should have a four-day legislative week with designated times for floor proceedings and committee meetings. The Congressional Record should accurately reflect House proceedings. The House parliamentarian should reorganize House rules. The House parliamentarian should prepare a recodification of House rules and establish a two-year budget cycle for presidential budget submissions, resolutions, authorizations, and appropriations. Appropriations Committee must notify appropriate committees of unauthorized appropriations. Point of order against appropriations exceeding authorization levels. Budget resolutions should include total tax expenditures. Committee reports on tax bills should list tax expenditures. To improve control over spending, a new process should require the President to set targets for direct spending and provide recommendations if targets are exceeded. The Ethics Committee should be able to use private citizens as fact finders for complaints against Members. A Speaker task force should study cost savings in the legislative branch. Eight-year authorizations are recommended. The National Performance Review recommends imposing eight-year authorizations on various agencies in the legislative branch and studying ways to coordinate nonpartisan services and minimize duplication. It also suggests exploring the feasibility of opening these services to competitive bidding by the private sector. Additionally, it proposes creating a bicameral \"office of compliance\" to apply labor laws to Congress and issue regulations. The National Performance Review recommends imposing eight-year authorizations on legislative branch agencies and exploring competitive bidding for nonpartisan services. It also proposes creating an \"office of compliance\" to apply labor laws to Congress and establish enforcement mechanisms. Additionally, it suggests professional development programs for congressional employees and studying staff salaries for parity between chambers. Abolishing Joint Committees on the Library and Printing in favor of a Joint Committee on Information Management is recommended for better oversight. The House should engage in activities to enhance public understanding of Congress and experiment with alternative forms of debate. Activities such as experimenting with alternative forms of debate, creating a congressional education center, and enhancing orientation programs for journalists covering Congress are recommended. Legislative information should be more readily available to Members, the public, and the media. Legislation embodying the recommendations was introduced in the 103rd Congress, but no action was taken. The House passed the Congressional Accountability Act, but the Senate did not act on it. The House established an Office of Congressional Fair Employment Practices and procedures for considering rules proposed by the new office's board. They also agreed to H.Res. 578, which established an Office of Compliance. The House and Senate nearly passed new lobby laws and gift rules, but Senate consideration ended without passing the measure. Most Republican candidates for U.S. Representative signed the Contract with America, a campaign platform for institutional change and priority legislation. The Contract with America outlined major reforms for the 104th Congress, including applying all laws equally to Congress, conducting a comprehensive audit for waste, cutting House committees and staff, limiting committee chair terms, banning proxy votes, requiring open committee meetings, a three-fifths majority vote for tax increases, and implementing zero base-line budgeting for an honest Federal Budget accounting.

House rules were recodified in the 105th Congress to consolidate rules and remove obsolete provisions. The House rules were recodified in the 105th Congress to consolidate rules and remove obsolete provisions. The recodification aimed to use consistent language, cluster similar provisions, and retain familiar rule numbers. The Rules Committee presented recommendations to House leaders, chairs, and ranking minority Members in October 1998. The proposed recodification was adopted when the House adopted its rules for the 106th Congress on January 6, 1999. The parliamentarian's notes in the House Rules and Manual track the recodification of specific provisions and changes to the text of the rules. Citations in this report refer only to the recodified rules and specific clauses at the time of the change. Cross references to rules before recodification can be found in the parliamentarian's notes or Table 2. The House rules were recodified in the 105th Congress to consolidate rules and remove obsolete provisions. Surveys and hearings by the Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress highlighted committee structure as a major concern for Members and staff. Previous changes to committee organization were made in various acts and resolutions. Changes to the committee system in the House have been addressed in resolutions since the 104th Congress, focusing on structure, organization, procedure, and staff/funding.

Rules changes in the House, starting from the 104th Congress, impacted committee structures and administrative functions. Offices were eliminated or created, responsibilities were shifted, and accountability was enhanced. Modern practices like financial audits were implemented, while traditional practices were reformed to adapt to technological advancements. These changes aimed to improve the House's administration and adapt to evolving conditions. Changes to the administration of the House have been implemented since the 104th Congress through various legislation and initiatives, including the use of information technology like THOMAS and e-mail. The House has adapted to technological advancements, with the introduction of the World Wide Web and the BlackBerry\u00ae personal digital assistant in 1999.

The House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct issues advisory memoranda interpreting ethical standards for House Members, officers, and employees. Controversial ethics changes in the 109th Congress were rescinded, reverting to rules from the 108th Congress. Disputes over committee rules and staffing delayed the organization of the Standards of Official Conduct Committee. In the 104th Congress, Democrats attempted to amend the Republican rules package by proposing bans on gifts from lobbyists and limitations on Members' royalty income. However, their motions were defeated. Later, the House agreed to H.Res. 250, which prohibited gifts to Members, officers, or employees. On November 16, 1995, H.Res. 250 was agreed upon, prohibiting gifts to Members, officers, or employees. In December 22, 1995, H.Res. 299 was passed, regulating Members' book contracts.

House rules were amended to comply with federal law, prohibiting a Member who is a candidate from sending a franked mass mailing less than 90 days before an election. Other changes included allowing family members other than a spouse or child to accompany a Member on official travel. The rules changes reflected a Republican perspective that evolved over time. The Republican majority in the House made extensive changes to House rules in the 104th Congress, drawing on various antecedents. Subsequent Congresses saw incremental changes, while many rules remained unchanged. After controlling four Congresses, Republicans revisited the rules due to a confluence of events. In response to events like 9/11 and the anthrax attacks, House Republicans made significant changes to House rules in the 108th and 109th Congresses. Adjustments included ending committee chair term limits, discontinuing the Speaker's term limit, creating a Homeland Security Committee, and realigning Appropriations Committee subcommittees for homeland security spending. In response to events like 9/11 and the anthrax attacks, House Republicans made significant changes to House rules in the 108th and 109th Congresses, including reorganizing subcommittees for homeland security spending. Congress also implemented new analyses of tax legislation and addressed ethical breaches by Members. Actions to open up Congress allowed more citizens to have insight into policymaking, but also gave lobbyists and activists more knowledge. Lobbying and public relations efforts intensified alongside committee and floor actions. Members of Congress are under pressure to be present in their districts regularly, leading to increased contact with constituents. Campaign costs and fundraising also expose them to more people interested in their actions. Congressional districts have become more politically homogeneous, potentially affecting primary elections. Rules changes in Congress do not always guarantee smooth legislative processes or bipartisan cooperation. In recent Congresses, the House has seen changes in rules to accommodate different perspectives within the Republican majority and deal with an emboldened minority. This led to fewer open special rules, more structured rules, additional days for legislation consideration, increased competition between committees, challenges in passing measures in the Senate, and difficulties in convening conferences between chambers. Despite these changes, the House remains an independent political institution within Congress. The House of Representatives remains an independent political institution within Congress, designed by the Framers to balance interests and require majority political will to take action. Congress's role is not only to make laws but also to evaluate proposals for feasibility, public support, cost, and practicality. If chamber rules allow all Members to participate in the legislative process, the system would be seen as working effectively. In the 109th Congress, 60% of Representatives had only known the rules since the 104th Congress. 265 sitting Members began their service in the 104th or later Congress. 21 Members who started before the 103rd Congress left, and 60 new Members were welcomed. The rules of the House are not meant to achieve specific legislative results but are available to all Members. Speaker Thomas Bracken Reed is mentioned in history. The House rules, crucial for governance, have evolved over time. Speaker Thomas Bracken Reed's influence on creating the modern House is noted. The Corrections Calendar, once significant, was terminated in the 109th Congress. The procedure for legislation under suspension of the rules has become more frequent. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974's requirement for two budget resolutions annually was deemed impractical and abandoned. The House rules, crucial for governance, are important components for all Members and majorities and minorities to use."
