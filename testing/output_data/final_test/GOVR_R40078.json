    "content": "California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger issued an executive order in 2007 for the establishment of a Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) to reduce fuel carbon intensity by 10% by 2020. The California Air Resources Board (ARB) released draft regulations in 2008 in response to Assembly Bill AB32, aiming for cost-effective reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The LCFS would require fuel suppliers to decrease lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from motor fuels, leading to a decrease in transportation fuel's greenhouse gas intensity. The 110th Congress introduced bills for a national Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) to reduce gas intensity of transportation fuels. These bills varied in target dates and required reductions, but none were adopted except for one discussed on the Senate floor. Motor fuels already face regulatory requirements at state and federal levels, and implementing a LCFS would add another major regulatory requirement, especially at the federal level. The report analyzes draft California standards and federal LCFS legislation proposed in the 110th Congress. It discusses potential impacts on state and national fuel supplies, considering transportation's significant contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. Transportation GHG emissions are primarily from vehicle miles traveled, fuel economy, carbon content of fuel, and non-fuel-related emissions. To reduce emissions, options include decreasing vehicle miles, improving fuel efficiency, reducing carbon content of fuel, and lowering non-fuel emissions. A low carbon fuel standard aims to reduce carbon content in fuels by using direct substitutes or blending components with lower carbon content, such as biofuels with lower greenhouse gas emissions. The carbon intensity of fuels can be reduced by blending biofuels with lower greenhouse gas emissions or switching to alternative fuels like natural gas, hydrogen, or electricity. It is important to consider the full lifecycle emissions of replacement fuels to avoid simply shifting emissions to another location. Direct and indirect emissions from every step in the production process and use of a fuel should be taken into account to accurately assess emissions. The lifecycle emissions of different fuels vary, with potential emissions coming from various stages such as extraction, refining, distribution, and combustion. Coal and petroleum fuels have emissions from mining, transport, and burning. Wind electricity emissions are minimal but include turbine production. Biofuels have complex lifecycles with emissions from fertilizer production, farming, refining, distribution, and combustion, which may be offset by plant growth. Indirect emissions are a key consideration. The effect of indirect emissions from changes in current practices, such as increased biofuel use leading to changes in crop production, is a key question in developing a low carbon fuel standard. Valuing emissions from each step in a fuel's lifecycle, especially regarding biofuels, remains a challenge with little consensus. California's AB32 requires the consideration of emissions from land use change, including indirect changes, by the California Air Resources Board. The California Air Resources Board (ARB) under the California Environmental Protection Agency (Cal-EPA) is mandated to adopt rules for maximum greenhouse gas emission reductions. Governor Schwarzenegger's executive order in 2007 directed Cal-EPA to establish a low carbon fuel standard, aiming for a 10% reduction in transportation fuel carbon intensity by 2020. ARB released draft regulations in 2008, with plans to implement the rule by 2010, requiring fuel providers to meet average GHG emissions levels. The draft rule by the California Air Resources Board (ARB) sets average GHG emissions levels for fuel providers, with decreasing levels each year. Two average requirements are established for gasoline and diesel fuel, with credits generated for over-compliance that can be used, banked, or traded. Fuel volumes are converted into gasoline gallon equivalents for comparison. The draft regulation by the California Air Resources Board (ARB) sets average GHG emissions levels for fuel providers, with decreasing levels each year. Fuel providers can calculate a fuel's carbon intensity using values provided by ARB in a lookup table. The lookup table allows providers to determine their specific fuel's carbon intensity based on production location and method. The California Air Resources Board (ARB) draft regulation sets GHG emissions levels for fuel providers, with decreasing levels each year. Fuel providers can calculate carbon intensity using ARB's lookup table based on production location and method. Key determinations needed include energy content, carbon intensity for each fuel, \"energy economy ratios,\" and baseline carbon intensity levels for the 10% reduction by 2020. LCFS likely promotes biofuels blended into gasoline and diesel, but baseline and carbon intensity values will impact biofuel's role. The 2010 baseline for the rule will likely incorporate the fact that most of California's gasoline is expected to be E10 (90% gasoline and 10% ethanol). Fuel providers face a \"blend wall\" limiting ethanol content to 10% due to EPA regulations, motor vehicle warranties, and manufacturers' limits on ethanol content. In the short term, conventional corn ethanol may need to be replaced by lower lifecycle emissions ethanol to meet a 10% reduction. Cellulosic ethanol from feedstocks like grasses and trees could have lower GHG emissions than gasoline, but uncertainties exist. Biodiesel or renewable diesel could be blended with diesel to reduce carbon, but current supply is limited. The LCFS aims to promote various alternative fuels like natural gas, electricity, and hydrogen to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It could lead to significant reductions in emissions, especially with renewable electricity. The use of fuel cell vehicles and hydrogen fuel may also be encouraged. The University of California, Davis study on California's LCFS found a 10 percent reduction in carbon intensity of transportation fuels by 2020 to be achievable. Barriers include limited supply of low-carbon fuels, infrastructure constraints, and a need for more vehicles for long-term solutions like hydrogen or electricity. One solution is blending ethanol into gasoline to reduce carbon content. The carbon content of gasoline can be reduced by blending ethanol into all gasoline. However, the E10 blend wall may limit the ability to blend additional ethanol. Two remedies are to petition the EPA to increase the ethanol limit beyond 10% or replace corn-based ethanol with lower carbon intensity sources like Brazilian sugar or cellulose. Promoting the use of E85 in flexible fuel vehicles is another option, but FFVs are a small fraction of vehicles. The use of E85 in flexible fuel vehicles (FFVs) is limited in California due to low penetration of FFVs and lack of E85 stations. Increasing FFV penetration and E85 usage, expanding E85 refueling infrastructure, and addressing barriers like rail/port capacity and storage systems are necessary for E85 to play a significant role in the LCFS. Limited availability of electric vehicles is a key barrier to meeting California's LCFS goals. The limited availability of electric vehicles is a key barrier to meeting California's LCFS goals. Currently, only Tesla Motors produces highway-capable electric vehicles, with most electric vehicles in service being neighborhood electric vehicles. To have a significant impact on the LCFS, the number of electric vehicles and charging infrastructure would need to grow significantly. While electric vehicles could be part of a multi-fuel strategy, they alone may not lead to the necessary 10% reduction by 2020. In the 110th Congress, several bills were introduced to establish a low carbon fuel standard similar to California's. Key differences among these bills included the stringency of emissions reduction, timeframe, and fuels covered by the program. The proposed national low carbon fuel standard would require deeper emissions cuts earlier and cover more fuels than California's program. Unlike California's program, a national standard would apply nationwide, limiting the option of fuel shifting to meet demand. Domestic production and imports would need to increase to meet the mandate, or national consumption of conventional fuels would need to decrease to comply with the averaging requirement. Under a 10% national standard in 2020, there would not be enough low-carbon fuel to offset total fuel demand, leading to a dramatic drop in transportation fuel consumption and a 140% increase in motor fuel prices. However, introducing more cellulosic biofuel and electricity in later years helped mitigate the price effect. Establishing a federal LCFS before the fuel is readily available could have disruptive effects on the fuel supply, with proposals having later time frames likely being less disruptive. The federal LCFS would also impact other federal environmental programs. The potential implementation of a federal Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) would have implications for existing federal environmental programs, particularly the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and future greenhouse gas control programs. The RFS, established by the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and expanded by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, mandates the blending of biofuels in transportation fuels, with a focus on advanced biofuels with lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. The potential implementation of a federal Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) would impact existing federal environmental programs, particularly the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). The LCFS focuses on advanced biofuels with lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions, including specific carve-outs for cellulosic biofuel and bio-based diesel substitutes. The EPA has not yet detailed which fuels will qualify or the methodology for calculating lifecycle emissions, which could complicate compliance with both the RFS and LCFS. Several proposals aim to align the LCFS requirements with the Clean Air Act. Several bills in the 110th Congress aimed to align the Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) requirements with the Clean Air Act. Some proposed adding new sections to Title II or establishing a new Title VII of the Clean Air Act, which would impact the linkage between the LCFS and the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). In the 110th Congress, bills proposed cap-and-trade measures with some including an LCFS (S. 2191, S. 3036, and S.Amdt. 4825). The interaction between an LCFS and cap-and-trade system was a key question, with no direct link between the two programs. This lack of linkage could lead to double regulation for fuel suppliers. The establishment of a low carbon fuel standard could significantly impact fuel supplies and prices. Future proposals may allow flexibility by using cap-and-trade credits for compliance. Details of any program, including stringency, scope, and flexibility, would determine effects on fuel markets and emissions. California has released drafts of possible regulations for its program, which could inform federal policymakers. A federal program would likely impact the fuel system nationwide in unique ways. A low carbon fuel standard could impact fuel supplies and prices. If more low-carbon fuel is needed, supply can be shifted from other parts of the country. Higher production or imports would be necessary nationwide. If the requirements exceed supply, conventional fuel supply would need to be reduced or the program delayed. Later time frames for proposals would be less disruptive to fuel supply."
