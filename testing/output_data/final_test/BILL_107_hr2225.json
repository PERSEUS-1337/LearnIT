    "content": "The Act titled \"Federal Election Law Integrity Act of 2001\" is also known as the \"Federal Election Law Integrity Act\". Congress clarifies that foreign nationals are prohibited from making political contributions in the United States under the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971. The United States District Court dismissed parts of a criminal indictment against Yah Lin Trie, questioning the prohibition on political contributions by foreign nationals to political party accounts. Congress aims to reaffirm the prohibition under the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971. Congress and this Act reaffirm that foreign nationals cannot donate money or anything of value to US candidates, political committees, or party accounts, directly or indirectly, regardless of any election connection. SEC. 3. PROHIBITION OF CERTAIN ELECTION-RELATED ACTIVITIES BY FOREIGN NATIONALS. Section 319 of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 prohibits foreign nationals from making contributions or donations to any candidate, political committee, or organization controlled by a US political party or candidate. This includes contributions related to elections, primaries, conventions, or caucuses. It is unlawful for any person organized under US laws to make contributions to political candidates or committees unless the funds are from their own US business activities. Foreign nationals are prohibited from influencing decision-making processes in political contributions. Individuals cannot participate in decision-making processes related to political committees, contributions to candidates, or donations to political parties if they are organized under US laws. However, eligible voters can still make contributions to support candidates for federal elections. The term 'donation' refers to money or any other valuable item given to a candidate, political committee, or organization by an individual eligible to vote in a federal election."
