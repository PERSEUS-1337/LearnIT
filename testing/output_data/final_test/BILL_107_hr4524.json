    "content": "The \"Debt Relief Enhancement Act of 2002\" may be cited as the official title of the Act. It includes modifications to the Enhanced HIPC Initiative. The Debt Relief Enhancement Act of 2002, also known as the Enhanced HIPC Initiative, aims to reduce the debt stock of eligible countries to 150% of their annual exports and lower annual debt payments. The Debt Relief Enhancement Act of 2002 limits annual debt payments to 10% of a country's current revenues, or 5% in the case of a severe public health crisis. Definitions include the Enhanced HIPC Initiative and Decision Point. The term \"Decision Point\" refers to when the Executive Boards of the International Bank for Reconstruction and the IMF review a country's debt sustainability analysis for eligibility for debt relief under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative. A country is considered to have a \"public health crisis\" if it has a high HIV/AIDS infection rate or is experiencing a health crisis. A country is considered to have a \"public health crisis\" if it is experiencing a health crisis or epidemic as defined by the World Health Organization. SEC. 3. REPORT ON EXPANSION OF DEBT RELIEF TO NON-HIPC COUNTRIES. Within 90 days of this Act's enactment, the Treasury Secretary must report to Congress on expanding debt relief to poor countries not covered by the Enhanced HIPC Initiative. The report should include options for burden-sharing among donor countries and institutions, as well as additional measures for debt sustainability in cases of economic shocks or natural disasters. Expansion of debt relief should consider including poor countries with outstanding debt that requires annual payments exceeding 10% of their annual revenues from internal sources. DEBT RELIEF FOR THE POOREST COUNTRIES. The President has the authority to reduce debts owed by eligible countries to the United States or its agencies, including guarantees, credits, and obligations related to agricultural commodity purchases. This authority is limited to implementing multilateral official debt relief. The President can reduce debts owed by eligible countries through multilateral official debt relief agreements known as \"Paris Club Agreed Minutes.\" This authority is subject to limitations on amounts and eligibility criteria, such as heavy debt burdens and eligibility for borrowing from the International Development Association. Additionally, countries must meet conditions related to military expenditures and support for terrorism to qualify for debt relief. The United States requires countries to meet specific criteria to qualify for debt relief, including cooperation on international terrorism and narcotics control, no gross human rights violations, no ineligibility under section 527 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, and not being designated as a 'Tier 3' nation in the Trafficking in Persons Report. The authority for debt reduction is contingent on eligible countries agreeing to allocate financial benefits towards combating HIV/AIDS and poverty, improving basic services, and addressing environmental degradation. Additionally, the debt reduction benefits must supplement the country's existing spending on poverty reduction. The authority for debt reduction requires eligible countries to implement transparent policy making, good governance, anti-corruption measures, and promote public participation in poverty reduction. The funds can only be used from appropriations for foreign operations and related programs under the \"Debt Restructuring\" heading. This debt reduction is not considered assistance under any law limiting aid to a country. The authority provided by subsection (a) can be exercised despite certain sections of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and the International Development and Food Assistance Act of 1975. SEC. 5. Modification of determination of countries supporting terrorism under certain international affairs laws. The text chunk discusses amendments to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and the Arms Export Control Act related to cooperation with the United States on combating international terrorism.

Amendments to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and the Arms Export Control Act now mandate cooperation with the United States in combating international terrorism. Amendments to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and the Arms Export Control Act now require cooperation with the United States in combating international terrorism, including the transfer of chemical or biological weapons by foreign persons."
