The \"Supporting Success for High Need Students Act of 2003\" defines terms like average per-pupil expenditure and high need child, and authorizes a grant program for children with disabilities costing more than 4 times the average per-pupil expenditure. The \"Supporting Success for High Need Students Act of 2003\" authorizes a grant program to assist children with disabilities on reservations who require a free appropriate public education costing more than 4 times the national average per-pupil expenditure. The \"Supporting Success for High Need Students Act of 2003\" authorizes grants to State educational agencies to establish high cost funds for providing free appropriate public education to high need children with disabilities. The Secretary shall allot funds to each State based on the amount received under section 611 for the fiscal year. Each State educational agency receiving a grant under the \"Supporting Success for High Need Students Act of 2003\" must establish a high cost fund and disburse funds to local educational agencies to cover a percentage of the costs of providing education to high need children with disabilities. The \"Supporting Success for High Need Students Act of 2003\" requires State educational agencies to establish a high cost fund to cover a percentage of the costs of providing education to high need children with disabilities. Local educational agencies must submit an application to the State educational agency to receive disbursements for the costs of providing a free appropriate public education to high need children. The \"Supporting Success for High Need Students Act of 2003\" requires local educational agencies to submit an application to the State educational agency for disbursements to cover the costs of providing a free appropriate public education to high need children with disabilities. The application must include the IEP for each high need child and assurances that grant funds will not be used for reimbursable medical costs. The \"Supporting Success for High Need Students Act of 2003\" requires State educational agencies to disburse funds to local educational agencies for providing education to children with disabilities, covering costs exceeding 4 times the average per-pupil expenditure. The State determines the funding for educating high need children based on the lower average per-pupil expenditure. Costs are only for special education and related services in the child's IEP. State educational agencies can disallow certain payments. The State educational agency may disallow certain costs if they are deemed inappropriate or unnecessary excess costs for providing a free appropriate public education to high need children. Legal fees and other associated costs for legal actions are not included in the costs for providing education to high need children. State educational agency may disburse remaining high cost fund funds to local educational agencies for serving children with disabilities who moved into the area after the school year started and to compensate agencies exceeding a set threshold on costs for providing free appropriate public education to all children. The State educational agency can use up to 2 percent of funds for administrative costs. The section ensures that children with disabilities receive a free appropriate public education without limitations. The Secretary evaluates high cost funds for children with disabilities and submits a report to Congress. Funds must supplement, not supplant, other available federal, state, and local funds for education. Grant funds cannot be used for Medicaid services. The State Medicaid program under title XIX of the Social Security Act is authorized to receive $750,000,000 for fiscal year 2004 and additional funds for each following year."
