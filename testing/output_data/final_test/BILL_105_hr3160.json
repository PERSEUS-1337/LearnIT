    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Airline Competition and Lower Fares Act\" and includes provisions for the withdrawal of slots. The \"Airline Competition and Lower Fares Act\" requires the Secretary to determine if the demand for airport slots can be met. If not, slots will be withdrawn from dominant carriers for redistribution. The Secretary must issue a written determination every 2 years on whether redistributing additional airport slots would increase competition between air carriers. If so, slots must be withdrawn to ensure competition, following relevant laws and regulations. Limitation on Slot Withdrawals: The Secretary is restricted from withdrawing more than 10% of slots held by a dominant carrier for auction in initial auctions and 5% in subsequent auctions under relevant laws and regulations. Slots used for direct flights to low-competition airports are not included in the calculation. The Secretary cannot withdraw slots from a dominant carrier for redistribution if they have been used for direct flights to low-competition airports for at least 24 of the last 30 months. International flight slots cannot be withdrawn. SEC. 3. AUCTIONS. After withdrawing slots, the Secretary auctions them to new entrants and limited incumbents, awarding each slot to the highest bidder. 40% of redistributed slots at LaGuardia, O'Hare, and Metropolitan Washington Airports, and 10% at JFK Airport, are allocated for flights to low-competition airports. Eligible bidders can only participate if they meet certain criteria. To participate in an auction for redistributed airport slots, a person must be a new entrant or limited incumbent, a US citizen or entity, hold safety certification from the FAA, economic certification from the DOT, not have declined eligible slots before 1986, not be controlled by an ineligible person, and be qualified to use a purchased slot. The Secretary determines qualification to use a purchased slot. Slots obtained at auction can only be transferred to new entrants or limited incumbents meeting requirements. Ownership changes may result in slot reverting to Secretary, unless in the best interest of competition. Competitive bidding does not alter slot allocation criteria. The Secretary can use auction funds to reimburse dominant carriers for investments in withdrawn slots and airport improvements. Any remaining funds will be credited to the general fund of the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. SEC. 4. SLOTS NOT ASSETS. A slot obtained under this Act or any other provision of law shall not be considered an asset for any purpose, including for collateral, forfeiture, or in bankruptcy. This does not apply to agreements in effect before the enactment of this Act. SEC. 5. UNFAIR COMPETITION. The Secretary must address complaints of predatory practices by air carriers filed before and after December 31, 1997, within specified timeframes after the enactment of the Act. The Secretary must address complaints of predatory practices by air carriers within specific timeframes after the enactment of the Act, including making initial findings, issuing restraining orders, reporting to Congress, and establishing guidelines. The Secretary, in consultation with the Attorney General, must issue guidelines defining predatory and unfair competition practices within 6 months of the Act's enactment. SEC. 6. ACCESS TO FACILITIES: The Secretary must ensure new entrants have access to airport facilities at fees comparable to incumbents. SEC. 7. EVALUATION OF RULE: A rulemaking proceeding will determine the impact of the 80-percent rule on airline competition. SEC. 8. LIMITS ON COMPETITION: The Secretary will report to Congress on barriers to entry and limits on competition in the aviation industry. SEC. 9. PROHIBITION ON INCREASED NOISE. SEC. 9. PROHIBITION ON INCREASED NOISE. The Secretary shall issue regulations to carry out this Act without increasing airplane noise in surrounding communities. SEC. 10. CLARIFICATION OF LEGAL STANDING. Section 41713(b) of title 49, United States Code, is amended to allow private parties to bring causes of action against air carriers under state common law or statutes. SEC. 11. DEFINITIONS. For the purposes of this Act, definitions include: dominant carrier (holding 10% or more of airport slots), limited incumbent (operating fewer than 12 slots at an airport), new entrant (no previous slot ownership), person (including commuter operators), and Secretary (referring to the Secretary of Transportation). The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Transportation. A \"slot\" is the operational authority for one landing or takeoff per day at specific airports. A \"low-competition airport\" is one that is not a large hub and has significantly less service or higher airfares, as determined by the Secretary."
