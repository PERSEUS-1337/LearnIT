The ongoing panzootic of highly pathogenic avian influenza strain H5N1 in Asia and Eurasia poses a threat to global human health and the poultry industry. The virus can cause massive avian die-offs, leading to the culling of millions of domestic poultry and significant economic losses. The fatality rate in humans can be as high as 50 percent. Recent outbreaks in 2005 suggest that the virus may spread throughout central and southern Asia, Europe, Africa, and potentially reach North America. The 1918 pandemic, the most lethal of the 3 pandemics, killed over 40,000,000 people worldwide. It was caused by an influenza virus that jumped directly from birds to humans and evolved to transmit from human-to-human. This raises concerns about the current H5N1 influenza strain. Increased surveillance, including on migratory birds, is crucial for controlling avian influenza. The capacity to proactively detect threats could significantly improve disease prediction and prevention capabilities. International wildlife health surveillance lacks clear jurisdiction. There is a need to share real-time data on zoonotic threats across various agencies. Surveillance in wild bird populations exposed to the virus is critical for controlling its spread and protecting human, livestock, and wildlife. Improving surveillance of wildlife health globally is crucial for identifying all strains of influenza viruses in wild birds, determining their role in virus spread, and enhancing preparedness for potential outbreaks. This would help close significant jurisdictional and scientific gaps in current global influenza preparedness efforts. The purpose of improving surveillance of wildlife health globally is to identify all strains of influenza viruses in wild birds, determine their role in virus spread, and enhance preparedness for potential outbreaks. This would help close significant jurisdictional and scientific gaps in current global influenza preparedness efforts. The Global Network for Avian Influenza Surveillance aims to rapidly detect and report infectious diseases in migratory birds and waterfowl worldwide. It utilizes viral strain information to track mutations, guide preparedness efforts, and conduct comprehensive disease surveillance initiatives. The disease surveillance initiative aims to provide early warning information for targeting resources towards enhancing poultry biosecurity, public health vigilance, and protecting the health, safety, and economic interests of the United States and its partners. An open access database will share information on HPAI and other pathogens identified in migratory birds in real-time. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"eligible organization\" refers to a US wildlife conservation group with global experience in tracking avian diseases, identifying avian influenza, and accredited zoological facilities. \"GNAIS\" stands for Global Network for Avian Influenza Surveillance, and \"GNAIS partners\" are its described partners. \"HPAI\" stands for highly pathogenic avian influenza. The term \"HPAI\" refers to highly pathogenic avian influenza. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Influenza Branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in partnership with an eligible organization. Global network for avian influenza surveillance. The Secretary will establish a Global Network for Avian Influenza Surveillance in collaboration with eligible organizations and federal and state agencies, including the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior. The eligible organization will collaborate with various partners including State wildlife agencies, multilateral agencies like the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization, conservation organizations, veterinary colleges, and other national and international partners for international surveillance of avian influenza. The international surveillance program managed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention involves monitoring for avian influenza and other bird pathogens at key locations globally. Trained professionals collect samples for testing and send them to diagnostic centers. The program also conducts disease surveillance on migratory birds, field investigations, and capacity-building activities in partnership with relevant agencies and organizations. Research on detection and surveillance of HPAI and other pathogens in migratory birds is conducted through training activities. Samples are sent to certified laboratories meeting international standards for testing. The eligible organization, along with GNAIS partners, shall transmit information on avian influenza to the Secretary. The Secretary will use surveillance reports for administration. The organization will use surveillance reports and other sources to investigate local avian influenza outbreaks, develop regional data on HPAI and migratory bird pathogens, provide technical assistance for disease prevention programs, and regularly report analytical findings to the CDC's Influenza Branch. The organization, in collaboration with federal partners, conducts activities to prevent and combat human diseases, supports the GNAIS network, and coordinates surveillance results. The Secretary manages a database providing geographic data on wild bird populations, movements, and laboratory test results. The Secretary oversees a database with wild bird population data and laboratory test results. Accredited colleges and GNAIS partners are trained to monitor bird areas globally and test for avian diseases. Authorization of appropriations for $10,000,000 annually from 2006 to 2010 is provided to carry out the Act."
