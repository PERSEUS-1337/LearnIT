    "content": "A presidential transition involves the transfer of executive power from the incumbent President to the successor, starting with pre-election planning and culminating in the inauguration day. It includes vetting candidates, familiarizing the incoming Administration with operations, and developing a policy platform. The importance of a well-organized transition was highlighted after the 9/11 attacks. The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs emphasized the significance of presidential transition planning in preventing security vulnerabilities. Historically, presidential transitions lacked advance planning and cooperation, with little interaction between incoming and outgoing administrations. Presidential candidates have typically avoided pre-election transition activities. The reluctance to start transition activities before the general election is due to concerns about appearing presumptuous and potentially facing backlash. Stakeholders now recognize the importance of a well-planned transition for a new Administration to govern effectively on inauguration day. The limited time between the election and inauguration necessitates pre-election planning to accomplish necessary tasks. The Presidential Transition Act of 1963 and subsequent amendments aimed to facilitate presidential transitions by providing services and facilities to transition teams and legitimizing pre-election planning by candidates. The legislation encourages candidates to start transition planning before the election to ensure a successful transition process. The Presidential Transition Act of 1963 and subsequent amendments authorize pre-election transition support for eligible candidates, establish transition coordinating councils, and provide facilities and services to the incoming Administration. This commitment underscores the importance of a successful transition for the continuity of government operations and prepares the new Administration to govern effectively. The transition to a new Administration involves appointing over 4,000 positions, managing a $4 trillion budget, and overseeing 2 million civilian employees across diverse missions. The complexity of the federal government is evident in the numerous agencies and departments responsible for various functions and programs. In 2008, 7,854 positions were to be filled by the President, highlighting the staffing needs of the new Administration. In 2008, 7,854 positions were to be filled by the President and the White House staff, including presidential appointees, federal judicial appointees, White House staff positions, and noncareer Senior Executive Service and Schedule C positions. National security was a key issue during the presidential transition, with concerns about terrorist attacks leading up to the 2009 inauguration of Barack Obama. The FBI briefed senior officials on a possible attack on the National Mall during the ceremony, although an attack did not occur. The 2009 inauguration of Barack Obama faced a possible attack on the National Mall, highlighting the need for preparedness during presidential transitions. Amendments to the Presidential Transition Act aimed to enhance readiness for transition-related incidents and ensure immediate national security responsibility for the incoming Administration. The most recent amendment, P.L. 114-136, mandated the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit reports. The recent amendment to the PTA, P.L. 114-136, requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit a report on threats and vulnerabilities facing the United States during a presidential transition. Another amendment mandates government officials to provide a summary of specific operational threats to national security to the President-elect. The period between election day and inauguration day is seen as a time when a lame duck President may accomplish little. During the 11 weeks between election day and inauguration day, outgoing presidents have the power to unilaterally set public policy through various directives. The level of activity during this time is influenced by the party of the successor. During the last one hundred days of a presidential administration, the sitting President may use their powers vigorously to shape public policy before the inauguration of the new President. This period of transition allows the incumbent to enact policies that could hinder their successor. This practice has been observed since Theodore Roosevelt's presidency in the 20th century. Since Theodore Roosevelt in 1901, there have been 18 presidential transitions, with 11 being interparty transitions. Presidents like Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Barack Obama have replaced Presidents from another party. The decisions and actions of an incumbent President can impact their successor, causing congressional concern. A President can issue executive orders, make appointments without Senate confirmation, and influence policies during the transition period. During the presidential transition period, the outgoing Administration can influence agency rulemaking, make significant decisions on records, and convert political appointees to civil service positions. This could force the incoming President to either accept objectionable policies or face political consequences for changing them. The new President and staff must also address actions taken by the previous Administration. The transition period for a new President involves challenges like staffing, agenda setting, and policy formulation. The incoming President can use tools like executive orders and political appointments to establish their policy agenda and potentially change their predecessor's policies. Additionally, dealing with budget submission is a crucial task during this period. The transition period for the President-elect is crucial for their success in office. Congress plays a role in confirming appointees, budget processes, and oversight of agency rulemaking. Other activities like executive orders and pardons may also be of interest to Congress. During the presidential transition period, congressional oversight may be required for issues such as personnel conversions, government records, executive clemency, cybersecurity, and national security. Additionally, agency rulemaking, executive branch appointments, judicial branch appointments, executive orders, and the President's budget are areas of interest that span both outgoing and incoming administrations. Some appointed individuals may transition to career positions within the executive branch. During the presidential transition period, congressional oversight may be required for personnel conversions to career positions in the competitive service, the Senior Executive Service (SES), or the excepted service. This practice, known as \"burrowing in,\" is allowed when following laws and regulations. Conversions often occur when one administration is leaving office and another is preparing to take over. Appointees are typically selected noncompetitively for positions like Schedule C, noncareer SES, or limited tenure SES, involving policy decisions or close relationships with top officials. Salaries range from GS-12 to GS-15 for Schedule C appointees and are based on the senior executive pay schedule for noncareer and limited tenure SES members. In 2007, Paul Light, a professor at New York University, highlighted the pay, benefits, and job security of career positions as reasons for individuals in noncareer positions to \"burrow in.\" Career employees are selected based on merit and without political influence, with a workforce that continues operations regardless of administration changes. Noncareer employees serve at the pleasure of the appointing authority or for the term of the Administration. When individuals in noncareer positions \"burrow in\" by converting to career positions, it may limit opportunities for other employees and create tension between noncareer and career staff. This practice may also raise concerns about undermining the work of the new Administration. The tension between noncareer and career staff may hinder government operations, which rely on career staff for continuity and expertise. Effective working relationships between noncareer and career staff are crucial, as highlighted by the Senior Executives Association. An effective relationship between political appointees and career executives is key for carrying out new initiatives and reforms. The webinar series provides guidance for career senior executives on managing the transition to a new administration. Appointments to career positions in the executive branch must adhere to strict procedures and regulations outlined in Title 5 of the United States Code and Title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Department and agency heads are responsible for preventing prohibited personnel practices and ensuring compliance with civil service laws and regulations. Actions must align with the 9 merit principles and 13 prohibited personnel practices. The 9 merit principles and 13 prohibited personnel practices outlined in Title 5 of the United States Code and Code of Federal Regulations ensure fair and open selection of career employees, free from political influence. Department and agency heads must follow regulations governing career appointments, including Civil Service Rules prohibiting discrimination and addressing appointing officer's discretion in filling vacancies. OPM approval is required for Schedule C employees to be detailed to competitive service positions, and public announcement is required for SES vacancies filled by initial career appointment. During the Presidential Election Period from June 1, 2016, to January 20, 2017, certain appointees, such as noncareer SES, Schedule C employees, and limited-term positions, are prohibited from receiving financial awards. Career-Reserved SES positions can only be filled by career employees. Conversion of noncareer positions to career positions without changes in duties or tailored positions to individual experience is monitored. OPM and GAO oversee conversions of employees from noncareer to career positions to ensure proper procedures are followed. OPM's policies require approval for selecting political appointees for competitive service positions during a Presidential election year. In a significant policy change effective January 1, 2010, departments and agencies must now seek prior approval from OPM before appointing current or recent political appointees to competitive or non-political excepted service positions at any level. Written authorization from OPM is required for such appointments. In a policy change effective January 1, 2010, departments and agencies must now seek prior approval from OPM before appointing current or recent political appointees to competitive or non-political excepted service positions. OPM will conduct merit staffing reviews for proposed career SES selections involving political appointees before certification of executive qualifications. OPM Director John Berry delegated decision-making authority over policy changes to career Senior Executives to avoid political influence. Pre-Appointment Checklists were included in the memorandum for Competitive Service and Non-Political Excepted Service Positions. OPM reminded departments and agencies of this policy in a memorandum issued on January 11, 2016. OPM issued a policy cautioning against creating vacancies for political appointees and removing Schedule C or Noncareer SES elements for appointments. The January 2016 memorandum reiterated policies from November 2009 and referenced the Presidential Transition Guide for guidance on ethical conduct and appointments. Additionally, P.L. 114-136 requires the OPM Director to adhere to specific guidelines. The Transitions Improvement Act of 2015 mandates the OPM Director to provide annual reports to specific committees on requests for political appointees in civil service positions. Quarterly reports are required in the last term of a President, with the option to exclude names if deemed appropriate. The OPM Director provides annual reports on requests for political appointees in civil service positions, with quarterly reports required in the last term of a President. The GAO oversees conversions from political to career positions, with the most recent evaluation covering the period from January 1, 2010, to October 1, 2015, at 30 agencies. The evaluation of conversions from political to career positions at various government agencies found that individuals were converted from noncareer positions to career positions in different categories. Some agencies converted political appointees to career positions without obtaining prior approval from OPM due to difficulties. Congress monitors conversions of employees from noncareer to career positions, especially before and after presidential elections. Oversight includes collecting information on conversions from appointed positions to career positions. Representative Ken Buck introduced H.R. 1132, the Political Appointee Burrowing Prevention Act, to address this issue. The Appointee Burrowing Prevention Act aims to prevent certain appointees in non-career positions from moving into career Civil Service roles for two years. This is to maintain merit-based hiring standards in the federal civil service. Representative Jason Chaffetz requested information on job openings and hiring practices from various government agencies in January 2017. Representative Chaffetz raised concerns about the acceleration of civil service hiring and compressed timelines in anticipation of a possible hiring freeze in 2017. He emphasized the importance of legitimate, justified hiring decisions free from political influence. Senator Ron Johnson and Senator Thom Tillis urged President Obama to consider implementing a hiring freeze on career civil servant positions. Senator Ron Johnson and Senator Thom Tillis urged President Obama to implement a hiring freeze on career civil servant positions, except for those related to public health or safety, until the end of his term. They expressed concerns about unfair practices and the potential for federal workers to undermine new policies. Senator Johnson previously requested a list of federal employees who converted from political appointments to career positions. Senator Ron Johnson and Senator Thom Tillis urged President Obama to implement a hiring freeze on career civil servant positions, except for those related to public health or safety, until the end of his term. They expressed concerns about unfair practices and the potential for federal workers to undermine new policies. Additionally, Senator Orrin Hatch and Representative Kevin Brady requested information on personnel conversions of noncareer employees to career or non-political excepted service positions within various government agencies. The GAO was requested to review political appointee conversions to career federal civil service positions from June 1, 2009, through October 1, 2015 by four Members of Congress. The GAO was asked to review political appointee conversions to civil service positions from June 1, 2009, through October 1, 2015. The review was requested by four Members of Congress who were concerned about the integrity of the merit-based federal workforce. Timothy Dirks, interim president of the Senior Executives Association, commended the Senators for requesting the review, expressing particular concern about political appointees \"burrowing in\" to SES and equivalent positions. SEA is concerned about political appointees \"burrowing in\" to SES and equivalent positions, potentially leading to non-meritorious selections due to limited competitive areas of consideration and political influence. Upon publication of GAO's September 30, 2016 findings, Representatives Upton and Chaffetz and Senators Thune and Johnson issued a joint press release on October 6, 2016, expressing concern about political appointees \"burrowing\" into the executive branch without following proper rules and procedures. They emphasized the need for hiring decisions to be free from political interference and justified. Chaffetz, Thune, and Johnson expressed concerns about political appointees \"burrowing\" into the executive branch without following proper rules and procedures. They emphasized the importance of fair and open competition in federal workforce hiring to prevent cronyism and political favoritism. The Department of Homeland Security reported the highest number of appointee-to-career employee conversions, prompting calls for the administration to ensure fairness and competition in federal service. Congress may need to assess the current oversight situation. Congress may need to assess the current oversight situation regarding conversions from appointed to career positions. OPM could be directed to report on its policy governing pre-appointment reviews, and Congress could consider amending relevant laws. Additionally, Congress could review restrictions on financial awards to senior politically appointed officers during the Presidential Election Period. Congress could consider increasing penalties for violating civil service laws and amending Title 5 of the United States Code to address issues with conversions from political to career positions. Training for federal managers and supervisors on OPM's policy could be provided to prevent unauthorized conversions. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs continue to show interest in this matter. Congress could consider directing OPM to provide standardized reports on conversions from appointed to career positions, ensuring easy access to government records of long-term interest to various stakeholders. The laws and policies governing agency federal records and presidential records are outlined, with unique requirements for each type of record under the Federal Records Act. The Federal Records Act outlines unique requirements for federal agency records, presidential records, Congress records, and Supreme Court records. The Archivist of the United States oversees the management of government records. Concerns arise during presidential transitions about potential loss or improper destruction of records, especially with the increasing number of platforms for record creation and storage volume. The Federal Records Act outlines requirements for federal agency records, presidential records, Congress records, and Supreme Court records. Concerns arise during presidential transitions about potential loss or improper destruction of records due to the increasing storage volume. Changes since 2009 include a new definition of federal records and policy documents instructing agencies on recordkeeping requirements. The updated definition of federal records, as amended in 2014, includes all recorded information made or received by a Federal agency under Federal law for preservation as evidence of the organization, functions, policies. The amended definition of federal records under the Federal Records Act emphasizes the importance of the actual information being stored, regardless of form or characteristic. This shift moves away from focusing on the physical media used to store information. Federal agency staff must ensure that records meeting this new definition are captured and retained as necessary. The transition to a new President does not directly impact the collection and retention of federal records at executive branch agencies. Political appointees must ensure proper management and preservation of federal records created during their tenure. The Federal Records Act applies to all information generated by political appointees in federal agencies. The Obama Administration used a variety of electronic platforms for record-keeping, making collection and retention more complex. Various records collection and retention guidance were issued during this time, including the 2012 \"Managing Government Records Directive.\" Federal agencies must apply NARA's records management guidance to both existing and new federal records. The 2012 \"Managing Government Records Directive\" by the Obama Administration required executive branch agencies to manage email records electronically by 2016 and permanent electronic records by 2019. The directive also urged collaboration with private industry for automated records management solutions. GAO reported in 2015 that 5 out of 24 agencies had not met the directive's requirements. NARA introduced the Capstone approach in 2013 to help agencies meet the email management deadline. NARA introduced the Capstone approach in 2013 to help agencies manage email collection and retention based on the email account holder. This approach involves treating senior agency officials' emails as permanent records, while other employee email accounts generate temporary records for a set period, such as seven years. NARA also released guidance on unlawful record removal, social media records management, and email records management in 2013 and 2014. Additionally, NARA issues bulletins to remind agency heads of regulations on proper records management during presidential election years. The 2008 bulletin provided guidance on the removal of records by departing officials, emphasizing the need to follow agency requirements for restricted materials. It also outlined criminal penalties for unauthorized removal or destruction of federal records. NARA re-issued its guidance in February 2016. In February 2016, NARA re-issued guidance on managing federal records, emphasizing the importance of employees' responsibilities. The Presidential Records Act of 1978 changed the ownership of presidential records, making them government property transferred to the Archivist after a President leaves office. The Presidential Records Act of 1978 changed the ownership of presidential records, making them government property transferred to the Archivist after a President leaves office. Incumbent Presidents are responsible for managing their records during their Administrations, with NARA working with various White House offices to coordinate the transfer of records and artifacts. The Presidential Records Act of 1978 defines presidential records and materials for transfer to NARA, including various types of documents and recordings. It also acknowledges the President's privilege to exercise discretion over these records. The Presidential Records Act of 1978 acknowledges the President's privilege to exercise discretion over records. The Executive Office of the President requested funds for data migration services and transition-related expenses. The Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014 clarified certain provisions of the PRA. The Presidential Records Act of 1978 allows the President to review records before public release. The law also requires any claim of executive privilege to be made by the incumbent or former President. Additionally, P.L. 113-187 prohibits individuals convicted of mishandling NARA records from accessing presidential records. NARA receives presidential records at the end of each Administration, tracking the increasing volume and electronic formats used. In June 2010, GAO testified to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform about the challenges of managing electronic records. The increasing volume of electronic information poses a significant technical challenge for record management. For example, the Bush administration transferred 77 terabytes of data to NARA, which was 35 times more than the Clinton administration. The NARA blog post in April 2013 detailed the records transferred to the George W. Bush Library, including millions of pages of textual records, artifacts, emails, and digital photographs. NARA is responsible for preserving records of former Presidents, working with them to capture social media content. Archivist David Ferriero mentioned the complexity of transferring electronic records in a 2015 blog post about the Barack Obama Presidential Library. The transfer of electronic records during presidential transitions is complex due to the increasing volume and variety of records. The President has the authority to grant executive clemency, including pardons, commutations, remissions, and reprieves, with few restrictions on its exercise. The President has broad authority to grant executive clemency, including pardons, even before charges are filed. Presidents historically increase clemency grants in the final months of their term. President Lincoln pardoned all involved in the rebellion against the US. In the final months of an Administration, controversial acts of clemency may be granted, potentially impeding ongoing investigations into executive branch officials. President G.H.W. Bush's pardon of key figures in the Iran-Contra affair and President Clinton's pardon of commodities trader Marc Rich are examples of such actions. These pardons can effectively end criminal investigations, as seen in the case of President G.H.W. Bush pardoning officials from President Reagan's Administration involved in the Iran-Contra affair. In his final acts before leaving office, President G.W. Bush commuted the sentences of two Border Patrol agents convicted of shooting a Mexican citizen. Mexico criticized the commutation, stating it prioritized anti-immigrant groups over their efforts. There were also considerations for clemency for soldiers involved in crimes at Abu Ghraib prison. The importance of U.S. cybersecurity has been highlighted. The increasing importance of U.S. cybersecurity is a critical element of national security, highlighted in the 2015 National Security Strategy and the 2016 Worldwide Threat Assessment. The presidential transition period may pose challenges in cybersecurity if positions with cybersecurity responsibilities are not filled promptly. Coordination among federal agencies for cybersecurity incidents is crucial for the government's capability. Responsibilities for cybersecurity incidents are crucial for the federal government's ability to respond effectively. President Obama's Presidential Policy Directive 41 (PPD-41) establishes principles for coordinated cyber incident response among federal departments and agencies. These principles emphasize shared responsibility, risk assessment, and safeguarding of incident details and privacy. The federal government's response to cybersecurity incidents is guided by Presidential Policy Directive 41 (PPD-41), which emphasizes principles such as safeguarding incident details, privacy, civil liberties, and sensitive information. The directive also outlines the need for a unified response and prioritizes the recovery and restoration of affected entities. Federal agency lines of effort are established, with the Department of Justice leading Threat Response activities and providing technical assistance for Asset Response. The federal government's response to cybersecurity incidents is guided by Presidential Policy Directive 41 (PPD-41), which emphasizes safeguarding incident details, privacy, civil liberties, and sensitive information. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) leads efforts to mitigate impacts and restore functionality, while the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) handles intelligence support. The Department of Defense (DOD) is responsible for the Defense Industrial Base critical infrastructure sector. The U.S. government's response to cybersecurity incidents is guided by Presidential Policy Directive 41 (PPD-41), focusing on safeguarding incident details and privacy. The intelligence community provides briefings to presidential candidates on cybersecurity threats, including challenges from the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and infrastructure weaknesses. Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea are identified as key threats in cyberspace. The assessment identified Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, and nonstate actors as the greatest threat actors in cyberspace. There are concerns about the cybersecurity qualifications of executive branch political appointees, particularly agency heads, and the implications for the federal government if positions are not filled in a timely manner. All federal agency heads have a cybersecurity responsibility for their agencies' systems, data, and networks. Agency heads have cybersecurity responsibilities for information systems and data collected by the agency. Congress has included agency heads in cybersecurity hearings, highlighting their managerial role in prioritizing cybersecurity. Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) also have explicit responsibilities for agency security. During a presidential transition period, agencies must plan for cybersecurity vacancies and devolve responsibilities to career employees. PPD-41 establishes coordination mechanisms to address key vacancies and adjust policy or operational responses accordingly, ensuring national security interests are protected. The 2016-2017 election transition period poses both opportunities and risks to national security. Collaboration between the current and new Administration is crucial for addressing foreign policy and security challenges. The outcome of this coordination may impact the new President's ability to safeguard U.S. interests and the legacy of the outgoing President. During the presidential transition period, changes in leadership may impact national security, creating opportunities for those seeking to harm U.S. interests. Extremist groups and foreign powers could exploit this uncertainty to manipulate foreign and domestic policies. Observers speculate that extremist groups and foreign powers may plan attacks around election day, based on the convergence of capability and opportunity. Any attack during the presidential transition period could impact the transition and Administration's policies. Presidential historians emphasize the importance of cooperation between incoming and outgoing Administrations for national security and foreign policy concerns. The need for effective transitions during the presidential transition period is crucial, especially as risks increase. Modern transition activities now extend beyond the election to inauguration. Presidential historians stress the importance of starting transition efforts at least six months before the election to avoid falling behind. The transition period can be divided into five phases, from campaign activities to establishing a national security team and policies. Cooperation between incoming and outgoing Administrations is vital for national security and foreign policy concerns. During presidential transitions, the outgoing and incoming Administrations are responsible for addressing risks and ensuring a smooth transfer of power. The newly elected President's response to challenges will depend on transition planning and learning. Various activities are typically undertaken, such as consulting with experts and providing information to the President-elect. During presidential transitions, experts provide information to the President-elect, offer operational briefings on national security matters, prepare briefing books, and expedite security clearances for transition team members. Agencies must follow procedures when issuing rules, such as publishing notices in the Federal Register, taking comments, and publishing final rules. Regulations have the force of law and significant policy effects. During presidential transitions, regulations are an important policymaking tool for the federal government. \"Midnight rulemaking\" refers to the increased number of regulations issued by federal agencies in the final months of outgoing Administrations. Concerns include less political accountability and insufficient time for reviewing public comments. During presidential transitions, regulations are an important policymaking tool for the federal government. Concerns about \"midnight rulemaking\" include potential quality issues due to rushed rule issuance and lack of thorough review. A 2012 study found that many midnight regulations were routine matters or tasks initiated before the transition period. During presidential transitions, regulations are a key tool for the federal government. Previous Presidents have imposed moratoriums on new regulations and delayed effective dates of rules issued at the end of the previous term. New Administrations can withdraw proposed rules not published in the Federal Register, but once final rules are published, they must go through the rulemaking process again to eliminate or change them. President Reagan issued Executive Order 12291 shortly after taking office in 1981 to control rulemaking. President Reagan issued Executive Order 12291 in 1981, requiring agencies to suspend major rules not yet effective. Subsequent administrations, including Clinton, G.W. Bush, and Obama, also delayed implementation of rules issued by their predecessors. The outgoing Administrations have attempted to protect rules issued in their final months by establishing effective dates before the new Administration takes over. For example, President G.W. Bush's Chief of Staff encouraged agencies to issue proposed rules by June 1, 2008, and final regulations by November 1, 2008. Similarly, President Obama's OIRA Administrator urged deputy secretaries to complete their highest priority rulemakings by the summer of 2016 to avoid a last-minute rush that could lower the quality of regulations. Congress has the power to overturn or amend regulations issued by agencies, even after they have taken effect. This can be done by changing the statutory authority underlying a regulation, providing additional instructions to agencies during rule development, or using legislative power to amend regulations. Congress has the power to overturn or amend regulations issued by agencies, even after they have taken effect. This can be done through the Congressional Review Act (CRA) or by adding provisions to agency appropriations bills. The CRA, enacted in 1996, allows Congress to use expedited procedures to disapprove agency rules. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to overturn agency rules by submitting joint resolutions of disapproval to both houses of Congress and the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Members of Congress have 60 days to introduce a resolution, and the Senate has 60 session days to act on it. The CRA makes consideration of the resolution privileged, limits debate to 10 hours, and if passed by both houses, it is presented to the President for signature or veto. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to overturn agency rules by submitting joint resolutions of disapproval to both houses of Congress and the Government Accountability Office (GAO). If the President signs the resolution, the rule \"shall not take effect\" and may not be reissued in \"substantially the same form\" without subsequent statutory authorization. If the President vetoes the resolution, Congress can override the veto with a two-thirds vote in both houses. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to overturn agency rules by submitting joint resolutions of disapproval. The CRA has been used once to disapprove a rule on ergonomics. There may be a period at the beginning of each new Administration where rules from the previous Administration are eligible for consideration under the CRA. Congress has also added provisions to agency appropriations bills to affect rulemaking. Congress has frequently added provisions to agency appropriations bills to affect rulemaking and regulations, prohibiting the use of funds for certain rulemaking-related purposes. These provisions can have a substantial effect on agency rulemaking beyond the Congressional Review Act. Unlike CRA resolutions, appropriations provisions do not nullify existing regulations. Regulated entities must comply with final rules in the Code of Federal Regulations, even if funds are restricted for enforcement. Restrictions on fund usage in appropriations acts may limit influence on agency rulemaking. These provisions are binding for the specified period and applicable to funded agencies. Some federal regulatory agencies may receive funding from sources other than congressional appropriations, such as user fees, which may not be restricted by appropriations language. State or local governments may also enforce federal regulations with their own funding sources. The President and the Senate share the power to fill top government positions, with the President nominating and the Senate providing advice and consent. Outgoing Presidents have used recess appointments to extend their influence into the succeeding presidency. Ministers, Consuls, Judges, and Officers of the United States are appointed as established by Law. The appointment process involves the President selecting and nominating individuals, Senate considering the nomination, and if confirmed, the appointee is sworn in. The President can make temporary recess appointments when the Senate is not in session. The recess appointment power allows the President to temporarily appoint officials when the Senate is not in session. However, recent developments have made it harder for a departing President to make recess appointments, especially if the Senate is opposed to the President's party. Scheduling practices have been used to prevent the Senate from going on recess long enough for the President to make appointments. The President's recess appointment power is limited to recesses of 10 days or longer, except in unusual circumstances. Appointees to executive branch positions typically serve at the pleasure of the President and can be removed at any time. Congress can set specific terms or restrictions on the President's power of removal for certain positions. Some positions have fixed terms and removal restrictions to establish independence from the President. Appointees with fixed terms can serve through multiple presidencies and may not be removed unless specific grounds are met. Appointees without specified protection from removal may still be protected based on case law. Some appointees with fixed terms and removal restrictions may be protected from removal based on case law. Outgoing Presidents have made recess appointments to such positions in the past, allowing appointees to serve until the expiration of their term or the recess appointment. A President could use a recess appointment to fill a fixed-term position that outlasts his time in office. Recess appointees may serve past the end of an Administration, either with the support of the incoming President and Senate or as controversial appointees not confirmed by the new administration. Recent developments have reduced the likelihood of a departing President installing a Senate-opposed appointee using the recess. The possibility of a departing President making a recess appointment, especially when facing opposition from the Senate, is low. Arguments can be made both for and against this practice. Supporters argue that the President has full constitutional authority until the end of their term and should be able to act accordingly. They also point out that previous Presidents have made recess appointments in their final months. Critics argue that such appointments could be controversial and should be avoided. The Appointments Clause in the Constitution outlines the process for appointing federal judges, stating that the President nominates and the Senate confirms. This process is similar to that of executive branch appointees, with the President submitting nominations to the Senate for consideration. The process of appointing federal judges involves the President nominating and the Senate confirming. Vacancies on lower federal court judgeships are common at the start of a new presidency, while vacancies on the Supreme Court are rare. Currently, there is a vacancy on the Supreme Court that may not be filled before the new President takes office on January 20, 2017. The Senate's approval of judicial nominations during an outgoing President's final year in office is crucial for the number of vacant judgeships at the start of a new presidency. The trend shows that U.S. circuit court nominations are typically not approved past June or July of a presidential election year. Vacancies on lower federal court judgeships are common at the beginning of a new presidency, with varying numbers for each President since Ronald Reagan. The process of nominating federal court judges involves a thorough evaluation by the White House Counsel's Office, Department of Justice, FBI, and American Bar Association. It can take several months before the President submits nominations to the Senate. The Administration submits its first circuit and district court nominations to the Senate for consideration, following a thorough evaluation process involving various agencies. The timing of these nominations varies across different presidencies, with concerns about executive orders also being raised. During presidential transitions, concerns about executive orders increase as outgoing Presidents may act unilaterally. Executive orders have the force of law and allow Presidents to establish control over policymaking quickly and forcefully. Ambiguity in statutes can justify presidential action, making executive orders an appealing tool for unilateral action. Presidents use executive orders to act quickly and shape the national agenda, especially when facing a hostile Congress or transitioning to an opposition successor. This unilateral action allows them to establish or change policy and secure their legacy, despite potential criticism. Some scholars criticize the use of unilateral directives like executive orders, noting the lack of legitimacy and democratic accountability. However, incoming Presidents may find executive orders effective in quickly implementing their policy agenda and distinguishing themselves from their predecessor. They may face challenges in amending their predecessor's actions. During transition periods, presidents face challenges in altering executive orders set by their predecessors, as it can damage credibility and encounter legal obstacles. Comparing executive orders issued by different Presidents during transition periods shows that Donald J. Trump signed the most orders, nearly doubling Reagan's count. During transition periods, presidents face challenges in altering executive orders set by their predecessors. The Presidents issued comparable numbers of executive orders, with Carter issuing the most during the pre-election period. The lame duck period showed variation, with Carter issuing the most orders related to the Iran hostage crisis. A study found that the end of a President's term sees an increase in executive orders, especially if succeeded by a member of the other party. The study found that presidents tend to issue more executive orders at the end of their term, especially if they are not succeeded by a member of the same party. The data suggests that executive orders have a strong policy component, with reelection also influencing the number of orders issued. Presidents use executive orders to recognize groups, establish policy, reorganize agencies, and affect legislation. Unilateral actions during transition periods result in a variety of executive orders in significance and scope. President Carter selected an FBI director and closed the government in 1980, while President Bush designated a public international organization and delegated disaster relief functions. During presidential transitions, executive orders play a significant role in reorganizing agencies and establishing policies. President Reagan transferred relief and emergency assistance functions to the director of FEMA, while President Carter issued executive orders related to the release of American hostages in Iran. The new Congress receives the President's annual budget submission in January, initiating the consideration of budget resolutions for the upcoming fiscal year. The Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 requires the President to submit a budget annually to Congress at the beginning of each regular session. The deadline for submission has changed over the years, with various amendments specifying the timing. The Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 requires the President to submit a budget annually to Congress at the beginning of each regular session. The deadline for submission has changed over the years, with various amendments specifying the timing to \"on or after the first Monday in January but not later than the first Monday in February of each year.\" The 20th Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1933, requires each new Congress to convene on January 3 and provides a January 20 beginning date for a President's four-year term of office. The 1990 change in the deadline made it possible for an outgoing President to leave the annual budget submission to his successor. President Obama may choose not to submit the FY2018 budget, following the example of his predecessors. Outgoing Presidents Ford, Carter, and Reagan all submitted budgets on time, while Presidents Bush, Clinton, and Bush had their successors submit the budgets for FY1994, FY2002, and FY2010 respectively. This practice has occurred during six presidential transitions since FY1977. In the past, Presidents have sometimes missed the statutory deadline for submitting budgets, leading to Congress enacting deadline extensions. However, in recent years, some budgets have been submitted late without authorization. For example, the FY1991 budget was submitted a week after an extended deadline, and the FY1989 budget was submitted 45 days late without any extension measures. In recent years, Presidents have submitted budgets late without authorization. For example, Presidents Clinton, G.W. Bush, and Obama submitted budgets for FY1994, FY2002, and FY2010 66, 63, and 98 days after the deadline, respectively. President Obama submitted his budget overview on February 26, 2009, and detailed budget information on May 7, 2009. Since 1921, incoming Presidents have typically assumed office with their predecessor's budget in place. However, some Presidents, such as Eisenhower, Kennedy, Nixon, Ford, Carter, and Reagan, chose to submit revisions shortly after taking office. On the other hand, Presidents Reagan, Clinton, G.W. Bush, and Obama did not submit detailed budget proposals until April or May of their first year, but they outlined their economic and budgetary policies to Congress in February. Since 1921, incoming Presidents typically assume office with their predecessor's budget. However, some Presidents, like Eisenhower, Kennedy, Nixon, Ford, Carter, and Reagan, submitted revisions shortly after taking office. Presidents Coolidge, Hoover, F.D. Roosevelt, Truman, Johnson, and G.H.W. Bush did not submit revisions. Carter and Reagan submitted revisions of their predecessors' budgets. G.H.W. Bush did not submit an official revision of Reagan's FY1990 budget but presented similar elements in a document to Congress coinciding with his first State of the Union Address."
