Congress and presidential administrations have backed national policies to help minority businesses achieve parity in the free enterprise system. The Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) aims to support minority business enterprises by providing technical and managerial expertise, support, and resources. Despite lacking statutory authorization, Congress has funded the agency for 48 years. The report discusses the agency's origins, funding history, recent performance, assessments, and current issues. The Trump Administration proposed reducing MBDA's funding from $34 million in FY2017 to $6 million for FY2018, with the intent of terminating the agency. However, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended an appropriation of $34 million for FY2018. MBDA was established as the Office of Minority Business Enterprises by President Richard Nixon in 1969 to promote minority participation in the U.S. economy. President Nixon established the OMBE to increase minority participation in the U.S. economy and promote economic advancement and political power. The OMBE was created within the first 100 days of his administration to address issues of racial inequality and social injustice. The OMBE was established by President Nixon to support minority businesses and promote their success. The Advisory Council on Minority Enterprise played a significant role in shaping the OMBE's agenda, despite facing challenges such as organizational difficulties and a lack of cooperation from other departments. President Nixon established the OMBE to support minority businesses, but it faced struggles in its early years. The Commerce Secretary's decision not to get involved in individual cases hindered its mission. To address concerns, President Nixon signed E.O. 11625 on October 13, 1971, clarifying and strengthening the OMBE's role. This order gave the Secretary a clear mandate to establish and carry out Federal policy for minority enterprise and coordinate efforts across all federal departments and agencies. The new E.O. directed departments and agencies to develop data collection processes for minority enterprise programs and create a network of minority business centers. These centers would provide assistance and financial support to minority businesses, marking a shift towards actively supporting their development. Congress considered legislation to authorize the agency during the Carter Administration, but it was not passed. In 1979, the Carter Administration reorganized and renamed the agency to the Minority Business Development Agency to refocus on assisting minority businesses develop into medium- and large-size firms in growth industries. Successive Administrations have continued to support the mission by refining the agency's focus and reorganizing the delivery of assistance and services. The Minority Business Development Center program (MBDC) was established to provide technical and management services to minority businesses through approximately 100 centers in metropolitan areas. President Reagan issued E.O. 12432 to encourage minority business participation in federal procurement. President George H.W. Bush considered transferring the agency's mission to the Small Business Administration but ultimately continued its existence. In 1994, President Clinton issued E.O. 12928 to promote procurement with small businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, historically black colleges and universities, and minority institutions. The Clinton Administration supported increases in the agency's budget to expand the reach and capacity of the MBDA, funding Rural Business Development Centers and Minority Business Opportunity Committees. The MBDA initiated the Community Based Enhancement Services (CBES) pilot program in 1996 to form strategic alliances for minority business development. An audit found deficiencies in program administration, recommending specific performance measures and staff expertise for monitoring activities. The MBDA, under the George W. Bush Administration, focused on coordinating programs with the SBA to support minority and disadvantaged firms with annual revenues of $500,000 or more. Research showed that these firms generated a larger percentage of revenues and employed more people compared to smaller minority firms. The agency funded programs like National Enterprise Centers and MBDCs to provide support services to larger businesses. The MBDA funded entities like MBDCs and MBOCs to provide consulting services to firms with growth potential. They also supported special projects, youth entrepreneurship, access to capital, and global competitiveness for minority businesses. Starting in the 1990s, the agency focused on helping minority firms enter the global economy. The preliminary study found that minority businesses can compete with larger multinational companies by leveraging their unique strengths, especially in developing countries. However, there is a lack of updated information on MBEs' international interactions, hindering the design of effective policies and programs to support their expansion. The Obama Administration focused on facilitating minority firms' entry into the global market and quantifying the impact of MBDA. The MBDA focuses on quantifying the impact of its activities, delivering services efficiently to minority business communities, and coordinating with federal agencies like the SBA, International Trade Administration, and others. It primarily serves businesses with revenues of at least $1 million annually, focusing on high-growth areas such as technology and bio-medicine. Services are provided through business centers in areas with large minority populations and businesses. MBDA business centers offer services to minority-owned firms in areas with high minority populations and businesses. Services include business consulting, private equity opportunities, joint ventures, and partnerships. Operators provide services on a fee-for-services basis to eligible minority business enterprises. Nonprofit organizations, for-profit businesses, governments, universities, and Native American tribal entities can compete to operate a center with a minimum annual award of $250,000. The MBDA funds various Business and Specialty Centers, with operators expected to contribute 33% of the grant award. Despite lacking statutory mandate, Congress continues to support the agency's mission through appropriations. The MBDA has received over $1.8 billion in appropriations since its inception. The Trump Administration's proposed budget for FY2018 requested only $6 million for MBDA, significantly less than the previous year's $34 million. This amount would be used to facilitate the agency's termination and closeout of activities in 2018. The Trump Administration supports the termination of the MBDA and its programs to reduce federal spending and redefine the government's role in domestic affairs. Supporters argue the agency is critical for minority entrepreneurs, while opponents believe these activities should be handled by state and local governments. The House Appropriations Committee approved the FY2018 budget for the agency's closeout. The House Appropriations Committee approved the FY2018 Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies appropriations bill (H.R. 3267) with $34 million allocated for MBDA activities. The bill directs MBDA to allocate at least 50% of its appropriation through cooperative agreements, external awards, and grants. Additionally, MBDA is required to submit a report on the state of minority businesses within 180 days of the bill's enactment. This language was included in the FY2018 omnibus appropriation measure (H.R. 3354) passed by the House on September 14, 2017. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported its version of the FY2018 CJS appropriations bill, recommending $34 million for MBDA activities, the same amount as in FY2017. The committee acknowledges MBDA's unique role in promoting minority-owned businesses and encourages submitting an annual report to Congress with recommendations for improving access to capital. Congress passed the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018, funding MBDA at the same level. The Disaster Relief Requirements Act, 2017 funds MBDA at the same rate as FY2017, with a rescission, until December 8, 2017 or until FY2018 CJS appropriations are signed. MBDA measures effectiveness through performance measures, reporting 26,896 jobs created or retained in FY2015. Nearly 100,000 jobs were created or retained from FY2012 through FY2015. Data on contracts, financial transactions, and jobs created/retained are reported by MBDA Business Centers and verified by MBDA headquarters. In FY2015, MBDA reported creating or retaining 26,896 jobs. The total value of contracts and capital secured by minority businesses with MBDA's assistance was $5.9 billion, with $4.3 billion from the private sector. Federal contracts and capital awarded to minority firms accounted for 14.7% in FY2015. The Return on Taxpayer Investment (ROI) in FY2014 was $247.6 for every $1 in MBDA funds. In FY2014, $247.6 in total investments was generated by every $1 in MBDA funds appropriated. In FY2015, the ratio declined to $197.4 for every $1 in funds appropriated. MBDA has been the subject of critical reports examining its efficacy in assisting minority businesses and program management issues. The George W. Bush Administration initiated the Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) in 2002 to evaluate federal programs, with a 2007 evaluation finding MBDA performance to be Adequate. The evaluation of the program highlighted strong management with high marks for program purpose, design, strategic planning, and program management. It noted the development of appropriate measures for the impact on business clients but recommended more research on long-term impact. The program awards grants competitively and provides oversight of grant activities. While focused on minority small businesses, other sources of business assistance exist at federal, state, and local levels. The Department of Commerce IG's 2006 report found that MBDA's performance measures were compromised by combining results from different programs and unreliable data. The agency inaccurately reported a 300% increase in clients assisted by MBOCs in 2004 due to combining results with two other programs, inflating the numbers. The MBDA director agreed with the report's recommendations to define key performance measures clearly. The 1998 audit report by the IG identified deficiencies in MBDA's monitoring of a pilot project testing Community-Based Enhancement Services. The monitoring failed to follow agency policies, leading to ineffective assessment. MBDA agreed to implement recommendations, assign staff with expertise, and develop project-specific performance measures. The Nixon Administration created the MBDA but did not propose enabling legislation despite intentions to do so. Several bills have been introduced in past Congresses to establish statutory authority for the agency. No bills were introduced during the 114th Congress for the MBDA. The 96th Congress considered but did not pass legislative proposals for the agency. During the 99th Congress, bills were introduced to establish a permanent MBDA within the Department of Commerce, granting the agency authority to support minority businesses through various activities. Representative Parren Mitchell introduced H.R. 4632. During the 99th Congress, Representative Parren Mitchell introduced H.R. 4632 to transfer MBDA activities to SBA for potential duplication avoidance. In later Congresses, Representative Kweisi Mfume introduced bills to re-designate MBDA as Minority Business Development Administration for market penetration and financial assistance. During the 111th Congress, Senator Bob Casey introduced the Minority Business Development Improvements Act of 2010, which aimed to establish the Minority Business Development Program under MBDA to provide technical and procurement assistance to qualified minority businesses. The bill also outlined minority business qualification requirements for the program. The bill introduced during the 111th Congress aimed to establish a program providing technical assistance and procurement opportunities for qualified minority businesses. It required ownership or control by historically disadvantaged individuals and defined qualifications for program participation. The bill aimed to assist qualified minority businesses by defining ownership criteria and directing the National Director of MBDA to establish a database for subcontracting opportunities. Representative Rush also introduced a bill for a Minority Business Development Program providing technical assistance, loan guarantees, and contract procurement. The bill aimed to assist minority businesses by providing technical assistance, loan guarantees, and contract procurement assistance. It would authorize MBDA to provide set-aside contracting opportunities and establish a database to help prime contractors identify historically disadvantaged firms for subcontracting. Senator Udall and Representative Rush introduced similar bills in different Congress sessions. In 2012, the National Advisory Council on Minority Business Enterprise (NACMBE) released recommendations to improve MBDA's effectiveness, including centralizing minority business development efforts and expanding access to capital. The MBDA aims to enhance minority business capacity through new capital sources, an MBE Academy, and a longitudinal database. Debate exists on whether MBDA duplicates SBA programs for disadvantaged groups, with some suggesting merging programs while others argue for complementarity. The MBDA focuses on enhancing medium and large scale minority firms, while leaving support for small and startup minority firms to the SBA. The agency's existence is determined by each new President, with past proposals for statutory authority not being passed. The President can terminate the agency's activities at any time, but Congress can appropriate funds to override this decision. Congress can also revoke or modify the executive order to support the agency's mission. Congress can revoke or modify the executive order to support the agency's mission."
