    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"No More Solyndras Act\" and includes findings. President Obama's green jobs agenda received substantial funding through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, allocating $90 billion to green energy programs and $47 billion for loan guarantees under title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. This allowed the Secretary of Energy to issue loan guarantees for projects that reduce air pollutants or greenhouse gases and utilize new technologies. The stimulus package expanded title XVII by adding section 1705 to include projects using commercial technology for renewable energy, electric power transmission, and biofuels. $6 billion was allocated for credit subsidy costs for projects starting construction by September 30, 2011. The Department of Energy issued loan guarantees for various projects totaling $15.1 billion under the section 1705 program. Three companies that received loan guarantees, including Solyndra, declared bankruptcy, potentially resulting in a loss of over $530 million to taxpayers. The investigation into the Solyndra loan guarantee revealed that the Department of Energy's review in 2009 was influenced by politics and ideology, ignoring concerns about the company's financial condition. Despite a provision prohibiting subordination of taxpayers' financial interest, the Department of Energy restructured the loan guarantee in 2011, putting taxpayers at risk of losing priority to Solyndra's investors in case of default. The Inspector General of the Department of the Treasury found uncertainty regarding the Department's actions. Treasury found unclear consultation with Secretary of Treasury on Solyndra loan guarantee, rushed process with no documentation. GAO found inconsistent treatment of applicants in DOE Loan Guarantee Program. DOE did not follow own process, increasing taxpayer exposure. The Department of Energy's lack of documentation made it hard to justify loan guarantee decisions, increasing taxpayer financial risk. Advisors to the President highlighted the risk of projects with little private investor involvement. A report in 2012 found that the projects in the loan program were higher risk investments not typically supported by private markets. The Department of Energy's section 1705 program has expired, but they will continue to consider applications for loan guarantees under the section 1703 program. The Department of Energy has $34 billion remaining in lending authority for new loan guarantees under the section 1703 program. The section 1705 program has expired, but applications for loan guarantees under the section 1703 program will still be considered. The Department of Energy has $34 billion remaining for new loan guarantees under the section 1703 program. SEC. 3. SUNSET. The Secretary of Energy will not issue new loan guarantees under title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 after December 31, 2011. For pending applications submitted before that date, the Secretary of the Treasury must provide a financial analysis within 30 days before any guarantee can be made. The Secretary of Energy must consider the Treasury's analysis before issuing loan guarantees under title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Any guarantee made against the Treasury's analysis must be explained to relevant committees within 30 days. The Secretary of Energy must report to Congress within 60 days of issuing a loan guarantee, providing details on the review process, terms of the guarantee, recipient, and project information. The report must include all relevant information while protecting confidential business details. The Secretary must provide all relevant information for loan guarantees, while ensuring confidentiality of recipient and technology details. SEC. 4. RESTRUCTURING OF LOAN GUARANTEES.\n\nThe Secretary of Energy must consult with the Secretary of the Treasury on any restructuring of loan guarantee terms, including deviations from financial terms.\n\nSEC. 5. RESTATING THE PROHIBITION ON SUBORDINATION.\n\nSection 1702(d)(3) of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to ensure that loan guarantees are not subordinate under any circumstances.\n\nSEC. 6. ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS AND CIVIL PENALTIES. Any Federal official responsible for violating loan guarantee requirements under title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 may face administrative discipline or civil penalties of $10,000 to $50,000 per violation. The term \"Federal official\" refers to individuals in specific positions within the Executive Schedule. Federal officials who violate loan guarantee requirements under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 may be subject to administrative discipline or civil penalties. This includes individuals in specific positions within the Executive Schedule and those serving in Senior Executive Service positions. GAO will conduct a study on federal subsidies in energy markets. The Comptroller General will study Federal subsidies in energy markets from 2003 to 2012, focusing on subsidies for electricity, transportation fuels, research, and manufacturing. A report will be submitted to relevant committees within a year of the Act's enactment. The Senate report will detail the costs and impacts of Federal subsidies in energy markets, including effects on the US Treasury, energy security, electricity and transportation fuel prices, private energy industries, foreign subsidies, and support from top GDP countries. The term \"Federal subsidies\" in this section refers to various forms of financial support provided by the government for energy markets and related sectors, including grants, loans, loan guarantees, tax credits, and other programmatic activities targeting specific energy technologies.
