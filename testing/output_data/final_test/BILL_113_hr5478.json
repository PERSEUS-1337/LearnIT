This includes mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles and weapons. The transfer of military equipment to local law enforcement has increased due to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The transfer of military equipment to local law enforcement agencies has increased significantly. Approximately 12,000 police organizations obtained nearly $500 million worth of excess military merchandise in fiscal year 2011. Over $4 billion worth of weapons and equipment have been transferred nationwide. A moratorium on weapons transfers was implemented in May 2012 due to reports of missing equipment and inappropriate transfers, but it was lifted in October 2013 without adequate safeguards.
