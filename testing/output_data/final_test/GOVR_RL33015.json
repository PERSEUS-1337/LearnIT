    "content": "The Social Security program provides monthly cash benefits to retired, disabled workers, and survivors of deceased workers. Workers must work in Social Security covered jobs for 10 years to qualify for benefits. Noncitizens working in the US must also pay Social Security payroll taxes. Social Security benefits are computed based on a worker's lifetime taxable earnings, with a progressive formula using \"bend points\" to return higher percentages of lower-wage workers' earnings. The Social Security benefit formula calculates benefits based on a worker's lifetime indexed earnings, with bend points determining the replacement rate. Recent changes require noncitizens to have work authorization to gain insured status under the program. Noncitizens must have work authorization for their earnings to count towards insured status under Social Security. Noncitizens with an SSN assigned before January 1, 2004 are exempt from this requirement. Noncitizens must be \"lawfully present\" in the US to receive benefits, with benefits suspended if this requirement is not met. Benefits can still be received while residing outside the US in such cases. Noncitizens can receive benefits while residing outside the United States if they meet exceptions to the alien nonpayment provision. Benefits are suspended if the noncitizen remains outside the US for more than six consecutive months, unless certain exceptions are met. For example, benefits are not suspended for citizens or residents of countries with totalization agreements with the US or citizens of social insurance countries like Mexico. Alien dependents and survivors must have lived in the US for at least five years previously to receive payments outside the US. The Social Security Act allows noncitizens to receive benefits outside the US if they meet exceptions to the alien nonpayment provision. The law provides exceptions to the five-year U.S. residency requirement for dependents and survivors, such as totalization agreements with other countries. Totalization agreements coordinate payroll taxes and benefit payments for workers who split their careers between the US and another country. Totalization agreements allow workers to contribute to the Social Security systems of both countries, resulting in dual coverage and taxation based on the same earnings. Workers can contribute to the foreign system if employed abroad for five or more years, or to their home country's system if employed abroad for fewer than five years. These agreements also allow workers to combine earnings credits from both systems, qualifying them for benefits under one or both systems. Benefits are prorated based on the years paid into each system, and the same treatment applies to foreign workers in the United States. Since 1978, the United States has signed totalization agreements with 20 countries, including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico, and the United Kingdom. Once signed, agreements are sent for review by the Secretary of State, the President, and Congress. The Social Security Act requires the President to submit the agreement text and a report on the estimated impact on affected individuals and financial programs. Totalization agreements automatically go into effect. A totalization agreement goes into effect unless Congress disapproves within 60 session days. The agreement with Japan expired in 2005, while the agreement with Mexico is still under review. The report compares socio-economic characteristics of individuals born in Mexico living in the US with those born in totalization countries. The analysis focuses on population and social characteristics, as well as labor force data from the March 2004 supplement of the Current Population Survey. Respondents from totalization countries are grouped together, excluding Luxembourg and Japan due to data limitations. The report compares socio-economic characteristics among different groups residing in the United States, including U.S. citizens, noncitizens from Mexico, naturalized U.S. citizens from Mexico, noncitizens from totalization countries, and naturalized U.S. citizens from totalization countries. The analysis is based on data from the March 2004 supplement of the Current Population Survey, focusing on population and labor force data. It is noted that distinguishing between legally residing aliens and unauthorized individuals is not possible using CPS data. The analysis compares socio-economic characteristics of different groups in the U.S., including U.S. citizens, noncitizens from Mexico, naturalized U.S. citizens from Mexico, noncitizens from totalization countries, and naturalized U.S. citizens from totalization countries. It is based on March 2004 Current Population Survey data, focusing on population and labor force information. It is challenging to differentiate between legally residing aliens and unauthorized individuals using this data. The number of Mexican-born noncitizens and naturalized citizens in the U.S. is significantly higher than those from totalization countries. Mexican nationals in the U.S. outnumber citizens from totalization countries by five times. Mexican noncitizens are more likely to be male, while noncitizens and naturalized citizens from totalization countries are more likely to be female. The higher percentage of females among naturalized citizens from totalization countries may be due to the older population demographic in those countries. Mexican noncitizens tend to be younger compared to noncitizens from totalization countries. Naturalized citizens from Mexico and totalization countries are generally older than their noncitizen counterparts. Mexican noncitizens and naturalized citizens from totalization countries tend to be older. Noncitizens must reside in the US for five years before applying for citizenship. U.S. citizens are more likely to be under 16, while very few naturalized citizens from Mexico or totalization countries are under 16. Mexican noncitizens have a higher percentage between 16 and 24 compared to U.S. citizens and noncitizens from totalization countries. Mexican noncitizens between 25 and 44 make up the majority, while naturalized U.S. citizens from totalization countries are mostly over 54. Noncitizens from totalization countries are better educated compared to Mexican noncitizens. Mexican noncitizens have lower levels of educational attainment, with 65.1% having less than a high school diploma. In contrast, 11.2% of noncitizens from totalization countries have less than a high school diploma, while 42.2% have a college or advanced degree. Noncitizens from totalization countries have higher educational attainment compared to Mexican noncitizens. Mexican naturalized U.S. citizens are less likely to have a high school diploma and more likely to have a Bachelor's or advanced degree compared to naturalized U.S. citizens from totalization countries. Labor force participation rates of Mexican noncitizens are discussed in Figure 3. The labor force participation rates of Mexican noncitizens (69.5%) are higher than noncitizens from totalization countries (61.6%), U.S. citizens (65.5%), and naturalized U.S. citizens from totalization countries (49.4%). Mexican noncitizens and naturalized U.S. citizens from Mexico have similar participation rates. Differences in age distributions may contribute to these disparities. The labor force participation rates vary by age, with over a third of persons from totalization countries being 65 or older. Unemployment rates are higher for Mexican noncitizens compared to noncitizens from totalization countries and U.S. citizens. Labor force participation rates are higher among the youngest and oldest groups of workers. The labor force participation rates vary by age, with Mexican noncitizens aged 65 and older having the highest participation rate. Mexican noncitizens aged 16-24 also have a higher participation rate compared to noncitizens from totalization countries. Mexican noncitizens aged 25-64 are less likely to be in the labor force compared to U.S. citizens. Unemployment rates for noncitizens from totalization countries are lower than those from Mexico in certain age groups. Mexican citizens aged 25-64 have higher unemployment rates than U.S. citizens in the same age group. Conversely, Mexican noncitizens aged 16-24 have lower unemployment rates than their U.S. counterparts. Men make up the majority of the labor force in all citizenship groups, with 72.4% of Mexicannoncitizens and 53.1% of noncitizens from totalization countries being men. Women tend to earn less than men over their lifetime. Women tend to earn less than men over their lifetime, with lower earners receiving a higher replacement rate on their Social Security contributions. U.S. citizens have a higher percentage of workers not in the labor force due to disability compared to noncitizens, with naturalized U.S. citizens from Mexico having the highest percentage. Mexican noncitizens have a lower percentage of individuals not in the labor force due to disabilities compared to other citizenship groups, possibly because they are younger and healthier. They also tend to have lower annual earnings. The median annual earnings for noncitizens from totalization countries are more than twice the median earnings for noncitizens from Mexico. Naturalized citizens from totalization countries earn $10,000 more than naturalized U.S. citizens from Mexico. The majority of employed Mexican noncitizens in the United States earned under $20,000 in 2003. Noncitizens from totalization countries had the highest concentration of people earning $80,000 or more, with 15.2% in this category. U.S. citizens, naturalized U.S. citizens from Mexico, and Mexican noncitizens had lower percentages in this income bracket. Social Security-covered workers and their employers contribute 6.2% of earnings up to $90,000, with higher wage workers paying more into the system. The benefit formula favors lower wage workers with a higher replacement rate in Social Security benefits. Mexican noncitizens tend to have lower work experience and educational attainment compared to other citizenship groups. They are more likely to work in service occupations with lower wages. This is in contrast to noncitizens from totalization countries and U.S. citizens, who have a higher concentration of people earning $80,000 or more. The Social Security benefit formula favors lower wage workers, providing them with a higher replacement rate in benefits. Noncitizens from totalization countries have a higher percentage of workers in professional occupations (28.0%) compared to Mexican noncitizens (2.2%) and naturalized U.S. citizens from Mexico (9.3%). U.S. citizens have the highest concentration in sales and office occupations (26.8%). Noncitizens from totalization countries also have a higher percentage in management, business, and financial occupations. Noncitizens from totalization countries and naturalized U.S. citizens from Mexico have a higher percentage of workers in management, business, and financial occupations compared to U.S. citizens and noncitizens from Mexico. Mexican noncitizen workers are more concentrated in construction and extraction occupations. The concentration of naturalized U.S. citizens from Mexico and noncitizens from Mexico in production occupations is over two times higher than U.S. citizen workers and noncitizens from totalization countries in the same occupations. Data from March 2004 shows that the majority of employed persons across all citizenship groups usually work full-time. In 2004, Mexican noncitizens and naturalized Mexican citizens are more likely to work full-time compared to other citizenship groups. The percentages of noncitizens and naturalized citizens from totalization countries working full-time are similar and not significantly different from U.S. citizens. Naturalized U.S. citizens from Mexico and totalization countries have been in the U.S. longer than their noncitizen counterparts. Naturalized U.S. citizens from totalization countries arrived prior to 1986 more often than those from Mexico. Mexican noncitizens were more likely to arrive after 1995 compared to noncitizens from totalization countries. Earnings of noncitizens are linked to the length of time spent in the U.S. Mexican noncitizens in the labor force have more dependents (1.7) than noncitizens from totalization countries (1.4). Naturalized U.S. citizens from Mexico have the highest average number of dependents at 2.0. Among those with dependents, Mexican noncitizens and naturalized U.S. citizens from Mexico have similar averages of 2.4 and 2.3, respectively. The average number of dependents for noncitizens and naturalized U.S. citizens from totalization countries is 1.9 and 1.6, respectively. U.S. citizens have an average of 1.8 dependents. The data is from the March 2004 Current Population Survey. Dependents include spouses, children under 18, full-time high school students under 19, and persons over 18 with disabilities. The average number of dependents for noncitizens from Mexico and totalization countries may be higher than shown in the table. Noncitizens from Mexico and totalization countries may have a higher average number of dependents than shown in the table. 72.4% of Mexican noncitizens in the labor force are male, with 8.0% reporting being married but their spouse is not living in the U.S. Only 1.3% of noncitizen men from totalization countries report the same. Dependents not residing in the U.S. are not captured in the CPS data. Noncitizens who have not resided in the same relationship with the worker in the U.S. for five years are not eligible for dependents or survivors benefits. Noncitizens from Mexico and totalization countries may have a higher average number of dependents. The five-year residency requirement for dependents or survivors benefits is waived for citizens from countries with totalization agreements. The Mexican population in the United States has a different socio-economic profile compared to U.S. citizens and persons from totalization countries. Individuals from totalization countries tend to have more education and higher earnings, while the Mexican population is younger and more heavily male. Mexican workers in the U.S. labor force may have higher replacement rates in Social Security benefits due to lower lifetime earnings. Mexican noncitizens spend more years in the labor force but may not contribute more to the Social Security system than noncitizens from totalization countries with higher incomes. The socio-economic variations among totalization countries are explored using data from the March CPS, although the sample size is not large enough for separate analyses for each country. The analysis focuses on noncitizens from select totalization countries compared to Mexico, with significant findings at a 95% confidence level. Mexican noncitizens in the U.S. outnumber noncitizens from all totalization countries combined, while naturalized citizens from totalization countries are fewer than those from Mexico. The population of naturalized U.S. citizens from Mexico is much larger than that from any individual totalization country. Age distributions of naturalized citizens from different countries vary, with South Korea having a younger population compared to Mexico. Noncitizens from totalization countries also have different age distributions, none equivalent to Mexican noncitizens. The age distribution of noncitizens from totalization countries tends to be older than Mexican noncitizens, with Chilean noncitizens being statistically equivalent except for specific age groups. Data was sourced from the Mar. 2004 Current Population Survey. Estimates for totalization countries exclude Luxembourg. There are significant differences in educational attainment among naturalized U.S. citizens from different totalization countries. The educational attainment of citizens from Italy, Portugal, and Greece is more similar to Mexico than to all totalization countries combined. Notably, there is no statistical difference in educational attainment between citizens from Mexico and Greece. The majority of citizens from Mexico, Portugal, and Italy have no schooling past high school. Overall, almost half of naturalized citizens from totalization countries did not pursue post-secondary education, except for Greece. Naturalized citizens from Mexico tend to be less educated than citizens from other totalization countries, except for Greece. Mexican noncitizens have lower educational attainment compared to noncitizens from other totalization countries. Noncitizens from totalization countries have higher rates of post-secondary education. Italian noncitizens are the least educated among the totalization countries, with only 31.7% having more than a high school diploma. Italian noncitizens have a higher percentage of college degrees compared to Mexican noncitizens. Labor force participation rates vary among naturalized citizens, with Mexico having the highest rate. Noncitizens from Italy and South Korea also have different labor force participation rates compared to Mexico. The labor force participation rates of naturalized citizens from totalization countries were analyzed separately. Only German and Canadian noncitizens had significantly lower unemployment rates than Mexican noncitizens. Mexican noncitizens had a higher percentage of full-time workers compared to noncitizens from Canada, Chile, and Germany. Naturalized citizens from totalization countries, including South Korea and Chile, arrived more recently than naturalized Mexicans in the labor force. South Koreans and Chilean noncitizens arrived after 1995, with a higher percentage of Chileans arriving after 1995 compared to Mexicans. The gender distribution of naturalized citizens from Mexico is evenly split between men and women, similar to naturalized U.S. citizens from Italy. A majority of Mexican noncitizens are male, with similar gender distributions for noncitizens from Chile and Italy. Among noncitizens in the labor force, 72.4% of Mexicans are male compared to 53.1% of noncitizens from totalization countries. The gender distribution of noncitizens from Chile and Italy in the labor force is similar to that of Mexico, with 72% and 61.4% male, respectively. Mexican workers have lower annual earnings compared to workers from totalization countries, with Mexican workers more likely to earn less than $20,000 annually. Naturalized U.S. citizens from totalization countries have occupational distributions similar to those from Mexico. Citizens from Canada, Italy, and South Korea are more likely to be in professional occupations, while citizens from Greece, Ireland, and Portugal are not significantly less likely to. Naturalized U.S. citizens from Greece, Ireland, and Portugal have similar occupational distributions to those from Mexico. Noncitizens from totalization countries are more likely to be in management and professional occupations compared to Mexican noncitizens. Additionally, noncitizens from totalization countries are less likely to be in service and transportation occupations than Mexican noncitizens. Mexican, Chilean, Italian, and South Korean noncitizens have similar occupational distributions in construction and production roles. Data from March 2004 Current Population Survey. Totalization countries' noncitizens are more likely in management/professional roles and less likely in service/transportation roles compared to Mexican noncitizens. The analysis is based on data from the March 2004 Current Population Survey (CPS), conducted by the U.S. Bureau of the Census for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The CPS collects demographic, social, and labor market information from approximately 57,000 households each month. Unemployed persons are defined as individuals not working but available and looking for work. Unemployed persons are individuals not working but actively seeking employment. Employed persons include those working for an employer, self-employed, or working at least 15 hours a week as unpaid workers. The CPS categorizes citizenship into five groups, with U.S. citizens defined as those born in the U.S., Puerto Rico, or abroad to U.S. citizen parents. Naturalized citizens from certain countries are excluded from the U.S. citizen group for analysis purposes. Naturalized citizens from Mexico and totalization countries are analyzed separately due to the likelihood of having credits to combine under a totalization agreement. Information on citizenship is collected for individuals born outside the United States or its outlying areas. Respondents who answer \"Yes\" are coded as naturalized citizens. In the CPS, individuals are categorized as naturalized citizens or noncitizens based on their response. The CPS does not verify citizenship responses or differentiate between types of noncitizens. Some noncitizens may be ineligible for Social Security benefits without changes to immigration or Social Security policy. The report discusses statistically significant comparisons related to security benefits, with estimates based on survey responses from households. Nonsampling and sampling errors are mentioned, with sampling error arising from surveying a sample instead of the entire population. Confidence intervals are used to provide accuracy information, with 95% confidence intervals typically including the actual population value. Confidence intervals were calculated using a methodology suggested by the Census Bureau, with 95% of intervals generally including the actual value of a population characteristic."
