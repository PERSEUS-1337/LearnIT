    "content": "The Secretary of Education may establish the National Remote Teacher Corps (referred to as the \"Corps\") to address teacher vacancies, reduce class sizes, and enhance educational quality in qualified remote areas. To be designated as a Corps site, a local educational agency or charter school in a qualified remote area must submit an application to the Secretary demonstrating a shortage of teachers, willingness to promote teacher accountability, provide mentorship and professional development programs, and offer compensation in accordance with standards. To be designated as a Corps site, a local educational agency or charter school in a qualified remote area must be willing to provide compensation in accordance with section 8(a) for each Corps participant placed with the agency or school. They must also be willing to work with the Secretary to develop an alternative certification route for Corps participants or allow them to participate in an existing alternative certification program. The Secretary may conduct recruiting programs for the Corps at institutions of higher education and recruit highly qualified elementary or secondary school teachers. Selection for the Corps is based on applications meeting specified criteria, including a bachelor's degree. Priority is given to individuals with a master's degree in education, science, technology, engineering, or mathematics. Teachers in elementary or secondary schools must be highly qualified with 10 or more years of experience or equivalent qualifications as determined by the Secretary. The Secretary may reimburse applicants for actual and reasonable travel expenses to Corps sites for evaluation and may set a maximum reimbursement amount. Participants in the Corps will be placed at designated sites. The Secretary will place Corps participants at local educational agencies or charter schools designated as Corps sites, considering preferences and teacher shortages. Participants must sign a participation agreement. Participants selected for the Corps must sign an agreement with the Secretary, committing to become certified as a teacher and accepting a full-time teaching position at a local educational agency or charter school for a minimum of 3 years. The Secretary has the authority to waive the 3-year commitment if necessary. Upon completion of the 3-year commitment, a Corps participant's agreement may be renewed annually. Waivers may be granted by the Secretary if deemed appropriate, relieving participants from agreement violations and reimbursement obligations. SEC. 8. COMPENSATION FOR CORPS PARTICIPANTS. Corps participants are considered employees of the local educational agency or charter school where they work and are compensated at the same rates as other employees in similar positions. Federal funds received by participants should supplement, not replace, their compensation. The Secretary may reimburse participants for travel expenses incurred by themselves and one family member. The Secretary may award cash bonuses to Corps participants with certain qualifications, and may also reimburse travel expenses for the participant and one family member once per year. The Secretary may award cash bonuses to Corps participants with specific qualifications, including those with 10 or more years of teaching experience in elementary or secondary schools, or equivalent qualifications as determined by the Secretary. The eligibility of Corps participants for Federal student financial assistance under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 shall not consider any cash bonuses awarded by the Secretary. SEC. 9. ALTERNATIVE CERTIFICATION ROUTE. The Secretary and each Corps site will develop a high-quality alternative certification route for non-certified teachers in high-need subjects. Priority will be given to individuals without an education degree and expertise in subjects with teacher shortages. All classes and materials will be accessible to Corps participants. The Secretary and each Corps site will develop an alternative certification program for non-certified teachers in high-need subjects. Corps sites with existing programs may allow individuals to participate in those programs instead of developing a new one. Professional development and distance learning are addressed in Section 10. The Secretary will develop a professional development and distance-learning program to help individuals in remote areas become highly qualified teachers. Grants will be awarded to institutions of higher education offering the program. Grants are provided to higher education institutions offering a professional development program for teachers in remote areas. The funds cover program administration costs and tuition for teachers at Corps sites. Institutions must submit an application to the Secretary to receive the grant. The institution must include the program in its articulation agreements with other higher education institutions as required by the Secretary. SEC. 11. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, terms defined in specific sections of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 and the Higher Education Act of 1965 are given their respective meanings. An \"articulation agreement\" is defined in the Higher Education Act, while an \"institution of higher education\" is defined in the same Act. Additionally, a \"qualified remote area\" is described as an area more than 3 hours away from a higher education institution using public or private transportation. The term \"United States Territory\" refers to specific regions including the United States Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Puerto Rico. These areas may have limited access, requiring transportation by boat or airplane for at least 6 months of the year. SEC. 12. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Sums may be appropriated as necessary for this Act."
