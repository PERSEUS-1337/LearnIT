A report discusses the economic impact of transportation infrastructure funding in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). ARRA was a response to the Great Recession, the most severe economic downturn since the 1930s. Unemployment rose to 10% in 2009, and ARRA was the largest fiscal stimulus measure passed by Congress in reaction to the recession. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) was a fiscal stimulus measure passed by Congress in response to the Great Recession. The law cost the federal government $787 billion from FY2009 through FY2019, with infrastructure accounting for approximately $100 billion to $150 billion. Programs administered by the U.S. Department of Transportation received $48.1 billion, while other public works infrastructure funding included projects for Army Corps of Engineers, clean water revolving funds, drinking water revolving funds, and federal land management agencies. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) authorized federal infrastructure investment in four ways: direct spending on federal infrastructure, grants to nonfederal entities, tax preferences for nonfederal investment, and credit assistance. This included funding for state and local governments to issue tax credit bonds for capital spending, totaling about $36 billion. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) provided funding for infrastructure through bonds, credit assistance, and grants to nonfederal entities. It supplemented DOT's regular FY2009 funding by 72%, with over half allocated to highways. Funding had to be obligated by the end of FY2010 and expended by FY2015. Most of the public transportation funding was distributed by formula, with exceptions for specific programs like the Capital Investment Grant program and high-speed rail projects. ARRA also created new discretionary programs for economic stimulus, including Transportation Investment. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) provided funding for infrastructure through various programs, including Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grants. States had to certify that the grants would supplement their planned transportation spending. ARRA transportation funding was spent more slowly compared to other types of assistance like unemployment compensation. About 9% of DOT's ARRA funding was spent within the first six months, while 44% of unemployment compensation was spent in the same timeframe. The majority of DOT's ARRA funding was spent in FY2010 (37%) and FY2011 (24%), with another 11% spent in FY2012. ARRA funding was provided on a reimbursable basis, requiring completion of eligible projects before federal payment. Criticism of infrastructure spending as an economic stimulus included concerns about slow expenditures and the concept of \"shovel-ready\" projects. CBO data shows almost half of DOT's ARRA funding was spent within about 18 months. The Obama Administration argued that slow infrastructure spending under ARRA could benefit the economy during a deep recession. Different types of stimulus have varying speeds of impact, with aid to individuals being spent quickly and new investment projects taking more time. Despite infrastructure funding being slower than other forms of support, there were differences in expenditure rates among programs. Highway and transit funding were distributed by DOT agencies. The Obama Administration argued that slow infrastructure spending under ARRA could benefit the economy during a deep recession. Highway and transit funding were distributed by DOT agencies through existing programs, while discretionary funds for new programs took longer to distribute due to program design and application processes. High-speed rail funding was particularly delayed in distribution. The Federal Railroad Administration struggled with slow expenditure of high-speed rail funding, with only 8% spent three years after ARRA enactment. Unlike other DOT programs, the FRA lacked experience in administering large grant funds. However, the Capital Investment Grant Program for transit projects showed an exception with faster funding distribution for new public transportation systems. Eligible projects included transit rail like subway, light rail, and commuter rail. The Federal Transit Administration distributed $750 million from the ARRA to 11 transit projects already under construction, with 63% spent within one year and 100% within two years. State and local agencies found it easier to quickly spend funds on small-scale projects. The Government Accountability Office found that more than two-thirds of highway funds were committed for pavement. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that the majority of highway funds were used for pavement improvement projects, while transit funds were mainly allocated to upgrading existing facilities and purchasing buses. Airport funding was directed towards runway and taxiway rehabilitation, as well as air navigation infrastructure upgrades. Public spending on transportation has been decreasing since 2003, with a temporary increase in 2010 and 2011 due to infrastructure funding from ARRA. State and local expenditures on transportation infrastructure have been consistently declining, except for 2009. State and local spending on transportation infrastructure decreased by 8% in 2013 compared to 2007, due to the long-term impact of the Great Recession on budgets. Despite the temporary increase in infrastructure funding from ARRA in 2010 and 2011, 2013 saw the lowest spending on major infrastructure systems since the late 1990s. Highway infrastructure spending declined from 2009 to 2013, with federal spending not fully offsetting the decrease in state and local government spending. The Great Recession led to a significant drop in tax revenue for state and local governments, affecting transportation funding. State and local governments faced reduced tax revenue during the recession, making it challenging to maintain transportation infrastructure spending. The federal government provided 100% funding for transportation projects under ARRA, but states had to certify their planned spending. GAO found that meeting the maintenance-of-effort requirements for transportation programs was difficult for governors. Despite challenges in maintaining transportation infrastructure spending due to reduced tax revenue during the recession, the federal government provided 100% funding for transportation projects under ARRA. However, states struggled to certify planned spending, leading to substantial substitution of federal dollars for state dollars in highway funding. Analysis showed that for every dollar of federal aid in ARRA for highways, overall spending increased by 19 cents, with states decreasing their own spending by 81 cents. The ARRA funding had modest employment effects in infrastructure sectors, with a decrease in highway construction employment from 2007 to 2009. Employment saw a slight increase in 2010 due to ARRA funding, but a sustained increase only began in 2015. The number of highway construction workers returned to pre-recession levels in 2018. ARRA funding likely helped maintain employment levels in transportation construction and other sectors by allowing state and local governments to shift expenditures. The financial crisis and recession affected state and local credit markets, making it difficult for governments to raise funds through tax-exempt municipal bonds. Limited access to financing may have contributed to a decline in infrastructure investment by state and local governments. The Build America Bond (BAB) program, part of the ARRA stimulus package, allowed state and local governments to issue taxable bonds with a 35% interest cost subsidy from the federal government. This attracted investors without federal tax liability, like pension funds, and lowered borrowing costs for infrastructure investments. The Build America Bond (BAB) program allowed state and local governments to issue taxable bonds with a federal subsidy, attracting investors like pension funds and lowering borrowing costs for infrastructure projects. BABs were more efficient than traditional municipal bonds as all federal subsidies went to the government issuer. Over 2,200 BAB issuances totaling $181 billion funded projects such as education, water/sewer, highways, and transit. Without BABs, these projects would have been funded with traditional tax-exempt bonds at a higher cost to issuers. The Treasury reported a surge in BAB issuance in late 2010, indicating accelerated capital financings. BABs required issuers to pay 65% of interest costs, shifting more infrastructure costs to state and local governments. The federal subsidy for BABs was spread over subsequent years. ARRA included time limits on transportation fund expenditure, with half spent within 20 months of enactment. Funding mainly went to routine projects. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) allocated funding for transportation projects, with half to be spent within 20 months of enactment. While some funds went to quick-to-implement projects like highway paving and bus purchases, larger projects requiring detailed reviews were not \"shovel-ready.\" This led to concerns that ARRA did not support long-term economic investments. State officials mentioned that deadlines limited project selection, but ARRA funding allowed completion of state-of-good-repair projects, potentially freeing up resources for future larger projects. Smaller state-of-good-repair projects were found to have higher benefit-cost ratios than new projects. The Department of Transportation (DOT) report shows that smaller state-of-good-repair projects have higher benefit-cost ratios than large \"game changing\" projects. DOT found that in 2014, 76% of highway spending was on state-of-good-repair projects, but 79% should be allocated for maximum economic benefits. For public transportation, 64% to 74% of infrastructure spending should go to state-of-good-repair projects, compared to the 60% spent in 2014."
