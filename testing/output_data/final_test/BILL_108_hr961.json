    "content": "The \"Upper Mississippi River Basin Protection Act\" includes provisions for the establishment of a sediment and nutrient monitoring network, data collection responsibilities, collaboration with existing monitoring efforts, reporting requirements, and a National Research Council assessment. Additionally, the Act addresses computer modeling and research in the region. The \"Upper Mississippi River Basin Protection Act\" includes provisions for computer modeling and research of sediment and nutrient sources, electronic distribution of information, reporting requirements, authorization of appropriations, and cost-sharing requirements. The Act defines the Upper Mississippi River Basin as the watershed portion of the Upper Mississippi River and Illinois River basins, including the Kaskaskia and Meramec watersheds. It also establishes the Upper Mississippi River Stewardship Initiative to monitor nutrient and sediment loss in the Basin using sound science methods. The Upper Mississippi River Basin Act establishes the Upper Mississippi River Stewardship Initiative to monitor nutrient and sediment loss using sound science methods, including quantifying sources, transport, and fate of nutrients and sediment, and evaluating the impact of treatment methods or conservation measures. Sound science protocols for data collection, analysis, and peer review are essential. Federal investments in the Upper Mississippi River Basin must be guided by sound science. Establishment of a monitoring network is outlined in Title I. The Secretary of the Interior will establish a sediment and nutrient monitoring network for the Upper Mississippi River Basin to identify sources, quantify processes, record changes over time, provide data for computer modeling, and identify major sources of sediment and nutrients. The Secretary of the Interior will establish a sediment and nutrient monitoring network for the Upper Mississippi River Basin to identify major sources of sediment and nutrients. The United States Geological Survey will assist in carrying out this task. SEC. 102. DATA COLLECTION AND STORAGE RESPONSIBILITIES. The Secretary of the Interior will establish guidelines for sediment and nutrient monitoring data collection, storage, and reporting. Data from the Upper Mississippi River Basin monitoring will be released to the public with generic identifiers. Privacy protection measures are in place for data from this monitoring. The data from the Upper Mississippi River Basin monitoring will be released to the public with generic identifiers, subject to disclosure provisions of section 552 of title 5, United States Code. SEC. 103. RELATIONSHIP TO EXISTING SEDIMENT AND NUTRIENT MONITORING. The Secretary of the Interior will inventory existing sediment and nutrient monitoring efforts to understand overlap, data gaps, and redundancies. They will integrate these efforts into the monitoring network required by section 101, making maximum use of existing data and programs. The Secretary of the Interior will coordinate with the long-term estuary assessment project to develop the sediment and nutrient monitoring network required by section 101. The Secretary of the Interior will collaborate with other monitoring programs to establish the sediment and nutrient monitoring network. Reporting to Congress is required within 180 days of the enactment of this Act. The National Research Council will assess water resources in the Upper Mississippi River Basin. SEC. 201. COMPUTER MODELING AND RESEARCH OF SEDIMENT AND NUTRIENT SOURCES. The Upper Mississippi River Stewardship Initiative requires the establishment of a modeling program by the Director of the United States Geological Survey to identify significant sources of sediment and nutrients in the Upper Mississippi River Basin. Computer modeling will be used to pinpoint subwatersheds contributing to sediment and nutrient loss for targeted reduction efforts. The program includes models relating nutrient and sediment loss to landscape, land use, and management practices, as well as defining river channel nutrient transformation processes. Models will define river channel nutrient transformation processes, collecting ancillary information in GIS format to support modeling and management use, including land use, soils, elevation, sediment and nutrient reduction actions, and remotely sensed data. The Director of the US Geological Survey will establish an Internet system within 90 days to provide information on programs, sediment/nutrient levels, and successful projects in the Upper Mississippi River Basin. Reporting requirements are also outlined. SEC. 203. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.\n\nThe Director of the US Geological Survey will provide annual reports to Congress and the public on monitoring activities in the Upper Mississippi River Basin, starting one year after the Act's enactment. Every three years, progress reports on modeling activities will also be provided. SEC. 301. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. $6,250,000 annually for US Geological Survey activities, with $650,000 for National Research Council assessment. SEC. 302. COST-SHARING REQUIREMENTS. SEC. 302. COST-SHARING REQUIREMENTS. Funds for the US Geological Survey Cooperative Water Program must adhere to the same cost-sharing rules as specified in the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2002."
