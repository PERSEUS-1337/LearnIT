    "content": "The \"National Flood Mapping Act of 2005\" is defined in terms of maps, the Secretary of the Army, and the Under Secretary for Emergency Preparedness and Response. It aims to identify flood-prone areas. The National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 is amended to establish, update, and maintain flood-risk zone data in cooperation with State and local mapping partners. It also includes the identification and mapping of flood hazard areas and flood-risk zones. The National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 is amended to establish, update, and maintain flood-risk zone data in cooperation with State and local mapping partners. This includes the identification and mapping of flood hazard areas and flood-risk zones, as well as the review and updating of maps in coastal areas. Flood insurance rate maps and related information must be made available on the FEMA website in a specific format. The National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 is amended to establish flood-risk zone data in digital geospatial format. The Technical Mapping Advisory Council makes recommendations on mapping flood risk areas efficiently in the United States. The National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 is amended to establish flood-risk zone data in digital geospatial format, including procedures for delegating mapping activities to State and local government partners. Subsection (k) is removed. The National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 is amended to establish flood-risk zone data in digital geospatial format, including procedures for delegating mapping activities to State and local government partners. Subsection (k) is removed. Additionally, a National Flood Mapping Program is established. The Under Secretary, in coordination with the Technical Mapping Advisory Council, establishes a program to review, update, and maintain National Flood Insurance Program rate maps. Each updated map includes the 500-year floodplain and areas at risk of inundation due to levee failure. The Under Secretary updates maps to include areas at risk of inundation from dam failures, coastal inundation data from the Corps of Engineers and NOAA, and storm surge modeling information. The Under Secretary updates maps with relevant information on stream flows, watershed characteristics, topography, and hazard areas such as land subsidence, coastal erosion, sediment flow, mud flow, ice jam, and areas prone to failure. The Under Secretary updates maps with information on structural protective works like levees, dams, and floodwalls to ensure they are adequate for flood risk determinations and use by State and local governments in managing development to reduce flooding risks. Standards are established to facilitate consistent data collection and analysis methods for communities with similar flood risks. In updating and maintaining maps, the Under Secretary prioritizes coastal areas affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita for guidance on hurricane recovery efforts. $400,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2006 to 2012. The Secretary will identify coastal areas at risk of hurricanes for the National Flood Insurance Program, with $9,000,000 authorized for implementation. The Comptroller General will review regulations related to floodplain management. The Comptroller General will review regulations on floodplain management to assess Federal agency compliance with an Executive order and recommend restrictions on Federal investment in floodplains. The Secretary is required to maintain and publish an inventory of levees in the United States for the National Flood Insurance Program."
