    "content": "The \"Supporting Transparent Regulatory and Environmental Actions in Mining Act\" or the \"STREAM Act\" requires the publication of scientific products for rules, environmental impact statements, assessments, and economic assessments under Title V of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977. The STREAM Act mandates the Secretary to make all scientific products used in developing rules and assessments publicly available 90 days before publication. This includes raw data for federally funded scientific products to ensure transparency and compliance. The STREAM Act requires the Secretary to release scientific products used in rule development 90 days before publication. If the products are not made available, the comment period for draft rules is extended, and the effective date of final rules is delayed. If products are withheld for over 6 months, the rule must be withdrawn unless there is a threat to human life.

The Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the Interstate Mining Compact Commission and its State members, will conduct a study with the National Academy of Sciences to assess the effectiveness of the Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Operations Permanent Regulatory Program in protecting streams through stream buffer zones. If inefficiencies are found, recommendations for improvement will be included in the study. The Board on Earth Sciences and Resources will report study results to relevant committees and agencies, with authorized funding of $1,000,000 for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. The Secretary is prohibited from issuing new regulations related to the Stream Protection Rule. The Secretary is prohibited from issuing new regulations related to the Stream Protection Rule until study results are submitted.
