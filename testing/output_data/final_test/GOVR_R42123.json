    "content": "The Department of the Interior (DOI) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have jurisdiction over air pollutant emissions from outer continental shelf (OCS) operations in different locations. DOI oversees OCS sources in federal waters in the western Gulf of Mexico and most of the central Gulf, while EPA has jurisdiction over sources in all other federal waters. This results in different regulatory programs with separate statutes and regulations, leading to varying requirements and compliance obligations for similar operations in different jurisdictions. The DOI and EPA have jurisdiction over air emissions from OCS operations in different regions, leading to varying requirements and compliance obligations. Differences in treatment and opportunities for oil and gas development have been criticized. The Gulf of Mexico has a divided jurisdiction, with more production wells in DOI's jurisdiction. After moratoria expired in 2008, areas in EPA's jurisdiction could potentially open for oil and gas development. The moratoria on OCS operations expired in 2008, potentially opening up areas for oil and gas leasing. Interest in oil and gas resources has expanded beyond the Gulf, with attention on OCS areas off the Atlantic coast. The Obama Administration canceled a lease sale off Virginia after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The House has passed bills to expand OCS oil and gas development in specific areas. Interest in developing OCS resources in EPA's jurisdiction has increased, leading to scrutiny on the permit activity of Shell in the Chukchi Sea. This resulted in the transfer of air emission authority in the OCS off Alaska's north coast from EPA to DOI through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012. The report will provide an overview of regulatory programs for air emissions from OCS oil and gas operations. Emission sources vary based on operation specifics, with offshore drilling units in deepwater emitting more than those in shallow water. Mexico may emit more emissions than a rig in shallow water. Arctic operations with icebreaker vessels generate higher emissions. A Senate Report from the 1990 Clean Air Act highlighted significant air pollution from OCS facilities impacting coastal air quality in the US. Emissions from OCS platforms and marine vessels can exceed 500 tons of nitrogen (NO x ) and 100 tons of reactive hydrocarbons annually. EPA permit documents confirm these estimates, especially for nitrogen oxide (NO x ) emissions. Selected OCS oil/gas operations show varying emission ranges for air pollutants in EPA's jurisdiction. For each source, NO x emissions are the main regulated pollutants, with some emitting as much pollution as a large oil refinery. The history of federal OCS air emission governance can provide insight for policymakers, as it may explain the current framework and relevant arguments. The Submerged Lands Act and the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act established federal jurisdiction for oil and gas resources on the Outer Continental Shelf. The Environmental Protection Agency was established in 1970, and the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970 laid the foundation for the federal air emissions program. The 1970 Clean Air Act set national air quality standards and regulations for air pollution control. In 1977, amendments included the prevention of significant deterioration program. The jurisdictional uncertainty between the Clean Air Act and the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act led to the EPA asserting authority over air emissions from OCS sources in 1978. In 1978, the Department of the Interior gained authority to regulate air emissions from offshore oil and gas operations. A federal appeals court affirmed DOI's authority in 1979. Concerns about OCS source air emissions in California persisted, with a 1992 report highlighting unique offshore air pollution issues in the state. Atmospheric conditions in coastal California trap smog due to sunlight, pollutants, winds, and mountains. Congress amended the Clean Air Act in 1990, allowing EPA to regulate air quality at offshore facilities. EPA issued regulations for OCS sources in 1992, with DOI overseeing facilities not under EPA jurisdiction. Section 328(b) required a study on OCS sources in nonattainment areas. The study assessed the impacts of OCS sources in nonattainment areas failing to meet NAAQS for ozone or nitrogen dioxide. MMS published a study in 1995 concluding that OCS petroleum development has a small contribution to onshore ozone concentrations. Decades-long moratoria on oil and gas development in much of the OCS have influenced interest in OCS air emission issues. President Bush lifted executive moratoria in 2008, including planning areas along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. The moratoria on oil and gas development in much of the OCS expired in 2008, potentially opening areas along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts for leasing activity. EPA's OCS program, governed by CAA Section 328, has separate regulatory regimes for inner and outer OCS sources based on distance from state boundaries. Multiple legal and administrative processes are required before drilling can occur in a specific area. Section 328 of the Clean Air Act directs EPA to develop regulations for OCS sources to meet ambient air quality standards and comply with the PSD program. It also establishes a comprehensive program for inner sources, requiring them to meet onshore emission control requirements. EPA promulgated regulations in 1992 for OCS source air emissions, which reference other CAA regulations for guidance. The Clean Air Act (CAA) regulations for outer OCS sources are less complex compared to inner OCS sources. EPA has the authority to determine regulations for outer sources under CAA Section 328. Outer OCS sources must comply with federal regulations, including the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program, New Source Performance Standards (NSPS), National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPS), and CAA Title V permitting provisions. The PSD program was added to the CAA in 1977 to address new emission sources affecting areas meeting NAAQS. OCS sources must comply with PSD provisions if they qualify as a \"major stationary source\" based on an annual emissions threshold of 250 tpy. Oil and gas activities may approach or exceed this threshold. As of January 2, 2011, OCS sources must consider greenhouse gas emissions. EPA is phasing in GHG applicability for the PSD program, with new sources subject to PSD if GHG emissions exceed 100,000 tpy of CO2e. If already subject to PSD for other pollutants, the GHG threshold is 75,000 tpy of CO2e. BACT must be applied for each regulated pollutant emitted in significant amounts for sources meeting the definition of a \"major stationary source.\" BACT is determined on a case-by-case basis for sources emitting significant amounts of pollutants. Most states have the authority to set BACT for applicable sources under the PSD program, with EPA Regions determining BACT for OCS sources in locations without Part 55 authority. Sources must show their emissions won't violate NAAQS or allowable increases over baseline concentrations. EPA is phasing in GHG applicability for the PSD program, with new sources subject to PSD if GHG emissions exceed 100,000 tpy of CO2e. To demonstrate compliance with BACT requirements, sources must provide an air quality analysis for each pollutant emitted in significant amounts, including one year of continuous monitoring data. Additional analysis on visibility and impacts to soils and vegetation is also required. If emissions may affect a Class I area, EPA consults with the Federal Land Manager to assess adverse impacts like reduced visibility. If accepted, the source won't receive a permit; if not, EPA must provide a public explanation. EPA may also require ongoing ambient air monitoring post-permit issuance. OCS exploratory drilling operations may be exempt from certain PSD program requirements if emissions are below pollutant-specific thresholds. The exemption has conditions regarding impact on Class I areas and the temporary nature of emissions. Sources meeting these conditions are not subject to air quality demonstration and analyses. EPA has the authority to require emissions monitoring during operation. Several OCS exploratory drilling operations with EPA air permits are considered temporary sources and must comply with NSPS in 40 C.F.R. Part 60. NSPS are technology-based standards for emission sources, which may include numerical limits or equipment standards. OCS draft permits may identify specific equipment with NSPS. OCS sources may also be subject to NESHAP regulations under CAA Section 112. Compliance with these regulations is required under Part 55. EPA regulations under CAA Section 112 establish emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants from specific sources. OCS oil/gas drilling operations may not be subject to Part 61 provisions but could fall under Part 63 requirements for equipment like reciprocating internal combustion engines. The Title V permit program under the Clean Air Act aims to streamline administrative and enforcement processes by consolidating all applicable requirements into a single permit. This program sets a lower emissions threshold of 100 tpy for regulated pollutants compared to the PSD program's threshold of 250 tpy. While some may see Title V permits as non-substantive, others may find them burdensome. Title V permits are issued for five-year periods and must be renewed thereafter, requiring emissions limitations, monitoring, recordkeeping, reporting, fee payments, and annual certification. Inner OCS sources must comply with all requirements for outer OCS sources and any state/local air emissions regulations. In case of conflict, the stricter regulations apply. The location of the inner OCS source determines its emission requirements based on the CAA and varying state/local regulations. The Clean Air Act (CAA) sets more stringent standards for nonattainment areas, where inner OCS sources may be subject to the lowest achievable emission rate (LAER). New or modified sources must offset emissions from existing sources. Coastal non-attainment areas for pollutants common to OCS operations are mainly in California and the Mid-Atlantic. EPA recently issued OCS air permits in the eastern Gulf of Mexico and off the northern Coast of Alaska. If OCS operations expand, nonattainment areas in California and the Mid-Atlantic may be affected. Owners/operators of inner OCS sources must submit a Notice of Intent (NOI) to EPA and state agencies, including emission estimates and impact analysis. The NOI must also include emission information from associated vessels. The purpose is to allow state agencies to decide if they want to request corresponding onshore area (COA) designation for OCS sources to comply with onshore emission provisions. The Clean Air Act allows EPA to designate a corresponding onshore area (COA) for OCS sources with stricter emission controls. State agencies can request COA redesignation, which EPA must decide within 240 days. Exploratory OCS sources are not eligible for COA redesignation due to operational duration constraints. EPA regulations prioritize emissions from vessels associated with OCS operations. The Clean Air Act allows EPA to designate a corresponding onshore area (COA) for OCS sources with stricter emission controls. State agencies can request COA redesignation, which EPA must decide within 240 days. In some offshore oil and gas operations, emissions from vessels may represent a substantial percentage of overall air emissions. Activities on the Outer Continental Shelf include platform and drill ship exploration, construction, development, production, processing, and transportation. Emissions from vessels associated with OCS sources are regulated under Section 328(a)(4)(C). EPA regulations (40 C.F.R. Part 55) interpret vessels as OCS sources when attached to the seabed or an OCS facility. Vessels may need to comply with PSD and BACT requirements if classified as OCS sources. Support vessels' emissions within 25 miles of an OCS source must be accounted for in regulation. Support vessels' emissions within 25 miles of an OCS source must be included in the source's \"potential to emit,\" which could push the emissions over regulatory thresholds. Coastal states can request authority to enforce air emission rules for OCS sources in federal waters near state waters. Governors must submit state regulations to the EPA Administrator for approval. If a state doesn't seek delegation, EPA enforces the program. EPA may enforce stricter standards if a neighboring state has received a COA redesignation. If a neighboring state has received a COA redesignation, EPA may enforce stricter standards for air pollution control agencies in California. Only four agencies have authority to implement Part 55, likely due to moratoria. EPA enforces regulations for sources within its jurisdiction, including state/local air emission regulations for inner OCS sources. Opening more OCS areas to oil/gas activities could change this dynamic. Part 55 does not specify administrative procedures but references statutory provisions. Procedural time frames for PSD and Title V permits apply to outer OCS sources, while inner OCS sources follow onshore standards. When EPA prepares a draft permit, it must allow 30 days for public comment and may extend the comment period. Parties can request a public hearing if there is significant public interest. PSD and Title V permits are subject to an appeals process with the Environmental Appeals Board. The Environmental Appeals Board (EAB) may review permit conditions and issue decisions within a reasonable time. Parties can contest EPA's permit decisions in court, with judicial review governed by relevant environmental statutes. The DOI has authority over OCS air emissions under the 1978 OCSLA. The DOI has authority over OCS air emissions under the 1978 OCSLA, directing the Secretary to promulgate regulations for compliance with national ambient air quality standards. Regulations were initially established in 1980 and were restructured in 1998, with recent administrative changes leading to further restructuring in 2011. An October 2011 rule separated BOEM and BSEE regulations, creating 30 C.F.R. Part 550 for BOEM provisions without adding or removing OCS requirements. The DOI made organizational changes to accommodate administrative changes without altering OCS requirements. Leaseholders must submit and receive approval for activity-specific plans before conducting operations on the OCS, such as Exploration Plans for exploration activities and Development and Production Plans for development and production activities. BOEM reviews and approves these plans. BOEM reviews and approves activity-specific plans for operations on the OCS, including projected emissions of pollutants like SO2, NOx, and VOC. Requirements apply regardless of jurisdiction, with exemptions based on emissions and distance from shore. The exemption formula for OCS sources is E = 33.3D, where E is the exemption threshold in tpy and D is the distance from shore in miles. OCS sources located beyond the exemption threshold are subject to air emission requirements. The primary threshold for EPA's requirements is 250 tpy, with states possibly having lower thresholds. Non-exempt OCS sources must determine if projected emissions would significantly affect onshore air quality, with VOC emissions automatically deemed significant. Approved air quality models are used for this determination. The DOI regulations require monitoring of air emissions from non-exempt OCS sources to assess their impact on onshore air quality. If air pollutant concentrations exceed specified levels, the facility's emissions would significantly affect onshore air quality. The significance levels are the same as those required by the EPA for new major sources impacting neighboring nonattainment areas. Additional requirements apply depending on whether the impacted onshore area is an attainment or nonattainment area, with more stringent requirements applying if multiple areas are impacted. The DOI regulations mandate monitoring of air emissions from OCS sources, regardless of exempt status. Lessees must submit monthly emission data, but compliance is uncertain. In nonattainment areas, sources must reduce emissions significantly and apply BACT, verified by a regional BOEM official. EPA imposes LAER for new sources in nonattainment areas, potentially stricter than BACT. If BACT is insufficient, additional measures are required at OCS sources under DOI jurisdiction. The DOI regulations require OCS sources to make additional reductions or acquire emission offsets if emissions affect attainment areas. BACT must be applied to emissions of any air pollutant that would significantly impact air quality in the area. Lessees must also assess if emissions of TSP or SO2 would exceed specified thresholds after applying BACT. EPA regulations differ from DOI's, reflecting standards from 1980. EPA's regulations address PM10 and NO2 emissions, while DOI's focus on TSP emissions. The EPA has revised standards and added new pollutants for OCS sources, including temporary facilities lasting less than three years. Vessel emissions in DOI's jurisdiction are treated the same as in EPA's jurisdiction. Support vessel emissions servicing OCS sources are considered direct emissions. DOI's regulatory text on vessel emissions does not align precisely with the CAA text. The DOI regulations on vessel emissions do not align precisely with the CAA text. DOI's guidance on emission calculations for plan submittals follows the statutory text, with shorter time frames for agency review compared to EPA. Lessees must certify the \"consistency\" of Exploration Plans and Development and Production Plans with approved coastal zone management programs. The CZMA consistency provision requires coordination with CAA requirements. States can object to a lessee's plan if it is inconsistent with their coastal zone management program. Lessees must either revise their plan or appeal to the Secretary of Commerce. Most states have concurred with federal actions, with only a few appeals related to offshore energy activities. The last appeal decision was made in 1999. The CZMA consistency provision requires coordination with CAA requirements. States can object to a lessee's plan if it is inconsistent with their coastal zone management program. The existence of the consistency requirement and uncertainty of appeal outcomes have led applicants to negotiate with states and modify proposed actions early on, reducing the number of appeals. CZMA regulations indicate that some OCS activities may not require review, especially as activities move farther offshore. NOAA states that a coastal state's review authority stops where coastal effects are not \"reasonably foreseeable,\" determined on a case-by-case basis with the state, lessee, and DOI. The DPP regulations mandate a 60-day comment period for parties to submit comments or recommendations to BOEM Regional. The EP process does not allow public participation, but the OCSLA provides for judicial review of agency actions. Table 6 compares elements of the EPA and DOI air emission programs for outer OCS sources. Inner OCS sources must meet requirements similar to onshore sources, with potentially stricter regulations in some areas. The primary difference between the EPA and DOI air emission programs for outer OCS sources is rooted in the different statutory authorities: the 1990 CAA and the 1978 OCSLA. The two regulatory programs reflect the underlying differences in objectives - air quality versus offshore energy development. OCS sources in EPA's jurisdiction must comply with the PSD program, while sources subject to DOI's regime must comply only if their emissions would \"significantly affect\" a state's air quality, resulting in a considerably different scope of applicability between the two programs. The EPA and DOI have different thresholds for air emission programs for outer OCS sources. EPA's PSD program applies to sources in its jurisdiction, while DOI's regime applies only if emissions significantly affect a state's air quality. EPA's permit process allows more public input, while DOI has a different time frame for reviewing permits. Stakeholders may debate the balance between resource development and environmental concerns in EPA's process. Policymakers may show increased interest if more OCS areas are open for oil and gas leasing."
