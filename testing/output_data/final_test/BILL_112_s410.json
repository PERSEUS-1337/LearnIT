The term \"presiding judge\" in this section refers to the judge overseeing the court proceeding, with specific criteria for different court settings.

The presiding judge of an appellate court may allow media coverage of court proceedings, with exceptions. The presiding judge of a district court in the United States has the authority to determine if an action would violate the due process rights of any party in a proceeding. This authority is granted notwithstanding any other provision of law, except in specific circumstances. The presiding judge of a district court in the United States may allow the photographing, recording, broadcasting, or televising of court proceedings, with the option to obscure the face and voice of witnesses upon request. The presiding judge may allow the broadcast of court proceedings but must inform non-party witnesses of their right to request their image and voice be obscured during testimony. The judge cannot allow this if it violates due process rights. The presiding judge has discretion to obscure the face and voice of an individual in court proceedings if there is good cause to believe that it would threaten their safety. Media coverage of jurors is not allowed, including photographing, recording, broadcasting, or televising them during trial or jury selection.
