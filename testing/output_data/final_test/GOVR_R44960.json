    "content": "Companies are increasingly using arbitration clauses in consumer and employment agreements, requiring disputes to be resolved through a neutral third party instead of in court. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found that millions of consumers are subject to arbitration clauses, and in nonunion workplaces, about a quarter of employees have mandatory arbitration agreements. While arbitration is seen as a quicker and cheaper alternative to litigation, critics argue that it denies consumers and employees the benefits of a jury trial. The Federal Arbitration Act, enacted in 1925, ensures the validity and enforcement of arbitration agreements. The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) was enacted in 1925 to ensure the validity and enforcement of arbitration agreements in maritime and commercial transactions. The U.S. Supreme Court views the FAA as promoting a national policy favoring arbitration. However, legal questions arise due to state law requirements and different types of arbitration agreements. Recent federal regulatory actions and proposed legislation aim to address concerns about the lack of choice in submitting claims to arbitration. The FAA's preemption of state law requirements and the Court's decisions on mandatory arbitration are also examined in this report. The report discusses the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) and the U.S. Supreme Court's decisions on mandatory arbitration agreements. The Court will review cases challenging agreements that restrict class actions, citing violations of the National Labor Relations Act. Section 2 of the FAA states the validity of arbitration agreements in commerce transactions, with exceptions for revocation based on legal or equitable grounds. The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) promotes the enforcement of arbitration agreements, historically viewed with hostility by American courts due to English influence. The Court's decision in Red Cross Line v. Atlantic Fruit Company in 1924 paved the way for federal legislation recognizing the validity of arbitration agreements. The United States Arbitration Act, signed by President Calvin Coolidge in 1925, declared a national policy favoring arbitration and removed the power of states to require a judicial forum for resolving claims agreed to be arbitrated. Congress aimed to protect arbitration agreements and saw the benefits of reducing the costliness and delays of litigation through valid arbitration agreements. The Federal Arbitration Act, signed in 1925, promotes arbitration and limits state power to mandate judicial resolution. Valid arbitration agreements can eliminate litigation costs and delays. The scope of contracts covered by the FAA's enforcement of arbitration agreements in commerce transactions has been debated in courts. The Federal Arbitration Act promotes arbitration in commerce transactions, with courts debating the scope of contracts covered by the Act. Courts have interpreted the phrase \"involving commerce\" broadly, considering Congress's power under the Commerce Clause. The Supreme Court's interpretation of the phrase \"involving commerce\" in the Federal Arbitration Act is broad, indicating Congress's full exercise of power under the Commerce Clause. The Court emphasized an expansive congressional intent, stating that the Act's control over interstate commerce extends to contracts related to interstate subjects and contracts in admiralty. The word \"involve\" is equated to \"affect\" in this context. The Supreme Court interpreted the phrase \"involving commerce\" broadly in the Federal Arbitration Act, equating it to \"affecting commerce.\" The Court determined that the FAA applies to all contracts involving commerce without requiring a contemplation of an interstate commerce connection by the parties, as this would contradict the Act's purpose of facilitating dispute resolution. The Court's decision aimed to prevent additional litigation about parties' contemplations and uphold an expedited dispute resolution system. The Supreme Court confirmed in 2001 that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) covers employment agreements requiring arbitration for work-related disputes. The Court held that the FAA's exemption clause only applies to specific transportation workers, not all employment contracts. The Supreme Court confirmed in 2001 that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) covers employment agreements requiring arbitration for work-related disputes, excluding specific transportation workers like seamen and railroad employees. The Court emphasized that excluding all employment contracts from the FAA's coverage would undermine the statute's specific enumeration of these categories. The Supreme Court has noted that state laws have historically regulated arbitration agreements alongside the FAA, with some states imposing restrictions on mandatory arbitration clauses in cases of unequal bargaining power. Section 2 of the FAA limits grounds for denying enforcement. The Supreme Court has recognized that the FAA restricts grounds for denying enforcement of arbitration agreements, preempting state laws that interfere with these contracts. State legislatures and courts have challenged mandatory arbitration agreements, but the Court consistently rules in favor of FAA supremacy. The preemption doctrine, originating from the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, establishes that federal law supersedes state law in cases of conflict. This can occur through express or implied preemption, where federal statutes may displace existing state laws. Federal preemption is guided by the purpose of Congress, with the ultimate goal of ensuring federal laws prevail over conflicting state laws. The preemption doctrine states that federal law supersedes state law through express or implied preemption. The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) does not have an express preemption clause but can supersede state laws that undermine its goals. The FAA aims to enforce arbitration agreements to streamline proceedings. The Supreme Court has emphasized that the FAA requires arbitration agreements to be treated equally with other contracts, preempting state laws that single out arbitration clauses for hostile treatment. The Court has addressed the FAA's relationship with state law in various contexts, establishing principles for when the FAA preempts state requirements that prohibit arbitration. The FAA displaces state laws or rules prohibiting arbitration of certain claims. In Southland Corporation v. Keating, the Court ruled that the Act supersedes a state provision forcing disputes to be resolved in court. In Keating, franchisees of 7-Eleven filed a lawsuit alleging violations of a state franchise investment statute. The California Supreme Court held that the state statute required judicial review, while the FAA did not. The Supreme Court ruled in Southland Corporation v. Keating that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) applies in state courts and preempts state laws prohibiting arbitration. Chief Justice Burger stated that the FAA establishes a national policy favoring arbitration and overrides state statutes requiring judicial resolution of claims. Congress intended for the FAA to apply to contracts involving commerce, expanding its reach beyond federal court enforcement. The Supreme Court in Southland Corporation v. Keating ruled that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) applies in state courts and preempts state laws prohibiting arbitration. Congress intended for the FAA to apply to contracts involving commerce, overriding state statutes requiring judicial resolution of claims. The Court emphasized that the FAA was meant to foreclose state attempts to undermine the enforceability of arbitration agreements. Subsequent decisions reaffirmed that the FAA preempts state requirements that impose special conditions on mandatory arbitration agreements. The Supreme Court's interpretation of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) preempts state laws that impose special conditions on arbitration agreements. In Doctor's Associates, Inc. v. Casarotto, the Court ruled that a Montana law requiring specific notice on arbitration agreements was preempted as it singled out arbitration provisions. The Supreme Court has ruled that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) overrides state laws that impose special conditions on arbitration agreements, considering them distinct from other contracts. In Preston v. Ferrer, the FAA preempted a state law requiring referral of certain claims to a state agency before arbitration could proceed, involving a dispute between television personality Alex Ferrer and entertainment attorney Arnold Preston. The Supreme Court ruled in Preston v. Ferrer that the FAA preempts state laws requiring referral of claims to a state agency before arbitration. The Court found that the state law conflicted with the FAA, which grants exclusive jurisdiction to arbitrators. The Supreme Court ruled in Preston v. Ferrer that state law imposing prerequisites to arbitration enforcement is preempted by the FAA. The Court rejected the argument that the California law could be reconciled with the FAA by postponing arbitration until the Labor Commissioner hears the dispute. The saving clause in the FAA allows arbitration agreements to be invalidated based on factors that would invalidate a contract. Courts can invalidate arbitration agreements if found unconscionable under state law, despite the FAA's saving clause. In AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, the Supreme Court ruled that state laws cannot obstruct FAA objectives. The case involved consumers charged sales tax for phones advertised as free, leading to a class action lawsuit against the company seeking individual arbitration. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed with consumers that an arbitration agreement was unconscionable for not allowing classwide arbitration. The Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, reversed the Ninth Circuit's ruling, stating that the FAA allows arbitration agreements to be invalidated by \"generally applicable contract defenses.\" The Supreme Court reversed the Ninth Circuit's ruling on an arbitration agreement, stating that generally applicable contract defenses can invalidate arbitration agreements. The Court found that a state rule requiring classwide arbitration interfered with the goals of the FAA and was preempted. In a recent FAA preemption ruling, the Supreme Court upheld the validity of arbitration agreements in Kindred Nursing Centers Limited Partnership v. Clark. The Court found that a Kentucky state rule requiring explicit waiver of trial rights in power of attorney agreements violated the FAA. The case involved former nursing home residents suing for improper care leading to their deaths. The Kentucky Supreme Court invalidated arbitration agreements in a nursing facility lawsuit, citing the state's constitutional right to trial by jury as sacred. The court ruled that representatives can only enter into binding arbitration agreements on behalf of individuals with their express consent, which was lacking in this case. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned the Kentucky Supreme Court's decision invalidating arbitration agreements in a nursing facility lawsuit. The Court held that Kentucky's requirement for an express statement to waive the right to a trial was in violation of the FAA, which covers the validity of arbitration agreements. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned Kentucky's decision invalidating arbitration agreements in a nursing facility lawsuit, stating that states are restricted in regulating arbitration agreements under the FAA. The Court found that state requirements targeting arbitration agreements are generally preempted by federal law, but courts can still invalidate certain agreements under the Act's saving clause. After the Supreme Court's decision in Concepcion, there has been ongoing debate about when arbitration agreements can be invalidated without impeding the objectives of the FAA. Major companies started limiting classwide arbitration in consumer and employment mandatory agreements in the late 1990s. Some criticize the use of class arbitration waivers for hindering challenges to practices like predatory lending and wage theft, while others argue that they do not prevent individual actions, especially in employment disputes. The Supreme Court has enforced arbitration agreements with class or collective action waivers in recent cases like Concepcion and American Express Co. v. Italian Colors Restaurant. These agreements aim to promote individual arbitration for faster and less costly dispute resolution, rather than allowing classwide arbitration. In American Express Co. v. Italian Colors Restaurant, merchants challenged a class arbitration waiver, claiming it violated antitrust laws by forcing them to accept higher card fees. The Second Circuit refused to enforce the waiver due to prohibitive costs for individual actions. The Supreme Court upheld the waiver, stating that antitrust laws do not prohibit class action waivers. In American Express Co. v. Italian Colors Restaurant, the Supreme Court upheld a class arbitration waiver, stating that the cost of pursuing individual arbitration should not prevent the effective vindication of rights under antitrust laws. The Court agreed to review three employment-related cases involving class or collective action waivers in both arbitral and judicial forums. In Board v. Murphy Oil USA, Inc.; Epic Systems Corporation v. Lewis; and Ernst & Young LLP v. Morris, employees argue that waivers violate their NLRA rights to engage in concerted activities for collective bargaining. The Fifth Circuit upheld a gas station operator's use of a class action waiver, stating the NLRA does not prohibit arbitration. However, the Seventh and Ninth Circuits found the waivers to be in violation of NLRA rights. The Seventh and Ninth Circuits ruled that waivers in arbitration agreements violate NLRA rights to engage in collective activities. In Epic Systems, the Seventh Circuit found the waiver unlawful under NLRA, stating it restricts Section 7 rights. The court determined it was an unfair labor practice and unenforceable under the FAA's saving clause. The Seventh and Ninth Circuits found that waivers in arbitration agreements violate NLRA rights to engage in collective activities. They ruled that the waivers are unenforceable under the FAA's saving clause, emphasizing the illegality of the waivers under the NLRA. The Ninth Circuit found that waivers in arbitration agreements violate NLRA rights to collectively pursue legal claims, deeming them unenforceable under the FAA's saving clause. This raises the issue of how the FAA should be interpreted when an arbitration agreement seeks to eliminate rights granted by another federal statute. In Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corporation, the Court allowed arbitration for Age Discrimination in Employment Act claims. However, the agreements in the current cases would eliminate the right to concerted activity under the NLRA. Epic Systems and Murphy Oil argue that the saving clause does not apply to the NLRA, contrary to decisions by the Seventh and Ninth Circuits. The Court's interpretation of the saving clause's application could be significant given its FAA jurisprudence and limited state ability to regulate mandatory arbitration agreements. Some federal agencies have acted to regulate arbitration agreements, such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issuing a rule restricting their use in certain consumer financial products. This rule was authorized by the Dodd-Frank Act and limits arbitration agreements in two main ways. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued a rule restricting the use of mandatory arbitration agreements in financial services. The rule limits providers from blocking consumers from class action lawsuits and requires disclosure of arbitration usage. Some Members of Congress oppose the rule, fearing negative impacts on consumers' legal dispute resolution. Legislation has been introduced to overturn the rule. In 2016, CMS issued a final rule for nursing homes and long-term care facilities, banning binding arbitration agreements before disputes. This sparked debate over resident protection vs. CMS authority. Lawsuits were filed against CMS challenging the ban. In response to lawsuits challenging CMS's authority to limit arbitration in nursing homes, a preliminary injunction was issued to prevent implementation of the arbitration requirements. CMS later withdrew its appeal and proposed a rule to revise the restrictions, allowing pre-dispute binding arbitration agreements with transparency measures. The proposed rule includes provisions for plain language and writing in the arbitration agreement. The revised approach by CMS allows pre-dispute binding arbitration agreements in nursing homes with transparency measures, including provisions for plain language in the agreement. Efforts to deter the use of mandatory arbitration agreements by federal agencies like the CFPB may only apply to specific categories of agreements. Some suggest amending the FAA to reverse the growing use of mandatory arbitration agreements. Several bills introduced during the 115th Congress aim to limit the use of mandatory arbitration agreements under specific circumstances, such as the Arbitration Fairness Act of 2017 (H.R. 1374/S. 537) and the Restoring Statutory Rights and Interests of the States Act of 2017 (H.R. 1396/S. 550). These bills would restrict mandatory arbitration agreements for antitrust, civil rights, employment, or consumer disputes entered into before the dispute arises. Courts would determine if an arbitration agreement is subject to the ban. The legislation proposed during the 115th Congress aims to limit mandatory arbitration agreements in specific circumstances. It would exclude certain claims from arbitration if they arise from violations of federal or state statutes, the U.S. Constitution, or a state constitution, unless both parties agree to arbitration after the claim has arisen. The changes would potentially make it easier for state courts to invalidate mandatory arbitration agreements. The Safety Over Arbitration Act of 2017 (S. 542) requires court, not arbitrator, to decide if provisions apply to an arbitration agreement. The Court Legal Access and Student Support (CLASS) Act of 2017 (H.R. 2301/S. 553) addresses arbitration in college enrollment disputes, stating FAA provisions promoting arbitration enforcement would not apply to student-institution agreements."
