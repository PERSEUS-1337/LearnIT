    "content": "The \"North Korean Human Rights Reauthorization Act of 2008\" was a result of bipartisan consensus in Congress to promote human rights, transparency in humanitarian assistance, and refugee protection. The United States, with a large Korean-American population, has a commitment to refugee and human rights advocacy. The Act acknowledges the deplorable human rights and humanitarian conditions in North Korea, highlighting the vulnerability of North Korean refugees. The Government of China is aggressively targeting North Korean refugees, shutting down Christian churches, and increasing bounties for their capture. North Korea is escalating public executions to deter escape attempts. Despite the Act's requirement, the Special Envoy on Human Rights in North Korea faces challenges in reporting on the situation. The Special Envoy on Human Rights in North Korea was appointed more than four months after the reporting deadline. Congress has expressed concern about the lack of progress in funding and implementing key provisions of the North Korean Human Rights Act, including the admission of North Korean refugees to the United States. The United States resettled only 37 North Koreans from 2004 to 2007, while South Korea resettled 5,961 during the same period. Delays in processing have caused many North Korean refugees to give up on US resettlement. In comparison, the US granted asylum to 15 North Koreans from 2000 to 2006, while the UK granted asylum to 60 and Germany to 135 during that time. The United States should prioritize seeking permission from foreign governments to process North Korean refugees for resettlement. Efforts should be made to ensure efficient screening and resettlement processes. The Special Envoy for North Korean Human Rights Issues should be a full-time position within the Department of State. The United States should approach the Republic of Korea to coordinate efforts for screening and resettling North Korean refugees who wish to resettle in the US. Genuine refugees exist among North Koreans. The United States should urge China to stop forcibly repatriating North Korean refugees, comply with international refugee agreements, and allow UNHCR access to determine refugee status. The North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 is being amended to support human rights and democracy programs, including increased funding for radio broadcasting to North Korea. The Broadcasting Board of Governors is required to submit a report on the status and content of US broadcasting to North Korea within 120 days of the Act's enactment. The North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 is being amended to promote freedom of information and appoint a special envoy on North Korean human rights issues. Amendments include increasing broadcasting to North Korea and changing reporting requirements. The North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 is being amended to address North Korean human rights issues, appoint a special envoy with ambassador rank, and protect refugees. The North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 is being amended to include provisions for participation in activities, reporting on humanitarian assistance, and providing assistance outside of North Korea. The North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 (22 U.S.C. 7833(c)(1)) is amended to update the year from \"2008\" to \"2012\". Additionally, Section 305(a) is amended to include reporting requirements through 2012, specify information on refugees, and detail the number of aliens assisted. The North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 is amended to update the year to \"2012\" and includes reporting requirements on refugees in East and Southeast Asia seeking protection as refugees. The Secretary of State must provide detailed measures undertaken to secure cooperation from governments in the region. The curr_chunk can be summarized as: \n\"Speaker of the House of Representatives and Vice President of the United States.\""
