    "content": "The Budget Control Act (BCA) was enacted in response to Congressional concerns about the federal deficit and debt. It reduces the budget deficit by placing limits on spending through annual appropriations and implementing sequestration if spending exceeds the limits. Additionally, the BCA includes automatic spending cuts of $1.2 trillion over the FY2013-FY2021 period if the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction fails to propose an alternative plan. As a result of the committee's failure, sequestration is set to take effect on January 2, 2013. The Budget Control Act (BCA) includes automatic spending cuts of $1.2 trillion over the FY2013-FY2021 period. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) determines annual spending cuts for defense and nondefense budgets. Exemptions from sequestration include programs like Social Security and Medicaid. The Budget Control Act (BCA) imposes spending cuts of $1.2 trillion over FY2013-FY2021. Exemptions from sequestration include programs like Social Security and Medicaid. The BCA limits Medicare payment cuts to 2% and requires OMB to reallocate sequester cuts across non-exempt non-Medicare mandatory spending and nondefense discretionary programs. Military accounts were exempted, leading to increased cuts in defense programs and spending in four categories. The Budget Control Act (BCA) imposes spending cuts of $1.2 trillion over FY2013-FY2021. Exemptions from sequestration include programs like Social Security and Medicaid. The Administration faced criticism for lack of information on BCA implementation, leading to the Sequestration Transparency Act. President Obama signed the bill into law on August 7, 2012 (P.L. 112-155), requiring a detailed report on budget accounts subject to sequestration. The OMB report in mid-September 2012 estimated percentage reductions for FY2013. The Budget Control Act imposes spending cuts over FY2013-FY2021, with exemptions for programs like Social Security and Medicaid. The OMB estimated percentage reductions for FY2013. Federal government spending supports jobs directly by paying salaries and contracting with firms, and indirectly through contractors buying outputs from other industries. The Budget Control Act imposes spending cuts over FY2013-FY2021, with exemptions for programs like Social Security and Medicaid. Federal government spending supports jobs directly by paying salaries and contracting with firms, and indirectly through contractors buying outputs from other industries, including navigational instruments manufacturing. Indirect jobs are supported by purchases of prime contractors, while induced jobs are created when workers spend their paychecks. An input-output model is used to trace the output by industry resulting from government and consumer purchases of final products. The Budget Control Act imposes spending cuts over FY2013-FY2021, affecting jobs supported by federal purchases. An input-output model is used to estimate the employment impact of reduced agency spending, with studies applying employment multipliers to calculate projected job losses by industry and state. Estimates by Stephen Fuller and Chmura Economics & Analytics for the Aerospace Industries Association show the employment effect of cuts to defense and nondefense agencies' budgets under the BCA. The implementation of the Budget Control Act (BCA) resulted in estimated job losses of 2.1 million in FY2013, with reductions in federal civilian and prime contractor jobs. These job losses included direct, indirect, and induced jobs throughout the economy. The study also found a small difference in job losses due to a reduction in Department of Defense (DOD) spending. The implementation of the Budget Control Act (BCA) resulted in estimated job losses of 2.1 million in FY2013, with reductions in federal civilian and prime contractor jobs. The study also found differences in job losses due to reductions in Department of Defense (DOD) and nondefense agency spending. The Budget Control Act (BCA) led to an estimated 2.1 million job losses in FY2013, affecting federal civilian and prime contractor jobs. Job losses varied between cuts to Department of Defense (DOD) and nondefense agency spending. Federal government employees could face significant job losses from nondefense budget cuts, while professional and business services firms and manufacturing employees may also be heavily impacted. The report highlighted potential state-by-state employment effects but noted that actual agency budget reductions could vary based on individual agency decisions. The largest job losses due to federal budget cuts are estimated to occur in California, the District of Columbia, Maryland, Texas, and Virginia. Different areas are affected when defense and nondefense budget cuts are examined separately. Inforum/University of Maryland produced estimates for the National Association of Manufacturers on the employment impact of reduced DOD spending under the BCA. The largest adverse employment impact of cuts from 2012-2022 baseline budgets for DOD is expected in calendar years 2013 and 2014. The baseline budget for 2013 was estimated to reduce defense-dependent employment by 907,000 jobs, including direct DOD civilian and military positions, jobs at defense contractors, suppliers, and induced jobs. A $64 billion decrease in defense expenditures for 2014 was estimated to reduce employment by 1,211,000 jobs. Job losses were expected to decrease thereafter as the economy adjusts. Job losses were estimated to decrease relative to the baseline as the economy adjusts to reduced federal spending. Laid-off workers are predicted to find new jobs as spending increases in other sectors. Manufacturing is projected to experience the largest job losses initially but is expected to recover in the out-years. Motor vehicle equipment manufacturing and construction and agricultural equipment manufacturing are examples of industries that are projected to experience job growth in the future. Inforum found that large direct suppliers of manufactured goods to the DOD would not recoup all lost sales and jobs by the end of the projection period. Most service industries were projected to lose jobs due to defense budget cuts, but wholesale, retail, financial services, and other services were expected to have modestly higher employment levels. Inforum used its State Employment Modeling System to estimate state-by-state employment effects of defense budget cuts. In calendar year 2014, Inforum projected job losses in California, Texas, and Virginia due to defense budget cuts. The National Education Association reported potential job losses in early childhood, K-12 education, and postsecondary education if the Education Department and Head Start budgets were reduced. The methodology used by NEA differed from other studies, focusing on direct job losses by program and state. The National Education Association estimated potential job losses in early childhood, K-12 education, and postsecondary education due to budget cuts. They projected 80,500 job losses, with 27,400 in K-12 education and 30,600 in Head Start. The methodology involved calculating state expenditures on employee compensation and applying it to the budget reduction. Head Start faces potential loss of 30,600 direct jobs due to budget cuts. The Aerospace Industries Association sponsored research on the impact of FAA budget cuts, with scenarios showing job losses ranging from 66,000 to 132,000 annually. Another scenario focused on NextGen development projected 40,000 job losses annually through 2020. The firm Econsult conducted an economic impact analysis on FAA budget cuts, estimating job losses of 66,000 to 132,000 annually from 2013 to 2021. The cuts would reduce air passenger and freight traffic, as well as aircraft manufacturing. Individuals and firms may switch to other modes of transportation, leading to job losses in various sectors. The Econsult analysis estimated job losses of 40,000 annually from 2013 to 2020 by delaying NextGen implementation. Sequestration of NIH extramural awards in FY2013 could reduce employment by 33,700 jobs. Dr. Ehrlich estimated that sequestration of NIH awards in FY2013 could reduce employment by about 33,700 jobs across various states, with California, Massachusetts, New York, and Texas being the most affected. The impact was calculated by applying state-by-state employment multipliers to the sequestered funds. Tripp Umbach analyzed the potential effect of a 2% reduction in the Medicare program from FY2013-FY2021, estimating a $10.7 billion cut in 2013 would result in 500,000 fewer jobs, including 212,000 direct jobs in various occupations. Input-output modeling was used to forecast industry employment effects. The potential effect of a 2% reduction in the Medicare program from FY2013-FY2021 was analyzed, estimating a $10.7 billion cut in 2013 resulting in 500,000 fewer jobs, including 212,000 direct jobs in various occupations. By 2021, job loss throughout the economy might total almost 767,000, with a significant portion in the hospital industry and other healthcare-related sectors. State-by-state projections of job loss were based on 2011 utilization data, but future utilization is not guaranteed. According to research, states like California, Florida, Texas, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Illinois may face significant job losses in healthcare and other industries due to a 2% sequestration of Medicare funds. Projections are uncertain due to unknown implementation details and assumptions about past spending patterns. For example, cuts may not be evenly distributed across industries, potentially impacting major shipbuilding centers disproportionately. Cutting federal spending through sequestration may lead to major job losses in shipbuilding centers like Virginia and Maine. This could result in employers losing business and workers losing jobs, especially for firms that sell products to the government. Achieving deficit reduction through different means could change who bears the burden of cuts, but the overall impact on U.S. employment may remain similar."
