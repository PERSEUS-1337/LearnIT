    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Small Business, Family Farms, and Constitutional Protection Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purposes section. The Congress finds the need to extend and strengthen the prohibition on using Federal funds to implement the Kyoto Protocol. The Environmental Protection Agency claims authority to regulate carbon dioxide under the Clean Air Act, but Congress did not delegate such authority. The Administration's call for early action crediting as part of its global climate change policy is seen as a strategy to implement the nonratified Kyoto Protocol prematurely and build a pro-Kyoto business constituency. This would reward big businesses for complying with the Kyoto Protocol before its ratification and encourage others to do the same. Early action crediting incentivizes big businesses to support ratification by acquiring emission credits that can be monetized. It penalizes non-participants by reducing available credits, increasing compliance costs for small businesses and family farms lacking expertise and capital for emissions reduction projects. Early action crediting is unnecessary for protecting big businesses from extra costs under the Kyoto Protocol, as the protocol is unlikely to be ratified. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 allows companies to voluntarily report greenhouse gas reductions without regulatory coercion. The Kyoto Protocol will not be ratified without support from policy makers and big businesses advocating early action crediting. The most effective way for Congress to protect US competitiveness is to oppose the Kyoto Protocol. The purposes of the Act are to safeguard the Senate's role in treaty making, prevent Kyoto Protocol implementation before ratification, and protect small businesses and family farms from additional costs under a future climate treaty. The Act aims to protect small businesses and family farms from incurring additional costs under a future climate change treaty or domestic program regulating greenhouse gas emissions. SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON FEDERAL ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE KYOTO PROTOCOL. Federal funds are prohibited from being used to propose or issue rules or regulations related to the Kyoto Protocol until the Senate ratifies it. No federal agency can regulate carbon dioxide emissions without specific authority granted by law. Additionally, federal funds cannot be used to advocate or implement programs providing regulatory credits. The curr_chunk states that federal funds cannot be used to advocate, develop, or implement a program providing regulatory credits for early voluntary greenhouse gas emission reductions before the Senate ratifies the Kyoto Protocol."
