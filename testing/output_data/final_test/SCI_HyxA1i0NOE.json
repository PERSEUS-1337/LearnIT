MELD, a new method called Manifold Enhancement of Latent Dimensions, helps quantify the effects of multiple experimental conditions by learning a latent dimension called Enhanced Experimental Signal (EES). This allows for the identification of signature genes and the most affected cell types in response to perturbations. The advantages of MELD analysis in two biological datasets, including T-cell activation and treatment of human pancreatic islet cells. Single-cell RNA-sequencing has made experimental design more complex, with challenges in quantifying differences between datasets due to noise. Finding prototypical groups of cells for experimental conditions is crucial for quantifying these differences. The Enhanced Experimental Signal (EES) is a quantification score to identify cells most affected by experimental perturbations. MELD (Manifold Enhancement of Latent Dimensions) is used to derive this score, utilizing graph signal processing methods for biomedical data analysis. The MELD tool provides tools for processing graph signals in high dimensional single cell data analysis. It models the Raw Experimental Signal as a graph signal representing cell conditions, applies a filter to infer the Enhanced Experimental Signal, and uses Vertex Frequency Clustering to identify cell types affected by experimental perturbations. The MELD algorithm aims to learn an Enhanced Experimental Signal (EES) that quantifies cell prototypicality across experimental conditions. It constructs a cell similarity graph, models the Raw Experimental Signal (RES), filters noise to infer the EES, and identifies prototypical cell populations and gene trends. The cell similarity graph is constructed using the \u03b1-decay kernel. MELD uses the experimental label to create the RES on the graph, assigning values to cells based on experimental conditions. The goal is to remove noise from the RES using a low-pass filter inspired by Laplacian regularization. In MELD, a new class of graph filters is proposed to address low frequency noise, with parameters controlling spectral translation and filter order. The method involves learning using a Chebyshev polynomial approximation and introduces a clustering algorithm called Vertex Frequency Clustering (VFC) to identify cell populations affected by perturbations. The Vertex Frequency Clustering (VFC) algorithm combines graph structure, RES signal frequency content, and EES signal magnitude to identify transcriptionally similar cell clusters affected by experimental perturbations. VFC uses Windowed Graph Fourier Transforms to create a spectrogram of the RES signal, which is concatenated with EES data and input into k-means clustering. This approach distinguishes between different cell phenotypes and unaffected cells. The inferred clusters can be used to identify gene signatures in experiments. The MELD algorithm is applied to single cell datasets to identify gene signatures and characterize cell types with varying responses to experimental perturbations. An example using Jurkat T cells cultured with and without antibodies to study T cell receptor activation is presented. Visualization with PHATE shows overlap in cell states between experimental conditions. In a study on T cell receptor activation, there was observed overlap in cell states between experimental and control conditions due to technical and biological noise. Approximately 76% of cells were transfected with gRNAs targeting proteins in the TCR pathway, leading to some cells lacking key effectors of activation. An ad hoc iterative clustering approach was used to obtain a signature of T cell activation. In a study on T cell receptor activation, an ad hoc iterative clustering approach was used to obtain a signature of T cell activation based on gene expression levels. MELD was applied to identify an EES of TCR activation without relying on clustering or gRNA information. The EES values showed a continuous spectrum across the data set, with higher values in regions enriched for stimulated cells and lower values in regions enriched for unstimulated cells. Genes with high mutual information with the EES were identified to ensure biological relevance. The study used MELD to identify a biologically relevant dimension of T cell activation at the resolution of single cells. Gene set enrichment analysis showed enrichment for gene sets related to T cell activation, T cell differentiation, and TCR response. The MELD signature included genes known to be affected by TCR stimulation not present in other signatures. The study analyzed human pancreatic islets stimulated with interferon-gamma using VFC to identify cell clusters with similar responses. Alpha, beta, and delta cells were identified, showing genes correlated with IFNg signaling. The study identified four groups of beta cells: cells enriched in stimulated or unstimulated conditions, intermediate cells, and non-responsive cells with high insulin expression. The non-responsive cluster showed low expression of IFNg-induced gene STAT1, indicating a lack of stimulation phenotype. This suggests a subpopulation of beta cells with functional differences marked by high insulin mRNA production. The results demonstrate MELD and VFC's ability to identify subpopulations of cells with diverse responses to perturbation. MELD introduces a novel filter to remove noise from experimental labels, allowing for the recovery of unique signals from data with multiple structures. Additionally, MELD and VFC can identify biologically relevant signals across various cell types and biological systems."
