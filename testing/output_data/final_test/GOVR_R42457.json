    "content": "The Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP) was established by Congress to provide free public access to federal government information. Originating in 1813, the program expanded over time to include federal executive branch publications. The current structure was set in 1962, with a network of depository libraries across the United States providing access to government information. The transition to digital information creation and distribution has transformed government information processes from tangible to digital formats, with materials now being born digital and distributed electronically for archival purposes. This shift includes a variety of digital content such as websites, blogs, datasets, and audio or video content. The transition to digital information has raised concerns for Congress regarding access, security, authentication, management, retention, preservation, and costs associated with tangible and digital materials. These issues have implications for government programs and policies, particularly for the FDLP. The FDLP is administered under Title 44 of the United States Code by the Government Printing Office, providing tangible government publications to depository libraries for public use. Depository libraries support the FDLP by providing resources for collection management, cataloging, and access to government publications for the general public. Ownership of publications remains with the government, ensuring long-term preservation and free local access. Costs for preservation and access are widely distributed among depository libraries. Regional depository libraries, designated under 44 U.S.C. 1912, retain government publications permanently, excluding superseded or unbound publications later issued in bound form. There are 47 regional libraries in the FDLP, responsible for providing materials directly to patrons or through interlibrary arrangements. Selective depository libraries, not designated as regionals, can choose among classes of FDLP tangible content provided by GPO. Selective depository libraries in the FDLP can choose among classes of government documents provided by GPO. Those served by a regional library can dispose of documents after five years, while others must retain them permanently. There are around 1,150 selective libraries in the program. GPO distributed 2 million copies of tangible items to depository libraries in FY2011. Some documents may not have a digital counterpart if the information owner does not authorize GPO to make it available. SuDocs maintains a list of essential government publications for libraries and the public. Much of the content previously provided in tangible formats is now available digitally through GPO's FDLP Electronic Collection, which includes legislative and regulatory products on GPO servers and other remotely accessible products managed by GPO or other institutions. The GPO provides access to official government publications through various means, including the Catalog of U.S. Government Publications (CGP), remotely accessible electronic products, and tangible electronic products distributed to federal depository libraries. The shift to a digital FDLP raises questions about GPO's ability to manage the program effectively. The GPO's responsibilities for distributing digital information are diverse and may not be explicitly specified. It provides access to digital content it does not produce or control, with archiving authorities for tangible materials but not for digital publications. GPO has some authority to manage digital FDLP materials, subject to congressional approval, but lacks explicit digital distribution authorities for online access to publications. The GPO's responsibilities for distributing digital information, including core legislative and regulatory products, do not directly address its retention and preservation responsibilities for digital information. Various efforts related to the program have been initiated by GPO and groups representing libraries in the FDLP, such as regional library activities, studies, proposals for consolidation and digitization of collections, and a study of the FDLP. The FDLP currently has 47 regional libraries, with some states having two regional libraries and others having none. Multi-state regional libraries are not explicitly sanctioned in U.S.C. Chapter 19. In recent years, proposals have been made for regional libraries in the FDLP to share responsibilities for selective libraries in other states. One proposal suggested a \"shared\" regional between the depository libraries of the University of Kansas and the University of Nebraska, while another proposed the Minnesota regional to assume responsibility for selective libraries in Michigan. However, the Kansas-Nebraska regional plan was denied committee approval in 2008. The JCP chair denied approval for the creation of a shared regional library for Michigan selectives, citing concerns about the University of Minnesota's capacity and collection management procedures. GPO noted that existing FDLP authorities do not explicitly authorize multi-state regionals and that approval should be sought from the Joint Committee on Printing. The University of Minnesota was denied approval to serve Michigan selectives due to concerns about capacity and collection management procedures. GPO contracted Ithaka S+R to develop sustainable models for the FDLP, resulting in a report delivered in May 2011. The report focused on collections, services, and the network of depository libraries. The report highlighted the increasing preference for accessing government information in electronic form, while noting that tangible collections still support some access demands. It emphasized the coexistence of tangible and digital collections in the future and the unique services provided by libraries. The report also pointed out inadequate support within the FDLP and suggested program growth by improving opportunities for libraries interested in government information services. The report by Ithaka highlighted new opportunities within FDLP for depository libraries related to digital collection management and collaboration. It also addressed challenges such as the distribution of regional libraries by state boundaries. Ithaka proposed a broad direction for GPO and depository libraries to provide access to government information without specific recommendations. Ithaka's report focused on three key areas of support for depository libraries: providing access to tangible and digital materials, and government information services. They emphasized the importance of allowing libraries to define their activities, promoting collaboration, and suggested potential changes to enhance participation in FDLP. Despite this, GPO rejected the report in August 2011. In August 2011, GPO rejected the Ithaka Report for not meeting the FDLP's mission and goals. GPO did not provide a detailed explanation for their decision, but acknowledged the report's value in developing new models for the program. Some of the recommendations in the report were considered beyond GPO's current authority. ASERL approved an implementation plan for the management of federal depository library collections, focusing on online access to digital copies. The plan aims to complement efforts in managing tangible collections and establish comprehensive FDLP collections. ASERL approved a plan to manage federal depository library collections, including establishing comprehensive collections and \"centers of excellence\" focusing on agency-specific materials. A documents disposition database was developed to facilitate the withdrawal of materials from depository libraries. Materials not requested within 45 days would be discarded, unless rare or of significant interest beyond the region. On November 4, 2011, SuDocs responded to ASERL's proposed disposition tool, stating it was not in compliance with the legal requirements of the Federal Depository Library Program. SuDocs recommended revisions to prioritize regional and selective libraries within states, followed by depository libraries within the southeast region. ASERL proposed amendments on February 12, 2012, which were approved by SuDocs on February 13, 2012. GPO approved proposed revisions by SuDocs and is awaiting a final decision. A study of the FDLP program is being developed to assess current and future needs based on data collected from individual depositories. The study aims to create state-focused action plans incorporating feedback from depository libraries. Consensus on key issues is crucial for moving forward with change. The current study is part of a larger FDLP study to develop a plan for the future of the Program based on a shared vision with member libraries. GPO has not announced when the results will be available. Issues related to the transition to digital government information may affect FDLP and extend beyond the program. The FDLP collection, dating back to 1813, contains approximately 2.3 million items. One-third of the tangible collection is not catalogued, and depository libraries may not have a full complement of materials due to joining at different times. Key issues include maintenance, retention of born digital information, access to resources, authenticity of digital material, robustness of the electronic collection, and cost of distribution initiatives. Estimates of tangible FDLP materials usage are not readily available due to decentralized storage, lack of tracking, and utilization metrics. Some parts of the collection may be underutilized, while others suggest that online access increases usage. Lack of systematic inquiry hinders determining the reasons for low utilization. Some depository libraries are considering digitizing tangible FDLP collections to increase access and reduce costs. This could also lead to consolidation of collections and reduce the number of physical government publications held by libraries. Some depository libraries are exploring digitizing tangible FDLP collections to enhance access and cut costs, potentially leading to collection consolidation. However, challenges exist regarding the preservation of born-digital information and the ongoing costs of maintaining digitized materials. The scope of authorities granted to SuDocs or depository libraries under current law may limit efforts to digitize or reduce tangible copies. The question of retaining and providing access to government information in tangible form raises various concerns. Questions arise regarding the retention and preservation of tangible materials in their original form or transitioning them to digital formats. Concerns include preserving decaying tangibles, determining the number of tangible copies needed for permanent retention, and ensuring access for the public when digital materials are insufficient. The need for a fully cataloged FDLP collection is highlighted to establish preservation requirements, while opinions vary on the number of tangible copies to retain permanently. Some suggest consolidating collections to save storage space and reduce costs. The ASERL plan proposes developing two complete sets for libraries in the southeast region, while another proposal suggests creating two national retrospective collections. A study on retaining scholarly journals in print form ranges from 6 to 96 copies. Questions on retaining and preserving digitized materials mirror those for tangible materials. The preservation of digitized materials is similar to issues faced with born digital materials. Questions arise regarding the costs, authenticity, ownership, disposition, resource savings, and public access. Consideration of costs for preserving tangible materials is also important. Estimates of the cost of preserving digitized or born digital materials in the FDLP program have not been developed. Differences in distribution processes between tangible items and digital materials may impact accessibility over time. Born digital materials may only be accessible through federal agency websites or GPO content partners, which could affect systematic access. Born digital materials, such as databases, websites, and publications, pose challenges for systematic collection, cataloging, and public access. Issues include version control, format obsolescence, media failure, and migration to newer formats. These concerns are not fully addressed by creators of government information. The challenges of preserving digital government information are not fully addressed by information technology creators, government agencies, information professionals, or users. Solutions for permanent retention have not been widely accepted despite discussions over the past four decades. The emergence of digital delivery outside the FDLP program may increase access to government information. The Ithaka Report assumes functional access to FDSys, which may go beyond the current statutory framework for FDLP. The reliance on the FDLP Electronic Collection raises questions for participants and users of government information. Digital government information is provided online, raising concerns for depository libraries about collection practices. Access to digital materials may impact tangible collections, requiring libraries to support both formats. Users may or may not benefit from digital delivery arrangements. The emergence of the FDLP Electronic Collection as a digital repository raises concerns about the security and availability of government information, especially regarding internet access, search resources, and the safeguard against information loss. The FDLP Electronic Collection raises concerns about data management protocols, backup policies, and funding for depository libraries. The costs of maintaining tangible collections have become prohibitive, especially in an era of dwindling resources. The emergence of digital delivery has shifted costs from depository libraries to GPO for providing digital materials. This could lead to additional appropriations or a reevaluation of service levels in a hybrid system of tangible and digital delivery. The shift to digital information has increased costs for the Government Publishing Office (GPO) in managing electronic government information. These costs are expected to rise with the creation of more digital content and the need to upgrade older data, software, and hardware. The current statutes governing the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP) are seen as inadequate in regulating modern information processes. The current statutes governing the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP) are insufficient to regulate contemporary processes carried out by government and depository institutions. There are questions about whether existing authorities can support GPO and depository libraries in meeting the demands of users of government information. Various social, political, and technical concerns need to be addressed systematically before developing a policy for the future of FDLP. Congress may need to consider issues such as long-term preservation of digitized information and a more inclusive definition of materials in FDLP collections. A more inclusive definition of materials for FDLP collections is needed as the current law does not consider government publishing programs outside GPO authority. The vague language could lead to differences in materials included. There is also a need to expand the current institutional model of FDLP to include activities like curatorial services, preservation, and digitization. The need to expand the current FDLP model to include curatorial services, preservation, and digitization activities, along with the costs and funding models for the program in the digital era.
