    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Renewable Fuels Pipelines Act of 2009\". Congress finds that creating the appropriate infrastructure to move renewable fuels is a necessary energy and transportation objective for the United States. As of the date of enactment of this Act, more than 70 percent of the gasoline supply of the United States is delivered to local terminals through pipelines, which are the most cost-effective, efficient, and safe transportation mode to deliver large volumes of liquid fuels. Renewable fuels are currently transported by truck, barge, and rail, but the volume requirements of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 will necessitate an expansion of the renewable fuels infrastructure. The transportation of renewable fuels through pipelines is essential to meet the volume requirements of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. Federal policy supports the production and use of renewable fuels, necessitating the construction of appropriate infrastructure for their transportation. Loan guarantees are provided for projects constructing renewable fuel pipelines. Loan guarantees are provided for projects constructing renewable fuel pipelines, with definitions and specific appropriations outlined in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Loan guarantees for renewable fuel pipelines under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 are amended to limit the Secretary's guarantee to 90% of the project cost and allow for multiple guarantees as long as they do not exceed the total project cost. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to allow the Secretary to provide guarantees for renewable fuel pipeline projects, with the guarantee capped at 90% of the project cost. The Secretary can consider the volume of renewable fuel to be transported when making guarantee determinations. The factors considered for renewable fuel pipeline projects include market size, storage availability, proximity to production facilities, terminal infrastructure investment, experience with renewable fuel, and construction capability. The proposed project involves constructing a renewable fuel pipeline to maintain fuel quality and ensure timely completion and property rights. Other criteria may be considered by the Secretary for evaluation. The Secretary may guarantee an initial loan for assembling a renewable fuel pipeline project at a preliminary stage, not exceeding 2 percent of the total loan guarantees for the complete project. To be eligible for a loan guarantee at the preliminary stage of a renewable fuel pipeline project, the applicant must provide a route description, construction cost estimate, and completion schedule to the Secretary. The applicant for a loan guarantee for a renewable fuel pipeline project must provide a schedule for project completion, an environmental review with mitigation strategies, and a business plan including market assessment and pipeline connections. The Secretary will consider various factors when evaluating a loan guarantee for a renewable fuel pipeline project, including a comprehensive project plan, engineering summary, project completion assessment, right of way acquisition plan, environmental studies, and permit acquisition plan. Eminent domain is also addressed in the process. The Secretary may grant eminent domain rights to the owner of a renewable fuel pipeline without requiring a certificate of public convenience and necessity. This is similar to the authority given to natural gas companies. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has jurisdiction over the ratemaking methodology for renewable fuel transported by pipeline. Authorization is given for up to $5 billion in loan guarantees for renewable energy projects. A temporary program includes rapid deployment of renewable fuel pipelines. The Secretary of Energy must publish a final rule within 90 days of this Act for a guarantee program for renewable fuel pipelines under the Energy Policy Act of 2005. This rule will either establish a new program or modify existing rules in accordance with the amendments made by the Act."
