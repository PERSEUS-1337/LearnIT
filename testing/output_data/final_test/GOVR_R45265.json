Established in 1871, FWS manages national and regional programs, enforces conservation laws, and distributes conservation funds to states, territories, and tribal governments. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) distributes wildlife conservation funds to states, territories, and tribal governments. The agency's history dates back to the late 1800s with the formation of predecessor agencies. FWS took its current form within the Department of the Interior in the 20th century. The Fish Commission, later renamed the Bureau of Fisheries, was created by Congress in 1871 to address declining fish stocks. It became part of the Department of Commerce and Labor in 1903. The Bureau of Fisheries, originally part of the Department of Commerce and Labor, assumed additional responsibilities such as managing the salmon fishery in Alaska. After the department split in 1913, the Bureau remained in the Department of Commerce and took on enforcing the Federal Black Bass Act and the Whaling Treaty Act. They also worked on mitigating threats to fisheries and increasing fish stocks through fish hatcheries. The USDA established the Section of Economic Ornithology in 1885 to study birds' impact on agriculture. It later became the Division of Economic Ornithology and Mammalogy, expanding its focus to include mammals. The division's responsibilities continued to grow, encompassing animals and plants' geographic distribution. In 1896, it was renamed the Division of Biological Survey to reflect its expanded mandate. The Division of Biological Survey was renamed the Bureau of Biological Survey in 1905, expanding its responsibilities to include conservation and regulatory activities. Various divisions were created within the bureau to address habitat loss, non-native species, species endangerment, and wildlife control. The bureau also enforced conservation laws and managed wildlife refuge lands designated for wildlife conservation, which later became part of the National Wildlife Refuge System. The Bureau of Fisheries and the Bureau of Biological Survey were transferred to the Department of the Interior in 1939 to consolidate conservation and wildlife resource activities. President Franklin D. Roosevelt justified the transfer in Reorganization Plan Number II. The Bureau of Fisheries and the Bureau of Biological Survey were transferred to the Department of the Interior in 1939 to consolidate conservation and wildlife resource activities under the same departmental administration. President Franklin D. Roosevelt justified the transfer in Reorganization Plan Number II, which later led to the creation of the Fish and Wildlife Service in 1940. The Fish and Wildlife Service was created in 1940 by President Roosevelt through Reorganization Plan II, consolidating the Bureau of Fisheries and the Bureau of Biological Survey into a single bureau within the Department of the Interior. This move aimed to centralize the conservation and utilization of wildlife resources in one department. The Bureau of Biological Survey focused on birds, land mammals, and amphibians, while the Bureau of Fisheries dealt with fishes, marine mammals, and aquatic animals. The Fish and Wildlife Service, established in 1940, consolidated the Bureau of Fisheries and the Bureau of Biological Survey. The consolidation aimed to centralize conservation efforts for wildlife resources. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) was officially established in 1956 through the Fish and Wildlife Act, creating the position of Commissioner of Fish and Wildlife. The Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956 established the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) within the Department of the Interior, comprising two bureaus - the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries and the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife. The act specified the responsibilities of each bureau, with the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries focusing on commercial fisheries, whales, seals, and sea-lions, and the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife focusing on migratory birds, game management, wildlife refuges, sport fisheries, and sea mammals. The Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956 established the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) within the Department of the Interior, transferring responsibilities from the Department of Commerce (DOC) and the Department of Agriculture (USDA). Reorganization Plan Number IV of 1970 further restructured FWS by transferring some responsibilities to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) within DOC. This shift returned some responsibilities to NOAA that had originally been under the Bureau of Fisheries in DOC before being transferred to DOI in 1939. The Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956 established the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) within the Department of the Interior, transferring responsibilities from the Department of Commerce (DOC) and the Department of Agriculture (USDA). P.L. 93-271 (enacted in 1974) further reorganized FWS by consolidating it with the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife under FWS. This act abolished the position of Commissioner of Fish and Game and established the Director of FWS to administer the agency under the supervision of the Assistant Secretary of Fish and Wildlife within DOI. The Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956 established the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) within the Department of the Interior, transferring responsibilities from the Department of Commerce and the Department of Agriculture. P.L. 93-271 in 1974 further reorganized FWS by consolidating it with the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife under FWS. The act abolished the position of Commissioner of Fish and Game and established the Director of FWS to administer the agency under the supervision of the Assistant Secretary of Fish and Wildlife within DOI. The law stipulated that the director position requires appointment by the President and confirmation by the Senate, with a positive education and experience requirement in fisheries and wildlife management. FWS has since grown and adapted to its current structure as the principal federal agency responsible for conservation, protection, and restoration of fish and wildlife resources in the United States. Reorganization of FWS remains a topic of interest to both the Administration and Congress, with debates on shifting responsibilities in or out of FWS jurisdiction. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) has a three-tier structure with national, regional, and field offices. In 2017, FWS had around 9,000 employees and administered 856 million acres of lands and waters. Discussions have been held regarding reorganizations to redistribute staff and resources within FWS. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) administers 856 million acres of lands and waters, with 146 million acres in national wildlife refuges and 705 million acres in national monuments. FWS is structured with 13 programs overseen by the Director and Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife. Assistant directors and chiefs manage divisions within their programs, with positions established in statute. FWS is divided into eight regions. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) is divided into eight regions, each led by a regional director. Regions align with state boundaries, except for Oregon and Nevada. Regions 1 and 4 include Hawaii and the Caribbean. Regional leadership teams consist of deputy directors, assistant directors, special agents, and program chiefs. Responsibilities include fisheries, wildlife conservation, budgeting, and external affairs. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) is organized into eight regions, each with a regional director overseeing various programs such as wildlife conservation, budgeting, and external affairs. Regions may have assistant directors or special program managers for specific activities. FWS's mission is to conserve and protect fish, wildlife, and plants and their habitats for the benefit of the American people through administrative and enforcement activities. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) carries out a variety of activities including managing wildlife refuges, restoring fisheries, protecting endangered species, and enforcing wildlife laws. Cooperation and partnerships with other entities are essential to FWS operations, and some programs are established by Congress in statutes while others derive authority from enabling legislation. The National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS) is a network of FWS-administered lands, submerged lands, and waters that provide habitat for fish and wildlife resources across the United States. Many NWRS units are open to the public and offer recreational opportunities. The National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS) includes national monuments, wetland management districts, waterfowl production areas, and coordination areas. Established in 1903, the NWRS contains 566 national wildlife refuges, 4 national monuments, and 210 waterfowl production areas. The FWS administers over 836 million acres, with national wildlife refuges covering 146 million acres. The National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS) covers 146 million acres, with almost 90 million acres in the 50 states. The areas managed by FWS were consolidated into a unified system in 1966 through the NWRSAA, which has been amended multiple times. The NWRSAA established the mission of the System to conserve, manage, and restore fish, wildlife, and plant resources and habitats for the benefit of present and future generations of Americans. The NWRSAA established activities permitted within the NWRS, prioritizing wildlife-dependent recreation like hunting and fishing. NWRS units can be established through legislation or administrative actions. Approximately 500 refuges were established administratively, while the rest were established through congressional actions. Congress has modified and codified many administratively created refuges. Congress has modified and codified many administratively created refuges within the NWRS, making it challenging to differentiate their origins. Lands and interests can be acquired through various authorities, including the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund, to support the Refuge Law Enforcement program for visitor safety and resource protection. The Fish and Aquatic Conservation Program within the NWRS works to conserve fish populations and their habitats. Congress addresses issues related to the administration and funding of the NWRS, including the compatibility of activities like hunting and fishing. The program's mission is to enhance aquatic resources for the benefit of the American people. The Fisheries Program focuses on fish species propagation, habitat conservation, invasive species management, and providing recreational and educational opportunities for the public. It supports freshwater fishing opportunities nationwide by promoting public access, protecting fish habitat, and minimizing risks from non-native species. The National Fish Hatchery System is part of the Fish and Aquatic Conservation Program. The National Fish Hatchery System, consisting of 70 hatcheries, fish health centers, and technology centers, was established in 1872 under the Fish Commission. The system is responsible for propagating fish species for recreation, endangered species recovery, and tribal partnerships. Congress has authorized the construction and operation of hatcheries through various statutes, including provisions for transferring some to nonfederal entities like states or universities. The Fisheries Program, in collaboration with states, tribes, and other groups, conducts research on fish ecology and uses applied science to inform conservation practices. Fish health and technology centers play a crucial role in scientific pursuits within the National Fish Hatchery System. The Fish and Aquatic Conservation Program focuses on fish diversity, conservation, and management, including the Aquatic Animal Drug Approval Partnership Program. The program also addresses aquatic invasive species through the AIS Program. The Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) Program, authorized by the National Invasive Species Act of 1996, funds regional coordinators and activities with partners. It also supports the Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force, which addresses aquatic invasive species nationally. Additionally, the AIS Program assists in evaluating injurious wildlife under the Lacey Act and in developing natural resources management plans for military installations. Congress has addressed funding and administration of national fish hatchery programs, fish habitat conservation, and interagency cooperative efforts led by FWS. The Secretaries of the Interior and Commerce enforce the Endangered Species Act for species protection and recovery. The responsibility for enforcing the Endangered Species Act is delegated to FWS for terrestrial and freshwater species and to NOAA Fisheries for marine species. NOAA Fisheries also has jurisdiction over anadromous species, while FWS oversees catadromous species. ESA provides a legal framework for protecting and recovering threatened and endangered species, with FWS conducting various activities under the Act. The FWS conducts activities under the Endangered Species Act, including species conservation, listing, critical habitat identification, recovery plans, federal consultations, habitat conservation plans, grants for species conservation, cooperation with tribes, CITES implementation, and other conservation activities. One of its main responsibilities is identifying and listing endangered species. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) identifies and lists endangered or threatened species for protection. The listing process includes determining critical habitat areas and developing recovery plans. Legal tools, such as prohibiting unpermitted take, aid in species' recovery and habitat protection. Federal agencies must consult with the Secretary responsible for ESA implementation to prevent actions that jeopardize listed species. Permitting authority is provided for incidental take. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides protection for listed species, permitting authority for incidental take, and regulation of import and export of wildlife. ESA activities include financial assistance, conservation coordination with landowners, and partnerships with nonfederal stakeholders. ESA also implements CITES, with the Secretary of the Interior designated as the authority. CITES categorizes species into Appendix I, II, and III based on extinction risk and focuses on trade regulation, not habitat loss. The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) prohibits harassment, hunting, capturing, or killing marine mammals in U.S. waters or by U.S. citizens outside of U.S. waters. It defines marine mammals and is jointly administered by the Secretaries of the Interior and Commerce. The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) prohibits harassment, hunting, capturing, or killing marine mammals in U.S. waters or by U.S. citizens outside of U.S. waters. The Secretary of the Interior, delegated to FWS, is responsible for the implementation of MMPA for marine mammals other than \"members of the order Cetacea and members, other than walruses, of the order Pinnipedia,\" which are under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Commerce, delegated to NOAA. FWS has jurisdiction over polar bears, sea otters, walruses, manatees, and dugongs. MMPA also prohibits the import and export of marine mammals and marine mammal products in the United States, with limited exemptions for subsistence or traditional uses by selected Alaska Native groups. Several marine mammals protected by MMPA are also listed under ESA or CITES. Administration and funding related to endangered and otherwise protected species is of perennial interest to Congress. Issues include how species are listed and delisted, the permitting process, and requirements for consultation. The Migratory Bird Program at FWS is responsible for conserving over 1,000 species and their habitats, working with various partners to achieve its objectives. Discussions have arisen regarding the divided jurisdiction between FWS and NOAA Fisheries for implementing ESA and MMPA, potentially leading to a shift in jurisdiction over protected species programs. The Migratory Bird Program is responsible for bird population monitoring, habitat conservation, permits, regulations, and recreation. Bird populations and habitats are protected by various statutes and international treaties enacted over a century, including species-specific, general conservation, and broader wildlife-related statutes. Some statutes, like the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, serve as implementing legislation for international treaties. Habitat protection statutes related to migratory birds protect both domestic and international habitats. Protection statutes related to migratory birds, such as the North American Wetlands Conservation Act and the Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamp Act (Duck Stamp Act), generate revenues for habitat conservation. The Duck Stamp Act, for example, funds the acquisition of waterfowl habitats through the sale of federal hunting stamps. International treaties like the RAMSAR Convention also provide for habitat protection for migratory birds. The Migratory Bird Program, established under the RAMSAR Convention, carries out actions related to regulating hunting seasons for migratory birds. States determine their hunting seasons within the federal framework, and regulations also cover permitting activities like incidental take and scientific research. The Migratory Bird Program issues depredation permits to reduce bird damage and protect interests like human health and safety. Stakeholders can also take specific species through depredation orders with restrictions. The program promotes wildlife education through activities like the Junior Duck Stamp Conservation Program and International Migratory Bird Day. The Migratory Bird Program includes education initiatives like the Shorebird Sister Schools Program and resources for bird identification. Grant programs like NAWCA and the Urban Conservation Treaty support habitat conservation for migratory birds. Congress may be interested in issues like hunting regulations for migratory birds and habitat preservation efforts. The International Affairs program at FWS coordinates efforts to protect wildlife and habitats globally, administers grant programs, provides technical assistance to wildlife managers, and regulates international trade and wildlife trafficking. It derives its authorities from various statutes and agreements focusing on conservation. The International Affairs program at FWS administers funds for specific species conservation efforts, partnering with international organizations to protect species like African Elephants, Rhinoceros, Tigers, Asian Elephants, Great Apes, and Marine Turtles through grants and conservation projects. Congress may consider international conservation efforts as mechanisms to promote and fund conservation activities and address the importation of foreign wildlife products. FWS enforces fish and wildlife conservation laws, with a history dating back to its predecessor agency, the Division of Biological Survey. The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) enforces the Lacey Act, which prohibits illegal importation, exportation, transportation, sale, or purchase of fish, wildlife, or plants. FWS's law enforcement mission includes investigating wildlife crime, combating invasive species, regulating wildlife trade, enforcing hunting regulations, and protecting endangered species and their habitat. Their authority comes from federal wildlife statutes. The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) enforces federal wildlife statutes and international treaties through its Office of Law Enforcement at national, regional, and field levels. Special agents investigate wildlife trafficking and smuggling networks, while wildlife inspectors oversee wildlife transit through U.S. ports and intercept illegal shipments. The Office of Law Enforcement within the Fish and Wildlife Service enforces wildlife statutes and treaties, focusing on intercepting illegal wildlife shipments at U.S. ports. Congress is interested in effectively implementing conservation laws, which may involve funding and modifying the responsibilities of law enforcement personnel. The Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration program works with states, territories, tribes, and DC to conserve and enhance fish, wildlife, habitats, hunting, sport fishing, and recreational boating opportunities. Grants are available for various activities, with eligibility differing by grant type. Authority for grant programs is provided in the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act of 1937. The State and Tribal Wildlife grant programs, funded by the Pittman-Robertson and Dingell-Johnson Acts, are supported by excise taxes on hunting and fishing equipment. Revenues from these taxes are used to provide mandatory appropriations for wildlife restoration and sport fish restoration activities. The Pittman-Robertson and Dingell-Johnson Acts provide funding for wildlife restoration, hunter education, and sport fish restoration programs. Funding is allocated to states, territories, and Washington, DC based on program-apportionment formulas. Both acts have provided nearly $21 billion in financial assistance for these conservation efforts. From FY2014 through FY2018, states, territories, and DC received over $1 billion annually for wildlife and sport fish restoration, hunter education, and state and Tribal Wildlife grants. Congress regularly addresses issues related to these grants, with legislation introduced to amend Pittman-Robertson and Dingell-Johnson Acts. Members of Congress introduce legislation to amend Pittman-Robertson and Dingell-Johnson Acts, altering funding types, allocation, and sources. Funding levels for State and Tribal Wildlife grants are considered annually, with the Trump Administration proposing to eliminate competitive grants. FWS receives discretionary and mandatory appropriations, fluctuating over time. Discretionary funding supports agency functions, while mandatory funding backs specified activities. FWS received $1.5 billion in discretionary appropriations annually from FY2009 to FY2018. From FY2009 to FY2018, FWS received $1.5 billion annually in discretionary appropriations, while mandatory appropriations averaged $1.2 billion annually. Discretionary funding remained steady, while mandatory funding increased. Congress funds FWS through annual appropriations laws, continuing resolutions, or omnibus/consolidated appropriations acts to support conservation, protection, and enhancement of fish, wildlife, and plants. During the appropriations process, Congress deals with various activities such as resource management, construction projects, land acquisition, international conservation, and payments and grants. FWS discretionary funding averaged $1.5 billion from FY2009 to FY2018, with the majority allocated to the Resource Management account for activities like Ecological Services related to the ESA. The remaining 18.33% of FWS discretionary funding is allocated across eight appropriations accounts, including Construction, Land Acquisition, and various conservation funds. FWS funding for design and construction includes Line Item Construction Projects, Bridge and Dam Safety Programs, and Nationwide Engineering Services. Land Acquisition funding comes from the Land and Water Conservation Fund for land acquisition. Mandatory appropriations for FWS have averaged $1.2 billion annually from FY2009 to FY2018, funding conservation activities and payments to states and tribes. From FY2009 through FY2018, FWS mandatory appropriations funded various conservation activities and payments to states and tribes. The appropriations were distributed among different accounts, with the majority going to Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration and Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration. Funding for conservation activities is derived from excise taxes on sporting goods, federal duck stamp sales, and an import duty on arms and ammunition. The funds are allocated to states and territories annually. The Migratory Bird Conservation Fund and the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund are supported by various sources of funding, including excise taxes on sporting goods and an import duty on arms and ammunition. The funds are used to acquire wetlands and upland habitat for the conservation of migratory birds, as well as to support grants for states and territories to conduct species and habitat conservation activities on nonfederal lands. The Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund receives fines for ESA and Lacey Act violations. North American Wetlands Conservation Fund is funded by various sources, including interest on the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration account and fines related to violations of the Migratory Bird Conservation Treaty Act. Coastal Wetlands Planning, Protection and Restoration Act provides funding from the Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restoration account for NAWCA projects in coastal states. NAWCA funds support habitat protection and restoration efforts for wetland species in the US, Canada, and Mexico. In 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act provided FWS with $280 million for resource management and construction projects, including deferred maintenance, habitat restoration, and energy-efficient retrofits. The Disaster Relief Appropriations Act of 2013 provided $167 million to the FWS for Hurricane Sandy recovery projects, including beach and shoreline restoration. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 provided $210.6 million to the FWS for recovery and resilience projects related to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. This funding supported various actions such as beach and shoreline recovery, refuge and hatchery rebuilding, dam removal, and modernization of Coastal Barrier Resource System maps."
