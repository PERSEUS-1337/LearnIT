    "content": "The \"March of Dimes Commemorative Coin Act of 2012\" commemorates President Franklin Roosevelt's creation of the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, now known as the March of Dimes, to combat polio. The Foundation funded research for polio vaccines by Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin, leading to the end of the polio epidemic in the United States. The March of Dimes Foundation shifted its focus to preventing birth defects, prematurity, and infant mortality in 1958. They funded research into genetic, prenatal, and environmental causes of over 3,000 birth defects. This investment in research led to 13 scientists winning the Nobel Prize since 1954. Virginia Apgar, creator of the Apgar Score, joined the Foundation in 1959 to lead its birth defects division. In the 1960s, the Foundation established over 100 birth defects treatment centers and assisted in developing Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs). The March of Dimes has advocated for various acts and launched campaigns to improve perinatal health care, prevent birth defects, and reduce preterm birth since 1976. They fund research into newborn screening, pulmonary surfactant therapy, maternal nutrition, and smoking cessation. The March of Dimes has advocated for programs to improve maternal and infant health, including initiatives to prevent neural tube defects and increase access to maternity care. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to mint $1 silver coins in recognition of the organization's founding and service, with specific specifications outlined. The design of the coins minted under this Act shall symbolize the mission and programs of the March of Dimes, reflecting its support for children's health. Each coin will feature the coin's value, the year \"2015\", and inscriptions of \"Liberty\", \"In God We Trust\", \"United States of America\", and \"E Pluribus Unum\". The design will represent the past, present, and future of the March of Dimes as a champion for babies. The coins minted under this Act will reflect the traditions and heritage of the March of Dimes, selected by the Secretary in consultation with relevant parties. The coins will be issued in uncirculated and proof qualities, struck at designated US Mint facilities, and can only be issued during a one-year period starting January 1, 2015. The sale price will be the face value of the coins. The Secretary will sell coins at face value plus a surcharge and design costs. Bulk sales will be discounted, and prepaid orders will receive a reasonable discount. All coin sales will include a $10 surcharge. The Secretary will promptly pay surcharges from coin sales to the March of Dimes for health initiatives. The March of Dimes will be audited for funds received. No surcharge can be included if it exceeds the annual commemorative coin program limit. The Secretary must ensure that minting and issuing coins will not cost the US Government and that all costs related to designing and issuing coins are recovered before disbursing funds to recipients.
