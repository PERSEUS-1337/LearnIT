Fourteen Marines were killed, tensions rose due to beheadings, and the incident occurred during a search for a kidnapped Italian priest. The MILF area ceasefire was jeopardized by a military clash on Basilan island in 2007. The Philippine government demanded that the MILF turn over cadre involved in the ambush after Marines were attacked. The MILF denied involvement in beheadings, stating it violates Islamic law. The situation escalated when the government set a deadline for the turnover. The Philippine government demanded the turnover of MILF cadre involved in an ambush on Basilan island in 2007. The MILF refused to surrender its cadre, leading to threats of military operations by the government and AFP. The MILF vowed to defend themselves, warning that an AFP offensive could jeopardize peace talks and spread fighting to Mindanao. This confrontation has implications for U.S. military support to the AFP against Abu Sayyaf. President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo of the Philippines expressed strong support for the United States after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack, allowing U.S. military forces to use Filipino ports and airfields for operations in Afghanistan. She emphasized the connection between the fight against international terrorism and domestic terrorism within the Philippines. President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo of the Philippines initially supported the U.S. war against Iraq in 2003 but later withdrew Filipino military personnel from Iraq in 2004 due to security concerns. The Philippines has faced terrorism from various groups, including the New Peoples Army (NPA) and criminal syndicates engaging in kidnappings for ransom. President Arroyo's focus has been on addressing Muslim insurgency within the country. The report provides an overview and policy analysis of the Abu Sayyaf terrorist group in the Philippines, focusing on the efforts to eliminate it and the implications of U.S. military cooperation. Filipino Muslims have a history of insurgency against various rulers, including Spanish colonizers, American rulers, and Philippine governments. Since the early 20th century, Filipino Muslims have had grievances over the settlement of Catholic Filipinos on Mindanao, leading to revolts in the 1970s for an independent Muslim state. Negotiations between the Philippine government and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) resulted in the MNLF abandoning its goal of independence, with an agreement reached in 1996. The MNLF abandoned its goal of independence in 1996 and an autonomous Muslim region was created. The MILF, a breakaway segment, demanded independence based on \"Koranic principles\" and gained strength in the 1990s. By 1995-96, the armed MILF had 35,000-45,000 members in Mindanao. They conducted military operations, including attacks on the AFP and bombings in cities. In 1996, a Bangsamoro Peoples Consultative Assembly called for an independent Muslim state. In 1998-99, MILF military operations led to a military offensive by President Joseph Estrada. The AFP captured the main MILF base on Mindanao, weakening their armed strength to 13,000. Cease-fire negotiations in 2001 have stalled, with some MILF elements cooperating with terrorist groups like Jeemah Islamiah. Abu Sayyaf, formed by Abubakar Janjalani in 1990, has ties to Muslim fundamentalist movements. Abu Sayyaf was formed by Abubakar Janjalani in 1990, who had ties to Muslim fundamentalist movements. Janjalani recruited dissidents from the MNLF and Filipinos who had fought with the Afghan mujaheddin rebels. The group carried out ambushes, bombings, kidnappings, and executions mainly against Filipino Christians. By 1995, Abu Sayyaf had an estimated strength of 600 members. Operations declined after 1995 due to a settlement between the Philippine government and the MNLF. Abubakar Janjalani was killed by AFP troops in 1998. In 2000, Abu Sayyaf began kidnapping foreigners for ransom payments, including a tourist resort attack in Sabah and seizing French journalists. Ransom payments, estimated between $10 to $25 million, were used to recruit new members and acquire equipment. Abu Sayyaf, with an estimated 1,000 members, used speedboats to attack a tourist resort on Palawan in May 2000, kidnapping 20 people including three Americans. One American was beheaded, while others were released after ransom payments. The group continued to kidnap Filipinos on Basilan in 2000 and 2001. Abu Sayyaf, with an estimated 1,000 members, kidnapped numerous Filipinos on Basilan and Mindanao in 2000 and 2001, demanding $2 million for some hostages. Philippine military operations, supported by the United States, weakened Abu Sayyaf's armed strength from 1,000 in 2002 to 200-400 in 2006. Under Khadaffy Janjalanai's leadership, Abu Sayyaf shifted focus to urban bombings, improved ties with military factions, and emphasized its Islamic nature. Abu Sayyaf, under Khadaffy's leadership, moved operations to western Mindanao, carried out bombings in Davao, and plotted attacks in Manila, including targeting the U.S. Embassy. They were responsible for the bombing of a ferry in Manila in 2004 and conducted simultaneous bombings in three cities in 2005, showing increased capabilities. In 2006, Abu Sayyaf bombed and destroyed the market in Jolo town. Abu Sayyaf received funding and support from Al Qaeda in the early 1990s. Al Qaeda operatives trained Abu Sayyaf fighters, with plans including an assassination of Pope John Paul II and attacks on U.S. airliners. Ramzi Yoesef established an Al Qaeda cell in Manila for these purposes. Abu Sayyaf received funding and support from Al Qaeda in the early 1990s, with plans for attacks on U.S. airliners and an assassination of Pope John Paul II. Ramzi Yoesef established an Al Qaeda cell in Manila for these purposes, which was uncovered by Filipino police in 1995. Yoesef was later arrested for his involvement in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. The relationship between Abu Sayyaf and Al Qaeda declined after 1995 due to the uncovering of the plot, but ties strengthened again after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. After the 2001 terrorist attack on the United States, Al Qaeda reconsidered Abu Sayyaf as an ally. Abu Sayyaf received training, arms, and support from Al Qaeda and other Middle East terrorist groups. Osama bin Laden ordered increased aid to Abu Sayyaf, possibly including $3 million in 2000. In 2001, Khadaffy Janjalani requested JI to train Abu Sayyaf members, leading to JI cadre training about 60 Abu Sayyaf members in bomb assembling. Abu Sayyaf operatives and JI members conducted a bombing in Zamboanga in 2002, resulting in casualties including a U.S. Special Forces soldier. Abu Sayyaf-JI collaboration allowed Abu Sayyaf access to MILF camps for training. Abu Sayyaf gained access to MILF camps where JI-MILF training was ongoing, and MILF commands began to support Abu Sayyaf-JI bombings. Reports indicated collaboration between JI and Abu Sayyaf forces on Jolo island, including accused Bali bombing perpetrators. Despite denials from MILF and MNLF leaders, there have been reports of links between elements of MILF and Al Qaeda and JI. In December 2001, a group of 13 Jeemah Islamiah members were arrested in Singapore for plotting bombings with assistance from an MILF trainer and bomb specialist. The MILF provided training and support to Jeemah Islamiah, who was also responsible for the Bali bombing in October 2002. Evidence of MILF cooperation with Abu Sayyaf was seen in the Davao bombings in March and April 2003. U.S. expert Zachary Abuza identified four MILF base commands as actively cooperating with Abu Sayyaf and JI. The MILF has been identified as cooperating with Abu Sayyaf and JI, with reports of joint training and operations. Abu Sayyaf leaders have found sanctuary in MILF base camps. There are also ties between Abu Sayyaf, MILF, and the Rajah Solaiman Movement. The RSM consists mainly of Filipinos from the northern Philippines. The Rajah Solaiman Movement (RSM) is primarily composed of Filipinos from the northern Philippines, including Manila. It has emerged from Filipinos who converted to Islam in the Middle East since the 1970s. The RSM has cells throughout Luzon, including Manila, and has collaborated with Abu Sayyaf in bomb plots, receiving support and training from elements within the MILF. Leader Ahmed Islam Santos underwent bombing training in MILF's Camp Bushra on Mindanao. The RSM leader, Ahmed Islam Santos, received bombing training in MILF's Camp Bushra on Mindanao in December 2001. There are concerns that key MILF commanders may not support any agreement with the Philippine government that does not include independence for Muslim areas in the southern Philippines. The Philippine government's policy has been constant military pressure on Abu Sayyaf, with significant troop deployments in Jolo and Basilan islands. President Arroyo ordered AFP troops into Basilan and Jolo islands to combat Abu Sayyaf. AFP operations were hindered by difficult terrain, civilian support for Abu Sayyaf, and limited military equipment. U.S. military aid partially addressed equipment shortages. The AFP faced challenges in combating Abu Sayyaf due to limited equipment and uneven quality of troops. U.S. military aid helped address some equipment shortages. Successes in targeting Abu Sayyaf leaders were offset by reports of corruption within the AFP, leading to failed operations like the encirclement in Lamitan in 2001. AFP units withdrew without explanation, allowing Abu Sayyaf to escape. Allegations of bribery of AFP commanders by Abu Sayyaf were made, leading to calls for an inquiry by Filipino Catholic bishops. Reports suggested collusion between AFP commanders and Abu Sayyaf. Gracia Burnham's book detailed Abu Sayyaf's bribery of military officials for supplies. Pressure from European and U.S. governments affected military operations during hostage situations. The Arroyo Administration and AFP commanders were limited in their military actions against Abu Sayyaf due to concerns for hostage safety, deployment of forces in other areas, and the risk of civilian casualties. The Estrada Administration faced criticism for civilian casualties during an AFP offensive on Jolo. Collaboration between Abu Sayyaf, MILF, and JI also hindered Philippine operations. The truce between the MILF and the Philippine government allowed for links to be established with the MILF and JI, leading to an ambush on Basilan in 2007. Despite the reduction in violence, JI's movement between Mindanao and Sulawesi continues, along with their collaboration with Abu Sayyaf. Negotiations between the government and MILF have been prolonged and unresolved, with disagreements over issues like \"ancestral domain.\" The issue of \"ancestral domain\" in the negotiations between the MILF and the Philippine government revolves around the size and geographical configuration of an autonomous Muslim entity. The MILF proposes a unified area that includes both Muslim and Christian-majority locales, while the government suggests a smaller, fragmented configuration more supportive of Christian populations. Another key issue is the debate over the constitutional-political system within the autonomous Muslim entity, specifically regarding whether it should be an electoral democracy or a traditional system led by Muslim religious and tribal leaders. The issue of elections is crucial due to the history of vote fraud in Muslim areas of Mindanao. The MILF seeks resolution on security forces' jurisdiction and a referendum for the final political status of the Muslim entity, potentially including independence. Disputes with the MNLF persist over their future role, with the MNLF still holding political influence in parts of Muslim Mindanao. The Autonomous Region for Muslim Mindanao, established in 1976, is considered weak, with powerful Muslim political families maintaining independence from MILF and MNLF. The United States provided military aid to the Philippines to combat Abu Sayyaf, with President Arroyo insisting on a advisory role for U.S. forces. By late December 2001, the AFP on Mindanao began receiving U.S. military equipment. AFP commanders were open to a more direct U.S. military role if President Arroyo sought it. The Bush Administration initially proposed a large, direct combat role for U.S. forces. The United States initially proposed a large combat role for U.S. forces in assisting the Philippines against Abu Sayyaf. However, negotiations with Filipino officials resulted in a more limited U.S. role, with U.S. troops providing training, advice, and non-combat assistance to Filipino troops on Basilan island in the \"Balikatan\" operation. The United States proposed a limited combat role for U.S. forces in assisting the Philippines against Abu Sayyaf. 300 troops, primarily Navy engineers, were deployed for \"civic action\" projects like road-building on Basilan. U.S. Special Forces teams could accompany AFP companies on the island, but there were concerns about command arrangements and doubts about the U.S. role, particularly from Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld. In mid-June 2002, the Filipinos and Americans finalized arrangements for U.S. Special Forces to accompany selected AFP companies on specified missions. The arrangement was set to end on July 31, 2002, the termination date of the Balikatan operation. However, the arrangements were not implemented before the deadline. U.S. policy towards the Burnhams, the American missionary couple held hostage, involved shifts, with American officials advising military restraint to limit danger to the hostages. The Bush Administration supported the payment of ransom to Abu Sayyaf in March 2002 to secure the release of the Burnhams. $300,000 was paid by private parties through intermediaries, with FBI officials assisting in delivering the money in April 2002. However, the ransom did not reach the Abu Sayyaf group holding the hostages, as it went to a different faction. After the failed ransom attempt, U.S. officials advised the AFP to use more aggressive tactics to rescue the hostages. The U.S. military provided intelligence to the AFP to rescue the Burnhams from Abu Sayyaf in 2002. Despite the unsuccessful rescue attempt, the Balikatan exercise strengthened Philippine-U.S. security cooperation and enhanced AFP capabilities on Basilan. President Arroyo continued to advocate for this cooperation. In 2003, there was increased AFP patrolling on Basilan, more encounters with Abu Sayyaf, and a decline in Abu Sayyaf strength. The group decided to leave Basilan with the Burnhams. Filipino officials praised U.S. equipment and intelligence support, which aided in successful operations against Abu Sayyaf leaders. The Bush Administration offered 350 U.S. personnel for civic action projects on Basilan. 350 U.S. personnel conducted civic action projects on Basilan, popular with the locals and helped neutralize support for Abu Sayyaf. The projects influenced a more positive reaction from Filipino Muslims towards the U.S. military role. President Arroyo and Secretary of Defense Reyes supported extending U.S. assistance to other islands in the Sulu group where Abu Sayyaf operated, leading to tough negotiations between the Philippines and the U.S. Possible division within the American side was evident. In autumn 2002, U.S. Defense Department focused on Jolo in the Sulu chain due to Abu Sayyaf bombings. Stronger ties between Abu Sayyaf and international terrorist groups were noted. Planning with the Philippine government began in December 2002. By February 2003, a plan was described for 350 Special Operations Forces in Jolo, supported by 400 U.S. troops in Zamboanga and a navy task force offshore. The Pentagon planned to deploy 1,000 U.S. Marines and 1,300 Navy personnel with attack helicopters and jets to Jolo. The troops would be in a combat role, participating in offensive operations against Abu Sayyaf. President Arroyo and AFP commanders agreed to the plan in February 2003, causing controversy in the Philippines. The plan to deploy 1,000 U.S. Marines and 1,300 Navy personnel with attack helicopters and jets to Jolo caused controversy in the Philippines. Filipino politicians, media organs, Muslim leaders, experts, and civic leaders criticized the plan as violating the constitutional prohibition of foreign troops engaging in combat on Philippine soil. President Arroyo asserted that the U.S. role on Jolo would be to train and advise under AFP jurisdiction but would not involve combat. The Bush and Arroyo administrations decided to put the plan on hold and re-negotiate the rules of engagement. After 2002, the United States and the Philippines implemented a new phase of U.S. training and support for the AFP, focusing on training AFP light infantry companies to combat Muslim insurgents and the New People's Army. In 2004, they negotiated alternative schemes for military cooperation against Abu Sayyaf, leading to two operations starting in 2005. One targeted Abu Sayyaf in western Mindanao, while the other focused on Jolo with a reduced U.S. military role compared to the original plan. The total U.S. military presence in the southern Philippines for these operations is typically around 450 personnel. The U.S. military operations in the Philippines aimed to neutralize Abu Sayyaf-Jeemah Islamiah training, capture leaders, and root out forces on Jolo. The U.S. provided intelligence, communications support, and deployed personnel with AFP units. U.S. troops also conducted training exercises in MILF-dominated areas since 2005, with a fluctuating presence of 180-250 troops on Jolo. The U.S. military has had a presence on Jolo Island since 2005, with a fluctuating number of troops ranging from 180 to 250. Their mission is to support Filipino troops against Abu Sayyaf, with a non-combat role similar to their presence on Basilan in 2002. U.S. military personnel live within Philippine military camps, operate with AFP units, and can only use their weapons when fired upon. Their support includes training AFP battalions in night combat, providing equipment such as communications gear and night vision goggles, offering intelligence technology, and assisting in planning operations. The U.S. military has been supporting the AFP on Jolo Island since 2005, providing intelligence technology, planning operations, and conducting civic action programs to improve the lives of the local populace. Despite significant successes, Abu Sayyaf remains active with an estimated strength of 200-300 members. Security has improved on Jolo Island as AFP presence has increased, leading to a decline in bombings and ambushes. People have a positive attitude towards the U.S. military, and Philippine-U.S. military cooperation against Abu Sayyaf has strengthened the alliance. The Philippines was designated as a Major Non-NATO ally during President Arroyo's state visit to Washington in May 2003. The Philippines was designated as a Major Non-NATO ally by the U.S. administration, allowing for increased military support and training. This support has enhanced the effectiveness of the AFP in counter-insurgency operations and increased awareness among AFP commanders in the southern Philippines. Joint operations have garnered strong support from the Filipino populace, although there is a risk of political backlash from nationalist and leftist groups. Leftist groups criticized the U.S. military role in Basilan, despite public support and endorsement from the Catholic Bishops Conference. They claimed it violated the Philippine constitution and accused the U.S. of seeking permanent military bases. Controversy may arise if the U.S. military role expands into combat or if the U.S. gets involved in a new conflict. Incidents involving U.S. military personnel and Filipino civilians could turn Filipino opinion against the U.S., as seen in a case where four Marines were charged with raping a Filipino woman. The case of a Marine convicted in the Philippines drew significant attention, especially regarding custody and imprisonment. The U.S. military's decisions are influenced by the complex Muslim terrorist situation. While Abu Sayyaf's strength has decreased, other negative developments could worsen the situation in the southern Philippines. Stalemate in government-MILF negotiations may weaken the ceasefire commitments. The cooperation among Abu Sayyaf, MILF commands, and Jeemah Islamiah on Mindanao is transforming the region into a significant base for terrorist operations targeting the Philippines. This has led to an increase in terrorist bombings since 2002, with a focus on the northern Philippines, including Manila. The Bush Administration is concerned about MILF's links with JI and Abu Sayyaf, and JI's use of the Mindanao-Sulawesi corridor for moving terrorists. The U.S. is concerned about the links between MILF, JI, and Abu Sayyaf in Mindanao, with fears of it becoming an \"Afghanistan-style\" situation. The cancellation of a U.S.-aided road project in Cotabato province indicated dissatisfaction with the situation and doubts about the Philippine government's ability to combat terrorism. The Bush Administration has considered labeling MILF as a terrorist organization, but the Arroyo Administration opposes this move. The Arroyo Administration opposes labeling MILF as a terrorist organization and supports peace negotiations. The Bush Administration backs the negotiations to separate MILF from JI and Abu Sayyaf. U.S. military involvement in Mindanao raises the risk of clashes with MILF. U.S. personnel conduct training missions and civic projects in MILF territory, sparking protests from Muslim groups. The MILF leaders are willing to accept a peaceful U.S. role in Mindanao, despite concerns over increased U.S. military presence. The breakdown of negotiations could lead to the Bush Administration facing decisions on a wider war. The AFP may seek more U.S. arms and a direct military role, while the Philippine government might shift its stance on U.S. military involvement against the MILF. The MILF leaders are open to a peaceful U.S. role in Mindanao, despite concerns about increased U.S. military presence. If a peace agreement is opposed by significant elements of the MILF and they align with JI and Abu Sayyaf, the Bush Administration may face pressure for greater U.S. military involvement. This could also happen if effective measures against JI on Mindanao are not taken after a peace agreement. The Administration may need to decide whether to use U.S. pressure on the Philippine government to ensure faithful implementation of obligations under a peace agreement, including projects financed by $260 million in U.S. aid to Mindanao since 2001. The Philippine governments have shown poor performance in implementing agreements with the MNLF in 1977 and 1996."
