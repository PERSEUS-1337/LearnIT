    "content": "The \"Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act\" includes provisions for temporary extended unemployment compensation and unemployment benefits for individuals qualifying based on part-time work or an alternative base period. It outlines entitlement to additional weeks of temporary extended unemployment compensation, extended benefit periods, federal-state agreements, payments to states, financing provisions, definitions, and applicability. The Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2002 is extended for six months under Section 208, with references made to the original Act. The Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2002 is extended until July 1, 2004, with provisions for transition for individuals receiving benefits. The Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2002 is extended until July 1, 2004, with provisions for transition for individuals receiving benefits, with the effect as if included in the enactment of Public Law 107-147. SEC. 103. ENTITLEMENT TO ADDITIONAL WEEKS OF TEMPORARY EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION. SEC. 103 amends the amount established in an account under subsection (a) to be 26 times the individual's weekly benefit amount for the benefit year. It also adjusts the amount in subsection (c)(1) to be 7 times the individual's weekly benefit amount. These amendments take effect as if included in the Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2002. The Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2002 is amended to apply only to weeks of unemployment after the enactment of this Act. Special rules apply to individuals with existing temporary extended unemployment compensation accounts. Amounts deposited before the enactment of this Act are treated as deposited by the individual. The Act treats amounts deposited by individuals under the Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Act as TEUC amounts. Determinations made before the amendments are disregarded, and new determinations are made using the amended Act. The Act requires determinations to be made regarding the exhaustion of an individual's account under the Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Act, taking into account amendments made to the Act. If an individual's account was augmented and exhausted of all TEUC-X amounts before the enactment of the Act, the determination of exhaustion is made as if it had not occurred until the date of enactment. SEC. 104. EXTENDED BENEFIT PERIODS. Section 207 is amended to apply the revised rate of insured unemployment. The term 'rate of insured unemployment' now includes individuals exhausting their right to regular compensation in the most recent 3 calendar months before the period for which the rate is being determined. The revised rate of insured unemployment now considers individuals exhausting their right to regular compensation in the most recent 3 calendar months. An additional extended benefit period trigger is introduced for weeks of unemployment after the enactment date. The benefit period under this section is determined by the State's unemployment rate exceeding 6 percent for the most recent 3 months. The State's unemployment rate must exceed 110 percent of the average rate for the corresponding 3-month period in the preceding 2 calendar years for a State 'off' indicator to be present. Any week with a State 'on' indicator will not be considered a week with a State 'off' indicator, regardless of any agreements. The Secretary makes determinations regarding these indicators. The Secretary determines the rate of total unemployment in each State for any period. Section 203(c)(1) is amended to include paragraph (3) after paragraph (2). TITLE II--UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS FOR INDIVIDUALS QUALIFYING BASED ON PART-TIME WORK OR AN ALTERNATIVE BASE PERIOD. SEC. 201. FEDERAL-STATE AGREEMENTS. Any State can enter into an agreement with the Secretary of Labor to make payments of regular compensation to individuals based on State law with modifications. Eligibility for compensation under this title is determined by applying a base period ending at the close of the most recently completed calendar quarter. If an individual is not eligible for regular compensation under State law due to not meeting requirements such as availability for work or refusal to accept work, compensation under this title will not be provided. Compensation under this title shall not be denied to an eligible individual seeking less than full-time work or failing to accept full-time work. The modifications also apply to determining benefits under Federal law based on regular compensation under State law. SEC. 202. PAYMENTS TO STATES HAVING AGREEMENTS UNDER THIS TITLE. Under this title, states with agreements will receive payments equal to 100 percent of regular compensation for individuals based on specified modifications. This includes compensation paid due to state law provisions comparable to the modifications. Under this title, states with agreements will receive payments equal to 100 percent of regular compensation for individuals based on specified modifications. The law's modifications, as determined by section 201(b)(1), will be reimbursable under paragraph (1). Sums payable to states under this agreement can be paid in advance or as reimbursement, based on the Secretary's estimates for each calendar month. These estimates can be adjusted based on prior month discrepancies. Administrative and other expenses are also covered under this agreement. The Unemployment Trust Fund will appropriate $500,000,000 for states to cover administrative expenses and provide reemployment services to unemployment claimants. State shares will be determined by the Secretary based on specified factors. SEC. 203. FINANCING PROVISIONS. Funds from the Unemployment Trust Fund will be used to make payments to States under agreements. The Secretary will certify payments to each State, and the Treasury will make payments accordingly. The Unemployment Trust Fund will transfer funds from the Federal unemployment account to State accounts for payments under agreements. SEC. 204. DEFINITIONS. The terms \"compensation\", \"regular compensation\", \"base period\", \"State\", \"State agency\", \"State law\", and \"week\" have specific meanings under the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970. In the case of a State agreement, \"State law\" refers to the State law with modifications described in section 201(b)(2), and \"regular compensation\" refers to compensation determined under the State law. The term \"State law\" has specific meanings under the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970, except as provided or where context indicates otherwise. SEC. 205. APPLICABILITY. An agreement under this title applies to unemployment weeks starting after the agreement date and ending before January 1, 2005."
