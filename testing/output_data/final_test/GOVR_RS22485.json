    "content": "The case of Watters v. Wachovia Bank involves a challenge to a regulation by the OCC regarding the application of state laws to national bank operating subsidiaries. The lower courts have upheld the OCC's authority in this matter, which has also been supported by three other federal appellate courts. The regulation in question, 12 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 7.4006, preempts the application of the Michigan Mortgage Brokers, Lenders, and Services Licensing Act to Wachovia Mortgage Corporation, a state-chartered subsidiary of Wachovia Bank. The OCC regulates mortgage brokers, imposes fees and standards, and investigates consumer complaints. It relies on provisions from the National Bank Act to promulgate its regulations, authorizing national banks to exercise necessary powers for banking. The creation of subsidiaries is considered an incidental power. The OCC has determined that creating subsidiaries is an \"incidental power\" of national banks, with exclusive visitorial powers allocated to the OCC. The district court ruled that the OCC could preempt state law under the NBA for state-chartered operating subsidiaries. It used the Chevron test to review the OCC's authority interpretation, which requires deference to Congress's clear intent or agency's reasonable construction. The court deferred to the OCC's interpretation of its authority to regulate national banks and their subsidiaries, finding federal preemption of state law due to conflict with federal regulation. The court also rejected claims of Tenth Amendment violation, asserting Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause to regulate national banks. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the judgment of the district court by holding that the OCC had the authority to regulate national banks and their subsidiaries under the Commerce Clause. The court deferred to the OCC's interpretation of \"incidental powers\" for national banks, including the authority to conduct business through operating subsidiaries. The ruling also upheld federal preemption over state authority and rejected claims of Tenth Amendment violation. The Supreme Court ruled in a 5-3 decision that the National Bank Act preempts state regulation of mortgage lending activities of national bank operating subsidiaries. The majority opinion, written by Justice Ginsburg, stated that national banks have the power to engage in real estate lending through operating subsidiaries, and this power cannot be significantly impaired by state law. The Court relied on the NBA's real estate lending and incidental powers clauses to support its decision. The Supreme Court ruled that the National Bank Act preempts state regulation of mortgage lending activities of national bank operating subsidiaries. The Court emphasized the exclusive authority of the OCC to regulate national banks and protect them from intrusive state laws. Federal law shields national banks from burdensome state regulations as long as they do not conflict with the NBA. The Supreme Court ruled that the National Bank Act preempts state regulation of mortgage lending activities of national bank operating subsidiaries. States can regulate national banks as long as it does not significantly interfere with their powers. Operating subsidiaries are subject to the same regulatory oversight as their parent national banks. The Supreme Court found that the National Bank Act preempts state regulation of mortgage lending activities of national bank operating subsidiaries. The focus was on the exercise of a national bank's powers, not its corporate structure. The Court dismissed concerns about preemption by regulation and stated that the NBA protects a national bank's engagement in the business of banking from state hindrance. The Supreme Court ruled that the National Bank Act preempts state regulation of mortgage lending by national bank operating subsidiaries, emphasizing the bank's powers over its structure. The decision eliminated the need for Chevron analysis on OCC preemption regulation, with a strong dissent noting the absence of clear statutory language exempting these subsidiaries from state laws. The Supreme Court ruled that state laws regulating national bank subsidiaries should not be preempted if they do not significantly impair bank activities. Congress recognizes the need for state law to govern both national and state banks for an effective dual banking system. The decision clarifies the distinction between federal and state bank charters, favoring national banks and some in the banking industry. Consumer advocates may find minimal solace in the fact that the decision only involves one state's laws on licensing and reporting requirements for a national bank's mortgage broker subsidiary. The Supreme Court ruled that OCC regulations preempt state laws regulating national bank subsidiaries, extending to all aspects of banking business. The dissent raised concerns about the potential impact on state consumer protection laws. The Supreme Court's ruling on OCC regulations preempting state laws regulating national bank subsidiaries is at odds with the long history of dual state and federal authority over national banks. This decision could lead to increased calls for federal legislation and may disrupt the delicate balance of the dual banking system, particularly in terms of consumer protection laws. Preemption of state consumer protection laws, including predatory lending laws, could have significant implications and garner attention from legislators. The potential implications of OCC regulations preempting state laws on national banks include concerns about the competitive advantage given to national banks, the gap left by state consumer protection laws no longer covering national banks, the sufficiency of OCC's consumer protection enforcement, and the adequacy of OCC's expertise in licensing and regulating national bank subsidiaries."
