    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African-Americans Act\". The Congress finds that approximately 4,000,000 Africans and their descendants were enslaved in the United States from 1619 to 1865, and that slavery was constitutionally sanctioned from 1789 to 1865. This institution deprived Africans of their rights, heritage, and the fruits of their labor, leading to ongoing systemic discrimination. Following the abolition of slavery, the United States Government continued to perpetuate discrimination against African-Americans through practices like sharecropping, Jim Crow laws, redlining, and unequal education. This historic and ongoing discrimination has led to economic, educational, and health hardships for African-Americans, including high incarceration rates and double the unemployment rate of White Americans. The purpose of this Act is to establish a commission to study and develop Reparation proposals for African-Americans due to the historic discrimination they have faced, including slavery, discrimination post-Civil War, and ongoing economic, political, educational, and social disparities. The curr_chunk discusses the negative effects of slavery and discrimination on African-Americans, the denial of slavery's inhumanity through instructional resources, Northern complicity in slavery, benefits to societal institutions, and recommendations for educating the public and implementing remedies. The curr_chunk recommends appropriate remedies based on the Commission's findings on the negative effects of slavery and discrimination on African-Americans, denial of slavery's inhumanity, Northern complicity in slavery, benefits to societal institutions, and suggestions for educating the public and implementing remedies. The curr_chunk establishes the duties of a commission to address the negative effects of slavery and discrimination on African-Americans, including educating the public and implementing remedies. The Commission is established to study and develop reparation proposals for African-Americans, with duties including identifying and compiling evidence of slavery from 1619 to 1865, such as capture, transport, and treatment of Africans. The Commission is tasked with studying and developing reparation proposals for African-Americans, including examining the sale and acquisition of Africans as chattel property, the treatment of African slaves in the colonies and the United States, and the role of Federal and State governments in supporting the institution of slavery. The Commission is studying reparation proposals for African-Americans, including discrimination in laws, public and private sectors, and the lingering effects of slavery. Recommendations will be made for educating the public and providing appropriate remedies. The Commission will recommend remedies for the lingering effects of slavery on African-Americans, including full reparations and a formal apology from the US government for human rights violations. The curr_chunk discusses how Federal laws and policies negatively affect African-Americans and how to reverse these effects, including providing compensation to descendants of enslaved Africans. The Commission will determine the form and eligibility for compensation, as well as recommend rehabilitation and restitution measures for African descendants. A report with findings and recommendations will be submitted to Congress within one year of the Commission's first meeting. SEC. 4. MEMBERSHIP.
