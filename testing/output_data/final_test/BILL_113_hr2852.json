    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purposes section. Congress reaffirmed the difficulty in detecting and proving unlawful discrimination in the Civil Rights Act of 1991. The Act approved \"mixed motive\" claims, where a protected characteristic was a motivating factor for an employment practice. Amendments were made to other civil rights statutes, including the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967. In 2009, the Supreme Court ruled in Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc. that mixed motive claims were not available under the ADEA, narrowing protections for unlawful employment practices. The purposes of this Act are to clarify congressional intent that mixed motive claims shall be available under the ADEA and similar civil rights provisions, reject the Supreme Court's reasoning in the Gross decision, and clarify that complaining parties may rely on any type or form of admissible evidence. Complaining parties under this Act may use any admissible evidence to prove unlawful employment practices, not required to show sole causation, and can employ any method of proof. SEC. 3. STANDARDS OF PROOF. The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 prohibits impermissible consideration of age in employment practices. An unlawful practice is established when age or a protected activity was a motivating factor, even if other factors were also involved. Complaining parties can rely on any admissible evidence to prove an unlawful practice occurred. The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 prohibits age discrimination in employment practices.

Amendments also clarify the prohibition against impermissible consideration of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in employment practices under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 includes definitions related to demonstrating compliance with the Act, specifically in cases involving mixed motives.

Certain antiretaliation claims under section 102(e)(1) with respect to title I are covered by Section 107(c) of the Americans With Disabilities Act. Remedies for discriminatory motivating factors include declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and attorney's fees, but damages are not awarded in such cases. The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 is amended to include standards of causation or methods of proof from the Americans with Disabilities Act. The amendment applies to all federal employees covered by the Act. SEC. 4. APPLICATION. This Act and its amendments apply to all pending claims after the enactment date."
