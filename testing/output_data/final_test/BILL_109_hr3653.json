    "content": "The Employee Participation Incentive Act of 2005, also known as the Act, establishes a maximum rate of income tax for C corporations with substantial employee ownership. The Employee Participation Incentive Act of 2005 sets a 30 percent maximum tax rate for C corporations with significant employee ownership. The Employee Participation Incentive Act of 2005 establishes the employee voting percentage and employee value percentage as the percentage of voting power and value of stock held directly by employees of a corporation, determined on the last day of the taxable year. The Employee Participation Incentive Act of 2005 establishes the employee voting percentage and employee value percentage based on the voting power and stock value held by employees, disregarding highly compensated employees' holdings. Controlled groups of corporations are treated as one entity for these purposes. The Employee Participation Incentive Act of 2005 sets employee voting and value percentages based on employee stock holdings, excluding highly compensated employees. Regulations will be prescribed for corporations filing consolidated returns and to prevent abuse of the Act. Amendments apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2005. SEC. 139B. COMPENSATION PAID IN STOCK BY CERTAIN CORPORATIONS. This section excludes compensation paid in stock by certain corporations from gross income. Employees of eligible corporations can receive remuneration in the form of stock from the corporation or its parent or subsidiary. The amount excluded from gross income cannot exceed 20 percent of the wages that would otherwise be included. An eligible corporation is defined as one that offers stock as remuneration for services. Employees of eligible corporations can receive remuneration in the form of stock, with certain conditions such as offering stock to at least 95 percent of full-time employees and prioritizing those in the bottom 75 percent of wages. The amount excluded from gross income for stock remuneration is not considered in determining the stock's basis. Additionally, stock remuneration is excluded from withholding under specific conditions. Employees can receive remuneration in the form of stock if it is reasonable to believe they can exclude it from income under section 139B. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for part III. Employees can receive compensation in the form of stock if they can exclude it from income under section 139B. A deduction is allowed to eligible corporations when qualified stock options are granted. The amendment applies to options granted after the enactment of this Act."
