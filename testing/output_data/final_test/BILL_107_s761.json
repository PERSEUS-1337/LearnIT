    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Native American Telecommunications Improvement and Value Enhancement Act.\" The \"Native American Telecommunications Improvement and Value Enhancement Act\" acknowledges the low telephone penetration rate on Native American reservations due to poverty, high service costs, and geographic challenges. Lack of phone service hinders access to emergency medical care, job opportunities, and internet benefits. The Act establishes a loan program to address these issues. The Rural Electrification Act of 1936 is amended to include a Native American Telecommunications Improvement and Value Enhancement Loan Program under Title VI. The Secretary will establish a loan program through the Rural Utilities Service for eligible Indian tribes to develop telecommunications infrastructure on tribal lands. Eligibility requires being a member of a cooperative or having an agreement with a telecommunications carrier. The Native American Telecommunications Improvement Revolving Fund is established in the Treasury of the United States to provide loans for improving telecommunications infrastructure on tribal lands. Applicants must have an agreement with a telecommunications carrier and submit a telecommunications plan to the Secretary. The Native American Telecommunications Improvement Revolving Fund assets include proceeds from loans, collections of principal and interest, and appropriations. These assets are used to make loans, administer the loan program, and award grants. The interest rate for loans made under subsection (a) of the Native American Telecommunications Improvement Revolving Fund shall not exceed:\n- 2% for tribes with per capita income 25% or less of the entire US\n- 3% for tribes with per capita income between 26% and 34% of the entire US\n- 4% for tribes with per capita income between 34% and 51% of the entire US. The Secretary awards grants to Indian tribes for feasibility studies on tribal telecommunications projects. Grants are provided based on specific criteria, including per capita income levels and meeting hardship definitions. The Secretary awards grants to Indian tribes for feasibility studies on tribal telecommunications projects. Grants are limited to $200,000 and funded by appropriations of $1,000,000,000. The program appropriates $1,000,000,000 for tribal telecommunications projects. Definitions include \"Federally-recognized Indian tribe\" and \"telecommunications carrier.\" The program will terminate 10 years after the first loan is made. The program will terminate 10 years after the first loan is made or when the telecommunications penetration rate reaches 90 percent of households on reservation lands."
