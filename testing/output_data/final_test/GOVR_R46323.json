    "content": "Federal aid to highways is provided through highway programs administered by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) as part of multiyear surface transportation reauthorization acts like the FAST Act. This report examines major highway issues Congress will consider during reauthorization, focusing on the 4 million miles of public roads in the US, with 25% eligible for federal aid as federal-aid highways. Federal funds are allocated to states and territories for building and improving these eligible roads. The Federal-Aid Highway Program provides funds to states for road projects, with states determining which projects to fund and overseeing construction. States are required to contribute a percentage of the project costs. The FAST Act authorized $225 billion for highways from FY2016 to FY2020, with annual increases in federal highway spending. Apportionment distributes funds among states by formula, with roughly 93% of funds apportioned under the FAST Act. The FAST Act allocated federal highway funds to states, with 93% apportioned to states and the rest for other purposes. Discretionary grant programs targeted specific policy objectives, but earmarks were eliminated after 2011. The core programs within the Federal-Aid Highway Program include the NHPP, STBG, and Highway Safety Improvement. The FAST Act consolidated multiple formula programs into a single annual authorization, ensuring each state receives a gross apportionment based on FY2015 shares. States are guaranteed a return of 95 cents for every dollar contributed to the Highway Trust Fund. Total apportionments are divided among core programs and the Metropolitan Planning Program. The FAST Act consolidated formula programs into a single annual authorization, providing $45 billion annually for highways. The America's Transportation Infrastructure Act of 2019 would offer a 27% increase in funding. Existing highway infrastructure condition is a key funding concern. The federal-aid system showed a mixed picture with improvements in pavement quality but also an increase in poor ride quality. Annual spending was deemed sufficient to maintain system condition through 2034, with potential improvements due to increased funding under the FAST Act. The cost of completing proposed work on federal-aid highways was estimated to require a 30% increase in government spending. The HTF receives revenue from dedicated taxes, mainly from gasoline and diesel fuel taxes, to fund highways and public transportation. The obligation limit caps the amount of highway funding FHWA can promise states each year. The HTF has separate accounts for highway programs and public transportation. The Highway Trust Fund (HTF) receives revenue from gasoline and diesel fuel taxes to fund highway programs. However, the reliance on these taxes has become problematic as they have not been increased since 1993, leading to a decrease in purchasing power. Since 2008, Congress has transferred nearly $144 billion to the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) to fill the gap between tax revenue and authorized outlays. Without changes, the HTF's highway account balance is projected to be close to zero in FY2022, leading to delays in payments to state departments of transportation. The COVID-19 pandemic has worsened the funding shortfall due to reduced travel and vehicle efficiency. Gasoline tax revenues are expected to decrease due to COVID-19 closures and telework, leading to a potential shortfall in the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) unless Congress provides additional funds. The Congressional Budget Office projects that HTF outlays will exceed revenues through 2026, with a projected shortfall of $46.5 billion for a five-year reauthorization starting in FY2021. Congress may need to increase taxes or transfer funds to avoid reducing the highway program scope. The Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee need to address funding for the highway program, considering the impact of COVID-19 on HTF revenues. Congress may need to continue transferring funds from the Treasury general fund to address the shortfall in the Highway Trust Fund. Congress could reduce spending on the Federal-Aid Highway Program by roughly 25% to align outlays with revenues. Alternatively, they could eliminate the HTF's mass transit account and use all HTF revenues for highways only, funding public transportation from the general fund. However, even with all HTF revenues dedicated to highways, annual shortfalls are projected to start in FY2024, with a $20 billion deficit by FY2026. In FY2026, highway spending could be maintained at current levels even without HTF money for public transportation. Congress could reduce federal funding by shifting highway responsibility to states and adjusting fuel and truck taxes accordingly. States would then need to raise their own highway revenues or cut spending. Devolution would involve federal front-end costs and reimbursement for previous projects. Various revenue sources could support the HTF, including raising fuel taxes, implementing a VMT charge, a carbon tax, or taxing electric vehicles. To maintain current highway spending levels in FY2026, options include raising fuel taxes, implementing a VMT charge, imposing a carbon tax, and taxing electric vehicles. Electric vehicles could be charged for road use through methods like using personal income tax. About 1.5 million EVs are currently in use. Implementing a VMT charge as an alternative to fuel taxes for road funding faces challenges such as high collection costs and opposition from trucking interests. Charging heavy trucks only, like in Germany, could be a less complex option due to fewer collection points, but still faces resistance. A national VMT on heavy trucks could face tax administrative issues, with payments to Toll Collect estimated at 13% of annual revenues. A carbon tax could be imposed on emissions, with revenue allocated to federal transportation programs. CBO estimated a $25 per metric ton carbon tax would increase federal revenues by $1.1 trillion between 2019 and 2028. The effect on the HTF would depend on the tax design and revenue allocation. Federal law allows most US roads to be toll roads, but existing Interstate System lanes cannot be tolled without reconstruction. When converting an existing road or bridge to a toll facility, it must be reconstructed or replaced. FHWA does not regulate toll rates but enforces limitations on toll revenue use. Revenue from tolls goes to state, local agencies, or private entities operating tolled facilities. Tolls can finance major roads effectively but may not be cost-effective in low population density areas. Tolling expansion could reduce federal road expenditures. Congress could consider various tolling approaches in surface transportation reauthorization. Congress could consider various tolling approaches in surface transportation reauthorization, including allowing states to toll existing Interstate Highway lane capacity under certain circumstances, regulating rate setting, and expanding states' ability to use toll revenue for federal-aid highway projects. The perennial question of how funding should be distributed to states versus at the discretion of DOT remains, especially after the ban on congressional earmarking in FY2011. In surface transportation reauthorization, Congress has control over discretionary program project awards selected by DOT. While not as direct as earmarking, Congress still influences the use of discretionary funds more than core program formula funds. Congress could adjust the distribution of highway funding by formula or expand discretionary programs. Recent bills have reduced discretionary programs, but new ones could be created to address specific issues like bridge conditions. Studies show that increased federal highway spending may replace state spending. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 included a \"maintenance of effort\" provision for states receiving stimulus funds for transportation infrastructure. A similar requirement could be included in the FAST Act reauthorization, but states may struggle to maintain spending levels due to revenue declines from the COVID-19 pandemic. The distribution of highway funding in the FAST Act and MAP-21 was based on federal-aid highway formula programs. The distribution of highway funding in the FAST Act and MAP-21 was based on federal-aid highway formula programs. The current funding formula is based on the apportionment of federal-aid highway formula programs to states, ensuring equity in fund distribution. This formula has not been adjusted for factors like population growth or infrastructure development, minimizing debates over fairness. Congress could continue to retain this formula in reauthorization. In reauthorization, Congress may retain the current formula for highway funding distribution to states or introduce a new formula to achieve specific policy goals. The FAST Act does not have a separate highway bridge program; instead, bridge improvements are funded through the NHPP and STBG based on states' priorities. As of December 31, 2018, 7.6% of bridges in the U.S. National Bridge Inventory were in poor condition, indicating a significant backlog of bridges needing major repairs or replacement. Congress could create a stand-alone bridge program to accelerate the reduction of bridges in poor condition. This program could be formula-based, allowing states to select projects, or discretionary, with project choices made by the DOT. Another issue is the allocation of federal bridge spending for bridges off the federal-aid highway network, particularly rural county-owned bridges. Congress could increase states' minimum spending level or allocate a specific amount for rural bridge projects to prioritize their repair. The penalty for states with high levels of structurally deficient bridge deck area on the National Highway System requires them to allocate 50% of their FY2009 Highway Bridge Program funds to improve bridge conditions until the deficiency falls below 10%. State officials must close unsafe bridges immediately, with some closures under county commissioners' authority. Failure to close unsafe bridges led to threats of fund withholding in Mississippi. The FAST Act created programs to improve highway freight movement, including the National Highway Freight Program (NHFP) and the Infrastructure for Rebuilding America (INFRA) grant program. NHFP provides up to $1.5 billion annually for freight-related highway projects, while INFRA offers $1 billion in funding for large freight enhancement projects. Congress should consider bridge safety not directly under state control in reauthorization. The INFRA discretionary grants in FY2020 are for large projects to improve freight movement, open to any government entity. Despite high demand, there are criticisms of lack of transparency and project selection. Reauthorization issues may include funding levels, eligibility changes, and oversight. Congress may need to decide on funding distribution between NHFP and INFRA. Worst congestion on freight routes is a concern. Highway transportation is a major source of carbon dioxide emissions, contributing to climate change. The federal-aid highway program includes programs like CMAQ that aim to reduce pollutant emissions. Highway infrastructure will face challenges from climate change, requiring both mitigation and adaptation responses. The federal-aid highway program, including the CMAQ program, funds projects to reduce emissions from cars and trucks that co-emit CO2. Other programs indirectly contribute to reducing GHG emissions, such as the Transportation Alternatives program. Mitigation options Congress may consider include ride sharing, electrifying truck stops, and supporting alternative fuel stations. Adaptation actions aim to increase the resilience of highways and bridges to climate change effects through engineering and policy-based activities. Highway bridges can be engineered to withstand climate change threats like stronger winds and flooding. Federal-aid highway funds can be used for climate change impact assessments and adaptation strategies. Congress may consider adding programs to fund adaptation and resiliency measures, increasing federal matching shares for protective features, and expanding disaster relief definitions. The Emergency Relief program provides federal assistance for emergency repairs following natural disasters. Congress has authorized $100 million per year from the HTF for this purpose. The Emergency Relief program provides federal assistance for emergency repairs following natural disasters, with Congress authorizing $100 million per year from the HTF. However, spending often exceeds this amount, leading to additional funding through appropriations on a \"such sums as needed\" basis. This raises policy questions on whether to raise the annual authorization to reduce reliance on supplemental disaster appropriations and how to address the repair backlog. States seeking funds must now consider climate change resilience in designing and constructing highway and bridge repairs. Resilience is the capability to anticipate, prepare for, respond to, and recover from multi-hazard threats with minimum damage. Emergency Relief funding is reactive and not meant for funding resilience measures in advance. Congress could expand the program to fund resilience measures for high-risk facilities or establish a separate resilience program. The FAST Act established three programs for funding highways on federal and tribal lands, with an average annual funding of $1.1 billion. The Federal Lands Transportation Program receives $355 million annually, mainly for agencies like the National Park Service. The Federal Lands Access Program supports projects providing access to federal lands, while the Tribal Transportation Program allocates funds based on road mileage, tribal population, and need. The Nationally Significant Federal Lands and Tribal Projects Program prioritizes large projects with a minimum cost of $25 million. The Nationally Significant Federal Lands and Tribal Projects Program prioritizes projects with estimated costs of at least $25 million, with a preference for those over $50 million. The program has received appropriations of $300 million for FY2018, $25 million for FY2019, and $70 million for FY2020. Funding for these programs may be an issue in reauthorization, with calls for revisions to allocation formulas for Federal Lands Access Program and Tribal Transportation Program funds. The federal government supports highway infrastructure financing through the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA), providing secured loans, loan guarantees, and lines of credit for major transportation projects. TIFIA is funded at $300 million for FY2020, allowing lending of roughly $4.3 billion. States can use funds from NHPP and STBG programs to cover administrative and subsidy costs. The main issue in reauthorization is the funding level, with $1.65 billion unobligated. The Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) program had $1.65 billion unobligated budget authority as of September 30, 2018. Congress could increase TIFIA funds by adjusting federal project share, eligibility criteria, and application processing speed. Changing the subsidy calculation could also expand TIFIA financing availability. Lowering TIFIA funding could eliminate unobligated balances. TIFIA offers an alternative to pay-as-you-go funding for project financing. Other proposals include creating a National Infrastructure Bank. In highway reauthorization, Congress may consider proposals like a National Infrastructure Bank and expanded state infrastructure bank funding. Concerns over project delays include funding agreement difficulties, public opposition, litigation, and environmental review processes. The FAST Act included provisions to speed up project delivery by changing the environmental review process. Congress may require studies on the impacts of these changes and FHWA's actions. Highway data and study issues have also emerged. FHWA's Highway Statistics series has faced issues with delayed production of tables, reducing their value to policymakers. Congress could request an explanation or GAO review of FHWA's data collection procedures. The recently released biennial report on the nation's highways was two years late and based on FY2014 data. The recently released biennial report on the nation's highways was delayed and based on FY2014 data. It provides comprehensive information on U.S. highway and mass transit infrastructure conditions, estimates future funding needs, and highlights the impact of spending increases. Congress may consider investigating why the Department of Transportation relies on outdated data for the report. The FHWA has not conducted a new Highway Cost Allocation Study since 2000. Congress could fund a new study to assess if current highway-related taxes reflect vehicle damage. Transportation planners could benefit from knowing truck characteristics on specific highway segments. The DOT and Census Bureau conduct a survey of shippers every five years to provide shipment information. The survey conducted by the DOT and Census Bureau every five years provides national freight transport data, but lacks sufficient sample size for specific urban areas. There is a policy question on whether the federal government should provide more robust freight data for state and local transportation planners. Safety measures for roadway infrastructure are primarily funded through the FHWA Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP), with vehicle and driver behavior measures handled by NHTSA and FMCSA. HSIP is the largest safety program up for reauthorization. The Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) is the largest safety program up for reauthorization, primarily funding infrastructure improvements for all public roads. Reauthorization issues include funding amounts and eligibility changes, with a focus on driver behavior as a key factor in fatal crashes. Congress can influence driver behavior through grants to states or withholding funds for non-compliance with federal policies, such as the minimum age for alcohol purchase. Reviewing the effectiveness of these penalties may be part of the reauthorization process. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) establishes standards for passenger vehicles, tests vehicle compliance, rates crashworthiness, and monitors consumer complaints for safety defects. Congress may be interested in studying the effectiveness of NHTSA's early warning reporting system. Commercial drivers engaging in interstate commerce fall under the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) jurisdiction. The regulation of hours of service for commercial drivers and the use of electronic logging devices, driver health requirements, and potential changes to age restrictions for commercial drivers are federal matters overseen by FMCSA."
