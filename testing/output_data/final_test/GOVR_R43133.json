    "content": "Sequestration is an automatic spending reduction process used to enforce budget policy goals. It was first authorized in 1985 and is currently being implemented under the Budget Control Act of 2011. The reductions include sequestration of mandatory spending from FY2013-FY2021, one-year sequestration of discretionary spending in FY2013, and lower discretionary spending limits from FY2014-FY2021. Certain federal programs are exempt from sequestration, and special rules govern its effects on other programs. Sequestration, required by the Budget Control Act of 2011, affects certain types of unemployment insurance benefits. Regular UC, UCX, and UCFE programs are exempt from sequestration, while EB, EUC08, and UI administrative funding are subject to sequester reductions. DOL has provided guidance on implementing these reductions. The DOL guidance outlines how states must reduce EB benefits by 7.3% for FY2015 due to sequester orders. This reduction applies to the federal share of EB benefits, with states responsible for the remaining 50%. The DOL guidance requires states to reduce EB benefits by 7.3% in FY2015 due to sequester orders. States may choose to offset the reduction by changing state unemployment laws. EB benefits were not available in any state in FY2014, and EUC08 benefits were reduced by 7.2% for weeks ending on December 28, 2013. The U.S. DOL worked with states to administer the FY2014 sequester of EUC08, providing options to achieve required savings. EB benefits would have been reduced by 7.2% for weeks of unemployment from October 6, 2013, to September 27, 2014. The federal share of EB benefit costs was subject to the sequester from October 6, 2013, to September 27, 2014. States could reduce EB benefits by the sequester amount if they changed their state unemployment law. Actual UI payment reductions began in March 2013, with no recovery of benefits already paid. The sequestration reductions required a 5.1% reduction for nondefense mandatory expenditures in FY2013, leading to a 10.7% reduction in EUC08 and EB payments starting March 31, 2013. States implementing the reductions later faced higher percentage reductions. Alaska was the only state in a payable EB period in FY2013, with its sequester cuts starting on May 19, 2013. In FY2013, states implemented sequester cuts on EUC08 benefits, with varying implementation dates reported by NASWA. North Carolina did not implement cuts due to program requirements not being met. Not all states applied reductions uniformly to all EUC08 beneficiaries. In FY2013, states implemented sequester cuts on EUC08 benefits using alternative methods like paused-week, grandfathering, and reduction of weeks within a tier. For example, South Carolina paused EUC08 benefits for specific weeks, while California applied cuts only to new EUC08 tier claimants. The state reduced the number of weeks available in each tier of EUC08 benefits without reducing the weekly benefit paid. Maine, for example, stopped paying the last eight weeks of tier III EUC08 benefits. No relevant legislation has been introduced in the 114th Congress regarding the UI sequester. In the 113th Congress, H.R. 2177, the Unemployment Restoration Act, aimed to make EB and EUC08 exempt from sequestration retroactively through FY2021. The Unemployment Restoration Act aimed to exempt EB and EUC08 from sequestration retroactively through FY2021, allowing federal employees to potentially receive UI benefits during administrative furloughs. UCFE provides income support for laid-off or furloughed federal employees based on state UC program laws. Eligibility, benefit levels, and waiting periods are determined by the state where the employee's duty station is located. Monetarily eligibility depends on wages earned or work history in the previous 12-18 months. State laws on \"partial unemployment\" and other factors influence UCFE eligibility for furloughed federal employees. UI benefits for furloughed federal employees depend on meeting the state definition of \"partial unemployment\" and whether a \"waiting week\" is required. Each state has its own laws on partial unemployment, where individuals are considered partially unemployed with reduced work hours and earnings below the weekly benefit amount. For example, in the District of Columbia, partial unemployment is defined as having less than full-time work and earnings below the weekly benefit amount. In the District of Columbia, individuals are considered partially unemployed if their earnings are less than their weekly benefit amount plus $20. Furloughed individuals must meet the state's definition of partial unemployment to be eligible for UC or UCFE benefits. Most states require a waiting week before receiving UI benefits, with varying requirements such as one week in DC and Virginia, and none in Maryland. Furlough days must be spread out across multiple weeks of unemployment to qualify for benefits. To be eligible for UI benefits, furloughed federal employees must meet the state's definition of partial unemployment. Additional guidance can be found at the U.S. DOL and OPM websites."
