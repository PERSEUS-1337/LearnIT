    "title": "AB 2257",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 54954.2 of the Government Code is amended to read: 54954.2. The legislative body of a local agency must post an agenda for a regular meeting at least 72 hours in advance, containing brief descriptions of each item to be discussed. The agenda must also include details on the time, location, and accessibility for the public, as well as options for disability-related modifications upon request. To request disability-related modifications or accommodations for a public meeting, a person with a disability can make a request regarding auxiliary aids or services. For meetings of legislative bodies occurring on or after January 1, 2019, online agendas must be posted on the primary website homepage with a direct link. The agenda must be in an open format that meets specific requirements. Online agendas for legislative bodies must be retrievable, downloadable, indexable, and machine-readable. They should be freely accessible to the public without any restrictions that hinder reuse or redistribution. If a legislative body has a website with an integrated agenda management platform, they are exempt from certain requirements. A direct link to the integrated agenda management platform must be prominently displayed on the primary website of a city, county, special district, school district, or political subdivision. The platform should provide access to agendas of the legislative body for meetings from January 1, 2019 onwards. The integrated agenda management platform must prominently display the current agenda of the legislative body and comply with specific requirements. It is defined as a website dedicated to providing agenda information to the public. The term \"Legislative body\" is defined as in Section 54952 and does not apply to political subdivisions established by local agencies. No action or discussion shall be undertaken on any item not on the agenda, except for brief responses to public testimony. Members can ask questions for clarification, make announcements, or provide references for factual information. They can also request staff reports or direct staff to place a matter on a future agenda. The legislative body can take action on items not on the agenda in emergency situations or with a two-thirds vote for immediate action. The item can be posted for a prior meeting and continued to the current meeting for action. This section is necessary to implement the California Constitution. The agenda posting requirement on the agency's website applies to specific legislative bodies. The legislative body defined by Section 54952 may include compensated members who are also part of another legislative body. Section 1 of the act amends Section 54954.2 of the Government Code to ensure public access to meetings and writings of local public bodies and officials. The act ensures public access to meeting agendas of local legislative bodies on their Internet homepage. No reimbursement is required as any costs incurred would be within the scope of the California Constitution."
