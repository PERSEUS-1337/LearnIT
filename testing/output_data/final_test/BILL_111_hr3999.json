    "content": "Reconsultation on Central Valley Project and California State Water Project. The Congress finds and declares that the United States owns and operates the California Central Valley Project (CVP) for various purposes including navigation, flood control, water storage and delivery, hydropower production, and habitat protection. The State of California owns and operates the California State Water Project (SWP), authorized in 1960 to provide water storage, hydropower generation, flood control, recreation, and wildlife enhancement. California is the world's 8th largest economy, with water from the Bay Delta supporting 25% of the state's economy. The Bay Delta in California is crucial for the state's economy, providing drinking water for millions, irrigating a significant portion of the nation's fruits and vegetables, and supporting wildlife projects. Several endangered species are facing low population levels due to the operation of water projects, prompting scientific investigations to identify the causes. Several endangered species are experiencing declines in population levels due to various environmental factors such as predation, competition from invasive species, water diversions, harvest, contamination, and climate change impacts. The operations of the CVP and SWP are coordinated through an agreement between the United States and California implemented in 1986. The Central Valley Project (CVP) and State Water Project (SWP) operations are subject to consultation with the Fish & Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service under the Endangered Species Act. The Central Valley Project Improvement Act of 1992 reallocated water for environmental restoration. The 2008 FWS and 2009 NMFS biological opinions are projected to result in an additional 1,200,000 acre-feet of reductions annually on average, impacting rural, agricultural communities in the San Joaquin Valley. The State of California has been severely affected by three dry years, leading to restricted water supply deliveries and high unemployment rates in the San Joaquin Valley. The 2008 FWS and 2009 NMFS biological opinions address environmental consequences and potential conflicts between them that may impact listed species. The purpose is to resolve these issues. The purpose of this section is to address environmental factors jeopardizing listed species and their critical habitat. The Commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation must consult with the Secretaries of the Interior and Commerce within 90 days regarding the operations of the Central Valley Project and California State Water Project. The consultation required by this section includes all listed species and candidate species affected by proposed operations. Factors affecting species survival and recovery, excluding Central Valley Project and California State Water Project operations, must be identified, analyzed, and described. The consultation required includes identifying and analyzing factors such as urban and agricultural runoff, industrial discharges, power plant water diversions, private water diversions, and invasive species predation on food availability for species survival and recovery. The curr_chunk discusses the need to identify, analyze, and quantify factors affecting the survival and recovery of a species, rank these factors by their relative effect, and assess the impact of Central Valley Project and California State Water Project operations on the species. The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce will issue a statement under the Endangered Species Act with respect to existing and proposed operations. If reasonable and prudent alternatives are included, they must specify the increased species abundance and limit required measures. The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce will recommend actions not under the Bureau of Reclamation's jurisdiction to address factors jeopardizing species or modifying their habitat. Deadline for consultation and issuance of statement under the Endangered Species Act must be met. The consultation and statement under the Endangered Species Act must be concluded within a 90-day period initiated by the Commissioner, with no extensions allowed. This section is considered a provision of the Act for citizen suits, and any previous consultations or statements are not effective. The Endangered Species Act consultation and statement must be completed within 90 days by the Commissioner, with no extensions allowed. Any previous consultations or statements are not effective. U.S.C. 1536 regulations regarding operations mentioned in subsection (b)(1) will be void after the issuance of the statement under this section."
