    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Paso al Norte National Museum of Immigration History Act\". Congress acknowledges the significant contributions of Hispanic-Americans and the rich history of cultural groups on both sides of the border, emphasizing the need to preserve and document the diverse histories of individuals and families who migrated to the United States in search of better lives. The history of migration at the United States southern border, particularly in El Paso, Texas, reflects the strong relationship between the people of the United States and Mexico. El Paso has been a significant port of entry for immigrants from Mexico, and El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro passed through the area, connecting colonial Spanish capitals with present-day United States cities. The University of Texas at El Paso is coordinating a national effort to create a museum dedicated to preserving the history of people who have moved between Mexico and the United States. The City of El Paso has made the establishment of the Paso al Norte National Museum of Immigration History a priority for revitalization and development. The Paso al Norte National Museum of Immigration History will be established in El Paso, Texas, to interpret and commemorate migration at the US southern border. The University of Texas at El Paso is involved in making land available for the museum's establishment. The Secretary of the Interior will award a grant to the University of Texas at El Paso for the establishment of the Paso al Norte National Museum of Immigration History, including planning, design, construction, furnishing, and startup expenses. The grant proposal must include a designation of land for the museum, plans for each facility, and compliance with building codes and laws. The grant proposal for the Paso al Norte National Museum of Immigration History must include compliance with building codes, a construction timetable, operation and maintenance plans, museum collections and educational programming descriptions, and exhibit design plans in accordance with professional standards. Authorization of appropriations for the Secretary of the Interior is set at $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2004, with additional funding as needed for fiscal years 2005 through 2008. All authorized funds are available for expenditure until fiscal year 2008."
