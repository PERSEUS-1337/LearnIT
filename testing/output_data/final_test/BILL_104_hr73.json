    "content": "The Secretary is prohibited from conducting any activities in the specified area of the Outer Continental Shelf in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico Planning Area. This includes preleasing activities, lease sales, and exploration, production, or drilling activities. Additionally, leases in this area may be canceled. Congress determines that the area described comprises unique marine habitats, including refuge for various species. Despite a moratorium on drilling, tracts were leased in the area. In 1988, Congress renewed the annual moratorium on new leasing and drilling in the area. President Bush announced a 10-year moratorium on leasing, development, and production in south Florida. Exploration, production, or drilling on the 73 tracts described would cause serious harm to the environment. Oil and gas activities are incompatible with the ecologically fragile area. Cancellation of all leases in the south Florida Outer Continental Shelf area is necessary due to the incompatibility of oil and gas activities with the ecologically fragile environment. This decision promotes the public interest in protecting the coastal area. SEC. 4. COMPENSATION. The Attorney General determines if a lease holder is entitled to compensation for lease cancellations. If entitled, negotiations are held for a fair settlement. Compensation may follow rules from the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act and can be in the form of currency or forgiveness of debts. The State of Florida is not required to compensate for lease cancellations under section 3(b). Compensation for cancellations may include currency, forgiveness of obligations to pay rents, royalties, or bonus payments to the Federal Government, or a combination of both, not exceeding the amount provided for under specified rules. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. For the purposes of this Act, terms defined in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act have the same meaning as in that Act. References to the Eastern Gulf of Mexico Planning Area are designated in the Department of the Interior Outer Continental Shelf Natural Gas and Oil Resource Management Comprehensive Program 1992-1997 Proposed Final. The term \"preleasing activities\" refers to activities conducted before a lease sale, including scheduling, industry interest requests, environmental impact statements, and drilling. The curr_chunk states that it does not involve various scientific analyses or studies."
