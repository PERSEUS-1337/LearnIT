    "content": "The \"School Construction Act of 1998\" is cited as the short title. It introduces incentives for public school construction through a new subpart in the Internal Revenue Code, providing credits to holders of qualified public school construction bonds. The \"School Construction Act of 1998\" introduces incentives for public school construction by providing tax credits to holders of qualified public school construction bonds. Taxpayers holding these bonds on the credit allowance date can claim a credit against their tax for the taxable year based on the credit rate determined by the Secretary and the face amount of the bond. The Secretary determines a credit rate each month for qualified public school construction bonds to be issued without interest cost. The credit allowed for a taxable year is limited by the regular tax liability and other allowable credits. The credit allowable for a taxable year under subsection (a) can be carried over to the next year if it exceeds the limitation imposed. Definitions for terms like 'credit allowance date', 'bond', 'State', and 'public school facility' are provided in this subpart. The term 'public school facility' excludes stadiums or athletic facilities. Gross income includes the credit allowed under this section. Shareholders of regulated investment companies holding qualified public school construction bonds can claim the credit. SEC. 54A. QUALIFIED PUBLIC SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION BONDS. Qualified public school construction bond defined as a bond issued for construction, rehabilitation, or repair of a public school facility by a State or local government, with a maximum term of 15 years. The text chunk discusses the conditions for qualified school construction bonds, including the temporary investment of bond proceeds and limitations on the amount of bonds that can be issued annually by an issuer. Additionally, there is a national limitation on the total amount of bonds designated each year. The national qualified school construction bond limitation for each calendar year is $3,600,000,000 for 1999 and 2000, and zero after 2000. The Secretary allocates this limitation among states with projected enrollment increases, with allocations made to issuers based on approved State applications. The Secretary allocates the national qualified school construction bond limitation among states with projected enrollment increases in proportion to their respective shares of the national projected enrollment increase. The projected enrollment increase is the increase in enrollment in public elementary and secondary schools during a 10-year period starting in 1997. An approved State application is required for the allocation. The Secretary of Education approves state applications for public school facility needs assessment surveys, including health and safety issues, school capacity, and infrastructure quality for high-quality education. The State will allocate funds to local educational agencies to address identified needs, prioritizing areas with enrollment increases, assisting localities lacking fiscal capacity for bonds, and ensuring funds supplement rather than replace school funding. The State will allocate funds to local educational agencies for school construction, rehabilitation, and repair, ensuring that the allocation does not supplant existing funding. State education agencies must adhere to approved plans for allocations. Unused limitations can be carried over to the following year if certain conditions are met. The subsection exempts certain calendar years from the provision. Reporting requirements for interest payments on qualified public school construction bonds are outlined, including the treatment of such amounts as paid on the credit allowance date. The Secretary may prescribe regulations for reporting requirements on qualified public school construction bonds, without regard to certain subparagraphs. A clerical amendment is made to the table of subparts for part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code. The amendments apply to obligations issued after December 31, 1998."
