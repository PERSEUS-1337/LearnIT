    "content": "The ACA has 10 titles with provisions related to financing, organizing, and delivering healthcare in the US. Title IX includes revenue provisions, while Title X reauthorizes the Indian Health Care Improvement Act and expands access to affordable healthcare for the uninsured and underinsured through subsidies and Medicaid eligibility. The ACA established new taxes on the health care sector and individuals to offset the costs of expanding insurance coverage. It includes provisions for Medicare, primary care workforce, preventive services, and quality measurement. Other provisions address elder abuse prevention and a new regulatory pathway for licensing biological products. The ACA includes provisions for Medicare, primary care workforce, preventive services, and quality measurement. It also addresses elder abuse prevention and a new regulatory pathway for licensing biological drugs. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the ACA would reduce federal deficits by $210 billion over 10 years and decrease the number of uninsured individuals by about 34 million in 2021. Since its enactment, the ACA has been subject to changes due to economic shifts, legislative amendments, technical updates, and legal decisions. Legislation altering the ACA has been enacted since March 30, 2010, with details provided in Table 2. The laws are listed in reverse chronological order, starting from the most recent. The 111th Congress made clarifications and technical adjustments to the ACA. During the 111th Congress, clarifications and technical adjustments to the ACA were made. Subsequent Congresses enacted more substantive amendments to the ACA, including repealing the CLASS Act and the IRS Form 1099 provision. Funding for programs like the Community Health Center Fund was appropriated, while funding for others like the Prevention and Public Health Fund was rescinded. The Congressional Research Service (CRS) included provisions in the ACA that made changes to new programs and activities, excluding provisions that extended or amended established programs. Lawmakers have considered ACA repeal or amendment in authorizing legislation and through the annual appropriations process. Lawmakers use annual appropriations to eliminate or fund ACA provisions and modify the law. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 included a temporary moratorium on the ACA's medical device tax and other changes. This excludes provisions addressing administrative spending for ACA implementation. Legislation modifying the ACA has become harder to identify over the years. Tables 3 and 4 list bills from the 111th-115th Congresses that would have changed ACA provisions but did not become law. These tables do not provide a comprehensive list of all modifications to the ACA. The tables list legislation from the 111th-115th Congresses that would have impacted the ACA. House-passed bills included repealing the ACA entirely or specific provisions, restricting funds, and replacing mandatory appropriations for ACA programs. The Senate passed fewer bills than the House to modify ACA provisions in the 111th-115th Congresses. The Senate bills did not aim to repeal the ACA entirely but focused on amending specific provisions or extending modified programs. Identifying bills that would modify the ACA has become increasingly challenging, making the lists of House and Senate-passed bills incomplete."
