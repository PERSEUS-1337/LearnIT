    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Community-Based Gang Intervention Act\" and includes findings and a sense of Congress. The Congress finds that the United States has a high incarceration rate, with over 2.2 million people in prison and 5 million on probation or parole. The country has 25% of the world's prisoners despite having only 5% of the world's population. Federal spending on law enforcement and corrections has significantly increased since 1982. State spending on incarceration has increased significantly, reaching $53 billion in 2012 from $10 billion in 1987. This rise in prison costs has led to cuts in vital social programs like education, job creation, housing, and healthcare. Between 1987 and 2007, corrections spending increased by 127%, far surpassing the 21% increase in higher education spending. In California, general fund expenditures for higher education have decreased by 9% while expenditures for corrections and rehabilitation have risen by 26%. California has the second largest prison population in the US with 165,062 prisoners. The nation had 165,062 prisoners in 2010, with Los Angeles being dubbed the \"gang capital\" due to the high number of gangs and gang members. Allowing one youth to turn to crime costs society millions, and in California, the average annual cost per inmate is $47,421 for adults and $218,000 for juveniles. In 1998, States spent nearly $4.2 billion on juvenile justice programs, with 67% going towards residential placements and only 8.4% towards delinquency prevention. Addressing root causes of gang violence and funding community-based programs can decrease gang and youth violence. Community-based gang intervention has proven to be cost-effective and beneficial for at-risk youth and families. In developing a comprehensive violence reduction strategy, the United States should address social conditions like poverty, homelessness, inadequate education, and limited economic opportunities that contribute to gang violence. TITLE I--COMMUNITY-BASED GANG INTERVENTION AGENCIES\n\nSEC. 101. COMMUNITY-BASED GANG INTERVENTION AGENCIES.\n\nThe Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 is amended by adding a new title: \"TITLE VI--COMMUNITY-BASED GANG INTERVENTION GRANTS\" with the purpose outlined in section 601. The title aims to provide comprehensive support for community-based gang intervention activities targeting active and former gang members, their associates, and those returning from confinement. It involves proactive and reactive responses at regional, state, local, and neighborhood levels to address the unique needs of gang-involved youth and their families. The title supports community-based gang intervention activities targeting active and former gang members at various levels, including the neighborhood and street level with active gang members individually. \"Support for community-based gang intervention agencies is outlined in Section 602.\" The Administrator will award grants to eligible community-based gang intervention agencies for activities such as street mediation and developing truces between gangs. The community-based gang intervention agencies will develop local and regional truces, facilitate dialogue between gangs and neighborhoods, provide services to decompress critical situations, offer 24/7 crisis intervention services, and provide training after major gang-related incidents. The community-based gang intervention agencies will develop local and regional truces, facilitate dialogue between gangs and neighborhoods, provide services to decompress critical situations, offer 24/7 crisis intervention services, and provide training after major gang-related incidents. They will also establish relationships with community stakeholders, attend local meetings, and develop conflict resolution skills to address community concerns related to gang activity.

The provision of assistance should not be based on factors such as race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, socioeconomic level, or past record. \"SEC. 603. DEFINITIONS.\" The curr_chunk defines key terms related to community-based gang intervention, including the definition of \"community,\" \"community-based gang intervention agency,\" and \"community-based gang intervention model.\" These terms focus on promoting public safety, reducing gang-related violence, and working effectively with gang-involved youth and their families. The `community-based gang intervention model' is a holistic approach to reducing gang violence through community-based intervention and rehabilitative services for gang-involved youth. It involves deploying specialists to interact with the community, providing rehabilitative services to individuals and families, and addressing barriers faced by gang-involved individuals. The term 'evidence-based' in gang activity prevention and intervention refers to practices with statistically significant outcomes, including reducing gang-related violence and increasing youth participation in job development, recreation, arts, or faith-based activities. These outcomes are determined through experimental trials. In a quasi-experimental trial, outcomes for participants are compared with a control group. The term 'gang' refers to a group organized by geography, culture, or activity that engages in violence. 'Promising' practices in community-based gang intervention are not evidence-based but show potential. The term 'youth' refers to individuals 18 years of age or younger, or in states where the juvenile justice system has jurisdiction over individuals older than 18, it includes individuals up to that maximum age.
