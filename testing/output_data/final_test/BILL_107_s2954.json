    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Student Testing Flexibility Act of 2002\". Congress acknowledges that State and local governments bear the majority of the cost and responsibility for educating public elementary and secondary school students. They often struggle to find adequate funding for basic educational services, while the Federal Government has not provided its share of funding for mandated education programs. This lack of funding increases financial pressures on States and local educational agencies, particularly in implementing required student academic assessments. The Secondary Education Act of 1965 highlights the uncertainty surrounding student assessments. Public school students undergo various tests annually, including standardized ones mandated by different educational agencies. Using multiple measures for student achievement is deemed more accurate than relying solely on high-stakes tests. The decision on the frequency of high-quality assessments should be left to State and local educational agencies. The waiver authority is specified in Section 3. Section 1111(b)(3) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include waiver authority for States to waive certain requirements if they demonstrate closing the achievement gap or exceeding adequate yearly progress for multiple years. The Secretary may waive requirements for local educational agencies in states without waivers if they demonstrate closing the achievement gap or exceeding adequate yearly progress for multiple years. The educational agency can receive a waiver for 3 years, renewable for additional 3-year periods, to use certain federal funds if they meet specific criteria. The educational agency can receive a waiver for 3 years, renewable for additional 3-year periods, to use certain federal funds if they meet specific criteria. State or local educational agencies can use funds for educational activities to improve academic achievement of students in schools that fail to make adequate yearly progress. A State or local educational agency granted a waiver under specific criteria cannot use federal funds for annual assessments to pay for a student's cost at a private school."
