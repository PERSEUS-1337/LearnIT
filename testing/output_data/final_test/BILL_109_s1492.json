    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Chesapeake Bay Environmental Education Pilot Program Act\" and includes findings related to the program. Congress finds that increasing public environmental awareness and understanding through formal environmental education and meaningful bay or stream field experiences are vital for protecting and restoring the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem. Using the Chesapeake Bay watershed as a context for learning can enhance student learning skills, improve academic achievement, promote positive behavior, and encourage environmental stewardship in schools and communities. The Federal Government, specifically the Secretary of Education, should collaborate with relevant entities to support these efforts. The Chesapeake Executive Council, State educational agencies, schools, and environmental organizations collaborate to develop curricula, teacher training, and special projects to increase understanding of the Chesapeake Bay watershed and raise awareness of environmental issues. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a Chesapeake Bay Environmental Education and Training Grant Pilot Program. This program aims to enhance understanding of the Chesapeake Bay watershed and environmental issues through curricula, teacher training, and special projects. The Chesapeake Bay Environmental Education and Training Grant Pilot Program defines key terms such as Bay Watershed State, Chesapeake Executive Council, and Eligible Institution. It aims to enhance understanding of the Chesapeake Bay watershed through education and training initiatives. The term 'Program' refers to the Chesapeake Bay Environmental Education and Training Grant Pilot Program established under section 4402. The Chesapeake Bay Environmental Education and Training Grant Pilot Program is established under section 4402. The Secretary will establish the Chesapeake Bay Environmental Education and Training Grant Pilot Program to provide grants for developing environmental education practices in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. The Federal share will be 50 percent, and the Program may be administered by various entities including the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. The Chesapeake Bay Environmental Education and Training Grant Pilot Program will provide grants to eligible institutions for environmental education projects, including curriculum development, field practices, environmental assessments, and teacher training. The Chesapeake Bay Environmental Education and Training Grant Pilot Program offers grants for various educational activities, including curriculum development, environmental seminars, on-the-ground activities like forest restoration and water quality monitoring, outdoor educational experiences, and distance learning courses. The Chesapeake Bay Environmental Education and Training Grant Pilot Program solicits applications for projects, selects suitable projects, supervises and evaluates them, and disseminates information on effective practices. The Secretary publishes a notice of solicitation for grant applications annually. The Program requires eligible institutions to submit applications containing specified information. Priority is given to projects that develop new or improved environmental education practices, have wide application, and meet academic standards. The Chesapeake Bay Environmental Education Pilot Program focuses on environmental education practices addressing priority skills or scientific fields. Grants are capped at $50,000, with notification to Congress before grant allocation and regulations to be established within a year of the Act's enactment. The Secretary must contract an entity to evaluate the Program by December 31, 2009, to determine if continued support is warranted. A report on the evaluation results must be submitted to Congress by December 31, 2010. $6,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2006-2009, with a limit of 10% for administrative expenses."
