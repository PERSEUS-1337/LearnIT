    "content": "In August 2007, asset-backed securities (ABS), especially those backed by subprime mortgages, lost value due to the housing market crash. Financial firms suffered capital losses from these ABS, leading to reduced access to liquidity. The crisis escalated in September 2008 with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Lehman Brothers, and AIG facing significant challenges. In response to the financial crisis of 2008, the federal government took extraordinary steps to address widespread disruption in financial markets. Initially, the approach was ad hoc, but the panic in September 2008 led to the passage of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (EESA) to create the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). This was in response to the failure of \"too big to fail\" firms like Lehman Brothers, which caused contagion and disruptions in the market. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (EESA) was passed by Congress in October 2008 to create the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). The response to the financial crisis included various programs to increase institutions' liquidity, provide equity to rebuild capital, and purchase illiquid assets to restore confidence in financial institutions. The government intervened in financial markets through programs like the PPIP, CPFF, and TALF to prevent the failure of institutions deemed \"too big to fail\" like AIG, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac. These programs have mostly been wound down, with some outstanding principal yet to be repaid. The government intervened in financial markets through various programs to prevent the failure of institutions deemed \"too big to fail.\" Critics argue that government intervention may not have been necessary, and oversight committees were established to review the crisis response. The report reviews the costs of new crisis response programs introduced by the Treasury, Fed, and FDIC to end financial panic and restore normalcy to financial markets. Overall, the interventions were successful in improving financial conditions by late 2008. The government's interventions in late 2008 successfully improved overall financial conditions, returning to precrisis levels by mid-2009. Evaluating the actions includes restoring financial normalcy at a minimum cost to taxpayers and distinguishing between funds provided to solvent and insolvent companies. The government's interventions in late 2008 improved financial conditions, distinguishing between funds for solvent and insolvent companies. For insolvent firms, the chances of fully recouping losses are low. In a panic, investors hesitate to provide funds, leading to a lack of liquidity for profitable opportunities. The government faces challenges in accurately distinguishing between healthy and unhealthy firms when providing funds. The financial crisis led to potential long-term costs for taxpayers, with estimates reaching as high as $23.7 trillion. Even official projections expected significant losses, such as a $356 billion subsidy on TARP funds. The government's interventions aimed to improve financial conditions but faced challenges in distinguishing between healthy and unhealthy firms. The government's interventions during the financial crisis resulted in a different financial outcome than initially projected. Most programs paid back in full with interest, bringing in more principal repayments and income than was paid out. Even programs with losses on specific transactions, like the Capital Purchase Program, still produced a net gain for the government. The government's interventions during the financial crisis resulted in a different financial outcome than initially projected. Most programs paid back in full with interest, bringing in more principal repayments and income than was paid out. Four programs still have assistance outstanding, with three already generating net income in excess of remaining principal. The GSE assistance remains outstanding due to government conservatorship, while the Treasury's Community Development Capital Initiative may also generate positive net income. The government's interventions during the financial crisis resulted in a different financial outcome than initially projected. Most programs paid back in full with interest, bringing in more principal repayments and income than was paid out. Three programs realized net losses when assistance was exhausted, but overall, realized gains across various programs exceed realized losses by tens of billions of dollars. Generating positive net income does not necessarily mean economic profit for the government, as borrowing incurred interest payments to finance the programs. The government's interventions during the financial crisis resulted in different financial outcomes than initially projected. Most programs paid back in full with interest, bringing in more principal repayments and income than was paid out. An economist would determine whether government programs generated economic profits by comparing the government's terms to what a private investor would require for the same investment. Adjustments to account for borrowing costs and risk could reduce gains to the taxpayer and even show losses on certain programs. CBO estimated that the nonhousing programs in TARP would approximately break even. The government's interventions during the financial crisis resulted in different financial outcomes than initially projected. CBO estimated that the nonhousing programs in TARP would approximately break even. There are concerns about moral hazard and the potential for future rescues due to increased private-sector risk-taking. The Congressional Research Service reports data on government holdings, income earnings, and estimates of profits or losses for each program. Treasury quickly implemented the TARP Capital Purchase Program after the enactment of EESA, followed by several other programs primarily under TARP. The Capital Purchase Program (CPP) purchased preferred shares in banks to add capital and help banks overcome toxic assets. Approximately $205 billion was disbursed under the CPP, which is now closed with no additional disbursements possible. The CDCI and PPIP programs provided funds and guarantees for purchases of mortgage-related securities and lower dividend rates on preferred share purchases from banks targeting underserved communities. The CDCI had $0.57 billion disbursed, with $0.06 billion outstanding, $0.03 billion written off, and $0.07 billion in income received. The PPIP program disbursed approximately $205 billion, with $0.04 billion outstanding, $5.2 billion written off, and $27.1 billion in income received. The PPIP program involved purchases of mortgage-related securities from bank balance sheets by private investors using TARP funds. All $18.6 billion in disbursed PPIP funds have been repaid with $3.85 billion in income received and no losses. The Section 7(a) Securities Purchase Program supported the SBA's loan program, with $0.36 billion repaid out of $0.37 billion disbursed funds. The Automobile Industry Support program provided loans to GM and Chrysler, included preferred share purchases from GMAC, and resulted in successful outcomes. The U.S. government's ownership stake in GM, GMAC/Ally Financial, and Chrysler resulted in majority and minority ownership. Ownership stakes were sold to GM, the public, Fiat, and the public in 2010-2014. No outstanding funds remain from the $79.7 billion disbursed. The automobile industry support program resulted in $16.6 billion in losses and $7.4 billion in income. Housing Assistance Programs disbursed $28.4 billion out of $33.4 billion. As of August 1, 2018, Treasury reported obligations under TARP totaling $450.5 billion authorized, with $440.1 billion disbursed. $376.4 billion of funds paid out have been returned to the Treasury and $35.3 billion have been written off or recognized as lost. TARP was originally authorized to outlay up to $700 billion; however, this amount was reduced to $475 billion by Congress in July 2010. Authorization to take on new commitments under TARP expired on October 3, 2010; however, outlays can continue under then-existing commitments. TARP overall generated positive net income, as income received ($48.7 billion) exceeds recognized losses ($35.3 billion) and remaining outstanding funds ($0.1 billion). The outcome of TARP exceeded expectations, with positive net income of $48.7 billion, surpassing recognized losses of $35.3 billion and remaining outstanding funds of $0.1 billion. The Capital Purchase Program provided $125 billion to the largest banks, with additional funds reserved for smaller banks. Initial contracts with the largest banks prevented them from exiting the program for three years. The Capital Purchase Program (CPP) had contracts with the largest banks preventing them from exiting for three years, including dividend payments and warrants to the government. By the end of 2008, 214 banks had $172.5 billion in share purchases outstanding. Changes by the Obama Administration and Congress allowed for early repayment without penalty. By June 30, 2009, $70.1 billion of $203.2 billion CPP funds had been repaid. The Obama Administration conducted stress tests on large banks to assess their capital levels. Banks that passed the stress test were allowed to repay TARP funds, while those deemed fragile had to raise additional capital privately or through a new Capital Assistance Program. GMAC received funding to meet stress test requirements. Treasury sold off CPP shares to the public at a discount, resulting in a loss for TARP. This helped minimize government intervention in financial markets during normal conditions. Treasury has allowed institutions to purchase their warrants directly upon repayment of preferred shares, using complex option pricing models to determine the initial offering price. Critics suggest auctioning warrants on the open market to ensure fair pricing. CPP investments earn income from dividends at a rate of 5% for the first five years and 9% thereafter. The CPP investments earn income from dividends with a rate of 5% for the first five years and 9% thereafter. S-Corp banks have a dividend rate of 7.7% for the first five years and 13.8% thereafter. CPP gains come from dividend payments, warrants, and capital gains. Losses can occur from institution failure, restructuring, or selling CPP shares below par value. As of August 1, 2018, Treasury reported $5.2 billion in write-offs and realized losses from the CPP, with the largest portion due to the failure of CIT Group. The CPP program has seen losses, with the largest portion attributed to the failure of CIT Group. Remaining banks in the CPP are small, with the government's holdings now at $0.04 billion. Despite losses of $4.7 billion, total income of $27.1 billion from dividend payments, capital gains, and warrant proceeds has exceeded losses. Positive cash flow is expected even if remaining funds are written down to zero. Gains of $6.9 billion come from Citigroup stock alone. The CDCI operated similarly to the CPP. The Community Development Capital Initiative (CDCI) purchased preferred shares from financial institutions serving low-income communities and small businesses. Treasury bought shares up to 5% of risk-weighted assets for banks and thrifts, or 3.5% of total assets for credit unions. The initial dividend rate was 2%, increasing to 9% after eight years. Unlike the CPP, no warrants were included, and purchases were completed in September 2010 with $210 million in new shares bought and $360 million converted from CPP. The Community Development Capital Initiative (CDCI) purchased preferred shares from financial institutions serving low-income communities and small businesses. Approximately $360 million of shares were converted from CPP. Eighty-four banks and credit unions received funds, with 28 previously participating in CPP. As of August 2018, 15 institutions remain in the CDFI. Treasury announced the Public Private Investment Program (PPIP) on March 23, 2009, to remove troubled assets from bank balance sheets by leveraging private and government funds. The Public Private Investment Program (PPIP) was introduced by the Treasury to remove troubled assets from bank balance sheets. Private investors would match TARP funds, choose assets to purchase, and manage the funds. The program aimed to remove existing mortgage-related securities from bank balance sheets, but only $22.4 billion was committed, far below the envisioned $1 trillion. Private investment fund managers had to prequalify to raise funds for the program. The Treasury introduced the Public Private Investment Program (PPIP) to remove troubled assets from bank balance sheets. Approved fund managers raised private equity capital and received matching Treasury capital and loans to invest in nonagency MBS. Nine funds were prequalified, but one fund reached a liquidation agreement with Treasury in early January 2010. By March 31, 2013, five funds were wound down. The Public Private Investment Program (PPIP) was introduced by the Treasury to remove troubled assets from bank balance sheets. By March 31, 2013, five funds had been effectively wound down, returning all $18.6 billion of disbursed funds with no losses. The program earned the Treasury $3.9 billion in income. Additionally, the program supported the Small Business Administration's Section 7(a) loan program through purchases of pooled SBA guaranteed securities. Treasury purchased $368 million in securities guaranteed by the SBA, with all securities sold or matured by October 2010. The SBA Section 7(a) Securities Purchase Program supported financial and nonfinancial firms under TARP. The program provided funding to General Motors and Chrysler through TARP's Automotive Industry Financing Program. Initial support included secured loans of up to $13.4 billion to GM and $4 billion to Chrysler. The Treasury provided financial assistance to General Motors and Chrysler through TARP's Automotive Industry Financing Program. GM received $50.2 billion in direct loans and indirect support, while Chrysler received $10.9 billion in loans and indirect assistance. GMAC also received a $5 billion capital injection through preferred share purchases. The Treasury provided financial assistance to General Motors, Chrysler, and GMAC through TARP's Automotive Industry Financing Program. As of August 1, 2018, the total support for the auto industry was approximately $79.7 billion, with $63.1 billion repaid and $8.4 billion in income. Approximately $16.6 billion was written off or taken as a realized loss. The Federal Reserve introduced emergency credit facilities in December 2007 to provide liquidity to the financial system. The Federal Reserve introduced emergency credit facilities in December 2007 to provide liquidity to the financial system. These facilities made short-term loans backed by collateral exceeding the loan value, with recourse to the borrower's assets if default occurs. Loans were available to qualified participants, including nonbanks not regulated by the Fed. Profits or losses from Fed lending accrue to taxpayers, similar to Treasury loans. Total assistance outstanding peaked at over $1 trillion during the crisis, a significant increase from pre-crisis levels. The Federal Reserve introduced emergency credit facilities in December 2007 to provide liquidity to the financial system through short-term loans backed by collateral. Profits or losses from Fed lending accrue to taxpayers, similar to Treasury loans. Fed remittances to the Treasury have increased from $35 billion in 2007 to over $75 billion annually since 2010, benefiting taxpayers. The Federal Reserve's emergency credit facilities, introduced in 2007, aimed to provide liquidity to the financial system through short-term loans backed by collateral. Taxpayers have benefited from the Fed's lending facilities, which were not risk-free, through increased remittances to the Treasury. The Fed has the authority to lend to banks and purchase certain assets, relying on emergency authority for new programs. All credit outstanding under these facilities has been repaid, with no losses reported by the Fed. The Federal Reserve's emergency credit facilities provided liquidity to the financial system through short-term loans backed by collateral. Estimating a subsidy rate on Fed lending is complex due to the Fed's control over the federal funds rate. The Fed's direct loans during the crisis were made at a very low rate to avert a crisis, raising questions about whether reducing the federal funds rate should be considered a subsidy. The Federal Reserve provided liquidity to the financial system through emergency credit facilities during the crisis. The Fed argues that reducing the federal funds rate was necessary to prevent a crisis, and it was not a subsidy as there was no private sector alternative. Detailed data on Fed activities, including outstanding balances and borrower information, is regularly reported. Specific transaction details, such as recipient identities and collateral, were disclosed in December 2010 as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The Federal Reserve created the Term Auction Facility (TAF) in December 2007 to provide liquidity to banks in exchange for collateral. The facility was equivalent to the discount window but was created to address the stigma associated with discount window lending. While the TAF was not temporary, no auctions have been held since March 8, 2010. Eligible depository institutions accessed the TAF and the discount window to address financial conditions. The Term Auction Facility (TAF) was created by the Federal Reserve in December 2007 to provide liquidity to banks through auctions held twice a month. The facility aimed to address the stigma associated with discount window lending and banks were the largest private sector recipient of Fed assistance since 2007. Loans outstanding under the TAF peaked at $493 billion in March 2009 and fell to zero when the facility expired in March 2010. Risks to the Fed were limited by collateral requirements, short loan duration, and recourse requirements. The Term Auction Facility (TAF) provided liquidity to banks through auctions, with loans maturing in 28 days (some in 84 days). Collateral requirements were similar to discount window lending, with most collateral being previously made loans and asset-backed securities. The Fed had no losses and earned $4.1 billion from the TAF. The Fed created the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) to provide liquidity to primary dealers like Bear Stearns before its crisis in March 2008. The TSLF allowed primary dealers to borrow up to $200 billion of Treasury securities for 28 days. Treasury securities are crucial for primary dealers in repurchase agreements. The Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) provided liquidity to primary dealers by allowing them to borrow Treasury securities for short-term financing. The facility included collateralized loans with private-label MBS and agency securities. After September 2008, all investment-grade debt securities were accepted as collateral. The TSLF expired in February 2010 with no losses and earned $781 million. The Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) was created after Bear Stearns' crisis, offering loans at the Fed's discount rate. The Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) provided loans to primary dealers at the Fed's discount rate, with collateral and recourse. Acceptable collateral included various securities, and equities were added in September 2008. The facility expired on February 1, 2010, with borrowing peaking at $148 billion on October 1, 2008. Borrowing was sporadic, with Bear Stearns being a major borrower before its merger with J.P. Morgan Chase. The Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) peaked at $148 billion on October 1, 2008, and had zero outstanding loans after May 2009. It experienced no losses and earned $0.6 billion in interest income. Commercial paper is routinely issued by large firms to meet liquidity needs, with three categories of issuers: financial firms, nonfinancial firms, and pass-through entities backed by assets. Commercial paper issued by firms, not backed by collateral, matures quickly. Individual investors buy through money market funds. A run on funds in 2008 decreased demand for new commercial paper. Firms rely on it to roll over debt. The Fed created AMLF to support the market. Banks received nonrecourse loans to purchase asset-backed commercial paper. The AMLF provided nonrecourse loans to banks to purchase commercial paper collateralized loans, reaching $152 billion at its peak in October 2008. It was later replaced by the CPFF, which bought various types of highly rated U.S. commercial paper. The CPFF charged different interest rates based on the type of paper purchased and expired on February 1, 2010. The CPFF bought commercial paper with different interest rates and could purchase as much as an issuer had outstanding. It held $351 billion at its peak in January 2009, earning $6.1 billion with no losses before expiring in February 2010. The AMLF provided loans to banks for commercial paper, later replaced by the CPFF. The Fed also created the MMIFF to lend up to $540 billion. The MMIFF, part of the Fed's commercial paper facilities, was planned to lend up to $540 billion to private sector SPVs investing in commercial paper. Each SPV would purchase commercial paper from a group of financial firms to help avoid runs on money market mutual funds. The MMIFF was never used and expired in October 2009. Bear Stearns faced bankruptcy due to short-term debt concerns, prompting fears of systemic risk. Bear Stearns faced bankruptcy and was deemed \"too big to fail.\" The Fed intervened by brokering a merger with JPMorgan Chase on March 16, 2008. To facilitate the acquisition, the Fed lent $28.82 billion to Maiden Lane I, a Delaware LLC, to purchase illiquid mortgage-related assets from Bear Stearns. JPMorgan Chase took a subordinated loan position of $1.15 billion and received an interest rate of 4.5% above the discount rate. Any additional losses would be absorbed by the Fed. By November 2012, Maiden Lane I assets were sold to fully repay the Fed and JPMorgan Chase. As of December 30, 2017, remaining assets were valued at $1.7 billion. The Fed stands to realize capital gains once these assets are sold, depending on their future value. Table 16 summarizes the support for Bear Stearns, including loans, losses or gains, and program conditions. The FDIC played a significant role in the financial crisis by resolving failed banks and administering federal guarantees on deposits. They implemented exceptional measures like the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program to support liquidity in the banking system. This program was authorized under the FDIC's systemic risk-mitigation authority. Financial institutions eligible for participation included peak loans, losses or gains, and program conditions. The Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP) was a voluntary program administered by the FDIC to support liquidity in the banking system. Eligible financial institutions were automatically registered unless they opted out by November 12, 2008. The program guaranteed bank debt issued before October 31, 2009, with fees up to 1.1% of the guaranteed debt on an annualized basis. The guarantee remained in effect until December 31, 2012. The FDIC established a limited successor program to the Debt Guarantee Program, with a six-month emergency guarantee facility for certain participating entities. The fee for issuing debt under this program was at least 3%. The Transaction Account Guarantee insured non-interest-bearing deposit accounts beyond the $250,000 limit, benefiting accounts used by businesses and local governments. The FDIC extended the TAG portion of the TLGP through December 31, 2010, but it was not further extended due to the Dodd-Frank Act. The program guaranteed $1.5 trillion in deposits, with participation from almost 90% of FDIC-insured institutions. The DGP guaranteed $345.8 billion in debt and the TAG guaranteed $834 billion in deposits in 2009. The TAG program collected $1.2 billion in fees over its life. The TAG program collected $1.2 billion in fees, insufficient to cover $1.5 billion in losses. In contrast, the DGP collected $10.4 billion in fees, offsetting $0.2 billion in losses. The Treasury had limited authority before EESA and TARP. On September 16, 2008, the Reserve Fund \"broke the buck,\" triggering a money market run due to losses from Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy. The Reserve Fund \"broke the buck\" in September 2008, leading to a run on money market funds. Treasury announced a program to guarantee deposits in participating funds to stop the run, using assets from the Exchange Stabilization Fund. Congress later addressed the guarantee in EESA, reimbursing the ESF but forbidding future guarantees. The program expired in September 2009. The Money Market Mutual Fund Guarantee Program, which expired in September 2009, reported no failed guaranteed funds and collected $1.2 billion in fees over its lifespan. The program covered over $3 trillion in deposits, with 98% of money market mutual funds protected. The ESF was used to increase liquidity by purchasing GSE securities from the Reserve Fund. The Fed created the TALF in November 2008 in response to issues in the ABS market. The Fed noted a significant decline in new issuance of asset-backed securities (ABS) in September and October, with interest rate spreads on AAA-rated tranches of ABS reaching historically high levels. Data showed a sharp drop in issuance of nonresidential mortgage ABS from $902 billion in 2007 to $5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008. To prevent a credit crunch, the Fed provided nonrecourse loans to private investors to purchase high-rated ABS, using them as collateral. The Fed provided nonrecourse loans to private investors to purchase high-rated ABS as collateral, with a minimum loan size of $10 million. Eligible collateral included new securities backed by various types of loans. TALF was later expanded to include \"legacy\" commercial mortgage-backed securities. Loans have a term of up to three years (five for some assets) with interest rates set at a markup over LIBOR or the federal funds rate. If ABS lose value, losses are borne by the Fed and Treasury instead of the borrower, making TALF riskier for taxpayers. The TALF program, despite being smaller than initially envisioned, had unique features that made it riskier for taxpayers. The Fed provided nonrecourse loans with a haircut on collateral value, and any losses were covered by Treasury. However, low issuance of eligible assets suggested investor aversion to ABS, limiting the program's effectiveness. The TALF program, which stopped making new loans in 2010, saw its last outstanding loan repaid in 2014, resulting in $0.7 billion to Treasury and $1.6 billion to the Fed. AIG, a federally chartered thrift holding company, was regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision in 2008. AIG, a federally chartered thrift holding company regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision, faced significant losses leading to stock price decline and credit rating downgrades. The company was at risk of bankruptcy, prompting the Fed to provide a high-interest line of credit worth up to $85 billion to prevent potential market disruption. The government provided financial support to AIG through a $85 billion line of credit and warrants for equity. The support was later restructured to include a reduced Fed loan, purchase of preferred shares through TARP, and asset purchases totaling up to $52.5 billion. The government maintained a 79.9% equity position in AIG throughout the restructuring. The government's equity position in AIG remained mostly unchanged after restructuring. In March 2009, the assistance was further restructured with a partial payback of the Fed loan through debt-for-equity swaps in AIG subsidiaries, reducing the maximum assistance to $35 billion. Additional future TARP purchases of up to $29.8 billion in preferred shares were committed, along with the conversion of existing shares. The Maiden Lane LLCs continued operating under previous terms, with loans totaling $43.9 billion at their peak. Another restructuring of government assistance was announced in September 2010 and finalized in January 2011 to simplify the government's interest in AIG. The government's plan to divest its stake in AIG involved ending the Fed's involvement through loan repayment, converting preferred shares to common shares, and selling them to the public. The Treasury held 92% of AIG's common equity and sold it over time, completing sales in December 2012. Treasury sold AIG equity over time, completing sales in December 2012. Federal Reserve loans repaid, Maiden Lane LLCs assets sold. Last government-held assets related to AIG intervention, TARP warrants sold in January 2013. TARP realized losses on AIG holdings, offset by Fed earnings. GSEs Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac faced debt yield issues in 2008, leading to HERA enactment. Congress enacted the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA) in response to the financial distress of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. HERA created the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to regulate the companies and gave the government authority to place them in conservatorship. FHFA took control of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in September 2008 to stabilize their financial condition. In a conservatorship, the powers of a Company's directors, officers, and shareholders are transferred to the designated Conservator. The Treasury purchased up to $200 billion of new senior preferred stock from firms to cover shortfalls between assets and liabilities. Treasury received 10% dividends on the preferred shares in exchange. The Treasury purchased preferred shares with a commitment fee, warrants, and liquidation preference shares. The GSEs matched their liabilities until drawing $4 billion in 2017. Treasury announced in 2012 that the GSEs would not retain profits. The GSEs will be wound down and not allowed to retain profits, with preferred share agreements amended to remit all profits to the Treasury. Treasury had written down the market value of its preferred shares to $109.3 billion by FY2012. The financial performance of the GSEs has improved significantly, with quarterly surpluses instead of deficits. They received $191.5 billion for preferred shares and paid $279.7 billion in income. Policymakers are debating how to maximize returns if the GSEs are wound down or their business transferred. The Fed purchased $172.1 billion of GSE bonds between 2008 and 2010 to support the mortgage market indirectly. The Federal Reserve purchased GSE bonds to support mortgage markets and stimulate economic conditions through quantitative easing. The Fed's holdings have declined over time to $57.2 billion as of December 31, 2013. The Fed faces no default risk on its GSE holdings as long as the Treasury stands behind the GSEs. It has earned $12.9 billion in interest from these securities through the third quarter of 2013. Additionally, the Fed and Treasury have bought MBS guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae since 2008. Between September 2008 and December 2009, Treasury purchased $220.8 billion of MBS, with peak holdings of $197.6 billion in December 31, 2009. From March 2011 to April 2012, it reduced those holdings to zero, earning $12 billion in profits over the program's life. The Fed purchased $1.25 trillion in MBS between January 2009 and March 2010 as part of quantitative easing, and resumed purchases in September 2012. Unlike GSE preferred stock or bonds, MBS purchases do not directly benefit GSEs but indirectly benefit them as major holders of MBS. Fed stopped adding to MBS holdings in 2014 and has been gradually reducing them since 2017. On November 23, 2008, the Treasury, Federal Reserve, and FDIC intervened in Citigroup with a $20 billion purchase of preferred shares through the TARP Targeted Investment Program and a government guarantee for $306 billion in Citigroup assets. Citigroup paid the government a fee for the guarantee in the form of $4 billion in trust preferred securities. The Treasury also received warrants for the purchase of common stock in these transactions. On February 27, 2009, the Treasury Department converted $25 billion of its TARP CPP investment in Citigroup preferred stock into Citigroup common stock, resulting in the U.S. government owning approximately 33.6% of Citigroup common stock. This conversion worsened the government's priority on Citigroup's assets in case of liquidation but improved certain capital ratios for the company and relieved it from paying dividends to the government. The government's exposure to potential risk and reward increased with this conversion. In December 2009, Citigroup and the Treasury agreed to repay $20 billion in preferred securities and cancel the asset guarantee. Treasury also canceled $1.8 billion of the $4 billion trust preferred securities. Citigroup repurchased the outstanding AGP trust preferred securities in September 2009. The Treasury began selling its common share holdings in Citigroup in April 2010, completing the sales in December 2010 at an average price of $4.14 per share. In December 2010, the Treasury sold its common shares in Citigroup at an average price of $4.14 per share, resulting in a gain of approximately $6.9 billion. Additional gains from Citigroup assistance totaled approximately $13.4 billion, including sales of TARP trust preferred securities, interest and dividends, sale of warrants, sale of subordinated notes, and termination fees. On January 16, 2009, the Treasury, Federal Reserve, and FDIC intervened in Bank of America with $20 billion in preferred shares and a guarantee on $118 billion of assets. Bank of America would bear up to $10 billion in losses, with the government covering 90% thereafter. Losses would be split between the TARP Asset Guarantee program. Bank of America was to pay the federal government a fee for the guarantee in the form of $4 billion in preferred stock with an 8% dividend rate and warrants to purchase common stock worth $2.4 billion at the time of the agreement. However, a final agreement was never signed, and on September 21, 2009, Bank of America negotiated a $425 million termination fee to withdraw from the Asset Guarantee Program, canceling the warrants and preferred shares. On December 9, 2009, Bank of America repurchased the $45 billion in preferred stock previously purchased under TARP. The warrants issued under the CPP and the TIP were sold at auction by the government in March 2010 for approximately $1.6 billion. The government provided support to Bank of America in March 2010 for $1.6 billion, with no outstanding assistance remaining. Interventions during the 2007-2009 financial crisis aimed to restore normalcy to financial markets by increasing liquidity, providing equity to institutions, purchasing illiquid securities, and preventing the failure of large troubled institutions deemed \"too big to fail.\" The government interventions during the financial crisis aimed to restore financial normalcy and were considered successful. Evaluating the government's performance includes assessing whether normalcy was restored at minimal cost to taxpayers. The government received financial assets, warrants, and loans in exchange for its outlays, generating income through dividends, fees, and interest. Measuring the program's cost solely by the government's cash outlay is misleading. The true cost to the government of financial interventions during the crisis is the difference between initial outlay and money recouped from income payments and asset sales, considering risks. Government could potentially make a profit if income payments or asset resale prices are high enough. The government interventions during the crisis, including Federal Reserve programs, mostly generated positive net income for taxpayers. Only three interventions resulted in net losses, with most programs exceeding initial outlays. Overall, these interventions have yielded tens of billions of dollars in net income for taxpayers, surpassing initial cost estimates.
