    "content": "The ACA mandates individuals to have health insurance coverage or face a penalty. Some are exempt, while others may receive financial assistance. Compliance started in 2014, with penalties assessed through tax filings in 2015. Minimum essential coverage must be maintained to avoid penalties. The ACA mandates individuals to have health insurance coverage or face a penalty. Minimum essential coverage includes government-sponsored and private insurance. Noncompliance may result in penalties based on income percentage or flat dollar amount. Penalty amounts increase over time. The penalty for not having health insurance under the ACA increases over time, with the flat dollar amount adjusted for inflation. The penalty is reduced by half for dependents under 18 and capped at 300% of the annual amount. In 2015, the penalty for a taxpayer and dependents is limited to three times $325, or $975. The total monthly penalty cannot exceed the cost of the national average premium for bronze-level health plans. In 2015, the maximum penalty for taxpayers liable for penalties for five or more individuals is $1,035 per month. Penalties must be included in federal income tax returns, and joint filers are jointly liable. Failure to pay the penalty may result in IRS collection efforts, such as reducing tax refunds. Individuals who fail to pay the penalty for not having health insurance under the ACA will not face criminal prosecution or penalties. The Secretary of the Treasury cannot file a lien or levy on property for non-payment. Exemptions from the individual mandate and penalty are outlined in statute and IRS regulations, with the HHS Secretary able to grant hardship exemptions for those unable to obtain health insurance coverage. Individuals facing financial, domestic, or other circumstances preventing them from obtaining health insurance coverage can receive a hardship exemption. This includes those unable to afford coverage based on projected household income, with income below the filing threshold, or ineligible for Medicaid due to a state's decision not to expand ACA coverage. Additionally, those identified as eligible for affordable employer-sponsored insurance but unable to afford the aggregate cost may also qualify for an exemption. Individuals can be exempt from the health insurance mandate and penalty based on various factors such as financial status, affiliations, or living abroad for more than 330 days. Some exemptions require obtaining certification from a health insurance exchange or claiming it through the tax filing process. The individual mandate for health insurance went into effect in 2014. Taxpayers had to report their coverage status and exemptions on their federal tax returns. The Department of the Treasury has not yet released information on the number of individuals subject to penalties or exemptions in 2014. The ACA Medicaid expansion in 2014 increased Medicaid enrollment significantly by including non-elderly, nonpregnant individuals with income below 133% of the federal poverty level. Some individuals who do not qualify for Medicaid can receive subsidies to help pay for health plan premiums through an exchange. The ACA requires certain information to be provided to the IRS and individuals to ensure compliance with the individual mandate for health insurance. Every entity providing minimum essential coverage must submit a return to the IRS and a statement to the covered individual to comply with the individual mandate. Insurers, plan sponsors, and government agencies are the reporting entities for different types of coverage. Insurers do not need to provide returns or statements for coverage offered through an individual health insurance exchange. The reporting entity for health insurance coverage is the health insurance exchange or insurers offering small group coverage through a SHOP exchange. The return to the IRS must include details like the reporting entity's name, address, and EIN, individual and employer information, coverage months, QHP status, and additional specified information. The reporting entity for health insurance coverage must provide a statement to each responsible individual covered under the policy. This statement includes contact information, policy number, and information for the IRS return. Reporting entities began submitting returns in 2014, with a delay until 2015. Failure to file timely and accurate returns or provide statements may result in penalties. The appendix provides penalty examples for individuals and families under the individual mandate for 2014 and 2015. It includes filing thresholds, penalty caps, and maximum penalties per month. The 2015 penalty cap for individuals filing jointly is $207 per month, up to a maximum of five individuals. The filing thresholds and penalty caps for 2016 have not been determined yet. The filing thresholds for 2016 are expected to be higher due to inflation adjustments. The examples for 2016 use estimated filing thresholds, as the penalty caps for 2016 are not available. The numbers for 2016 are for illustrative purposes only to show the scope of penalties and the relationship between penalty components. In 2014 and 2015, individual-mandate penalties were based on income levels. For example, in 2014, an individual with income above $10,150 but below $19,650 paid a $95 flat amount. In 2015, an individual with income above $10,300 but below $26,550 paid a $325 flat amount. Penalty caps applied to higher income levels. In 2016, individual mandate penalties were based on income levels. An individual with income above the filing threshold but below $38,250 paid a $695 flat amount. Those with income above $38,250 paid 2.5% of applicable income. Penalty caps applied to higher income levels, with individuals above $134,500 paying a capped amount. In 2014, individuals with income above $20,300 but at or below $48,800 paid a $285 flat dollar amount. Those with income above $48,800 but below $999,500 paid 1% of applicable income. In 2015, individuals with income above $20,600 but at or below $69,350 paid a $975 flat dollar amount. Those with income above $69,350 and $517,400 paid 2% of applicable income. In 2016, individuals with income above $20,900 but at or below $104,300 paid a $2,085 flat dollar amount. In 2016, individuals with income above $104,300 will pay a $2,085 flat dollar amount; those below this threshold will pay 2.5% of applicable income. A family of four with income at or above the penalty cap will pay the capped amount."
