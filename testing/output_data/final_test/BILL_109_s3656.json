The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) aims to combat the global AIDS epidemic with $9 billion targeted for initiatives in 15 focus countries, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa. The prevention goal is to avert 7 million HIV infections through the ABC model (Abstain, Be faithful, use Condoms), promoting abstinence-until-marriage, and addressing local prevention needs. The Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 requires one-third of prevention funds for abstinence-until-marriage programs. The U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator mandates 50 percent of prevention funding for sexual transmission prevention activities, limiting other strategies. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported challenges in allocating funding under the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found challenges in meeting the earmark for abstinence-until-marriage programs under the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. Country teams face difficulties in responding to local epidemiology and cultural norms, with some having to allocate more than 33 percent of prevention funds to abstinence-until-marriage activities, impacting other programs. Prevention funds for activities like condom promotion and STI management decreased from 23% to 18% in 2006 due to abstinence-until-marriage spending requirements. This led to reduced funding for programs like Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission, limiting services for pregnant women and children, as well as programs for high-risk groups like married discordant couples, sexually active youth, and commercial sex workers. The abstinence-until-marriage spending requirement hindered funding for medical and blood safety activities, leading to potential cuts in condom procurement and social marketing. The implementation of the ABC model was found to be unclear, causing confusion about target groups and messaging. The ABC guidance lacks clarity on permissible activities under the model. The ABC model restricts promoting condoms to youth, causing confusion about using PEPFAR funds for condom social marketing. Sub-Saharan Africa has two-thirds of people living with HIV, with prevalence rates ranging from 4% to 37% in different countries. The HIV prevalence rate ranges from 4 percent in Uganda to 37 percent in Botswana. Young people aged 15-24 are most threatened by AIDS, accounting for half of all new HIV cases globally. Many adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa have sex before marriage, with inadequate information on protection. Young people in sub-Saharan Africa, especially women, lack knowledge on HIV prevention methods like abstinence, monogamy, and condom use. Coercion, sexual violence, and gender inequality contribute to their vulnerability to infection. Marriage does not protect young women from HIV. Marriage does not protect young women from HIV, and in some cases, it may even increase their risk. Sex education programs promoting abstinence and condom use do not lead to increased sexual activity. Young people play a crucial role in changing the course of the AIDS epidemic. According to the World Health Organization, focusing on young people is the most effective approach to confronting the AIDS epidemic, especially in high prevalence countries. The Sense of Congress is outlined in Section 3. The Sense of Congress emphasizes the need to provide sexually active young people in countries with high HIV infection rates with knowledge and tools to protect themselves from HIV, including medically accurate information on prevention strategies. The curr_chunk emphasizes providing information on preventing HIV and other STIs through education on condom use, abstinence, and reducing casual sexual partners. The curr_chunk focuses on the allocation of funds. The curr_chunk amends the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 by defining abstinence-until-marriage programs as those prioritizing abstinence for unmarried individuals to prevent HIV transmission. The curr_chunk discusses promoting skill-building strategies for practicing abstinence to prevent HIV transmission. The curr_chunk focuses on providing assistance to young people. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended to include sexually active young people in countries with a generalized HIV epidemic. This means HIV is spreading in the general population, with infection rates exceeding 1 percent among people aged 15-49."
