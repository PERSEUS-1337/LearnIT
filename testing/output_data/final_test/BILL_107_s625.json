    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act of 2001\". Congress finds that violence motivated by race, religion, gender, or other factors is a serious national problem that disrupts communities. State and local authorities handle most violent crimes but need more federal assistance. Current federal law is insufficient to address bias-motivated violence. Violence motivated by bias devastates victims, their families, friends, and communities. It affects interstate commerce by impeding movement, forcing relocation, hindering purchases, employment, and commercial activities. Perpetrators cross state lines to commit such violence. Violence motivated by bias utilizes interstate commerce to facilitate its commission. It is historically linked to slavery and involuntary servitude based on race, color, and ancestry. Eliminating racially motivated violence is crucial in eradicating the remnants of slavery. To eliminate the remnants of slavery, it is necessary to prohibit assaults based on real or perceived religions or national origins, as certain groups were historically perceived as distinct races. Federal jurisdiction over bias-motivated violent crimes allows authorities to address such incidents effectively. The serious and widespread problem of bias-motivated crimes warrants Federal assistance to States and local jurisdictions for effective investigation and prosecution. The term \"hate crime\" is defined in this Act as per the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. Additionally, there is support provided for criminal investigations and prosecutions by state and local law enforcement officials. The Attorney General may provide various forms of assistance in criminal investigations or prosecutions of violent crimes or felonies motivated by prejudice based on certain characteristics at the request of state or tribal law enforcement officials. The Attorney General may prioritize providing assistance for hate crimes committed by offenders in multiple states or rural jurisdictions with limited resources. Grants can be awarded to help cover the extraordinary expenses of investigating and prosecuting hate crimes for State, local, and Indian law enforcement officials. The Office of Justice Programs will collaborate with funded jurisdictions to address the concerns of all affected parties. Each State seeking a grant under this subsection must submit an application to the Attorney General within a specified 60-day period, meeting all requirements set forth by the Attorney General. The application for assistance under this subsection must describe the need for the grant, certify lack of resources for investigating or prosecuting hate crimes, demonstrate consultation with victim services programs. The Attorney General must approve or disapprove grant applications within 30 business days. Grants cannot exceed $100,000 for a single jurisdiction in a year. A report must be submitted to Congress by December 31, 2002, detailing the grants. The Attorney General must approve grant applications within 30 days. Grants cannot exceed $100,000 per jurisdiction per year. A report detailing grant applications, awards, and expenditures must be submitted to Congress. $5,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2002 and 2003. SEC. 5. GRANT PROGRAM.
