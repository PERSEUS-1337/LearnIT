    "content": "The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, introduced by Representative Paul C. Ryan and Senator Patty Murray, raised defense and nondefense budget spending limits for FY2014 and FY2015. The bill was passed by the House and Senate in December 2013 and signed into law by President Obama. The National Defense budget limit was increased by $22 billion to $520 billion for FY2014. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 raised defense and nondefense budget spending limits for FY2014 and FY2015. The new FY2014 limit for the Department of Defense was set at $497 billion, just above the current limit of $476 billion. If Congress extended the current CR level for the full year at these new limits, there would be no sequester in January 2014. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees are drafting FY2014 funding bills that would conform to the newly revised budget caps. For FY2015, the new budget limit for National Defense would be $523 billion, $9 billion above the current limit. Similarly, the new FY2015 limit for DOD would be $498 billion, $9 billion higher than the current limit. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 raised defense and nondefense budget spending limits for FY2014 and FY2015. The National Defense spending over the FY2012-FY2021 decade would total $5.447 trillion, $32 billion above the current limit. DOD spending would total $5.206 trillion, a $30 billion increase over current limits. The Act also reduces COLAs for military retirees under 62, saving $6.235 billion for the Department of Defense over the decade. The proposed change in COLAs for military retirees would save the Department of Defense $6.235 billion over the decade. It would apply to most military retirees, excluding \"REDUX\" retirees. Some Members have expressed concerns about this reduction in benefits, but the proposal may be reconsidered later as it does not take effect until December 1, 2015. Congress faces decisions in January 2014 regarding extending the current CR or passing appropriations acts to avoid a government shutdown and sequester. To avoid a sequester, Congress must appropriate defense spending within BCA limits. If new limits are adopted and defense spending matches the current CR, there will be no sequester. However, if defense appropriations exceed BCA limits, OMB would impose a sequester. Under current BCA limits, a sequester would reduce defense spending by $20 billion in mid-January 2014 to comply with the BCA. The House and Senate passed the FY2014 National Defense Authorization Act, which was signed into law on December 26, 2013. This act effectively removed the threat of a sequester by adopting new limits on defense spending to comply with the Budget Control Act. The CR (P.L. 113-46) provided funds for DOD and federal agencies to resume normal operations after a 16-day government shutdown due to lack of FY2014 appropriations. The CR allowed spending at FY2013 levels, taking into account sequestration. DOD received about $495 billion under the CR. During the government shutdown in FY2014, some DOD personnel were exempt from furloughs, including all uniformed military personnel and some civilians. Legislation was passed to appropriate funds to pay active-duty military and some DOD civilian personnel costs during the shutdown. During the government shutdown in FY2014, legislation was passed to provide funds for active-duty military personnel, DOD civilian personnel, and death gratuities for survivors of military personnel who die while on active duty. The Obama Administration requested $632.7 billion for military activities, including $526.6 billion for the base budget and $80.7 million for war costs. The Obama Administration requested $632.7 billion for military activities in FY2014, including $526.6 billion for the base budget, $80.7 million for war costs, $18.9 billion for defense-related nuclear energy programs, and $7.4 billion for other defense-related activities. The House and Senate versions of the FY2014 NDAA differ slightly from the President's request, with the House bill authorizing more funds for military pay raise, shipbuilding, and ballistic missile defense. The House Armed Services Committee's proposal, presented to the House, would not negatively impact DOD programs as previously allocated funds could cover the requested new budget authority. The Senate's S. 1197 bill made minimal changes to the Administration's request, while the House bill added $5.4 billion. Ultimately, the compromise FY2014 NDAA bill, signed into law on Dec. 26, 2013, authorized a similar amount to the Administration's original request. The Administration requested about $589.5 billion for the base budget and OCO, with the House bill proposing a $4.2 billion reduction and the Senate bill a $2.2 billion reduction. FY2014 marks the third year of dealing with spending caps set by the BCA. In FY2021, the debt limit was raised in exchange for $2.1 trillion in reductions, with $900 billion coming from National Defense agencies in FY2013 budget. Additional $1.2 trillion reductions were to be achieved through sequester in FY2013 and automatic cuts to appropriations between FY2014 and FY2021. President Obama's FY2014 budget request was delayed. The FY2013 budget request was delayed due to uncertainties from the legislative battle over appropriations. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 set the initial amounts, subject to further reductions through sequestration to comply with the Budget Control Act of 2011. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 later amended the spending caps. The Administration's $552 billion national defense budget request for FY2014 would need to be reduced by $53.8 billion to comply with BCA limits. If defense appropriations exceeded the limit, a sequester would occur. The President's budget aims to achieve a $1.2 trillion reduction through revenue increases and entitlement program cuts. The BCA would be amended to defer the spending caps. The BCA would be amended to accommodate the President's FY2014 defense budget request of $552 billion. The House passed appropriations bills for defense, energy, water, and military construction-veterans administration. To achieve FY2014 savings mandated by the BCA, the House budget resolution proposes higher cuts to nondefense spending and changes to entitlement programs. Total discretionary spending for the year would be $967 billion, the limit allowed by the BCA. The BCA sets separate limits for defense and nondefense spending. The House's defense levels exceed the BCA cap, leading to a potential sequester cut in January 2014. The Senate's budget resolution aligns defense spending with the President's request, proposing a combination of revenue increases and entitlement spending reductions to offset spending above the BCA level. The Senate's budget resolution aligns defense spending with the President's request, proposing a combination of revenue increases and entitlement spending reductions to offset spending above the BCA level. DOD officials have raised concerns about the impact of sequestration on combat readiness and modernization due to the arbitrary nature of funding cuts. If the original BCA caps had not been amended by law, there would have been a $53.8 billion sequester cut to discretionary spending in early January 2014. The sequestration process allows DOD flexibility in implementing budget cuts, with exemptions for certain accounts. The President can exempt military personnel accounts to avoid involuntary separations, but the total amount to be sequestered from DOD remains unchanged. The sequestration process allows DOD flexibility in implementing budget cuts, with exemptions for certain accounts. House and Senate conferees defined a single PPA for the entire Operation and Maintenance (O&M) account of each service and reserve component, giving DOD flexibility in allocating cuts within those blocks of money. This could result in larger reductions in some O&M-funded activities to minimize cuts in other areas, such as operational training or support for combat units. DOD could also avoid or minimize sequestration cuts in funds for war operations in Afghanistan. Congress authorizes and appropriates separate amounts for base budget funding and OCO funding, with most funding co-mingled in PPAs subject to sequestration. DOD reduced OCO funding by $5.3 billion to meet the FY2013 sequester, possibly due to higher needs. Unobligated balances in investment accounts were reduced to allow for smaller cuts in newly appropriated budget authority. Among procurement accounts, FY2013 budget authority was cut by 5.2% on average, while unobligated funds were cut by 11.2% on average. After sequestration, DOD utilized reprogramming procedures to shift funds among accounts, requesting congressional approval to shift nearly $9 billion to cover essential expenses. This included reallocating $5.1 billion of OCO funding, with $3.0 billion from cancelled lower priority needs and the remainder from the base budget. If Congress passes a budget resolution amending BCA caps, it could avoid sequesters in defense spending. Ways to prevent sequesters include appropriating funds meeting the lowered cap before FY2014, following a joint budget resolution. The current CR (P.L. 113-46) is set to expire on January 15, 2014, and Congress may pass individual appropriations bills, an omnibus funding bill, or another CR by that time. Section 258B of the Deficit Control Act of 1985 allows the President to propose an alternative plan to meet defense sequester caps, which Congress would need to approve within five days. Bills have been introduced to give DOD more flexibility to meet lower BCA caps. Introduced by Representatives Cooper and Ryan on July 31, 2013, H.R. 2883, the Defense Flexibility Act, would allow the Secretary of Defense to transfer funds to meet \"urgent national priorities\" up to the amount sequestered in that account. The bill grants transfer authority to the Secretary of Defense between appropriations subject to reduction under a sequestration order. The Defense Flexibility Act, H.R. 2883, allows the Secretary of Defense to transfer funds to address urgent national priorities or consequences of a national emergency resulting from sequestration. The bill grants transfer authority between appropriations subject to reduction under a sequestration order, with limitations on the amount transferred. Some concerns have been raised about potential undermining of congressional funding priorities due to the significant transfer authority granted by the bill. The bill S. 465 requires a \"notice of implementation\" to be submitted to committees for approval before going into effect, which could be unconstitutional. It also gives DOD flexibility in multiyear contracts and production rate changes during a CR. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel warned of \"serious adverse effects\" if DOD's FY2014 base budget is reduced by $52 billion to comply with the BCA cap on defense spending. Secretary Hagel warned of the severe impact of a potential $52 billion reduction in DOD's FY2014 base budget to comply with the BCA cap on defense spending. He stated that the cuts would be too steep to be mitigated by flexibility, even with assumptions that the reduction would not affect the OCO request and DOD would have discretion in allocating the cuts. Hagel described the projected BCA impact as a high-level summary of DOD's approach to adjusting to lower budgets. Secretary Hagel predicted negative consequences if DOD were required to cut the President's FY2014 DOD base budget request by $52 billion, including a disproportionately small reduction in military personnel spending due to the cost of severance payments offsetting savings from involuntary separations. Hagel stated that cutting military personnel costs by 10% would require severe actions. Secretary Hagel described severe actions to address a $52 billion budget cut, including halting new personnel intake, freezing promotions, and reducing civilian hiring. The Department of Defense would minimize cuts to operation and maintenance costs directly tied to training and combat readiness but would reduce procurement, R&D, and military construction funding by 15% to 20%. Deputy Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter announced that the department would operate in FY2014 as though its budget were limited. The Department of Defense would begin operating in FY2014 as though its budget were limited by the BCA cap, which was more than $50 billion lower than the President's FY2014 request. This approach was taken to prepare for potential sequester cuts and to allow for easier adjustments in spending later in the year if needed. DOD Comptroller Robert Hale announced that DOD would be spending at or slightly below the CR level after the FY2014 CR set defense spending levels. Witnesses have raised concerns about negative effects of BCA budget caps on readiness and procurement schedules. The FY2013 DOD sequester totaled $37.2 billion, tapping all available DOD BA except military personnel accounts. The DOD's FY2013 base funding totaled $495.2 billion after all sequester cuts, with compliance measured by budget authority (BA) or funding amounts. Rescission of prior year unobligated balances cancels BA provided for programs in earlier years, but does not reduce resources available for current fiscal year programs or activities. The DOD's FY2013 base funding totaled $495.2 billion after sequester cuts, with an additional $20 billion decrease expected for FY2014. Funding available for FY2013 programs and activities totaled $501 billion, excluding rescissions. FY2014 BCA caps for defense are at their lowest point for the decade, with a slight increase in funding from FY2015 to FY2021. Some argue that the FY2013 sequester had harmful effects on readiness and investment accounts. The FY2013 sequester had harmful effects on readiness and investment accounts. The Obama Administration's FY2014 budget request includes $641.12 billion for National Defense programs, with $625.15 billion requested for programs falling within the scope of the annual National Defense Authorization Act. The Administration's budget for discretionary DOD budget authority in FY2014 includes $607.36 billion, with $526.64 billion for \"base\" defense budget costs and $80.72 billion for OCO, mainly in Afghanistan. This budget also includes $6.68 billion for TRICARE for Life program and $17.96 billion for defense-related programs. The National Defense discretionary total for FY2014 is $632.74 billion, with $17.96 billion allocated for defense-related programs of the Energy Department. This includes funding for nuclear weapons stockpile renovation, environmental cleanup, and nuclear powerplant development. An additional $7.41 billion is requested for defense-related activities in other agencies, with the largest share for FBI counterintelligence operations. Mandatory spending includes $8.40 billion, with $7.13 billion for military retirement fund payments. The legislation has narrowed limitations on \"concurrent receipt\" of military retired pay and disability annuity from the Department of Veterans Affairs. President Obama's FY2011 budget request projected $6.26 trillion for DOD's base budget over 10 years. The Budget Control Act in 2011 shaped subsequent debates on DOD budgets, with the FY2012 request as a baseline for reductions. Subsequent reductions in DOD discretionary spending have been measured from FY2012 to FY2021. The caps set by the Budget Control Act would require a total reduction of $977 billion (15.9%) compared to the FY2012 DOD 10-year plan. The FY2013 and FY2014 DOD budget plans further reduced projected spending, totaling a cumulative reduction of $577 billion (9.4%) compared to the FY2012 plan. An additional $400 billion reduction is needed to meet the BCA caps for FY2012-FY2021. The base budget for DOD increased steadily until 2010, then declined in FY2012 and FY2013 due to budget limits. Without modification, further reductions in National Defense spending are expected. From FY2015 to FY2020, there is projected to be a steady increase in DOD funding. The Administration's projection of discretionary DOD budget authority through FY2021 would provide a higher level of purchasing power. The DOD budget authority through FY2021 is projected to have higher purchasing power than the average annual budget since the Vietnam War. The $526.6 billion request for discretionary spending in DOD's FY2014 base budget aims to sustain current U.S. strategy and downsize the Army and Marine Corps. There are efforts to reduce costs and restrain personnel cost growth, with minimal impact on weapons acquisition programs. DOD agreed to cut $52 billion from the FY2014 base budget request to meet spending cap. Secretary Hagel initiated a review to develop alternative budget plans for FY2015-FY2019. Obama Administration's Strategic Guidance document informs DOD planning and budgeting for maintaining a sufficient force. The FY2014 base budget request for DOD focuses on maintaining a force capable of winning major conventional wars in one region and deterring aggression in another. The emphasis is on training for a spectrum of conflicts, from major wars to peacekeeping operations, and improving the ability to assist other countries in strengthening their security forces. The FY2014 DOD budget aims to enhance the ability to assist other countries in strengthening their security forces. It includes a plan to reduce the number of active Army and Marine Corps personnel by the end of FY2017, emphasizing operations in the Asia-Pacific region and the Middle East. The FY2014 DOD budget aims to reduce the number of active Army and Marine Corps personnel by the end of FY2017. The budget request includes a 1% raise in military basic pay, saving $540 million in FY2014 and nearly $3.5 billion through FY2018 compared to a 1.8% increase. The President set the 2014 monthly basic pay increase at 1.0 percent, deviating from the automatic 1.8% increase under 37 U.S.C. 1009. Congress can establish a different pay raise, and the Obama Administration had initially planned to increase military basic pay at the ECI rate for FY2014. The Administration proposed pay increases below the ECI rate for FY2015 in its FY2014 DOD budget, including new fees and fee increases for TRICARE beneficiaries. DOD justifies the increases due to rising medical costs, with Congress approving some fee increases for pharmacy copayments in FY2013. The proposed fee increases for FY2014 would not affect active-duty servicemembers but would impact their dependents. The FY2014 base budget request includes proposed fee increases for military retirees under 65, with a new TRICARE for Life enrollment fee. The budget incorporates efficiency initiatives to reduce spending by $17.03 billion over FY2014-FY2018, with significant savings from TRICARE cost reductions and DOD civilian payroll cuts. The FY2014 budget request includes proposed cuts to DOD civilian payrolls, enlistment bonuses, recruitment advertising, Army deployments in the Balkans, and Navy operation and maintenance budgets to save a total of $6.42 billion. The FY2014 budget request includes reductions in planned acquisition spending for weapons programs totaling $15.62 billion over FY2014-FY2018. Savings would come from program cancellations, reduced purchases, and wider use of multi-year procurement contracts. The proposed changes include dropping plans for the \"Block IIB\" version of the SM-3 anti-ballistic missile interceptor and canceling the Precision Tracking Space System, saving $2.06 billion and $1.72 billion respectively. The FY2014 budget includes savings of $270 million from canceling the Precision Tracking Space System, $1.35 billion from deferring the construction of the Apache attack helicopter, $1.09 billion from using Atlas rockets for satellite launches, $684 million from slowing procurement of the Navy's SM-6 anti-cruise missile interceptor, and $683 million from reducing overhead costs for the carrier-launched F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The FY2014 budget includes savings from various sources such as reducing the number of Navy's F/A-18 fighters, Marine Corps ammunition inventory, buying DDG-51-class destroyers and C-130J cargo planes on multi-year contracts. DOD projects a total reduction in military construction budgets over the FY2014-FY2018 period. The FY2014 budget includes savings of $4.13 billion, with cutbacks from base closures and medical facility shutdowns due to a rejected BRAC proposal. The $79.44 billion war costs request for OCO represents a 3% reduction from FY2013, with a 39% decrease in U.S. personnel deployed in Afghanistan. According to DOD's breakdown of the FY2014 OCO budget, key components like U.S. force operations, activities outside Afghanistan, and equipment purchases would see declines of less than 10%. These costs are decreasing at a slower rate than U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan due to expenses related to closing bases, returning equipment, and refurbishing worn-out equipment. The FY2014 OCO budget request for Afghanistan includes increasing U.S. support for the Afghan Army and National Police by 50% to $7.7 billion. The budget authority required is $80.7 billion, with efforts to reduce costs by rescinding $1.3 billion appropriated for FY2013 for Navy ships and Air Force cargo planes. The FY2014 budget request aims to reverse Congress's decision to retire Navy ships and Air Force cargo planes. Funding for the OCO budget would come from various sources, including money added by Congress in FY2013. H.R. 3304, signed into law in December 2013, aligns with the Administration's budget request. The versions of the NDAA passed by the House (H.R. 1960) and reported by the Senate Armed Services Committee (S. 1197) exceeded the cap on national defense spending in FY2014 by more than $30 billion. The final version of the bill (H.R. 3004) and the Senate committee version (S. 1197) align closely with the President's requested budget. The House-passed bill authorized $5.04 billion more for OCO funding than requested. The House-passed bill authorized $5.04 billion more for OCO funding than requested, including increases for depot maintenance, Army unit reset, fuel costs, and equipment for National Guard and reserve units. The enacted version of the bill authorized $2.0 million less than the OCO request, dropping about two-thirds of the House-passed increases. There was no basis for convening a House-Senate conference to reconcile the House-passed and Senate committee-reported versions of the FY2014 NDAA. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees negotiated a compromise version of the FY2014 NDAA, which was passed as an amendment to H.R. 3304. The House and Senate both approved the amended bill on December 12 and December 19, 2013, respectively. The FY2014 NDAA, passed as an amendment to H.R. 3304, made few additions to authorization levels for procurement and R&D programs. The bill blocked proposals to retire Navy ships early, increase TRICARE fees, and retire A-10 ground attack planes. The FY2014 NDAA made few additions to authorization levels for procurement and R&D programs, blocking proposals to retire Navy ships early, increase TRICARE fees, and retire A-10 ground attack planes. The NDAA also included actions related to selected Administration savings, with both versions authorizing more than requested for certain O&M accounts to accommodate budget reductions. The Senate committee-reported S. 1197 added $1.8 billion to these accounts, while the House-passed H.R. 1960 added $5.6 billion, including $4.6 billion for OCO funding. The final version of the FY2014 NDAA incorporates Administration proposals to reduce military personnel ceilings by over 40,000 for active component and over 8,000 for reserve components. The Army and Marine Corps plan to accelerate reductions in active-duty personnel by an additional 38,100 troops by FY2015 due to budget constraints. The final version of the FY2014 NDAA includes plans to reduce military personnel ceilings by over 40,000 for the active component and over 8,000 for reserve components. The Army and Marine Corps aim to accelerate reductions in active-duty personnel by an additional 38,100 troops by FY2015. The Senate committee's bill proposed a 1% raise in military basic pay for FY2014, while the House Armed Services Committee called for a 1.8% raise tied to the Employment Cost Index. The higher raise would increase FY2014 military personnel costs by $540 million. The FY2014 military pay raise was set at 1.0% by the President, who has the authority to specify an alternative raise. The FY2014 NDAA included provisions to address sexual assaults within the Armed Forces, with differences between the House and Senate bills. The FY2014 NDAA addressed sexual assaults in the Armed Forces, with differences between the House and Senate bills. H.R. 3304 included compromise versions of provisions related to sexual assault issues. H.R. 1960 included a provision allowing military chaplains to close prayers according to their faith traditions. The House rejected an amendment for nontheistic chaplains, and instead, H.R. 3304 requires a survey of military chaplains by DOD. H.R. 3304 includes a provision requiring DOD to survey military chaplains on restrictions affecting their ability to minister. The final bill urged consultation with all faith groups on policies impacting religious freedom. The FY2014 NDAA included a provision amending a law from the FY2013 NDAA regarding accommodating the beliefs of armed forces members. The concern was raised about the Department and services showing favoritism towards certain religious groups. Section 532 of the FY2014 NDAA amends existing law to allow individual expressions of belief in the Armed Forces, unless it impacts military readiness. H.R. 3304 does not authorize proposed increases in TRICARE premiums, catastrophic cap indexing, or enrollment fees for certain programs. H.R. 3304 would introduce enrollment fees for certain TRICARE programs, adding $218 million to the requested TRICARE authorization for FY2014. It would allow current TRICARE Prime participants to remain in the program, even in areas where new enrollees are barred. In February 2013, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta lifted the combat exclusion rule for female military personnel. He directed all military assignments to be open to women by January 1, 2016, with exceptions subject to approval. The House-passed FY2014 NDAA includes a provision for developing gender-neutral occupational standards for assigning members to units, including Special Operations Forces. In the final version of the bill, H.R. 3304, Section 524 included a House-passed provision with a technical amendment. The Senate Armed Services Committee praised DOD for moving towards a gender-neutral and performance-based assignment system. They encouraged full integration of women in all military occupations and expressed concerns about women's career opportunities. DOD was directed to submit a report on retention rates, career progression for female servicemembers, and personnel management options. H.R. 3304 included a provision for reserve component units with mobilization notice requirements to prevent last-minute deployment cancellations causing inconvenience. Secretaries of military departments must give 120 days' notice for deployment or provide explanations to Congress if notification is not given. In the bill reported by the Senate Armed Services Committee, Section 508 requires the Secretary of Defense to approve any decision to cancel a planned reserve unit deployment within 180 days if an active duty unit is deployed instead. Section 513 in the final bill adds a 120-day notice requirement for individual reserve component members mobilized. Congressional action on funding for ground force equipment is also summarized. The House bill would increase funding by $274 million for procurement of tanks and armored combat vehicles, citing concerns about the budget request being insufficient to sustain production capacity. The House committee expressed reservations about relying on foreign sales to maintain the industrial base and proposed additional authorization for vehicle production. The House bill, H.R. 1960, would add $274 million for armored vehicle programs, including upgrades for M-1 tanks and funding for armored recovery and assault breacher vehicles. This funding is in addition to the budget request and aims to address concerns about production capacity and reliance on foreign sales. The Senate bill would add $165 million for M-1 tank upgrades and armored recovery vehicles. Both H.R. 1960 and S. 1197 authorize funds for developing new battlefield vehicles, including the Army's Ground Combat Vehicle, Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle, Marines' Amphibious Combat Vehicle, and Joint Light Tactical Vehicle. The final version of the NDAA authorizes $134.6 million for the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) to replace the HMMWV. The Marine Personnel Carrier (MPC) program has been dropped due to deferral by the Marine Corps. The bill also includes provisions for the affordability and technical feasibility of the Ground Combat Vehicle and funding for the Amphibious Combat Vehicle. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees expressed concern about DOD's ability to fund the Navy's shipbuilding plan, especially the replacement of Trident missile-launching submarines. Rear Admiral Richard P. Breckenridge stated that the Navy would need an additional $60 billion over 15 years to replace the missile subs. The House Armed Services Committee directed DOD to submit a 30-year shipbuilding plan with annual budgets of $16 billion, as opposed to the assumed $20 billion. Congressional action on funding for naval systems includes authorizing $3.48 billion for 11 nuclear-powered aircraft carriers by the end of the decade. Congressional funding for naval systems includes $1.53 billion for two aircraft carriers currently under construction and $1.96 billion for major overhauls of two existing ships. This funding would cover refueling nuclear reactors and upgrading electronic and weapons systems. The congressional funding for naval systems includes $1.53 billion for two aircraft carriers under construction and $1.96 billion for major overhauls of existing ships. The bills would also increase the spending cap for the Ford (CVN 78) carrier. The final bill reduced $22.1 million from the carrier funding request for refueling overhauls. Additionally, funds are authorized for Virginia-class submarines, a new ballistic-missile sub, and an enlarged version of the Virginia-class. The House-passed H.R. 1960 aims to increase funding for the Virginia-class submarines by $492 million to offset sequestration cuts from the FY2013 appropriation. The total requested amount of $5.28 billion would support the construction of Virginia-class subs, with $2.93 billion allocated for one sub and partial funding for a second. An additional $2.35 billion is designated for long lead-time components for two more subs. The remaining funding is for R&D programs. The remaining sub-related funding, endorsed by both bills, includes $1.08 billion for R&D programs: $787.6 million for a next-generation ballistic missile sub and its nuclear powerplant, and $59.1 million for the Virginia Payload Module. H.R. 3304 supports the budget request for new Navy destroyers and adds funds to offset sequestration cuts from the destroyer programs. The budget for Navy destroyer programs in FY2013 was offset by funds added in the Senate and House bills, nearly matching the amount cut by sequestration. The DDG-1000 class was intended to succeed the DDG-51 class, but only three ships were built, with the Navy returning to procuring DDG-51-class ships. The Navy is transitioning to procurement of an enlarged \"Flight III\" version of the DDG-51 design with a larger radar for improved missile defense capability. The final version of the bill requires the Navy to compare costs and risks of resuming procurement of DDG-1000 type ships. The House Armed Services Committee directed the Secretary of the Navy to submit a report on the effectiveness of a larger version of the AMDR radar on a larger ship for missile defense. The final version of the bill authorizes $1.78 billion for procurement of four Littoral Combat Ships (LCSs) for missions in near shore waters, with interchangeable weapons modules for mine-sweeping, sub-hunting, or surface combat. H.R. 3304 also requires reports on the Navy's plans for LCS vessels and compares them with other U.S. ships. The final bill authorizes $1.78 billion for procurement of four Littoral Combat Ships (LCSs) with interchangeable weapons modules for various missions. It requires reports on the Navy's plans for LCS vessels, comparing them with other U.S. warships and potential adversaries. Additionally, it mandates assessments of the ships' suitability for missions and testing programs. Section 325 of the bill requires a detailed report on the Navy's plan to sustain the ships in areas far from U.S. shipyards using private contractors for maintenance. The Government Accountability Office was asked to review the Navy's plan for sustainment of the LCS. Congressional action on funding for aircraft and missile programs was approved in the final bill, including upgrades for B-2, B-1, and B-52 bombers, as well as funding for a new stealth bomber. The House-passed version of the bill denied authorization for modifying B-52s. The final bill approved funding for upgrades to B-2, B-1, and B-52 bombers, as well as a new stealth bomber. It authorized $1.47 billion for refurbishing Trident II missiles and $65.4 million for the Conventional Prompt Global Strike program. The bill did not include a provision to deny funds for B-52 modifications in compliance with the New START treaty. The final bill did not include a provision to deny funds for B-52 modifications in compliance with the New START treaty. However, House and Senate negotiators directed DOD to submit a report on managing the risk of an adversary assuming a submarine-launched missile carried a nuclear warhead. The House-passed bill aimed to cut $30.2 million from the budget request, with $14.7 million intended to prevent the decommissioning of ICBM missile silos. The House bill included provisions opposing the New START treaty and seeking additional reductions in nuclear arms. The final bill incorporated some arms control issues but did not include funding cuts related to New START compliance. The FY2014 budget request allocated $167.7 million for Navy R&D programs developing long-range armed drone aircraft for aircraft carriers, with $21.0 million for the Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle project. The House Armed Services Committee criticized the Navy for prematurely retiring the X-47 drones used in the UCAV project before exploring all technical challenges for the UCLASS drones. The committee disagreed with the decision to drop the midair refueling test controlled solely by on-board computers. H.R. 1960 proposed increasing UCAV authorization by $20.0 million. The House bill, H.R. 1960, aimed to increase UCAV authorization by $20.0 million to $41.0 million and included a provision for mid-air refueling tests with the X-47. The enacted version authorized $21.0 million for UCAV, without the requirement for mid-air refueling tests. The FY2014 budget request included $7.68 billion for the Missile Defense Agency for R&D efforts on sensors and weapons to detect and destroy ballistic missiles. The House-passed bill and Senate committee-reported NDAA would increase MDA authorization for Israeli defense systems and the Ground-based Midcourse Defense. H.R. 3304 would authorize $372 million more than requested for MDA, with Israeli systems receiving half the increase and U.S. territorial defense accounting for the rest. Congressional action on funding for missile defense programs is summarized in Appendix Table A-1. The budget request for missile defense programs includes $1.03 billion for the GMD system, which will be used for refurbishing and upgrading interceptor missiles, deploying additional interceptors in Alaska, and surveying potential East Coast launch sites. The FY2013 NDAA required DOD to develop a plan for an East Coast site to increase interception capabilities. Additionally, $315.2 million is requested for long-range radars essential for target data. H.R. 3304 authorizes $1.13 billion for GMD, including additional funding. H.R. 3304 authorizes $1.13 billion for GMD, including $20.0 million for a potential third site assessment and $80.0 million for investigating a flight test failure. It also mandates the deployment of an additional missile-detection radar for U.S. territory with an extra $30 million allocated. Both House and Senate bills authorize more than the requested $98.0 million for Israeli missile defense programs, with H.R. 1960 adding $173.0 million and S. 1197 adding $150.0 million. The House bill authorizes $220.3 million for Israel's Iron Dome system and an additional $15.0 million for U.S. production. H.R. 3304 also includes provisions for NATO to share costs of a regional missile defense system for Europe. The House bill includes provisions for NATO members to make additional \"burden-sharing\" contributions and detainee-related restrictions until December 31, 2014. During floor debate, an amendment regarding detainee transfers was rejected by the House. The House rejected an amendment to eliminate indefinite military detention for detainees in the US under the AUMF resolution. The Senate bill would have relaxed restrictions on detainee treatment and allowed for Guantanamo detainees to be transferred to the US for continued detention or trial. The Senate rejected two amendments related to detainee issues in the current law, retaining the strict prohibition on transferring detainees to the United States for any purpose. Amendment 2255 would have kept the provisions of current law that bar transfer of Guantanamo detainees, while Amendment 2175 would have barred detainees transferred to the US from requesting asylum. The final version of the bill allows for the transfer of detainees to other countries if they have been ordered released by a U.S. court or assessed as no longer a threat, with the Secretary of Defense determining if it is in the national security interest. Written certification to Congress is not required before executing a transfer. The compromise legislation on detainee transfers in the National Defense Authorization Act requires the Executive to report to Congress on Yemen's capability to detain, rehabilitate, or prosecute detainees. It removes the statutory bar against transferring detainees to Yemen and includes provisions on detainees held in Parwan, Afghanistan. The annual DOD appropriation bill covers only DOD military activities, excluding military construction. The House version of the FY2014 DOD appropriations bill (H.R. 2397) would provide $585.1 billion for activities, nearly $4.4 billion less than the Administration requested. The Senate's version (S. 1429) would provide $587.5 billion, nearly $2.2 billion less than the request. H.R. 2397 would add $1.20 billion to the Administration's request for the base budget to offset unrealistic assumptions about cost reductions in building maintenance and other operations. The House bill for the FY2014 DOD appropriations includes additional funding for fuel costs, weapons, and R&D programs. It also reduces the base budget request by cutting funds from programs deemed excessive or not adequately justified. The Senate committee's version of the bill for FY2014 DOD appropriations includes cuts totaling $5.06 billion from programs deemed excessive or not adequately justified, $1.53 billion from programs with unspent balances or requesting more than needed, and $578 million offset by rescinding prior appropriations. These reductions are partially offset by additions totaling $4.19 billion to the Administration's base budget request. The House-passed H.R. 2397 for FY2014 war costs would appropriate $79.34 billion, $59.3 million more than the Administration's request. Key increases in the bill include funding for equipment for National Guard and reserve units, accelerating the \"reset\" process for Army units deployed in Afghanistan, and a transfer fund for unforeseen OCO costs. Amendments eliminated most of the $6.3 billion increase in the OCO request. The House-passed H.R. 2397 for FY2014 war costs would appropriate $79.34 billion, $59.3 million more than the Administration's request. Amendments adopted by the House reduced the committee-reported OCO amount by $3.5 billion, with cuts to funding for the Afghan Army and National Policy. The Senate committee's bill, S. 1429, would provide $77.62 billion in new budget authority for OCO, which is $1.66 billion less than the Administration's request. The Senate committee-reported version of the FY2014 DOD appropriations bill (S. 1429) includes funding cuts for various military programs, such as the Afghan Security Forces Fund and Army basic pay. The House-passed version (H.R. 2397) includes additional funding for a 1.8% basic pay increase. Both bills also propose cuts to enlistment and reenlistment bonuses and special pays. The Senate and House bills for the FY2014 DOD appropriations include funding cuts for various military programs, reductions in Permanent Change of Station funding, and an increase in funding for the Air Force's Special Victims' Counsel program. The bills would add upwards of $500 million to the requested $33.1 billion. The Senate and House bills for the FY2014 DOD appropriations include funding cuts for various military programs, reductions in Permanent Change of Station funding, and an increase in funding for the Air Force's Special Victims' Counsel program. Both bills would add over $500 million to the $33.1 billion requested for DOD's health care system, with a focus on TRICARE funding and additional allocations for medical R&D projects and facility maintenance. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees noted a planned downturn in Army's purchases from specialized industrial base for tanks and armored vehicles in their reports on the FY2014 appropriations bill. The Senate added $90 million for M-1 tank upgrades, while the House included $75 million for M-88 recovery vehicles. The House and Senate bills made reductions in R&D programs for new armored combat vehicles for the Army and Marine Corps. The House bill would provide $592.2 million for the Ground Combat Vehicle, while the Senate bill would cut $169.0 million. For the Armored Multipurpose Vehicle, the Senate bill would provide $116.3 million, while the House bill would cut $30.0 million. Both bills would cut $14.0 million from the Marine Corps request for a new amphibious assault vehicle. Congressional action on naval programs is summarized in Appendix Table A-6. The summary of funding for selected naval programs is detailed in Appendix Table A-6. Congress has historically insisted on full funding for major weapons programs, allowing incremental funding for aircraft carriers and helicopter carriers but resisting proposals for other types of ships. They have also rejected funding ships and Air Force satellites using advance appropriations. The Administration is relying on advance appropriations to fund one of two Virginia-class submarines in FY2014. The Administration is relying on advance appropriations to fund one of two Virginia-class submarines in the FY2014 budget request. The total cost of two subs is $5.41 billion, with $1.53 billion appropriated as \"long lead-time\" funding in prior budgets, $2.93 billion requested in FY2014, and $952.7 million budgeted as an \"advance appropriation.\" The House Appropriations Committee criticized the advance appropriation proposal as a \"funding gimmick\" and added $950.0 million to fully fund the second FY2014 submarine. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed adding $277.0 million to the amount requested. The Senate bill, S. 1429, would add $277.0 million to maintain the industrial base for Virginia-class subs. It would deny $59.9 million for the Virginia Payload Module, citing disruption to production line and lack of DOD approval. Both House and Senate bills approve $1.62 billion for a DDG-51-class destroyer, with the House bill adding $100 million to address a shortfall in the program. The House bill would add $100 million to address a shortfall in the DDG-51-class destroyer program due to sequestration. Both House and Senate bills would cut funding for the Air and Missile Defense Radar program, citing delays in development. Additionally, minor reductions would be made to the procurement of F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. The House and Senate bills propose cuts to funding for the F-35 Strike Fighter program, with the Senate bill also reducing funding for long lead-time components to slow production increase for FY2015. The Senate bill aims to reduce the number of F-35s funded in the FY2015 budget request to 36, an increase of about 25% over the previous year. The Senate Appropriations Committee opposes DOD's decision to end F/A-18E/F production, stating that the plane is crucial for the Navy's carrier air wings for the next 25 years. Both House and Senate bills propose additional funding for long lead-time components to support the purchase of 22 F/A-18E/F Navy fighters in FY2015. H.R. 2397 and S. 1429 would increase funding for the Missile Defense Agency in FY2014. The House and Senate bills propose additional funding for the Missile Defense Agency in FY2014, with the House bill adding funds for Israeli anti-missile systems and the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) program. The House bill includes funds for additional GMD interceptor missiles and consideration of deploying interceptors on the East Coast. The Senate bill appropriates $1.03 billion for GMD, with a shift in funding for R&D. The House and Senate bills propose additional funding for the Missile Defense Agency in FY2014. Both bills would provide $220.3 million for the Israeli Iron Dome system. The House bill includes $7.73 billion for the Afghan Security Forces Fund, while the Senate bill cuts $781.8 million intended for aircraft purchases for Afghanistan's Air Force. This includes $365.0 million for Russian-built Mi-17 helicopters from Rosboronexport, with a provision to bar DOD from doing business with the company. The Senate Appropriations Committee criticized DOD for purchasing 20 additional Super Tucano turboprops from Embraer without a clear requirement for them. The committee took action on selected amendments during consideration of H.R. 2397."
