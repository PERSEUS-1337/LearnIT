    "content": "In this paper, the authors address the challenge of co-generation with generative adversarial nets (GANs) by developing an annealed importance sampling (AIS) based Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm. This approach outperforms classical gradient-based methods on synthetic data and CelebA. The authors tackle the co-generation challenge with GANs using an AIS-based HMC algorithm, outperforming gradient-based methods on synthetic data and CelebA. They address the difficulty of sampling from part of the domain given the remainder, known as co-generation, by dealing with the ragged energy landscape during training. The authors propose a method using AIS-based HMC algorithm to address the co-generation challenge in GANs, showing promising results on synthetic and CelebA data. The text discusses using a well-trained generator to reconstruct latent data from partially observed data, but solving the program is challenging, especially with a highly trained generator. The text discusses using an annealed importance-sampling based Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method to prevent local optima issues in co-generation when reconstructing latent data from partially observed data. The text introduces the use of annealed importance sampling (AIS) to approach the posterior distribution in co-generation. An annealing schedule is defined to refine samples gradually using Hamilton Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling. Hamilton Monte Carlo (HMC) is used to traverse folds in an energy landscape by trading potential and kinetic energy. It involves leapfrog integration to compute new proposal samples and Metropolis Hastings to accept or reject proposals. HMC defines a Hamiltonian and iterates through three steps multiple times, initializing the momentum variable with a standard Gaussian. Hamilton Monte Carlo (HMC) involves leapfrog integration to propose new samples and Metropolis Hastings to accept or reject them. The process includes sampling the momentum variable, moving along a Hamiltonian hypersurface, and deciding whether to accept the proposal. Baselines are used for evaluation on synthetic and imaging data, with comparisons to common methods. Our proposed AIS co-generation method outperforms the common baseline on 2-dimensional synthetic data by achieving the desired reconstruction with only one initialization after 6,000 AIS loops. Energy barriers in the Z-space complicate optimization, but our method simplifies the process. Samples from generators trained for different epochs show successful reconstruction in the experiment.

In the rows, samples obtained from the generator for the data are illustrated in black color. Results obtained with Alg. 1 show significantly better results and robustness to initialization. Validation on CelebA using MSE and MSSIM metrics with progressive GAN architecture is also conducted. The proposed co-generation method using AIS and HMC outperforms baselines in GAN training iterations, showing robustness to optimization challenges and ability to traverse energy barriers. Additional results for real data experiments are also presented. Our proposed algorithm outperforms baselines in recovering masked images and generating high-resolution images from low-resolution ones. Results for CelebA and LSUN datasets are shown, demonstrating robustness to z initialization positions."
