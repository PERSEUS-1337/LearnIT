    "content": "The \"Emergency Forest Restoration Act\" allows the Secretary concerned to conduct forest management activities on National Forest System lands or public lands in a State to address declared emergencies. A categorical exclusion is available for these activities, with $300,000,000 authorized for each fiscal year from 2018 to 2025. Timber sale revenues can be used to offset funds appropriated for emergency purposes. The Secretary of Agriculture must identify appropriated funds for timber sales annually. Within 5 years, timber sales must recoup the identified funds and associated costs. Proceeds from timber sales are to be deposited accordingly. The funds from timber sales are to be deposited as follows: (A) The appropriated amount identified annually shall go to the general fund of the Treasury. (B) Costs associated with the sale will be deposited in a designated fund for construction and supervision expenses. (C) Any remaining amounts will also go to the general fund of the Treasury. The Treasury of the United States receives timber sales as miscellaneous receipts. A categorical exclusion is available to the Secretary of Agriculture for timber sales, except as provided in section 4. SEC. 4. LIMITATION OF CATEGORICAL EXCLUSION.\n\nA categorical exclusion under this Act may not be used on National Forest System lands or public lands that are part of the National Wilderness Preservation System, located within inventoried roadless areas, or where timber harvesting is prohibited by statute.\n\nSEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, a \"categorical exclusion\" refers to an exception to the National Environmental Policy Act for projects on National Forest System lands or public lands that would normally be considered a major Federal action. A \"declared emergency\" is an insect or disease infestation in a State declared an emergency by the Governor. \"National Forest System lands\" are Federal lands included in the National Forest System. The Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974 defines the term \"Secretary concerned\" as the Secretary of Agriculture for National Forest System lands and the Secretary of the Interior for public lands. The term \"State\" includes all states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and other U.S. territories."
