    "content": "In the past year, several high-profile American companies have been targeted by cyberattacks. Target, eBay, Home Depot, and J.P. Morgan Chase were all victims of data breaches, resulting in the theft of customer information and credit card details. Target had 70 million individuals' data compromised, eBay asked 200 million users to change passwords, Home Depot faced an attempt to steal credit card info from 50 million shoppers, and J.P. Morgan Chase disclosed contact information for about 76 million customers being at risk. In 2014 and early 2015, high-profile cyberattacks targeted companies like Sony Pictures, Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield, and J.P. Morgan Chase, exposing personal information of employees and customers. These incidents highlight the increasing frequency and severity of cyber threats, posing significant risks to national security. In 2014 and 2015, high-profile cyberattacks targeted companies like eBay, Home Depot, J.P. Morgan-Chase, Sony Pictures, and Anthem. Experts warn of increasing cyber threats, with a survey showing 43% of US firms experiencing data breaches. The consensus is that cyber incidents will become more frequent and sophisticated in 2015 and beyond, posing challenges for businesses reliant on computers. The threat of cyberattacks is increasing, with potential devastating effects on various systems beyond just economic losses. Nations like Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea are using cyberspace for warfare, raising fears of attacks on critical infrastructure or even launching nuclear weapons. The United States faces the risk of a \"cyber Pearl Harbor\" that could cause physical destruction and loss of life. The President and congressional leadership prioritize enacting laws to prepare for cyber threats, with a focus on enhancing the exchange of cyber-threat intelligence between the public and private sectors. Effective cybersecurity relies on robust knowledge of potential threats, including vulnerability data, threat data, and countermeasure data. Current public and private sector information sharing efforts are inadequate, primarily due to concerns about potential liability when sharing cyber-threat information. The report analyzes legal issues surrounding cyber-threat information sharing, including concerns about liability hindering participation in sharing initiatives. The discussion covers current legal authorities, sources of liability, and complexities in sharing cyber-intelligence. The report discusses liability issues related to cyber-information sharing and legislative proposals for reforming federal laws. It highlights the different aspects of cyber-information sharing, such as disseminating cyber-intelligence from the government to other entities. Cyber-threat information sharing involves private entities sharing cyber-intelligence with each other and with the government, including reporting potential cyber-vulnerabilities to DHS. Legal challenges may impede cyber-intelligence dissemination. The federal government, specifically the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), has clear authority to share cyber threat information with the private sector and other government agencies. The Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) is responsible for accessing and integrating information from various sources to identify and assess terrorist threats and vulnerabilities to the homeland. The Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is responsible for integrating and disseminating relevant information, analysis, and vulnerability assessments related to terrorist threats and critical information systems. DHS is authorized to provide analysis and warnings to state and localities upon request. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is authorized to provide analysis and warnings to state and localities upon request. The DHS's National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) and its subcomponents, such as the Office of Cybersecurity and Communications (CS&C), play a crucial role in overseeing the security of the nation's cyber and communications infrastructure. CS&C supports 24x7 information sharing, analysis, and incident response. The National Cybersecurity and Communication Integration Center (NCCIC) supports 24x7 information sharing, analysis, and incident response for threats affecting critical information technology and cyber infrastructure. NCCIC operates key aspects of information sharing programs like CISCP and ECS, allowing for real-time disclosure of cyber threat information to private organizations and critical infrastructure owners. The National Cybersecurity Protection Act of 2014 (NCPA) formalized NCCIC's authority to share sensitive cyber threat information with private actors. NCPA confirmed NCCIC's role as an interface for real-time sharing of cybersecurity information between federal and non-federal entities, providing technical assistance, risk management support, and incident response capabilities. The National Cybersecurity Protection Act of 2014 (NCPA) formalized NCCIC's authority to share cyber threat information with private actors, including federal agencies, state and local governments, and private sector owners and operators of critical information systems. President Obama mandated NCCIC to engage with Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations (ISAOs) for collaborative coordination. The Homeland Security Act, as amended by the NCPA, grants DHS significant authority to disseminate cyber threat intelligence to government agencies and the private sector. The NCPA grants NCCIC the authority to share cyber-information related to \"cybersecurity risks,\" allowing DHS to disseminate federal cyber threat information to the private sector. The private sector is concerned about the broad and ill-defined statutory authority within DHS for cyber-information sharing, leading to confusion about central actors. Entities like I&A, NPPD, and CTICC have overlapping legal authorities for disseminating cyber-intelligence. The DHS, specifically the Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center (CTICC), has limited authority to share cyber-threat information with private entities. Sharing must be voluntary, and private sector participation cannot be mandated under current law. The current voluntary information sharing scheme for federal cyber information may be questioned due to limited authority to mandate private sector participation. Other laws may restrict the government's ability to disseminate cyber-threat information, requiring protection from unauthorized disclosure and adherence to specific requirements. Laws aimed at preserving privacy and civil liberties may restrict DHS's ability to share sensitive cyber-information, such as sources or methods of ongoing investigations. The Homeland Security Act and NCPA require compliance with federal laws on privacy and protection of civil liberties, potentially limiting the disclosure of individually identifiable information in cyber intelligence. The Privacy Act of 1974 restricts government disclosure of individually identifiable information in cyber-information sharing programs, limiting DHS's efficacy in providing cyber intelligence to private entities. Coordination with multiple federal agencies for review causes delays in releasing relevant information, potentially rendering it irrelevant. The legal landscape surrounding the sharing of cyber-intelligence by private parties is complex, with various legal concerns creating disincentives against sharing information. Legal issues arise when private companies share cyber-information with each other and with the government. Private sector companies share cyber-intelligence with the government and each other through various informal and formal arrangements, such as Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs). The federal government has supported these efforts to share valuable cyber-information. The creation of industry-specific ISACs was supported by Presidential Decision Directive-63 in 1998. However, various laws may discourage private sector cyber-intelligence sharing due to potential liability issues. The absence of federal laws governing such exchanges leaves room for state and federal privacy laws to restrict cyber-information sharing among private actors. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (ECPA) contains three titles regulating communication interception and storage. Private entities considering cyber-intelligence sharing should be aware of the potential legal implications under ECPA. The Wiretap Act prohibits intentional interception of electronic communications and disclosure of their contents without authorization. This includes using any device to acquire the communication's substance during transmission. Additionally, it restricts divulging intercepted communications to anyone other than the intended recipient. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) prohibits the interception of electronic communications and the disclosure of their contents without authorization. This includes scanning the contents of electronic communications during transmission and may restrict real-time transmission of cyber-intelligence. Many cyber-threat detection methods require using the contents of electronic communications to determine potential threats. The Wiretap Act includes exceptions for consent in intercepting electronic communications to determine malicious intent. Cyber-information sharing relies on real-time sharing of threat information, but limitations exist under the Wiretap Act. Consent exception allows interception with prior consent from one party involved. Courts assess the dimensions of consent to determine legality. The Wiretap Act's consent exception allows interception of electronic communications with prior consent from one party. Determining who is a \"party to the communication\" in cyber-threat scenarios can be challenging due to the use of multiple computers by cybercriminals. Monitoring systems for cyber-intruders may argue they are a party to the communication being monitored. The interpretation of being a party to electronic communication may impact privacy protections. Consent is required from individuals participating in the communication. Legal uncertainty arises in cyber-information sharing due to differing court interpretations. Courts have differing conclusions on whether an electronic communications service provider's customer consents to interception. Consent cannot be casually inferred; it must be explicitly shown. Merely notifying someone of interception capability does not imply consent. Deficient notice will almost always defeat a claim of consent. The Wiretap Act includes a \"provider exception\" allowing providers to intercept communications to protect their rights or property, not third parties. This exception may conflict with the need for consent in monitoring electronic communications. The Wiretap Act's provider exception allows providers to intercept communications to protect their own rights or property, not third parties. While some courts have interpreted this broadly, others have limited it to protecting the provider's own equipment and rights. The Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel also states that the exception must protect the provider's rights or property, not those of third parties. This suggests that ECPA may allow private entities to monitor their own systems and share cyber-intelligence for self-protection, but not to disclose or divulge electronic communications in real time to protect a third party's property or rights. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) Title II, known as the Stored Communications Act (SCA), prohibits service providers from disclosing the contents of electronic communications in their possession. This law applies to both electronic communications services and remote computing services, with violators facing civil liability. The SCA is complex, particularly Section 2702, which restricts providers from divulging stored communications. Section 2702 of the Stored Communications Act (SCA) prohibits service providers from disclosing the contents of electronic communications. The SCA defines Electronic Communications Services (ECS) as services that allow users to send or receive electronic communication, and Remote Computing Services (RCS) as services that provide computer storage or processing. Not all disclosures by ECS or RCS are prohibited, only those of the contents of communications, not address information. The Stored Communications Act prohibits service providers from disclosing the contents of electronic communications. For an ECS provider, only disclosures made while the communication is in electronic storage violate the statute. The definition of \"electronic storage\" has been a point of contention. The Stored Communications Act prohibits service providers from disclosing the contents of electronic communications. The statute excludes providers of RCS who access communication contents for purposes other than storage or processing, like for advertising. Unlike the Wiretap Act, the SCA's prohibition on disclosure of stored communications may not restrict cyber-information sharing. The Stored Communications Act prohibits service providers from disclosing the contents of electronic communications. The statute excludes providers of RCS who access communication contents for purposes other than storage or processing, like for advertising. Cyber-information sharing may not violate the SCA if the disclosed information does not include ECS or RCS provided to the public. Internet Service Providers or email providers may share information for cybersecurity purposes without violating the SCA. The Stored Communications Act's ambiguity regarding information sharing for cybersecurity purposes may deter providers from sharing cyber-threat information with private entities due to disputes over key terms. Ambiguity in the law can lead to litigation, which may discourage companies from engaging in cyber-information sharing. Despite exceptions to the SCA's prohibition on disclosure, hesitancy to participate in information sharing schemes may still exist. The Stored Communications Act (SCA) allows disclosures to authorized personnel for forwarding communications but does not permit sharing with outsiders. There is a consent exception for divulging communication contents if the sender or recipient consents. However, the scope of this exception is fact-dependent, potentially leaving communications providers at risk of litigation. The Stored Communications Act (SCA) has a consent exception for disclosing communication contents, but the scope is unclear, leading to potential litigation risks for providers. The SCA's provider exception is limited to protecting the provider's rights or property, not extending to third parties. Another relevant federal privacy law is the Pen/Trap Act, which focuses on real-time capturing of information. The Pen/Trap Act prohibits the real-time capturing of non-content information without court permission, with exceptions for service providers. Violations can lead to criminal penalties. The Pen/Trap Act allows for the monitoring and testing of electronic communication services to protect rights and property. It includes a consent exception for using pen/trap devices with user consent. Unlike the Wiretap Act and SCA, the Pen/Trap Act does not prohibit the disclosure of non-content information. This makes it easier for private entities to share cyber-threat information without legal concerns, thanks to the provider exception. Title III of ECPA allows providers to use pen/trap devices for the operation, maintenance, and testing of electronic communication systems. Private entities with cybersecurity concerns may naturally capture non-content information. The provider exception also permits the use of pen/trap devices to protect the rights or property of the provider or users. The Pen/Trap Act allows the use of pen/trap devices to protect against abuse or unlawful use of service, including identifying cyber-threat sources. Providers can capture non-content cyber-threat information with user consent. Liability under the Pen/Trap Act is not a concern for sharing information on cyber-threat sources. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) is a federal privacy law that could impact cyber-threat information sharing among private entities. ECPA's privacy protections are based on the age and content of communications, with non-content information receiving fewer protections. Other federal privacy laws target specific industries that handle personally identifying information (PII). The Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 (CCPA) prohibits cable operators from disclosing PII, leading to potential civil liability for violations. Federal privacy laws regulate the collection and dissemination of PII, raising legal questions for regulated entities. Federal privacy laws govern the collection and sharing of personally identifiable information (PII) by various entities, including consumer reporting agencies, financial institutions, and health care providers. Legal questions arise when sharing cyber-intelligence that may be protected under these laws, as there are no specific exceptions for cybersecurity purposes. Case law on this matter is limited. State laws may hinder private entities from sharing cyber-intelligence for cybersecurity purposes, creating legal uncertainties. These laws, which are often more restrictive than federal laws, regulate different aspects of communications privacy, adding complexity to the issue. For example, most states have eavesdropping laws similar to the Wiretap Act, and some require consent from both parties for electronic communication. Some states require both parties to consent to intercepting electronic communication, potentially deterring entities from sharing cyber-threat information. State privacy laws and antitrust laws also pose liability concerns for entities collaborating on cybersecurity. Liability concerns for private entities collaborating on cybersecurity include anticompetitive issues, as highlighted in a recent survey of IT professionals. Federal antitrust law aims to deter anticompetitive conduct, with the Sherman Antitrust Act prohibiting agreements that unreasonably restrain trade. Certain activities like price fixing and market allocation are viewed with skepticism under this law. Certain agreements, such as price fixing and market allocation, are inherently anticompetitive and illegal per se. Other agreements, like mergers or joint ventures, are judged under the rule of reason. Violations of federal antitrust laws can lead to criminal prosecutions and civil actions with the risk of treble damages. Civil litigation risks treble damages for successful plaintiffs. Coordination on cyber-defense may lead to antitrust liability, depending on the nature of the agreement. Exchanges of information among competitors are not automatically violations of the Sherman Act. The Supreme Court has recognized that such practices can enhance market competitiveness. Professional associations' rules are not condemned per se. Agreements to coordinate on cyber-defense, like implementing uniform cybersecurity practices, may involve sharing costs or adopting cybersecurity measures. Efforts to share cybersecurity information among private entities, especially within formal organizations like an ISAC, will likely be evaluated under the rule of reason. This analysis would consider the legitimate justifications for sharing cyber-information against any anticompetitive effects. There is no clear case law on how antitrust laws apply to coordinated efforts to combat cyber-threats. Antitrust laws may create legal uncertainty for private entities engaging in cybersecurity information sharing. In 2014, the DOJ and FTC issued a joint policy statement clarifying that information sharing agreements are typically analyzed under a rule of reason. The exchange of cyber-threat information is seen as beneficial for securing the nation's networks. The DOJ and FTC issued a joint policy statement in 2014, stating that cyber-threat information sharing can help secure the nation's networks. The primary antitrust concern is sharing competitively sensitive information that could lead to competitive coordination among competitors. The legality of cyber-information sharing agreements is intensely fact-driven. The government's conclusions on the legality of cybersecurity information sharing agreements with antitrust law may be difficult due to the rule of reason. Private parties can enforce antitrust laws through civil lawsuits, posing liability risks for entities sharing cybersecurity information. This could deter participation in cyber-information sharing. The fear of liability in cyber-information sharing stems from tort law, particularly negligence. To prove negligence, a plaintiff must show duty of care, breach of duty, causation, and harm. In the event of a cyberattack, a company may be held liable for failing to provide reasonable security to protect against cybercriminals. Courts recognize the duty of companies to provide reasonable security against cybercriminals, but are hesitant to hold them liable for unforeseeable cyberattacks. Liability for a cyberattack depends on the knowledge a party has about the attack, and businesses may not be obligated to guard against innovative breaches without known defenses. Cyber-information sharing schemes could help in this regard. Cyber-information sharing schemes have the potential to change tort liability for entities involved in cyberattacks. Sharing information could provide evidence for potential lawsuits, while failing to act on shared information could make harm from cyberattacks foreseeable. This could incentivize entities to avoid participating in information sharing programs. Participation in cyber-information sharing programs may increase tort liability risks for entities involved in cyberattacks. However, it is challenging for a plaintiff to succeed in proving that a private entity failed to prevent a cyberattack due to the need for specific circumstances such as actual damages linked to shared information. Despite media reports on potential losses, the majority of costs from a cyberattack are borne by the attacked company and do not result in actual losses for potential plaintiffs in a tort lawsuit. Courts are hesitant to allow lawsuits in such cases. Participation in cyber-information sharing programs may increase tort liability risks for entities involved in cyberattacks. Courts are hesitant to allow lawsuits based on potential future injury from cyberattacks due to the economic loss doctrine, which often prevents recovery in such cases. Litigation risks in tort lawsuits related to cyberattacks may be minimal, with courts dismissing claims early on. Several laws could lead to liability concerns for private entities sharing cyber-information. The 2013 Target data breach resulted in a shareholder lawsuit alleging fiduciary duty violations. Shared cyber-information could be crucial evidence in similar lawsuits, showing specific knowledge of cyber vulnerabilities. A shareholder derivative lawsuit could result from a cyberattack, with shared cyber-information aiding in litigation. The Uniform Commercial Code governs bank-customer rights regarding fraudulent wire transfers, with banks typically bearing the risk unless agreed otherwise. Banks may bear the risk of fraudulent payment orders if they implement a commercially reasonable security procedure and accept the payment order in good faith. Prior awareness of cybersecurity risks, such as through shared cyber intelligence, could impact a bank's liability under the UCC. Shared cyber-information could be crucial evidence in lawsuits related to data breaches, helping to establish the timing of cyberattacks and the adequacy of a company's cyber defenses. This could deter private entities from sharing cyber-intelligence, impacting the federal government's access to vital cyber-threat information held by the private sector for informed decision-making. The private sector plays a crucial role in providing cyber-intelligence to the government for informed decision-making. However, obtaining this information can be challenging, as private entities may not always share vital cyber-threat information voluntarily. This could impact the government's access to crucial data for addressing cybersecurity needs. The government has legal authority to receive voluntarily shared cyber-information from private sector entities, as outlined in various statutes such as the Homeland Security Act and the Critical Infrastructure Information Act. Private parties may be hesitant to disclose cyber-intelligence due to legal concerns. The Homeland Security Act and Critical Infrastructure Information Act allow private entities to voluntarily share critical infrastructure information with the government. Concerns exist about potential disclosure of proprietary or sensitive information under the Freedom of Information Act. The CIIA provides an exemption to FOIA for critical infrastructure information. The CIIA provides an exemption to FOIA for critical infrastructure information voluntarily shared with DHS. The Protected Critical Infrastructure Information Program ensures shared information receives protections. Concerns exist about indiscriminate dissemination of cyber-intelligence through FOIA requests. The FOIA exemption is limited to information related to \"critical infrastructure.\" The Critical Infrastructure Information Act (CIIA) exempts vital systems and assets that would have a debilitating impact if incapacitated or destroyed in the United States. Only information related to the security of critical infrastructure is protected under the CIIA, limiting the scope of FOIA exemptions for cyber-information shared with the federal government. Private actors may question whether threat information falls within the CIIA's definition for critical infrastructure, creating legal uncertainty. The PCII program by DHS has procedural rules for information sharing to ensure protections under the CIIA, including submitting information to the PCII Program Manager and providing certifications and disclaimers. The PCII Program's procedural restrictions may hinder real-time cyber-information sharing efforts. While cyber-intelligence shared with DHS may not be exempt from FOIA, other exemptions like trade secrets or privileged information could still prevent its disclosure. A broader exemption for cyber-information shared with the government may be necessary to address this issue. A concern exists regarding the potential disclosure of sensitive cyber-threat information shared with the government through FOIA. This raises worries about the waiver of intellectual property rights, particularly in relation to trade secrets. Trade secret law aims to protect valuable business information that provides a competitive advantage. Trade secret protection is crucial for valuable business information that gives a competitive edge. If cyber-intelligence is shared with the government, there is a risk of losing trade secret protection. This could happen if details about internal operations or proprietary data are disclosed during cyber-threat information sharing. During a cyberattack, failing to prevent disclosures of trade secret information can result in losing legal protection. Sharing cyber-intelligence with a third party can also weaken trade secret protection. However, private entities can negotiate contractual terms to protect shared cyber-intelligence. Concerns have been raised about the effectiveness of agreements between the government and private entities in safeguarding trade secret information during cyber-intelligence exchanges. The Department of Homeland Security requires private entities to sign a CRADA to access cyber-intelligence from NCCIC, potentially forfeiting intellectual property rights. This provision in CRADAs has raised concerns among companies, hindering their participation in cyber-information sharing. Private actors sharing cyber-intelligence with the government fear that shared information could be used against them in regulatory actions, especially in cases involving cyber-breaches and data loss. The FTC has been actively involved in federal cybersecurity efforts, raising concerns about the potential misuse of shared information. The FTC has been leading federal cybersecurity efforts, initiating enforcement actions resulting in civil penalties and compliance obligations for companies. Cyber-intelligence shared with DHS led to an FTC investigation of a company, as seen in the case of LabMD in 2010. The FTC initiated an investigation against LabMD, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also mentioned as having an interest in regulatory actions related to cyber-intelligence. The SEC administers laws to ensure investors receive adequate information about securities and prevent fraud. Companies are advised to report material cyber-risks and incidents to the SEC. Companies are advised to report material cyber-risks and incidents to the SEC to avoid investigations and potential penalties. There is concern that information shared with the government in cyber-information sharing arrangements could be used against companies for not disclosing material information to the SEC. The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CIIA) prohibits the use of disclosed information by any other government entity for regulatory enforcement actions. It also restricts the use of CII by officers or employees of the United States for purposes other than specified in the act, with penalties for violations. The CIIA's restrictions on collateral use of cyber-information face challenges due to vague terms and lack of case law, raising concerns about sharing sensitive data with the government post-Edward Snowden disclosures. The Edward Snowden disclosures revealed the extent of American foreign intelligence efforts, causing technology giants to lose trust from customers and financial losses. Companies are now hesitant to share cyber-intelligence with the government due to privacy concerns. Some have concerns about sharing cyber-information with the government due to privacy issues, particularly regarding the Stored Communications Act. This act prohibits providers from disseminating non-content information to governmental entities. The Stored Communications Act (SCA) prohibits providers from knowingly divulging non-content information pertaining to a subscriber or customer to any governmental entity. Courts have interpreted \"record information\" broadly to include details like a subscriber's name, address, and communication records. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has issued guidelines to limit the scope of information that falls under this prohibition. The Justice Department's view allows private entities to disclose information like characteristics of cyber tools or Internet traffic patterns to the government without violating the SCA. This indicates uncertainty in federal privacy law regarding cyber-intelligence sharing with the government. The SCA's prohibitions on disclosures by service providers to the government have exceptions, such as the provider exception and consent exception. These exceptions may not provide clarity for sharing cyber-information with the government, as they are limited in scope and tied to specific circumstances. The SCA allows service providers to submit cyber-intelligence to the government in cases of emergency involving danger of death or serious physical injury. The \"exigent circumstances\" exception is narrowly interpreted to only allow access to information necessary to prevent or minimize a true, active emergency. It is unclear if private sector cyber-information would qualify for disclosure under this exception. The SCA's general prohibition on voluntary disclosures to the government with regard to electronic communications raises questions about federal privacy law in cyber-information sharing. Legislative changes may be needed to encourage the dissemination of cybersecurity intelligence from the private sector to the government. Legislative changes to federal law aim to promote cybersecurity information sharing between public and private sectors. Various proposals have been introduced in Congress to address legal barriers and facilitate the distribution of cyber-intelligence. Six themes are identified in these proposals, focusing on government-held cyber-information and private sector control. The current law on cyber-security information sharing lacks federal guidance, leading to reliance on disparate legal principles. Proposals aim to authorize sharing of cyber-intelligence between public and private entities to clarify this legal area. The Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA) and the Cyber Threat Sharing Act of 2015 (CTSA) aim to authorize sharing of cyber-intelligence between the public and private sectors, allowing entities to share cyber threat information with each other. The legislative proposals on cybersecurity information sharing diverge on three central issues: the types of cybersecurity information authorized for dissemination, the entities that can receive such information, and the purposes for which the information can be used. Bills like the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2014 (CISA) allow sharing of information on cyber-vulnerabilities, threats, and prevention strategies. The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2014 (CISA) allows sharing of cyber-threat information, while proposals like the CTSA limit sharing to ISAOs and the NCCIC. CISPA authorizes private entities to share cyber-intelligence with any entity, contrasting sharply with the CTSA. CISPA allows the disclosing entity to place restrictions on the use of shared information. The CTSA limits the use of shared information to cybersecurity purposes and requires efforts to minimize unrelated information that could identify specific persons. The scope and goals of cybersecurity information sharing legislation are defined by what information can be shared, with whom, and for what purposes. Proposals that restrict the sharing of information may hinder cyber-intelligence dissemination, while those that allow broad sharing for various purposes may raise concerns about privacy rights. The legal frameworks for cybersecurity information reform proposals focus on key issues like cyber-intelligence sharing and the role of government entities in facilitating information sharing between the public and private sectors. The proposals aim to establish broad authorizations for dissemination of cyber-intelligence while addressing concerns about individual privacy rights. The legislation may need to determine the central repository and distributor of cyber-intelligence within the government. The legal frameworks for cybersecurity information reform proposals focus on establishing a central repository for cyber-intelligence within the government. Legislation designates DHS to coordinate cyber-information sharing, with NCCIC tasked to disclose cyber threat indicators to federal and non-federal entities. CISPA allows the President to designate an entity within DHS for receiving and sharing cyber threat information. The legislation designates DHS as the central entity to receive and share cyber threat information with other governmental entities. It also allows the President to designate an entity within DOJ to handle cybercrimes information dissemination. CISA requires multiple federal agencies to collaborate on developing procedures for sharing federal cyber threat indicators. The Attorney General is required to establish policies for receiving cyber threat indicators from the private sector. DHS plays a central role in receiving and disclosing cyber-information according to CISA. The DHS has a central role in receiving and disclosing cyber-information, developing processes for accepting cyber threat indicators, and ensuring federal entities receive such indicators. However, there are concerns about overlapping legal authorities in cyber-information sharing, with some proposals not addressing this issue. Some cybersecurity proposals, like CISPA, aim to maintain existing information sharing relationships without altering the government's authority. It is crucial for cybersecurity proposals to ensure that disseminated government information is extensive and useful, as delays in sharing cyber-intelligence could reduce its effectiveness. To enhance the distribution of cyber-threat information, cybersecurity proposals suggest two main strategies: real-time sharing of cyber-intelligence among federal agencies and the private sector, and granting additional access to classified cyber-intelligence to those in the private sector. For example, CISA proposes automated distribution of cyber-information in a universal electronic format, while CISPA mandates procedures for sharing classified cyber-threat intelligence with the private sector. The proposals aim to facilitate sharing classified cyber-threat intelligence with the private sector by expediting security clearances. However, challenges exist in balancing rapid disclosure with privacy and national security concerns. Legislation and agency actions need to address these competing goals effectively. The legal issue surrounding cybersecurity information sharing legislation is how to minimize liability for private sector entities disclosing cyber-intelligence. Uncertainty in applying federal laws like antitrust and privacy laws to cyber-information sharing may deter participation without assurances of liability protection. Several cybersecurity proposals aim to reduce liability for private entities sharing cyber-intelligence to encourage participation. Two legal approaches include narrowly tailored immunity provisions tied to specific laws and debates on scoping liability protections. Gregory Nojeim of the Center for Democracy and Technology advocates for legislation creating exemptions to ECPA for service providers to share information for cybersecurity. Others propose a \"cyber-security exception to antitrust laws\" to exchange security information. Tailored immunity provisions aim to protect against disrupting existing legislative schemes but have drawbacks. The tailored immunity approach aims to protect privacy interests when sharing cyber-intelligence, but faces challenges in crafting immunity provisions for all potential sources of liability. Entities sharing cybersecurity information could be vulnerable to lawsuits under various federal and state laws, creating legal uncertainties and deterring more aggressive information sharing efforts. Experts highlight significant gray areas in cyber-intelligence sharing laws, suggesting broader liability protections may be needed. Legal claims, such as antitrust and tort law, are evolving, making it difficult to predict future lawsuits. Even meritless claims require factual development, potentially deterring information sharing efforts. Limited liability carve-outs may not effectively prevent legal challenges. The recent legislation on cybersecurity information sharing has shifted towards broad immunity for private entities involved in collecting and sharing cyber-intelligence. This approach includes \"notwithstanding\" clauses in cybersecurity bills to provide civil liability protections. This change is in response to the limitations of tailored carve-outs that may not effectively prevent legal challenges and costly factual discovery. Recent cybersecurity legislation includes \"notwithstanding\" clauses that allow entities to share cyber threat indicators and countermeasures without being hindered by conflicting laws. These clauses supersede any laws that may deter such behavior. Additionally, the legislation includes provisions for liability limitations and early dismissal of lawsuits related to cyber-information sharing. The Good Faith Safe Harbors and Preemption Clauses in cybersecurity legislation provide liability protections for entities sharing cyber-information, ensuring no interference from state or local laws. The focus is on limiting liability rather than allowing limitless actions. The scope of liability protections for information sharing in cybersecurity bills varies considerably. For example, the CTSA only prohibits actions against entities for receiving or disclosing \"lawfully obtained cyber threat indicators\" from specific sources. This immunity does not cover activities to acquire cyber-threat information, sharing outside designated sources, or if the information is not \"lawfully obtained cyber threat indicators.\" The CTSA provides limited liability protections for entities sharing \"lawfully obtained cyber threat indicators\" from specific sources. In contrast, bills like CISA offer broader immunity for sharing information with any entity or the federal government, with specific carve-outs for certain causes of action. The effectiveness of these liability protections in promoting information sharing and legal certainty for private parties remains uncertain. The language in cybersecurity bills may create legal uncertainty for private parties sharing cyber-intelligence. Phrases like \"good faith\" and \"notwithstanding\" may not eliminate all litigation risks. Lawmakers must consider how much legal uncertainty the private sector can tolerate in information sharing immunity provisions. The debate over liability protections in cybersecurity legislation revolves around increasing private sector participation in sharing cyber-intelligence. One proposed solution is to mandate private entities to collect and share cyber-information, raising legal questions about compliance and civil liability. The debate over liability protections in cybersecurity legislation focuses on mandating private entities to collect and share cyber-information, raising legal questions about compliance with the Fourth Amendment. This could potentially transform private sector entities into government actors, leading to concerns about violating constitutional rights. The Fourth Amendment inquiry in cybersecurity legislation depends on factors such as the nature of cyber-information collected in the private sector and consent to the search. The propriety of a mandatory cyber-information program under the Fourth Amendment may also depend on the specifics of the program and the \"special needs\" exception recognized by the Supreme Court. The Fourth Amendment inquiry in cybersecurity legislation involves balancing public interests and individual liberties, including the right to refrain from speaking. Mandated disclosures of cyber-intelligence may conflict with First Amendment protections, as private entities may have a First Amendment interest in not being compelled to disclose cyber-information. The First Amendment interest of private entities in not being compelled to disclose cyber-information may conflict with mandated disclosures of cyber-intelligence. Compelled disclosure of cyber-threats may survive a First Amendment challenge if narrowly tailored to promote a compelling government interest in deterring cyberattacks. However, the law on compelled speech in this context is unclear and may present constitutional challenges to mandatory cyber-threat collection. Imposing penalties on companies for not participating in mandatory cyber-information sharing may not be effective, as it only incentivizes sharing if the penalties outweigh the costs. Voluntary cyber-information sharing programs may be more tailored and effective, as heavy-handed mandates could lead to excessive sharing. Recent cybersecurity legislation, such as CISPA, CTSA, and CISA, avoids mandatory information sharing schemes. Lawmakers are exploring ways to incentivize voluntary cyber-information sharing, including liability protections and access to government intelligence. Other incentives could include subsidies like direct payments from the government. Incentives for cyber-information sharing could include subsidies like direct payments from the government or tax benefits. One bill in Congress aims to create incentives through amendments to the Internal Revenue Code. Lawmakers need to address concerns about government collection of private cyber-intelligence to increase participation in sharing schemes. Recent cybersecurity legislation has addressed concerns about government control of voluntarily disclosed cyber-intelligence by creating a broad FOIA exemption for shared information. This approach aims to protect intellectual property rights, prevent regulatory actions against private entities, and safeguard the privacy rights of individuals. Recent cybersecurity legislation, such as CISPA and CISA, includes FOIA exemptions for shared cyber-threat information to protect intellectual property rights. CISPA specifies that shared information must be considered proprietary, while CISA exempts cyber threat indicators and countermeasures from disclosure to the federal government. These provisions aim to prevent the forfeiture of intellectual property rights upon disclosure to the government. The bill requires shared cyber-intelligence to be considered proprietary information, restricting disclosure to outsiders unless permitted by the disclosing entity. CISA explicitly states that providing cyber threat indicators to the government does not waive any applicable privilege or protection, including trade secret protection. Regulatory enforcement concerns are addressed in recent cybersecurity legislation by including FOIA exemptions and blanket statements to prevent information disclosure from being used in regulatory actions. Recent cybersecurity legislation includes provisions to limit the federal government from using shared information for regulatory purposes. Privacy concerns are addressed by restricting the government's use of shared information to specific cybersecurity purposes and preventing certain cybercrimes. The legislation avoids detailed privacy rules, instead requiring collaboration with federal agencies to address privacy issues. The legislation requires DHS and other federal agencies to create procedures for handling disclosed cyber-intelligence, focusing on protecting personally identifiable information (PII). Specific rules in some proposals restrict the government from using certain sensitive documents containing PII, like library records or firearm sales records. CISA mandates the protection of shared cyber threat indicators containing PII from unauthorized use or disclosure. The issue with recent cybersecurity information sharing proposals is ensuring government compliance with restrictions on the use of shared cyber-intelligence. Congressional oversight is the main enforcement mechanism, with federal agencies required to report to Congress on their use of shared cyber-information and compliance with privacy regulations. Other legal mechanisms may also be available to ensure government compliance, such as the CTSA's provision for penalties for government officers or agents violating privacy rules. The Cybersecurity Information Sharing proposals focus on enforcing restrictions on government use of shared cyber-intelligence. CISPA includes penalties for government entities violating use restrictions, imposing liability for intentional violations. Current laws criminalize misconduct related to critical infrastructure information sharing. Lawmakers must consider the balance between government scrutiny and control over shared cyber-intelligence. The current legal framework surrounding cyber-information sharing raises complex questions about balancing government scrutiny and control with the rapid dissemination of cyber-intelligence. It may be challenging for information sharing legislation to promote both robust data collection by the government and respect privacy and property rights. The legal framework governing cybersecurity and intelligence sharing may face uncertainties and new legal questions if altered by Congress. Balancing incentives for information sharing while protecting privacy, antitrust, and other laws is crucial. Resolving these legal issues is essential for effectively protecting the United States against cyberattacks. The regulation of cyber-intelligence sharing poses difficult legal questions for the 114th Congress."
