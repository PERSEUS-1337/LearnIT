The Congress finds that the United States ranks poorly in health status compared to other industrialized nations, with minority populations suffering disproportionately from cancer. African Americans have a 35% higher cancer death rate than whites, and Native Hawaiian men also have elevated rates of lung cancer. Infant death rates among minority populations, including African American, American Indian, Alaska Natives, and Hispanics, are well above the national average. SIDS accounts for approximately 10 percent of all infant deaths in the first year of life. Racial and ethnic minorities, including African Americans, American Indians, and Alaska Natives, face higher risks of SIDS and cardiovascular disease. Disparities exist in hypertension rates and treatment among minority populations. Diabetes, a leading cause of death in the United States, disproportionately affects racial and ethnic communities. African Americans and Hispanics have significantly higher prevalence rates compared to whites. American Indians and Alaska Natives also have a higher prevalence of diabetes, with the Pimas of Arizona having the highest known prevalence in the world. HIV/AIDS also disproportionately impacts minority populations. Minority populations in the United States suffer disproportionately from AIDS, with 54 percent of all cases occurring in minority persons despite representing only 25 percent of the total population. More than 75 percent of AIDS cases among women and children are in minority individuals. Despite higher rates of illness, death, and disability, minorities are underrepresented in clinical research trials, except for studies on behavioral risk factors. Culturally sensitive approaches are needed to increase minority participation in research studies, and there is a national need for minority scientists in biomedical, clinical, and health services research. In 1990, only 3.3 percent of US medical school faculties were underrepresented minorities, with only 1 percent being full professors. The proportion of underrepresented minorities in higher academic ranks decreased from 1980 to 1990. Establishment of National Center for Research on Domestic Health Disparities under Part E of title IV of the Public Health Service Act. The National Center for Research on Domestic Health Disparities conducts research, training, and health information dissemination for minority health. The Director coordinates activities with other NIH agencies and collaborates on a comprehensive plan. The National Center for Research on Domestic Health Disparities coordinates activities with other NIH agencies to identify and promote research on minority health, including multidisciplinary projects and collaboration among institutes. The National Center for Research on Domestic Health Disparities aims to promote coordination and collaboration among entities conducting research, encourage research by funded entities, recommend research agendas, and ensure sufficient allocation of resources. Additionally, the Center assists in including minority groups in clinical research and may provide research endowments for minority health studies. The National Center for Research on Domestic Health Disparities aims to promote coordination and collaboration among entities conducting research on minority health. An advisory council will be established to advise the Director on related activities, and biennial reports will be prepared. $100,000,000 is authorized for carrying out the program. The National Center for Research on Domestic Health Disparities is authorized to receive $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, with additional funding for the following years. A conforming amendment removes section 404 from the Public Health Service Act. The amendments made by this Act will be effective on October 1, 1999, or upon the date of the enactment of this Act, whichever is later."
