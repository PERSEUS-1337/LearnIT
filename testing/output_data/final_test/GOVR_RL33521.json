Despite the Energy Independence and Security Act passing in December 2007, the 110th Congress continued considering energy proposals, including legislation on oil and gas leasing, energy taxes, and the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The 110th Congress considered various energy proposals, including legislation on oil and gas leasing, energy taxes, and the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. High gasoline prices led to a range of proposed legislation, such as increasing CAFE standards for automobiles and light trucks. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 addressed these issues by setting new standards and procedures. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-140) set new standards for renewable fuels in gasoline, including advanced biofuels. Despite dropping some proposals, Congress remained interested in energy issues. New legislative proposals emerged, including bills to suspend federal gasoline and diesel taxes and promote U.S. petroleum production. Senator Domenici introduced a bill to open the Outer Continental Shelf and part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil and gas leasing. The legislative initiatives in response to rising gasoline prices included proposals to impose windfall profits tax on oil companies, extend tax credits for renewable energy, address speculation driving up oil prices, prohibit price gouging, suspend fill of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and open up the Outer Continental Shelf for oil and gas leasing. The legislative initiatives to address high gasoline prices in 2004 were influenced by various factors affecting crude oil and gasoline prices globally. Oil prices are determined by world demand and supply, with events in remote areas impacting prices for everyone. Major factors contributing to the increase in crude oil prices included heightened demand and supply dynamics. The increase in crude oil prices was influenced by factors such as increased consumption by China and the possibility of supply disruptions from violence or natural disasters. World demand for crude oil grew by 1.3% in 2007 to 86.0 mbd, while world supply was 87.3 mbd in March 2008, leading to little excess supply. Speculators entering the commodity markets and the decline in the value of the dollar also contributed to the upward pressure on prices. The decline in the dollar's value compared to other currencies has contributed to the increase in crude oil prices. The perception that production capacity will not keep up with demand is also pushing prices higher. OPEC countries hold most of the spare production capacity, which has been lower than average in recent years. This has led to higher gasoline prices, with crude oil accounting for about 72% of the cost. The cost of gasoline is typically in the range of 45% to 55%, with crude oil contributing 46% of the cost in May 2007. Factors such as limited refining capacity, fuel blend requirements, and increased demand have led to higher gasoline prices. Higher costs in any element of gasoline production are likely to be passed on to consumers. The 2004 price surge sparked energy policy discussions and calls for legislation, but the urgency waned until the Katrina disaster. U.S. gasoline consumption continued to rise, with prices not reaching the levels of previous crises until Katrina pushed them towards $3.00 per gallon. There were no physical shortages or long lines at the pump, except in disaster-affected areas. The proportion of consumer expenditures on oil and gasoline declined in the early 1990s from the high levels of the 1970s and 1980s. The common view that oil prices would continue to rise indefinitely has shifted due to increased world proved reserves. The price increase in 2004 was initially seen as temporary, with no physical shortage of gasoline or long lines at the pump. The increase in crude oil prices to record levels is leading to suggestions of permanent shortages in petroleum production capacity due to changing world market conditions. Despite higher prices, world demand for oil continues to rise, while some regions are unable to develop existing resources, creating a tight market with production capacity only slightly exceeding demand. Temporary interruptions in production could lead to further price increases. The increase in crude oil prices is causing concerns about permanent shortages in petroleum production capacity. Some experts believe that high prices are driven by strong demand and political pressure on oil producers to increase production. Energy policy initiatives are being considered to address the short-term effects of high prices and tackle long-term consumption reduction. The current situation regarding high oil prices has led to discussions on how to address the issue. There are three main options: increasing efficiency, using alternative fuels, or increasing oil production. The choice of option depends on one's view of the future oil market. Some believe the tight market will continue and support alternative fuels and efficiency, while others see the tight market as temporary and advocate for increasing oil production. Any move to increase supply worldwide is seen as a positive signal to ease tightness and volatility in the oil market. Proposals to address high prices include suspending federal gasoline and diesel transportation taxes for the summer driving season. Senator Obama criticized these proposals, while similar bills were introduced in the House but not taken up. The Federal Price Gouging Prevention Act (H.R. 1252) was passed by the House in response to surging gasoline prices, aiming to ban the sale of gasoline at \"unconscionably excessive\" prices during energy emergencies. The White House threatened to veto the bill due to concerns about gasoline price controls, but the House vote indicated enough support to override a veto. The CLEAN Energy Act of 2007 included a price-gouging provision similar to H.R. 1252 but was not included in the final version. Speculation driving up oil prices led to legislation for oversight and regulation. The 2008 farm bill expanded the role of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The Energy Markets Emergency Act was passed by the House on June 26, 2008. The House passed the Energy Markets Emergency Act (H.R. 6377) on June 26, 2008, to curb excessive speculation and price distortion in the market. The Senate proposed the Stop Excessive Energy Speculation Act of 2008, but disagreements on amendments blocked action. The Commodity Markets Transparency and Accountability Act of 2008 (H.R. 6604) was approved by the House Agriculture Committee on July 24, 2008, and passed the House on September 18 by a vote of 283-133. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was authorized in 1975 and consists of caverns in Louisiana and Texas storing nearly 700 million barrels of crude oil. Its current capacity is 727 million barrels, authorized at 1 billion barrels. The SPR serves as an emergency source of oil in case of supply interruptions or adverse economic effects. Program costs focus on maintaining facilities and readiness. Royalty-in-kind deliveries to the SPR have totaled around 140 million barrels since FY1999. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) has stored around 140 million barrels of royalty-in-kind oil since FY1999. Deliveries of RIK oil during FY2008 are projected to be 19.1 million barrels, with forgone revenues estimated at $1.170 billion. Controversy arose in Congress over continuing to fill the SPR with RIK oil, with critics arguing against it due to tight markets and high prices. Legislation was introduced to suspend RIK fill and mandate the sale of 13 million barrels of SPR oil in FY2008. In FY2008, legislation was passed to suspend Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) fill and mandate the sale of 13 million barrels of SPR oil. The bills established conditions for resuming RIK fill, with the Senate passing the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Fill Suspension and Consumer Protection Act. Another bill proposed releasing 70 million barrels of high-quality crude oil from the SPR to lower gasoline prices. The House failed to pass a bill in July 2008 that aimed to lower gasoline prices by suspending Strategic Petroleum Reserve fill for six months. Legislative proposals included a \"windfall profits\" tax on oil companies, but it was not passed. Oil industry tax issues were indirectly involved in a large tax measure during the Second Session. The House failed to pass a bill in July 2008 to lower gasoline prices. A large tax measure included extension of tax credits for renewable energy. The Senate attached it to the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 with only a small offset provision affecting the oil and gas industry. Most proposals aimed at longer-term trends. The controversy surrounding Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards dates back to the 1970s. The issue was largely resolved with the Energy Independence and Security Act in the First Session of Congress. Oil and gas exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) has been a contentious topic for years, with support growing gradually over time. The controversy surrounding oil and gas exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) has been ongoing for years, with legislative proposals aiming to reduce oil consumption, such as the Enhanced Energy Security Act of 2006. President Bush set goals to reduce oil imports from the Middle East and decrease gasoline consumption through research in alternative fuels and improved vehicle technology. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 aimed for 7.5 billion gallons of renewable fuels by 2012, while the President's initiatives targeted 35 billion gallons by 2017. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 aimed for 7.5 billion gallons of renewable fuels by 2012. The Senate passed a provision in 2007 requiring 36 billion gallons of ethanol production by 2022. The final bill set a standard starting at 9.0 billion gallons in 2008, increasing to 36 billion gallons by 2022, with 21 billion gallons from cellulosic ethanol and advanced biofuels. The moratorium on oil and gas leasing in the Outer Continental Shelf faced controversy during the Second Session. President Bush lifted the executive ban on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) imposed in 1990. Republicans in Congress tried to open up parts of the OCS for leasing but faced obstacles. The House passed a bill to allow limited oil and gas leasing on the OCS. The House passed a bill allowing limited oil and gas leasing on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), despite objections from Republicans. The Senate did not take up the bill, leading to a continuing resolution to fund programs until March 6, 2009. H.R. 2638, the Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009, was passed without extending the OCS leasing ban. The curr_chunk discusses various tax provisions related to renewable energy credits and offsets affecting the oil and gas industry. It includes bills such as H.R. 1596, H.R. 2419, H.R. 2448, H.R. 2638, H.R. 5146, and H.R. 6022, each addressing different aspects of energy policy and funding. These bills were enacted between 2007 and 2008, with some becoming law despite presidential veto. H.R. 6022 (Welch) passed as P.L. 110-232 on May 19, 2008, suspending the Strategic Petroleum Reserve fill. Other related bills include H.R. 6349 (Marshall), H.R. 6377 (Peterson), H.R. 6578 (Lampson), and H.R. 6604 (Peterson) addressing oil prices, energy markets, and commodity market transparency. S. 2598 (Dorgan) also relates to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve fill. The Senate passed multiple bills related to energy and consumer protection, including the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Fill Suspension and Consumer Protection Act of 2008, a highway fuel tax holiday bill, a diesel tax parity act, and an American Energy Production Act. Other bills included a suspension of the highway fuel tax and the Consumer-First Energy Act of 2008."
