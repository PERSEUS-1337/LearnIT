Section 30322 of the Public Resources Code is amended to define \"ex parte communication\" as any communication between a commission member or staff and an interested person regarding a matter within the commission's jurisdiction, excluding certain specified communications. The text chunk outlines various types of communications that are considered as \"ex parte communication\" within the context of official proceedings involving members of a commission who also serve as officials of state, regional, or local agencies. This includes communications between commission members and other agency officials, as well as nonvoting commission members and state agency staff. Section 30324 of the Public Resources Code is amended to require disclosure of ex parte communications by commission members and staff.
