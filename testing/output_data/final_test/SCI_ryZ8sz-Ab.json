    "content": "Recent advances in recurrent neural nets (RNNs) have shown promise in natural language processing applications like sentiment analysis. A new approach for text classification is introduced, utilizing a fast reading technique inspired by human reading methods. This approach involves an intelligent recurrent agent that evaluates the importance of text snippets to make predictions efficiently. An end-to-end training algorithm based on policy gradient is used to train an agent for text classification. The agent evaluates text snippets to make decisions, achieving higher efficiency and accuracy compared to previous approaches. Recurrent neural nets (RNNs) like GRU and LSTM are commonly used in natural language processing for sequence to sequence tasks and classification tasks. Models need to read every word for seq2seq tasks, but for classification tasks, not every word is equally important. For example, sentiment analysis focuses on specific words or chunks. In natural language processing, RNN models like GRU and LSTM are used for sequence tasks and classification. For sentiment analysis, key words in a review can provide sufficient information without reading the entire text. The models are expected to determine the importance of each sentence for accurate predictions. In this paper, the aim is to enhance RNN models by introducing efficient partial reading for classification while maintaining high accuracy. A recurrent agent uses an RNN module to encode information and a policy module to decide what token to read next or when to stop reading. The model incorporates classification accuracy and computational cost as a reward function to encourage fast and accurate reading. The goal is to achieve fast reading for classification with high computational efficiency and good performance. Our approach aims to enhance RNN models for text classification by incorporating efficient partial reading techniques. Using a policy gradient method, we backpropagate rewards into the policy and encoder modules to achieve high computational efficiency and accuracy. Through evaluation on sentiment analysis and topic classification datasets, our model outperforms standard RNN and LSTM-skip models. The model focuses on predicting a single label for an input sequence by skimming, re-reading, and early stopping to skip irrelevant information and reinforce important parts for fast and accurate classification. The model enhances RNN for text classification by incorporating efficient partial reading techniques. It reads the current token, encodes data and previous information, and decides the next token to read by skimming or stopping for a final prediction. The model can be defined on top of a RNN structure and trained via back-propagation. Skimming and re-reading actions are defined by choosing a step size and moving to the next token sequentially or skipping multiple tokens. If the action is to stop or the next token is after the last token, the model outputs a label. The policy module \u03a0 in the framework plays a critical role in deciding when to stop reading and make a prediction, ensuring efficient classification output by skipping irrelevant text. It evaluates the importance of each token to determine the next step in the sequential process. The policy module in the framework determines the next step in the sequential process by outputting a probability distribution over actions based on the text read before. It generates a sequence of actions by sampling a stopping decision and a step size to decide whether to stop reading or jump to the next token. The policy module outputs a probability distribution over actions based on the text read before, determining the next step in the sequential process. It samples a stopping decision and step size to decide whether to stop reading or jump to the next token, aiming to minimize the difference between true and predicted labels while keeping computational cost low. The reward for the last output action is based on the loss function measuring accuracy, while other actions incur a negative computational cost. The reward signal is defined by a trade-off parameter between accuracy and efficiency. The goal is to find the optimal parameters to maximize the expected return using the policy gradient algorithm without expensive integration or enumeration. The REINFORCE policy gradient is used to optimize the objective on data (x, y) by utilizing Monte Carlo rollout samples. To address the high variance in gradient estimation due to varying rollout sequence lengths, the advantage actor-critic algorithm is implemented for variance reduction. This method backpropagates signals for classification accuracy and computational cost throughout the model, providing an end-to-end solution. Our model aims to accelerate text classification by controlling the trade-off between accuracy and time cost using the hyperparameter \u03b1. This parameter allows us to adjust the computational budget allocated for each sample, ensuring the best classification accuracy within the budget. This is beneficial for cost-sensitive applications, such as those on mobile devices. In this section, the approach is illustrated using sentiment analysis and topic classification tasks on mobile devices. Experiments are conducted on three syntactic levels, with results presented on word, character, and sentence levels. IMDB, Yelp, AG news, and DBpedia datasets are used for evaluation, with predictive accuracy and average FLOPs as performance metrics. The energy cost for the policy module is minimal compared to the total FLOPs required. The approach involves using sentiment analysis and topic classification tasks on mobile devices. Experiments are conducted on different syntactic levels with results on word, character, and sentence levels. The method is evaluated on the IMDB movie dataset, with data split into training, validation, and test samples. The network structure includes a convolution layer, LSTM, and MLP with specific hyperparameters and a chunk-size of 20 words for the classifier. The study explores the effectiveness of re-reading and skimming in text classification tasks using different baseline models on the IMDB dataset. The models include early stopping, partial reading, and whole reading models, each with varying approaches to reading and processing text chunks. The comparison on the IMDB dataset shows the performance of the proposed method. The comparison on the IMDB dataset shows that the proposed model, early-stopping model, and partial reading model were evaluated based on FLOP count and accuracy. The blue and green lines outperformed the red line, indicating a trade-off between accuracy and energy cost. Rereading and skipping improved performance, suggesting that training the classifier with the policy model enhances computational efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, experiments were conducted at the character-level for topic classification. The proposed model outperforms the partial reading baseline in topic classification on large-scale text datasets. It achieves superior performance at the sentence level in sentiment analysis on the Yelp dataset. Our proposed model achieves superior performance and significant speedups on different datasets and syntactic levels compared to a partial reading model. It also shows a 0.5-1 percent accuracy improvement over a full-reading model and outperforms a recently published baseline model in efficiency. Our model outperforms their LSTM-skip model in efficiency and achieves higher accuracy on various text classification tasks. The proposed mechanisms of rereading and skimming are effective at different levels of semantics. An ablation study demonstrates the effectiveness of skimming, rereading, and early-stopping actions. The study compares different actions in a model using two datasets. The blue curve shows the best performance with all actions enabled, while the green curve with only early-stopping performs the worst. Combining skimming and rereading improves the model's performance. The model's actions are illustrated in a sentiment analysis example where the LSTM full-reading model failed. Our model successfully classified a sentiment analysis example where the LSTM full-reading model failed. The model's confidence in decision-making increased after reading key information, leading to the correct answer. Skimming and rereading actions were shown to improve the model's performance. Our model, after reading key words like \"stake\" and \"collaboration deal,\" confidently predicts the text is about business. It utilizes adaptive computation for time efficiency, similar to previous studies on recurrent neural networks and image classification tasks. Our proposed model utilizes the combinatorial complexity of actions for tasks like question-answering and text classification. Unlike previous models that focus on early-stopping or selecting relevant sentences, our model incorporates skimming and rereading mechanisms. Additionally, our policy module is trained considering both accuracy and computational cost explicitly, aiming to reduce inference computational cost for new examples. BID1 proposes a scheme to selectively activate parts of the network, while BID3 presents two schemes for adaptively utilizing the network during inference. Unlike BID33, our model incorporates human-like mechanisms for rereading and early-stopping, leading to improved efficiency and accuracy. We use a simple reward structure and implement a value network to reduce variance, achieving advanced performance in classification tasks. The proposed approach introduces a policy module for fast reading in classification tasks, incorporating accuracy and computational cost as reward functions. End-to-end training using the policy gradient method improves both accuracy and computational performance on various datasets. The model's performance is shown to be robust to different chunk sizes. The model's performance is robust to different chunk sizes, as demonstrated on the IMDB dataset. Our full-action model outperforms the baselines significantly with chunk sizes of 8, 20, and 40. Smaller chunk sizes lead to more decision steps within each sentence, making policy optimization more challenging. Advanced algorithms like proximal policy optimization may help overcome this issue. The red curve represents the partial reading baseline, while the grey, blue, and purple curves represent our models with chunk sizes of 8, 20, and 40. Our model shows robustness to different chunk sizes."
