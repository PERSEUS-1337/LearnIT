    "content": "The financial crisis highlighted the risks of the unregulated OTC derivatives market. Lawmakers introduced regulatory controls through the Dodd-Frank Act, requiring certain swaps to be cleared by DCOs. Conflicts of interest in derivatives clearinghouses are examined in this report, along with proposed measures by the CFTC and SEC to address them. Clearinghouses are a crucial part of futures exchanges, addressing credit risk in derivatives trading. Winners in derivatives contracts rely on clearinghouses to guarantee payment, eliminating the need for traders to monitor each other's financial resources. Proposed measures by the CFTC and SEC aim to address conflicts of interest in clearinghouses, which are of concern to the 112th Congress. A clearinghouse requires derivatives traders to provide initial margin and daily maintenance margin to cover potential losses. Failure to meet margin calls may result in liquidation of positions. Margin rates are adjusted to reflect market volatility, and members contribute to a default fund to cover losses. This system prevents uncapitalized exposures that could lead to clearinghouse failure. The clearinghouse system requires traders to provide margin to cover potential losses and contribute to a default fund. If a large trader fails without sufficient margin, it can lead to a chain of defaults. This risk was evident during the 2008 financial crisis when AIG's potential failure threatened its bank counterparties. The clearinghouse system requires traders to provide margin to cover potential losses and contribute to a default fund. If AIG had been required to clear its contracts and post margin, it would likely have run out of money long before its derivatives position reached a size that could threaten systemic stability. The aim of derivatives reforms in Dodd-Frank is to prevent the scale of exposure that led to AIG's downfall. Different types of derivative financial instruments are used for hedging business risk and speculative profits, traded in various markets regulated by different entities. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulates stock options traded on exchanges, while swaps and security-based swaps are traded over-the-counter (OTC) and not regulated by anyone. Exchanges use clearinghouses to manage credit risk by guaranteeing payment to both parties in a trade. This system eliminates the need for traders to monitor counterparty default risk. In the OTC market, dealers stand ready to take long or short positions, making money on spreads and fees. They absorb credit risk, while customers face the risk of dealer default. Large financial institutions dominate this market, with their creditworthiness now in question after the 2008 financial crisis. The OTC market operates with dealers taking long or short positions, earning money on spreads and fees. Creditworthiness is now tied to government intervention to ensure contract honor during crises. Dodd-Frank aims to standardize clearing of derivatives, with ISDA setting best practices for collateral use. Compliance is voluntary, but Dodd-Frank mandates clearing for systemically important institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates clearing of derivatives, with exemptions for certain cases. Trillions of dollars in derivatives transactions are expected to move from OTC dealer markets to clearinghouses. Concerns arise over the sudden increase in swaps clearing volume due to the complexity of customized contracts compared to futures. Swaps, unlike futures, have non-linear relationships with underlying variables and lack standardized maturity dates. Pricing risk in swaps is more complex and prone to error, potentially leading to systemic risk. Dodd-Frank includes safeguards to mitigate risks in swaps clearing, focusing on risk management, control, and governance. The Dodd-Frank Act addresses concerns about swaps clearing by focusing on risk management, control, and governance of clearinghouses. Clearing a swap involves hurdles such as approval by regulators and meeting regulatory standards set by the Act. Clearinghouses have the discretion to refuse swaps they deem too risky for clearing. Regulatory approval is contingent on the clearinghouse's technical expertise and financial resources to manage risk effectively. Dodd-Frank sets core principles for DCOs to meet, including financial, managerial, and operational resources, risk management capabilities, and risk control standards. Enforcing provisions of the law regarding swaps clearing does not necessarily require heavy regulation. Clearinghouses have strong economic incentives to ensure market participants post enough margin, exchange membership has sufficient capital, positions are netted out, and trades are transparent for effective risk monitoring. The incentives of clearinghouses to remain operational and regulators to prevent financial instability align. In theory, there are potential counter-incentives that may lead DCOs to act in a way that increases systemic risk, such as powerful large banks influencing clearinghouses not to clear certain OTC products. Lawmakers are concerned about the influence of a small number of large swaps dealers on clearinghouses and trading platforms, which could undermine the efficacy of clearing in mitigating systemic risk. The Dodd-Frank Act directs the CFTC and SEC to identify conflicts of interest in derivatives clearinghouses that may interfere with clearing mandates, such as limiting access to the clearing agency by large banks to maintain higher fees and limit competition. The Dodd-Frank Act directs the CFTC and SEC to identify conflicts of interest in derivatives clearinghouses that may interfere with clearing mandates, such as limiting access to the clearing agency by large banks to maintain higher fees and limit competition. DCO members could potentially restrict indirect access, limit eligible clearing products, and influence risk management controls to reduce collateral requirements and liquidity resources in the clearing process. The CFTC also recognizes conflicts in determining clearable swap contracts, membership criteria for clearinghouses, and overall risk management decisions. The concerns raised include the possibility of a \"race to the bottom\" among clearinghouses cutting margin requirements to gain market share, potentially jeopardizing the long-term survival of the DCO. Large derivatives dealers could dominate swaps clearing, maintaining the status quo of the OTC market. Regulators have the authority to ensure open and nondiscriminatory access to DCOs. The scenario of clearinghouse members deliberately setting low capital and margin standards may seem improbable. The 111th Congress debated concentrated ownership and control of derivatives clearinghouses, leading to the adoption of the Lynch amendment setting a 20% ownership limit for certain financial institutions to prevent conflicts of interest. The Lynch amendment, setting a 20% ownership limit for financial institutions to prevent conflicts of interest in derivatives clearinghouses, was adopted by the House but not included in the final version of Dodd-Frank. Instead, Sections 726 and 765 addressed conflict of interest provisions. The legislative history does not explain why the Lynch amendment was omitted. During conference deliberations on H.R. 4173, House conferees proposed the Lynch amendment language, which was deemed important by Chairman Barney Frank. Senate conferees rejected parts of the House offer, opting for regulators to write rules to mitigate conflicts of interest instead of strict ownership caps. The House accepted the Senate position, clarifying the mandatory nature of rulemaking in Sections 726 and 765 in a colloquy on the House floor on June 30, 2010. The final Dodd-Frank Act mandated that the CFTC and SEC adopt rules to mitigate conflicts of interest, with the agencies deciding on ownership limits. Both agencies proposed rules with percentage limits on ownership and voting control of DCOs, along with governance structures to prevent control by large financial institutions. The CFTC proposed strict ownership limits in line with the Lynch amendment, while the SEC's proposed rules did not include strict ownership caps. The CFTC and SEC propose ownership limits for DCOs, restricting voting power for certain entities. Enumerated entities include bank holding companies, nonbank financial companies, swap dealers, and major swap participants. DCOs can choose between two sets of ownership limits. The CFTC and SEC propose ownership limits for DCOs, restricting voting power for certain entities. Enumerated entities, including bank holding companies and swap dealers, are subject to ownership restrictions. DCOs can select from two options for ownership limits, with opponents concerned that stricter rules may lead to under-capitalization during crises. DCOs argue that ownership restrictions on large banks could reduce critical expertise and access to capital in the swaps market. Commissioner Jill E. Sommers opposed the rule proposal, stating that voting equity restrictions are unnecessary to address conflicts. The voting equity restrictions may stifle competition by preventing new swaps trading and clearing firms. Commissioner Sommers noted that the European Commission rejected ownership limitations. The Dodd-Frank Act retains DCM core principles, including addressing conflicts of interest. The CFTC's 2007 final rule established acceptable practices for minimizing conflicts of interest in DCMs as they evolve into diverse enterprises. The Dodd-Frank Act includes revised core principles for DCOs, focusing on conflict management and governance structures to prevent conflicts of interest. The CFTC rules require governance structures in DCOs to prevent conflicts of interest, including having 35% of boards and committees consist of independent directors. DCOs must have a Risk Management Committee with 35% independent directors. DCOs cannot be operated by another entity unless they comply with these requirements and agree to CFTC or SEC authority over their officers, directors, employees, and agents. The conflicts of interest rules require DCOs to have independent directors on their boards and committees, and make their books and records available for inspection by the CFTC or SEC. Critics argue that these rules may limit competition by restricting new DCOs from entering the market and could hinder investors' ability to retain control over commercial interests. They also warn that the rules may limit trading and clearing options, reduce competition, and create market uncertainty. Some of the industry's largest banks argue that a limit on aggregate ownership of DCOs can cause conflicts of interest amongst non-members, potentially exacerbating systemic risk. They fear that non-member owners lack expertise in risk management and may take greater risks in decision-making. Critics note that putting a cap on ownership rights may not effectively mitigate conflicts of interest among members and non-members. Proponents of ownership limits for DCOs argue that it is necessary to prevent a handful of large firms from controlling the system, as this could lead to insufficient collateral and increased risk. They point to past failures in risk management by large banks, such as the undercapitalization of AIG before the financial crisis, which required billions in government intervention to prevent default. The financial industry's largest banks may not have the appropriate collateral when running clearinghouses, leading to concentrated risk. Concerns exist about limiting dealers' monopolistic control over clearinghouses, SEFs, and exchanges. Dodd-Frank's goal of promoting competition is not fully met by the 5% ownership cap, as brokers can still collaborate to gain control. The critics argue that brokers can collectively own the majority of DCO, SEF, and DCM operations, allowing big banks to dictate decision-making. They urge the CFTC and SEC to impose stronger restrictions on collective ownership to prevent domination. Most exchanges and clearinghouses have become vertically integrated, with three main clearinghouse-exchanges in the US and Europe. The main clearinghouse-exchanges for OTC derivatives in the US and Europe are the CME Group, ICE, and LCH.Clearnet. Dodd-Frank and CFTC rules may impact their ownership and operations. CME Group has a small share in clearing OTC derivatives compared to regulated futures. CME ClearPort started clearing interest rate swaps in 2010 with over $900 million in outstanding contracts by 2011. Participants include BlackRock, Citadel, Fannie Mae, and major banks like BofA Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs. Barclays Capital, Citi, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Nomura, and UBS are major players in the CDS market. CME ClearPort was established in 2002 for clearing OTC natural gas products and later expanded to include credit default swap contracts. ICE Trust dominates the CDS market, clearing a majority of products compared to CME. By the end of 2009, ICE Trust had cleared over $4 trillion worth of CDS contracts, representing 16% of the global market. In contrast, CME's net notional outstanding U.S. contracts were only $33 million as of February 2011. CME Group's ownership structure is diverse, with individual stakeholders owning 0.86%, mutual fund holders owning 29.67%, and other institutions owning 37.78%. ICE, like CME, has vertically integrated execution, clearing, and settling facilities. ICE is owned 0.28% by individuals, 31.41% by funds, and 70.10% by institutions. Its largest shareholders are T. Rowe Price (9.82%), Sands Capital Management (5.64%), Delaware Management Business Trust (4.84%), and Vanguard Group (4.46%). ICE has been clearing CDSs since 2009, with a focus on the CDS market. The interest rate swaps market is dominated by LCH, clearing over 40% of trades with $200 trillion outstanding. LCH's ownership is concentrated with 84% owned by users and 17% by exchanges. Its board includes members from major financial institutions. On November 6, 2010, LCH.Clearnet Group Ltd., Europe's largest clearinghouse, completed a buyout of shareholders, boosting its largest users' stakes ending a nine-month struggle for control. LCH's board of directors includes members from leading OTC derivatives dealers like Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and Citigroup. Shareholders have direct involvement in the company's business, with adjustments to ownership and governance structures expected due to regulatory rules. Many banks and clearinghouses are capitalizing on new derivatives clearing rules, with examples like RBS joining CME's OTC clearing division and Wells Fargo Securities becoming a member. LCH.Clearnet is launching a \"buyside\" service for interest rate swaps. There is a trend towards vertical integration in the exchange and clearinghouse industry, with examples including CME Group, LCH.Clearnet, and ICE. CME Group, LCH.Clearnet, and ICE are examples of companies in the exchange and clearinghouse industry. CME Group was formed in 2006 through a merger between the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade. ICE Clear US, originally the New York Cotton Exchange Clearing Association, expanded its business through mergers with the International Petroleum Exchange and the Chicago Climate Exchange. The Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX) merged with the New York Board of Trade (NYBOT) in 2007. Exchanges integrate with clearinghouses to improve efficiency by economizing transaction costs and avoiding double marginalization. This integration has been a part of financial markets long before OTC trading. The Chicago Board of Options Exchange established central counterparty clearinghouses in 1973, predating OTC transactions. Exchanges are merging to compete in derivatives, futures, and options trading, with the NYSE nearing a takeover by Deutsche Borse AG in 2011. This trend of mergers aims to create larger financial exchanges to compete with electronic exchanges and smaller rivals. The Wall Street Journal predicted that CME Group Inc. could surpass NYSE and Deutsche Borse AG to become the world's largest futures exchange and the biggest U.S. options group."
