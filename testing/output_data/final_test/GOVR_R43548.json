    "content": "Most of the funding for HUD comes from annual appropriations by Congress. Programs like Public Housing, Section 8 rental assistance, HOME, and CDBG help low-income families with housing and community development. Congress appropriates funds to CDBG for disaster recovery and specialized grant programs assist homeless individuals, including those with HIV/AIDS. FHA insures mortgages for home buyers with low down payments and developers of affordable rental buildings. Surplus FHA funds offset HUD budget costs. Total net enacted appropriations for HUD over the past five years are shown in Table 1. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-76) was signed into law on January 17, 2014. The Appropriations Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-76) was signed into law on January 17, 2014, providing year-long appropriations for all federal agencies, including HUD. A funding lapse and partial government shutdown occurred until a short-term continuing resolution (P.L. 113-46) was enacted on October 17, 2013, funding agencies at FY2013 levels. Final FY2014 appropriations were later enacted for all federal agencies, providing $32.8 billion in net budget. The final appropriation for HUD in FY2014 provided $32.8 billion in net budget authority, an increase of 4% from FY2013. Gross funding for HUD programs in FY2014 was $45.5 billion, a 7% increase from FY2013. Unlike FY2013, FY2014 discretionary appropriations for HUD were not subject to sequestration. The FY2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act (P.L. 113-235) was signed into law on December 16, 2014, funding most federal agencies, including HUD, for the fiscal year. The FY2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act (P.L. 113-235) was signed into law on December 16, 2014, providing $45.4 billion in gross discretionary appropriations for HUD programs, slightly lower than in FY2014. In FY2015, net budget authority increased to $35.6 billion from $32.8 billion in FY2014. Receipts from the FHA loan insurance program dropped by $3 billion in FY2015. The House and Senate approved appropriations bills for the Departments of Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development. The Senate Committee-passed THUD appropriations bill (S. 2438) in June 2014 would have provided $45.8 billion in gross budget authority and $36.0 billion in net budget authority. The Obama Administration's FY2015 budget request included $46.7 billion in gross discretionary budget authority for HUD, an increase from FY2014. The President's budget requested higher net budget authority than in FY2014, mainly due to reduced savings from the FHA mortgage insurance fund. Congress used CBO's estimates, resulting in a net budget authority of $36.9 billion. HUD funding levels for FY2014 and FY2015 are compared in Table 2, with over 75% of discretionary funding supporting Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance, Section 8 project-based rental assistance, and the Public Housing program, serving more than 4 million low-income households. Appropriations for these programs, along with Choice Neighborhoods and the Rental Assistance Demonstration, are discussed in the following subsections. The tenant-based rental assistance (TBRA) account funds the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program, the largest account in HUD's budget. It provides funding for the annual renewal of over 2 million vouchers used by families to subsidize housing costs and covers administrative costs for Public Housing Authorities. Funding comes from current-year appropriations and advance appropriations for the following fiscal year. President's FY2015 budget proposed an increase in total funding for the Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance account. The funding for the Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance account increased from $19.2 billion in FY2014 to $20.0 billion in FY2015, a 4.5% increase. The President's budget requested funding to renew 2.2 million vouchers and provide new HUD-VASH vouchers for homeless veterans. Additionally, there was a proposal to increase administrative fees for local PHAs. The House and Senate Committee-passed THUD appropriations bills would have reduced TBRA funding compared to the President's budget request. The House and Senate Committee-passed appropriations bills for FY2015 would have provided less funding for the Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance account than requested by the President. The final FY2015 appropriations law ultimately allocated $19.3 billion for TBRA, slightly more than FY2014 levels but less than the President's request or the proposed bills. The final FY2015 appropriations law allocated $19.3 billion for Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance, slightly more than FY2014 levels but less than the President's request. The law increased funding for administrative fees but not to the level requested by the President. The House-passed bill did not include a restriction on Section 8 payment standards above 120% of fair market rent. PHAs can still request higher payment standards under certain circumstances. The Section 8 project-based rental assistance (PBRA) account provides funding to administer and renew existing project-based Section 8 rental assistance contracts between HUD and private multifamily property owners. HUD provides subsidies to make up the difference between what low-income families pay (30% of their incomes) and the agreed-upon rent. Contracts for newly subsidized units have not been entered into since the early 1980s. Congress funded contracts for 20- to 40-year periods, but new annual appropriations are needed for renewals. Some old contracts lack sufficient funding to complete their terms, requiring new funding. The President's FY2015 budget proposed a decrease in PBRA funding compared to FY2014. The budget suggested funding all PBRA contracts on a calendar year schedule, from January through December, to address short-funded contracts in recent years. The President's FY2015 budget proposed a decrease in PBRA funding compared to FY2014, suggesting funding all contracts on a calendar year basis. Both the House and Senate Appropriations Committee agreed to shift to calendar year funding for PBRA, with an estimated cost of $10.8 billion for FY2016. This change aligns PBRA with other housing assistance programs and aims to address short-funded contracts in recent years. The final FY2015 funding law appropriates $9.73 billion for PBRA, slightly less than requested. The law allows HUD to supplement funds with recaptured and unobligated funds. The funding level provided may not fully fund all PBRA contracts for 12 months. The final FY2015 funding law appropriates $9.73 billion for PBRA, slightly less than requested, which may not fully fund all contracts for 12 months. Public Housing program provides rental units for low-income families, receiving federal funding under two primary accounts. HUD provides funding to Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) through the operating fund and capital fund to support ongoing maintenance and modernization of public housing properties. The President's FY2015 budget requested a 4% increase in total funding for the Public Housing program, reaching $6.5 billion. This included a 4.5% increase in the operating fund and a 2.7% increase in the capital fund compared to FY2014. The budget proposed eliminating funding for the ROSS program and allocating $25 million for the Jobs Plus Pilot. The House-passed THUD appropriations bill proposed reduced funding for the capital fund and maintained the operating fund at the FY2014 level. The Senate Committee-passed bill included increased funding for the capital fund and operating fund compared to FY2014. Both bills requested funding for the Jobs Plus Pilot Initiative. The final FY2015 appropriations law maintained funding at FY2014 levels for the ROSS program and the Jobs Plus Initiative. The FY2015 budget requested an increase to $120 million for the Choice Neighborhoods program, which provides grants to communities to redevelop distressed housing. Choice Neighborhoods replaced the HOPE VI program, with PHAs and other entities eligible to apply for grants. The final FY2015 appropriations law funded the Choice Neighborhoods program at $80 million, $10 million less than FY2014 levels. The Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) was established in the FY2012 Consolidated Appropriations Act, allowing housing subsidy programs to convert to Section 8 project-based rental assistance or vouchers. The Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) allows conversion of Rent Supplement and Rental Assistance Program to PBV assistance. There is a limit on conversions under the first RAD component but not the second. RAD must be cost neutral. The President's FY2015 budget proposed changes to RAD, including eliminating conversion caps and funding for Public Housing conversions. The Senate Committee-passed bill proposed changes to the Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD), including funding for the conversion of Public Housing units and raising the cap on units that can convert. The final FY2015 HUD appropriations law included RAD provisions from the Senate bill, with exceptions of no funding provided for RAD and the elimination of the deadline for conversion under the second RAD component. The Community Development Fund (CDF) supports various community development activities, including the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program. CDBG provides financial assistance for neighborhood revitalization, housing rehabilitation, and economic development. Grants are allocated to entitlement communities, states, and insular areas for addressing local housing and economic development needs. The Obama Administration's budget request for FY2015 included $2.870 billion for activities funded under the CDF account, representing 6.1% of the total budget authority. The budget proposed a 7.4% decrease in total funding for CDF account activities, with funding for Section 4 capacity building now under separate HUD accounts. The Obama Administration's budget request for FY2015 included $2.870 billion for activities funded under the CDF account, representing 6.1% of the total budget authority. This included funding for Section 4 capacity building, Integrated Planning and Investment Grants, and Neighborhood Stabilization Initiative activities. The Administration proposed a 7.4% decrease in total funding for CDF account activities compared to the previous year. The Obama Administration's FY2015 budget request included $2.870 billion for CDF account activities, a 7.4% decrease from the previous year. The Administration also requested $70 million for Indian tribes, with plans to propose reforms to the CDBG program focusing on formula revisions, regional planning, and targeting resources to areas of greatest need. The Section 108 Loan Guarantee program allows states and entitlement communities to access funding. The CDBG Section 108 Loan Guarantee program allows states and communities to borrow up to five times their annual allocation for economic development, housing, and infrastructure projects. The program will now charge a fee instead of providing a credit subsidy, with a proposed loan commitment ceiling of $500 million in FY2015. Regulations for the fee-based proposal were approved in the FY2014 appropriations act. HUD announced regulations for the CDBG program in FY2014 appropriations act. Grantees were directed to continue applying for credit subsidy until depleted. H.R. 4745 recommended $3.060 billion for CDF activities, including $3.0 billion for CDBG formula grants. This was $30 million less than FY2014, $200 million more than requested, and $20 million less than Senate bill recommendation. The bill also allocated $10 million less for Indian tribes. House approved an amendment to prevent HUD from terminating CDBG entitlement status. The House bill, H.R. 4745, aimed to protect CDBG entitlement status and did not include funds for Integrated Planning Grant activities. It proposed converting Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based structure with a $500 million ceiling. Additionally, it would have funded Section 4 under a separate account. The Senate Committee-passed bill recommended $3.090 billion for activities funded under the CDF account, including $3.020 billion for CDBG formula grants. This was $10 million less than the previous year's appropriation and $220 million more than requested by the Administration. The bill also supported funding for Indian tribes, mold remediation, Section 108 loan guarantee program, and Section 4 activities at the $35 million level. The Senate Committee-passed bill recommended $3.090 billion for CDF activities, including $3.020 billion for CDBG formula grants. The bill did not support transferring the Section 4 program to a new account or funding the Neighborhood Stabilization Initiative. It included a provision to prevent communities from exchanging CDBG funds for non-CDBG funds to address issues like affluent communities not participating in the program. The bill also directed HUD to establish a $2 million CDBG demonstration program for best practices. The P.L. 113-235 allocates $2 million in CDBG funds for developing best practices to expedite post-disaster recovery efforts. The total appropriation of $3.066 billion includes $3 billion for CDBG formula grants to states, entitlement communities, and insular areas, with $66 million set aside for the Indian CDBG program. This represents a 7% increase above the Administration's request and a 1% decline from the previous year's appropriation. The ICDBG program receives $4 million less than the previous year. The P.L. 113-235 allocates $6 million for mold remediation in Indian housing under the ICDBG program. It also supports a $500 million loan commitment ceiling for the CDBG Section 108 program. Additionally, $35 million is allocated for capacity building activities by national organizations like Local Initiative Support Corporation, Enterprise Foundation, and Habitat for Humanity. The act does not approve the Administration's request to transfer the Section 4 program to a different account. The act does not appropriate funding for the Administration's Neighborhood Stabilization Initiative proposal. It includes CDBG-related provisions prohibiting the exchange or transfer of CDBG allocation between communities and the use of CDF funds for certain projects. Last funded in FY2010, the act specifies that FY2015 CDF appropriations cannot be used for Rural Innovation Fund projects or discretionary activities under the CDBG program. The HOME Investment Partnerships Program is a block grant providing formula funding for affordable housing activities benefiting low-income households. The President's budget requested $950 million for the program, a 5% decrease from FY2014. The House-passed bill proposed $700 million for HOME, $250 million less than the President's request and $300 million less than FY2014. The Senate Committee-passed bill proposed $950 million for HOME and $10 million for SHOP in its own account. The President's budget included legislative proposals affecting HOME eligibility criteria. The President's budget proposed changes to the HOME program, including eliminating the $335,000 threshold for eligibility and revising provisions for \"grandfathering\" of participating jurisdictions. The budget aimed to address the issue of many jurisdictions receiving small allocations that may be difficult to administer effectively. The House-passed and Senate Appropriations Committee-passed bills aim to address the issue of small allocations for affordable housing programs by removing the lower threshold for participating jurisdictions. The President's budget proposed permanent changes to the HOME program, including eliminating the $335,000 threshold and revising grandfathering provisions. The FY2015-enacted appropriations law provides $900 million for the HOME program, $100 million below FY2014 funding. It includes $10 million for SHOP and maintains the lower threshold for localities to become participating jurisdictions. The Federal Housing Administration insures mortgage lenders against losses on home mortgages for eligible borrowers with low down payments, making mortgage credit more widely available. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insurance programs help make mortgage credit more widely available at a lower cost. The programs are administered through two accounts in the HUD budget: the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI Fund) for single-family home loans and FHA-insured reverse mortgages, and the General Insurance/Special Risk Insurance Fund for mortgages on multifamily buildings and healthcare facilities. The MMI Fund is the largest and is usually associated with FHA loans for single-family homes. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA) governs the recording of costs for federal loan guarantees, including FHA-insured loans, in the budget. It requires the cost of loans insured in a fiscal year to be recorded as the net present value of expected future cash flows. This is known as credit subsidy, with the net value expressed as a percentage of the volume of loans expected to be insured in that year. If estimated cash inflows exceed outflows, the net present value is reflected in the budget as a negative number representing negative outlays. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 governs the recording of costs for federal loan guarantees, including FHA-insured loans, in the budget. Negative credit subsidy results in offsetting receipts, which can be used to offset other costs of the HUD budget. The MMI Fund historically has had a negative subsidy rate, generating negative credit subsidy. In FY2015, it was estimated to generate $12.2 billion in negative credit subsidy, with an additional $876 million from the GI/SRI Fund, totaling about $13.1 billion in negative credit subsidy for FHA. In FY2015, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated a lower credit subsidy rate for loans insured under the MMI Fund (-5.3% compared to -9.03% in the President's budget), resulting in about $8 billion in negative credit subsidy rather than $12.2 billion. This led to a smaller amount of offsets available to appropriators to offset the cost of the HUD budget, requiring less in gross new appropriations to stay within specified limits on net new budget authority. The MMI Fund historically has negative credit subsidy, not requiring appropriations to cover guaranteed loan costs. For FY2015, the President's budget requested $170 million for administrative expenses, proposing an additional fee to lenders generating up to $30 million. The House bill allocated $130 million for expenses and did not authorize a new fee. The final FY2015 appropriations law provides $130 million for administrative contract expenses for FHA, but does not authorize FHA to charge an administrative support fee to lenders. Annual appropriations acts also authorize FHA's \"commitment authority\" to insure a certain dollar volume of loans. The FY2015 President's budget requested authority to insure up to $400 billion in new single-family mortgages under the MMI Fund and up to $30 billion in mortgages under the GI/SRI Fund. The final FY2015 appropriations law provides commitment authority for the GI/SRI Fund. The credit subsidy rates for insured loans are re-estimated annually. The FCRA allows government loan guarantee programs to draw on indefinite budget authority to cover future costs without congressional action. The FHA drew $1.7 billion in mandatory funding from its permanent and indefinite authority with the U.S. Treasury at the end of FY2013 to cover future costs on insured loans. This was the first time FHA needed to use this authority for its single-family program. No additional funds were required in FY2014. The President's budget request and congressional appropriations bills may include provisions affecting HUD programs and implementing new initiatives. Provisions in HUD's budget justifications and appropriations bills for FY2015 included restrictions on funding for certain programs. The House-passed bill prevented funds from being used for the FHA-HAWK program, which incentivized housing counseling for FHA-insured mortgage borrowers. The final FY2015 appropriations law includes provisions to prevent HUD from using funds to insure mortgages seized through eminent domain and to relocate staff working on multifamily asset management. HUD plans to consolidate its multifamily operations into fewer field offices as part of its Multifamily Transformation initiative. HUD is consolidating its multifamily operations into fewer field offices, requiring some staff, including asset management staff, to relocate. Congress has directed HUD not to move asset management staff at this time. Various proposals in the President's budget request and appropriations bills were not included in the final law. These proposals aimed to promote savings in assisted housing programs and restrict HUD from using funding for certain programs. The President's budget proposed changes in calculating adjusted income for rent assistance programs, testing rent-setting models for self-sufficiency, and allowing PHAs more flexibility with capital and operating funds. These proposals were not included in the final law. The Senate Appropriations Committee-passed bill proposed allowing PHAs to use up to 20% of operating funds for capital expenses. The President's budget suggested a demonstration to conserve energy and water in multifamily housing, with funds from project-based rental assistance. The bill also included a conservation proposal for Section 8, Section 202, and Section 811 properties, with funding for improvements coming from contract renewal funds. Additionally, the budget proposed withholding Native American Housing Block Grant funds from tribes with excessive undisbursed funds. The House-passed bill included a proposal to prevent HUD from enforcing the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule and using funds for the Housing Trust Fund. This rule aims to promote fair housing practices, and the Trust Fund was established in 2008 but would have been restricted by the bill. The Housing Trust Fund, established in 2008 under the Recovery Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-289) and administered by HUD, has not been funded due to contributions being suspended when Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placed in conservatorship. The Senate Committee-passed bill would have allowed Public Housing Authorities to establish replacement reserve accounts for capital needs, with funds not subject to the 24-month obligation requirement. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA, P.L. 112-25) increased the debt limit and included provisions to reduce the budget. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA, P.L. 112-25) increased the debt limit and contained provisions to reduce the budget deficit through spending limits and reductions. It imposed spending caps for discretionary programs from FY2012 through FY2021, with different caps for defense and nondefense funding. HUD discretionary programs are subject to the nondefense discretionary caps. Additionally, the BCA required a deficit reduction plan to be developed by a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, leading to sequestration of nonexempt discretionary funding in FY2013. The Budget Control Act of 2011 imposed spending caps on discretionary programs through FY2021. Sequestration will occur if Congress appropriates funding exceeding the caps. In FY2013, nondefense discretionary accounts, including HUD, were reduced by 5.0% due to sequestration. Additionally, an across-the-board rescission was included in the FY2013 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act to stay within the discretionary caps. The Budget Control Act of 2011 imposed spending caps on discretionary programs through FY2021. Sequestration occurred in FY2013, reducing nondefense discretionary accounts by 5.0%. An across-the-board rescission was also implemented to stay within the caps. Moving forward, sequestration for nonexempt discretionary programs will only happen if appropriations exceed budget caps set by the Bipartisan Budget Act. The discretionary budget caps for FY2014 and FY2015 were adjusted, with the nondefense discretionary spending cap set at $492 billion for both years."
