    "content": "While deep neural networks are successful, reducing model size is crucial due to energy consumption and storage constraints. By encoding network weights using a random sample based on Kullback-Leibler divergence, compression rate can be controlled while optimizing training set loss. This encoding scheme approaches the optimal information-theoretical lower bound, showing best test performance on benchmarks like LeNet-5/MNIST and VGG-16/CIFAR-10 for a fixed memory budget. Our approach achieves the highest compression rates for a fixed test performance and the best test performance for a fixed memory budget. Traditional model compression techniques include pruning, quantization, and coding. Deep Compression BID3 combines all three techniques systematically. Coding is the central routine, while pruning and quantization help reduce entropy for shorter encoding lengths. Bayesian Compression BID9 follows a similar scheme, using variational inference for deterministic weights encoding. The paper proposes a novel coding method that aims to achieve bits-back efficiency by encoding a random weight-set from the full variational posterior, stepping away from traditional pruning-quantization techniques. The paper introduces a new coding method called Minimal Random Code Learning (MIRACLE) that encodes a random weight-set from the full variational posterior, achieving bits-back efficiency. This approach is different from traditional methods and is shown to have a theoretical lower bound for coding efficiency. BID10 BID1 coding scheme uses a deterministic weight-set w* and a coding distribution based on Shannon's source coding theorem. The scheme achieves optimal coding efficiency with Huffman coding, but can be further improved by extending the variational family to include more general distributions. In developing a method to encode a random weight-set with short coding length, a variational approach is used to train a neural network within a constrained memory budget. By selecting an encoding distribution and a parameterized variational family for the network weights, the goal is to achieve good training performance while representing the model with a short code. This approach builds on previous work by introducing a variational objective related to the \u03b2-VAE to constrain compression size using a penalty factor. The goal is to encode a random weight-set efficiently using a variational approach in training a neural network. The method aims to achieve good training performance and model representation with a short code. The expected message length for sampling the weight-set is bounded by the mutual information between the data and weights. Harsha et al. provide a proof that this lower-bound can be approximated using rejection sampling, although the algorithm is intractable due to tracking acceptance probabilities. The proposed method aims to efficiently encode a sample from q \u03c6 by drawing K samples from p and creating a discrete proxy distribution q with support only on these samples. By drawing a sample from q, its index k * can be easily encoded, achieving coding efficiency. Decoding the sample is straightforward by drawing the k * th sample from the shared random generator. This simple algorithm produces a close-to unbiased sample from q \u03c6. The method efficiently encodes a sample from q \u03c6 by splitting weights into groups with a fixed allowance, allowing for efficient sampling. Experiments were conducted on LeNet-5 and VGG-16 using a Gaussian distribution for q \u03c6. MIRACLE outperforms competitors in compression and model size for a given test error rate. The paper introduces a new algorithm called MIRACLE for coding model parameters, based on recent information-theoretic insights. It outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in compression and model size for a given test error rate. Future work will focus on optimizing memory accesses for improved energy consumption and inference time. The algorithm allows for direct running of compressed models, potentially leading to significant savings in memory accesses."
