Congress finds that the national security and economic prosperity of the United States are dependent on a secure information infrastructure, including telecommunications and computer networks. Collaboration with the private sector and international partners is essential to protect cyberspace. In a speech on Internet freedom, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton emphasized the importance of protecting the free flow of information and condemned cyber attacks, stating that they pose a threat to the economy, government, and civil society. James Lewis from the Center for Strategic and International Studies highlights the need for international cooperation in cybersecurity. The U.S. cybersecurity policy is underdeveloped and requires energetic engagement to promote objectives and reduce risks. Recommendations include developing a coordinated foreign cybersecurity assistance program and shaping the international environment for cybersecurity strategy. International norms are crucial for uniting nations on technical standards, legal norms, territorial jurisdiction, sovereign responsibility, and use of force in the digital infrastructure. The Sense of Congress is outlined in Section 3. The Sense of Congress emphasizes the need for international norms and principles to address cyber vulnerabilities and potential state failure due to cyber attacks. The multilateral system has not effectively addressed these issues, and there is a call for negotiating a multilateral framework on cybersecurity. The need for negotiating a multilateral framework on cyberwarfare to establish shared norms and prevent disruptions. The current US diplomatic engagement on international cybersecurity is uncoordinated and should focus on securing cyberspace within a multilateral framework. The Secretary of State should develop a clear strategy for international cyberspace and cybersecurity engagement, including reviewing existing policies. The condensed text chunk is: \n\nThe Secretary of State should define objectives for US cyberspace policy, collaborate with other countries, negotiate a multilateral framework for cyberwarfare, share threat information, and consult with stakeholders.
