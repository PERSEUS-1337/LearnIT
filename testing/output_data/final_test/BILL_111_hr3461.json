The National Orphan Highways Program, established by the \"Orphan Highway Restoration Act,\" allows the Secretary to provide grants and technical assistance to States and local governments for maintenance, resurfacing, reconstruction, and rehabilitation of orphan highways. Priority is given to projects enhancing community livability. The Secretary prioritizes projects that focus on pedestrian safety, align with state and local plans, minimize environmental impacts, use innovative private sector strategies, encourage public-private partnerships, involve higher state or local funds, support mixed-use development, and result in route transfer upon completion. The Secretary will transfer management responsibilities to local jurisdictions upon completion of projects funded through this section. Funds will be distributed based on census data, with a minimum of 20% for local governments with 50,000-250,000 residents and 50% for those with less than 50,000 residents. No grants will be withheld by the Secretary. The Secretary will not impose requirements on grant recipients for orphan highways unless consistent with this chapter. The Federal share of project costs will follow section 120 guidelines, with Federal land agencies able to contribute to non-Federal shares. Grant recipients can use up to 2% of funds for administrative costs. An orphan highway is defined as a highway with specific criteria.

These highways require significant maintenance due to decreased statewide importance. The term 'unit of local government' refers to various political subdivisions of a State, including cities, counties, townships, tribes, and law enforcement districts with independent budget and tax authority. The Education Assistance Act authorizes appropriations from the Highway Trust Fund for law enforcement agencies in the District of Columbia and Trust Territories of the United States.
