Over 100,000 troops were withdrawn, and a transitional force remained for Operation New Dawn (OND). All troops were scheduled to leave Iraq by the end of 2011. Statistics on fatalities and wounds for OND and Operation Iraqi Freedom are available on the DOD's website. According to UNAMI, 2,953 Iraqi civilians were killed and 10,434 were injured in 2010, compared to 3,056 killed and 10,770 wounded in 2009. The Iraq Ministry of Human Rights reported 3,254 civilian deaths and 13,788 wounded in 2010. Another report from 2009 listed 85,694 civilian deaths from 2004 to 2008 due to terrorist attacks. The Iraq Ministry of Human Rights reported a total of 88,948 Iraqi civilian deaths from 2004 through 2010, specifically due to terrorist attacks. Other Iraqi ministries also track civilian deaths, with the Iraq Health Ministry monitoring civilian deaths and the Ministries of the Interior and Defense tracking police and security forces deaths. These ministries release their data monthly to the press. The Iraq Ministry of Health and Iraq Body Count provide monthly data on civilian and security force deaths in Iraq. The Iraq Body Count estimates between 103,640 and 113,230 civilian deaths from military action as of November 2011. Additionally, they reported 4,884 Iraqi police deaths between January 2006 and November 2008. Between January 2006 and November 2008, 4,884 Iraqi police were killed. A study analyzed civilian deaths during the Iraq War, attributing 12% to coalition forces, 11% to anti-coalition forces, and 74% to unknown perpetrators. The study found coalition forces had a higher \"Dirty War Index\" than anti-coalition forces, with indiscriminate effects on women and children. The Iraq Coalition Casualty Count also tracks Iraqi civilian and security forces deaths using media reports. The Iraq Coalition Casualty Count (ICCC) estimates 50,152 civilian deaths and 8,825 security forces deaths from 2005 to 2011. A cluster study reported between 426,369 and 793,663 Iraqi civilian deaths from violent causes up to 2006. The Iraq Family Health Survey (IFHS) Study Group conducted a cluster study on violence-related mortality in Iraq, estimating 151,000 deaths from March 2003 to June 2006. Violence was the main cause of death for men aged 15-59 in the first three years after the 2003 invasion. The study is widely cited for its findings on violence-related mortality rates in Iraq. The IFHS study distinguishes between different victims of violence in Iraq, including civilians, police, and security force members. A survey conducted by ORB in 2007 estimated that over 1,000,000 Iraqi citizens have died as a result of the conflict since 2003. The Brookings Institution used various sources to develop its own estimate of deaths for Iraqi civilians, police, and security forces due to violence. The U.N. Human Rights Report, Iraq Body Count, General David Petraeus's testimony, and Iraqi government sources estimate that between May 2003 and July 2011, 115,515 Iraqi civilians and 10,125 police and security forces died. Various sources provide casualty estimates for Iraqi civilians, security forces, and police officers, cautioning readers about the differing methodologies used."
