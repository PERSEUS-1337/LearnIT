    "content": "This report discusses the labor force participation of young people aged 16 to 24, highlighting their lower employment rates compared to older workers. Factors such as increased investment in education, limited availability for full-time work, and lower experience and skills contribute to this trend. The period of analysis is from 2000 to 2018. The report focuses on trends in the labor market from 2000 to 2018, including two recessions and a decline in jobs requiring only a high school diploma. Young people aged 16 to 24 experienced the steepest decreases in labor force participation and employment, but employment levels have been steadily recovering in recent years. Early labor market experiences have lasting impacts on employability and wages, making this report relevant for Congress in workforce development and education. The report discusses trends in the labor market from 2000 to 2018, focusing on youth employment and education pathways. It includes labor market data such as the participation rate, employment ratio, and unemployment rate, comparing outcomes based on age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Factors influencing youth participation in the labor force and their employment prospects are explored, along with potential short- and long-term effects of their experiences. The Appendix contains supplemental tables. The report discusses trends in the labor market from 2000 to 2018, focusing on youth employment and education pathways. Declines in young people's labor force participation are attributed to increased enrollment in high school and postsecondary education. The Department of Labor predicts that fast-growing occupations will require postsecondary education. Youth in this report are defined as ages 16 through 24. The transition from adolescence to adulthood has become longer and more complex, with policymakers recognizing that it no longer ends at age 18. Youth aged 16 to 24 have various education and employment pathways, including high school, college, military enlistment, and employment. Opportunities are more limited for those who drop out of high school. Young adults aged 18 to 30 face limited opportunities such as not being able to enroll in college or enlist in the military. Many still want to work for various reasons like gaining experience and saving for the future. A 2015 survey showed that 61% of young adults in the labor market are optimistic about future job opportunities, with a preference for steady employment over higher pay. The labor force participation rate has declined somewhat since 2013, with 62% in 2015 for steady employment and 36% for higher pay. The data is reported by BLS based on a household survey conducted by the Census Bureau, known as the Current Population Survey (CPS). It includes individuals aged 16 and above and excludes those in certain institutions. The labor force participation rate is the percentage of employed individuals in the population. The labor force participation rate is the percentage of individuals in the population who are employed and unemployed. BLS defines employed as working for pay or profit, including part-time and temporary work, but not unpaid internships. Unemployed individuals are jobless, actively seeking work, and available for employment. The employment-population ratio is the proportion of employed individuals in the non-institutionalized U.S. population. The unemployment rate is the share of individuals in the labor force who are unemployed. The labor force participation rate measures individuals engaged in or seeking work. Changes in participation can indicate interest in working or lack thereof. Factors like job prospects, education, and market conditions affect participation rates. The employment-population ratio and unemployment rate help gauge market conditions. The employment-population ratio and unemployment rate are key indicators of market conditions. The unemployment rate can be misleading as it may not reflect the true extent of individuals wanting to work. Data on labor force trends post-World War II are displayed in figures and tables in the section and Appendix, including information on age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Tables and figures in the Appendix also show labor force trends for teens and young adults. The labor force trend data for teens and young adults from 1948 through 2017 show differences in employment-population ratios based on age. Teens had the lowest ratios, followed by young adults. The prime-age adults' and young adults' ratios moved in the same direction from the 1950s through the 1970s but diverged after that, reaching nearly 13 percentage points difference in 2017. Figure 1 illustrates the cyclical nature of the employment-population ratio, especially for teens. The teen employment-population ratio declined more sharply after recessions compared to young adults and prime-age adults. Young adults saw a more upward trajectory due to increased female labor market entry since the 1960s. Both teens and young adults experienced a dip in employment-population ratios from 2000 to 2010, with teens experiencing a more significant decline. Following the 2007-2009 recession, both age groups began to recover, with teens showing greater gains in labor force participation and employment-population ratio. The decline in employment-population ratios for teens and young adults post-2000 can be attributed to an increase in high school and college enrollment. Some students are pursuing unpaid internships to meet graduation requirements, leading to a lack of inclusion in the labor force. This trend does not necessarily indicate a voluntary withdrawal from the workforce for schooling purposes. The employment-population ratios for female and male teens and young adults from 1948 to 2017 show different patterns. The ratios for females were historically lower than males but began to converge in the 1990s. This shift may be due to changing employment prospects for individuals with lower education levels. Young males ages 16 through 29 have lower education levels and are less likely to be enrolled in high school or college compared to females. Females have made significant progress in the labor market, with increasing employment-population ratios and college completion rates. Factors like lower fertility, declining marriage rates, and increased divorce rates have also contributed to women's increased participation in the workforce. From 2000 onwards, employment-population ratios for females and males became more similar, with young adult males consistently higher. Figures 3 and 4 compare employment-population ratios of teens and young adults by race and Hispanic ethnicity from 1972 to 2017. White youth had the highest ratios over time, followed by Hispanic youth, while black and Asian youth had lower ratios compared to their white and Hispanic counterparts. BLS started recording employment data for black individuals in 1972, Hispanic individuals in 1994, and Asian individuals in 2000. The employment trends for white, black, and Hispanic teens reflected the cyclical effects of the economy until the late 1990s. The employment-population ratios for all groups decreased in most years through 2012. The employment gap between white and black teens narrowed from 20 to 10 percentage points by 2017. Employment for white young adults steadily increased, while Hispanic and black young adults made progress in the labor market post-recession. The employment-population ratio for black young adults reached an all-time high of 61% in 2017, similar to levels in the late 1990s. Asian young adults have seen a decline in their employment-population ratio, hovering near 50% post-recession. Despite improvements in minority youth employment, they still have lower ratios compared to white youth, possibly due to factors like education, poverty, and neighborhood characteristics. Black and Hispanic youth are less likely to have completed high school and college, impacting their employment prospects. Asian youth are delaying entry into the labor market for education, with high rates of college completion. Hispanic youth have varying education levels, with employment-population ratios closer to white youth. Labor force data in 2017 shows a 62.9% participation rate and 4.4% unemployment rate. In 2017, the labor force participation rate was 62.9% with a 4.4% unemployment rate. Teens had the second lowest participation rate, highest unemployment rate, and lowest employment-population ratio. Young adults had a high participation rate but also a higher unemployment rate compared to the overall rate. These trends are influenced by various factors affecting labor force outcomes. The trends in youth labor force participation rates and employment-population ratio from 2000 to 2017 show a downward trajectory before the recession, with lower rates in 2017 compared to 2000. These trends are influenced by factors like experience, availability, and school participation among young people. The youth unemployment rate in 2017 was similar to that in 2000, at 9%, indicating some stability in the labor market for young people post-recession. Both male and female labor force participation rates and employment-population ratios decreased from 2000 to 2017, with males experiencing a greater decline. By 2017, participation rates were comparable for both genders, but males had withdrawn slightly more from the labor market. Unemployment rates increased for male youth but slightly decreased for female youth during this period. Labor force participation and employment-population ratios for all racial and Hispanic ethnic groups decreased from 2000 to 2017. Black and Asian youth had different employment outcomes, with Black youth facing higher unemployment rates despite higher labor force participation, while Asian youth had lower unemployment rates comparable to white youth. Overall improvements in the economy from 2014 to 2017 led to a slight increase in labor force participation for most subgroups. The employment-population ratio increased for all subgroups, with a significant jump of nearly 16% for black youth. Unemployment rates declined for all subgroups, with black youth experiencing the most significant drop. The labor force data for youth from 2000 to 2017 shows declines in labor force participation and employment-population ratios for teens compared to young adults. Despite similar unemployment rates in 2000 and 2017, both teen and young adult unemployment rates have decreased by about 30% since 2014. The labor force situation has been improving for youth since the last recession, with employment-population ratios recently recovering to pre-recession levels. Factors affecting youth labor market outcomes include less education and experience compared to older workers, increased competition for jobs requiring less education, and a growing number of young people enrolled in school. Teens often report not being in the labor force due to attending school, and firms are more likely to hire workers with greater availability. The overall health of the economy affects job availability, with firms hiring workers based on consumer demand for goods and services. The labor market has been slowly recovering since the recession, with a projected modest increase in GDP. Firms prefer to hire workers with more experience and availability, which can disadvantage young workers. Young workers may face challenges in finding jobs due to firms preferring experienced workers. The rising premium on education could decrease demand for adult workers with less education, leading to increased competition between adults and young people in the labor market. Immigration and education also play a role in job availability for youth. A Federal Reserve Bank analysis shows a growing trend of school attendance among young people without a high school diploma, with rates steadily increasing over time. Enrollment in higher education for teens and young adults reached peak levels in 2010 and 2012 respectively, but there was a slight decline in attendance for teens by 2015. This may be attributed to improved job prospects and rising costs of public higher education. About 40% of young adults were enrolled in higher education. The rising cost of public higher education has led to a decrease in labor market participation among teens and young adults. A BLS analysis found that school attendance was the main reason for not being in the workforce for 9 out of 10 teens ages 16 to 19 in 2014. Teens attending school were less likely to work, facing greater academic demands and pressure. Participation in educational activities now takes up more time in a young person's day than ever before. More high school students are meeting requirements for attending a four-year college. Increased school attendance and coursework preparation for college have led to a growing share of students pursuing education over work. Research shows that individuals with a bachelor's degree or higher have favorable labor force outcomes, including lower unemployment rates and higher wages. This trend is reflected in the data on unemployment rates and median weekly earnings for full-time workers ages 25 and older in 2017. In 2017, higher education levels corresponded to lower unemployment rates and higher earnings for full-time workers aged 25 and older. College graduates had a 2.5% unemployment rate and earned nearly $1,200 per week, while high school graduates had a 4.6% unemployment rate and earned $712 per week. Workers with more education were better equipped to withstand economic downturns. A growing number of young people have obtained a college degree, likely due to the belief that higher education leads to better job opportunities. Data from 2000 to 2016 show that both males and females made gains in high school completion, but females were more likely to have a college degree. In 2016, males and females had similar high school completion rates, but females were more likely to have a college degree. Since 2000, females have shown higher rates of high school and college graduation compared to males, with about 40% of females completing a bachelor's degree by age 30. College completion rates have increased across racial and ethnic groups, particularly for Hispanic and black females, with rates nearly tripling for Hispanic young adults. These educational gains may contribute to better labor market outcomes for females compared to males. Over the 2000 to 2017 period, females had better labor market outcomes than males, with a smaller decline in employment-population ratio and a decrease in unemployment rate for females. Minority youth also had smaller losses in labor force participation compared to white youth. Factors affecting labor market experiences are more significant for youth, who often have frequent movements in and out of the labor force, especially during the educational calendar. Research has shown that characteristics of neighborhoods, such as employment and poverty rates, can impact the labor status of youth seeking summer or initial jobs. Findings have been mixed, with some studies linking certain neighborhood characteristics to higher employment rates for low-income teens. Research has found that better communities with less concentrated poverty and income inequality, as well as better schools, are associated with improved outcomes for children from poor families, including higher earnings as young adults. The income gap between white and black young adults can be partly explained by differences in where they grow up. Geographic isolation from job-rich areas can impact youth employment outcomes, with limited job proximity having a more significant effect than access to transportation. Proximity to schools also influences college attendance decisions and later job opportunities. Studies have shown a relationship between proximity to college and college attendance, even when controlling for individual and family characteristics. Research on decreasing labor force participation and employment among youth is limited. Early youth unemployment has serious negative effects on income but not as strong on future unemployment. Youth entering the labor force during an economic downturn have poorer long-term labor market outcomes. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), researchers estimated the long-term effects of youth unemployment on labor. The study from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) examined the long-term effects of youth unemployment on labor market outcomes. It found that early unemployment negatively impacted wages and future unemployment rates. For instance, a six-month spell of unemployment at age 22 could result in a 2% to 3% lower wage rate in their early 30s. Another study showed that graduating during a recession led to a 10% reduction in earnings, with an average annual earnings loss of 1.8% over the first 10 years. The loss of earnings persisted, with an average decrease of 1.8% per year over the first 10 years due to difficulties in obtaining work hours and earning power. Research shows that young people's job market experiences since 2000 have been less favorable, with a higher share of college graduates working in low-wage jobs compared to previous years. This report provides an overview of the challenges faced by the youth labor force. The report highlights the declining employment-population ratio for youth, especially teens, since 2002. Factors such as school enrollment, lack of work experience, and educational levels contribute to this trend. Despite economic growth, the ratio has remained below 40%, indicating a long-term decline in youth employment. The employment-population ratio for young adults has been higher and more stable, but gains have dipped since the early 2000s. In 2017, the ratio was about 66%, higher than in 1948. Research is needed on the effects of recent long-term youth unemployment and how the current generation compares to past generations in terms of employment and wages."
