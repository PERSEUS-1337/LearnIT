It introduces a credit for elementary and secondary school expenses and contributions to charitable organizations providing scholarships for students attending these schools. The \"K-12 Community Participation Act of 1998\" introduces a tax credit for qualified elementary and secondary education expenses and charitable contributions. The maximum credit varies depending on the taxable year, ranging from $100 to $250. The tax credit for qualified elementary and secondary education expenses in the calendar year 2000 is twice the dollar amount applicable for joint returns. Qualified expenses include tuition, fees, tutoring, books, supplies, computer equipment, transportation, and other necessary expenses for attending public, private, or religious schools, including homeschooling. The term 'school' refers to any institution providing elementary or secondary education as defined by State law. A 'qualified charitable contribution' is the deductible amount for cash donations to a school tuition organization. A 'school tuition organization' is an organization disbursing funds for elementary and secondary education. The term 'elementary and secondary school scholarship' refers to scholarships that cover expenses for education up to 12th grade. Organizations providing such scholarships must allocate at least 90 percent of their annual income and donations. No double benefit deduction is allowed for contributions eligible for a credit under this section. The credit allowable under this section for any taxable year is subject to limitations based on the regular tax, other credits, and the tentative minimum tax. Controlled groups are treated as one taxpayer for this purpose. Taxpayers can elect to not have this credit apply for a taxable year. The tax credit limitations are based on regular tax, other credits, and tentative minimum tax. Controlled groups are considered one taxpayer. Taxpayers have the option to exclude the credit for a taxable year. Additionally, part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code is amended to include a new item. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1997."
