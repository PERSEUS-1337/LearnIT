    "content": "The Constitution empowers the President to nominate and appoint top federal government officials with the advice and consent of the Senate. These officials include Ambassadors, Judges of the supreme Court, and other Officers of the United States. This report provides an overview of high-ranking executive branch positions. This report provides an overview of high-ranking executive branch positions, known as \"advice and consent positions,\" that require Senate approval. It explains the three stages of the advice and consent process: selection and nomination, Senate consideration, and appointment. The report also covers recess appointments and temporary filling options for vacant positions. Additionally, it discusses statutory provisions applied to specific executive branch positions. The appointment process for high-ranking executive branch positions involves selection and nomination by the President, Senate consideration, and final appointment by the President. Congress can also create positions for appointment by the President alone, courts, or department heads. Other types of positions and federal judiciary appointments are not covered in this report. The White House selects and clears a prospective appointee before sending the formal nomination to the Senate. The President, with the assistance of the White House Office of Presidential Personnel, chooses a candidate for the position. Members of Congress and interested parties may recommend candidates for specific PAS positions, but the White House is not obligated to follow these recommendations. Senators argue they are entitled to provide advice to the President on selections, but the extent of this entitlement is debated. During the nomination process, Senators may delay or block consideration if they feel consultation was lacking. Candidates submit forms like the OGE 278 and SF 86, undergo an FBI background check, and have their financial disclosures reviewed. During the nomination process, candidates undergo background investigations to address conflicts of interest. The selection and clearance stage can be lengthy, especially during the beginning of an Administration. Congress amended the Presidential Transition Act in 2004 to expedite the appointment of the national security team. The Presidential Transition Act of 1963 encourages early security clearance for potential nominees to national security positions. Nominees have no authority until Senate confirmation, and the Senate decides on confirmation. The Senate determines whether to confirm a nomination based on factors like the position's importance, political circumstances, and policy implications. Most appointees are confirmed without public debate, while others undergo hearings and investigations. The Senate historically focuses on nominees' views and their impact on public policy. Factors like Senate control by the President's party and the President's involvement can influence the confirmation process. Nominations are primarily handled at the committee level by the Senate executive clerk. The Senate executive clerk receives nominations and refers them to committees according to Senate rules. Committees conduct investigations, hearings, and reporting stages on nominations. Hearings provide a public forum to discuss nominees' qualifications and policy perspectives. Senators use hearings to explore nominees' qualifications and raise oversight issues. In 2011, a bipartisan effort was made to address the burdensome process of confirming nominations to over 1,000 executive branch positions. The Senate agreed to S.Res. 116, which established a faster confirmation process for certain positions, bypassing formal committee referral for most nominations. Committees are still responsible for collecting background information on nominees. The Senate established a faster confirmation process for certain executive branch nominations in 2011. Committees collect background information on nominees, and if a nomination is referred to a committee, it may be declined at any point. The committee can report a nomination favorably, unfavorably, or without recommendation to the full Senate. Failure to obtain a majority vote on the motion to report results in the nomination not being reported to the Senate. The Senate may decline to report a nomination for various reasons, leading to the possibility of discharge from committee to bring it to the floor. While most executive branch nominations are confirmed, some fail due to lack of committee action or opposition on the Senate floor. Opposition can prevent consideration and confirmation by unanimous consent. The Senate can overcome opposition to a nomination by invoking cloture, which historically required the support of at least 60 Senators. However, in November 2013, the Senate changed its rules to only require a simple majority for cloture on most nominations. Post-cloture debate remains limited to 30 hours. Nominations not confirmed or rejected in the session they were made must be resubmitted by the President in a succeeding session. In the final stage of the appointment process, the confirmed nominee is given a commission signed by the President and sworn into office, granting full authority to carry out the responsibilities of the office. The President may sign the commission after confirmation, making the appointment official. Limited-term appointments to fill vacancies can be made by the President without Senate approval. The President can make limited-term appointments to fill vacancies without Senate approval, including recess appointments that expire at the end of the following Senate session. Congress has enacted provisions to restrict pay for recess appointees, but the President may still use this power to ensure appointees are paid. Salary prohibitions for recess appointees can be bypassed under certain circumstances. The President can make limited-term recess appointments to fill vacancies without Senate approval, which must be followed by a nomination within 40 days of the next session. The Department of Justice interprets the statute to prevent payment for appointees given successive recess appointments to the same position. The President can make limited-term recess appointments to fill vacancies without Senate approval, followed by a nomination within 40 days. A provision in the FY2008 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act may prevent appointees from being paid if their nominations are rejected by the Senate. Congress has used specific scheduling practices to prevent the President from making recess appointments since the 110th Congress. The President can make limited-term recess appointments to fill vacancies without Senate approval, followed by a nomination within 40 days. Congress has used specific scheduling practices to prevent the President from making recess appointments. The Constitution authorizes the President to fill vacant PAS positions through recess appointments, and the Vacancies Act provides limited statutory authority for temporary appointments in executive agencies. The Vacancies Act allows for temporary appointments in executive agencies, with a 210-day limit that can be extended under certain circumstances. It does not apply to positions on multi-headed regulatory boards or specific positions filled temporarily under other statutory provisions. Congress may provide for temporary filling of vacancies in certain advice and consent positions. The Vacancies Act allows for temporary appointments in executive agencies, with a 210-day limit that can be extended under certain circumstances. Congress has enacted provisions for filling vacancies in advice and consent positions, including methods such as automatic designation of acting officials or presidential designation. These provisions often include qualifications, fixed terms, limitations on removal, chair selection, and holdover authority, especially for regulatory and collegial boards and commissions. The Senate confirmation process can be influenced by provisions for appointees to leadership positions, such as qualifications for experience, skills, and educational backgrounds. Congress has selectively used qualification provisions, including requirements for citizenship, residency, and political party affiliation to maintain balance on regulatory boards. The Senate confirmation process can be influenced by qualification provisions for appointees to leadership positions, including requirements for citizenship, residency, and political party affiliation. Statutory qualifications associated with a position may affect nominee selection and Senate consideration. The Administration's selection process may be limited to a smaller group of candidates, potentially impacting the nominee's qualifications. If a nominee falls short of statutory requirements, the Senate must decide whether to confirm them. The Senate confirmation process for appointees to leadership positions may be influenced by qualification provisions, including political party balance. The White House often negotiates nominations with the opposition party for boards and commissions. Nominations may be submitted together for group confirmation. Some positions have set terms of office. Fixed-term positions for leadership roles typically have periods of four to seven years, aligning with the presidential election cycle or overlapping administrations. Despite having set terms, appointees serve at the pleasure of the President and can be removed at any time. This lack of protection may result in close guidance and potential removal during a presidential transition. A fixed term for leadership positions may influence the independence of appointees from the President. Short terms make officials more susceptible to Presidential direction, while longer terms may reduce allegiance to the President's successor. In some cases, positions with fixed terms can only be removed for cause by the President. The United States Code limits the President's ability to remove appointees from agencies like the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for political reasons. Independent regulatory boards often have provisions protecting members from removal without cause. This independence is crucial for agencies with quasi-judicial functions. The United States Code limits the President's ability to remove appointees from agencies like the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for political reasons. Independent regulatory boards often have provisions protecting members from removal without cause. This independence is crucial for agencies with quasi-judicial functions. Although less common, leaders of single administrator-headed agencies such as the Social Security Administration, Office of Special Counsel, Federal Housing Finance Agency, and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have for-cause protections. White House vetting and Senate consideration of nominations for fixed-term positions may involve different considerations than appointments of indefinite duration. Incumbents protected from at-will removal are unlikely to be involuntarily removed, and Senators not of the President's party may prevent confirmation to preserve vacancies for incoming Presidents. The use of fixed terms for members of federal boards and commissions is to ensure leadership continuity by staggering end dates. Individuals can be nominated for a specific seat and term, either to fill a vacancy or for an upcoming term. This system helps prevent simultaneous board member departures. The President may submit two nominations for the same person simultaneously, one to complete an unexpired term and the other for a succeeding term. The chair of some commissions requires Senate confirmation and must be appointed from the current commissioners. If the President wants to appoint a non-member as chair, two nominations are submitted - one for member and one for chair. In many cases, the President appoints the chair from the group's members without a separate nomination. When nominating a member for chair, the President can remove them at will. However, a higher threshold is needed to remove them as a member of the board. Some statutes allow officials to serve past their term without reappointment. Holdover provisions can impact the dynamics of board and commission leadership. Holdover provisions can impact the dynamics of board and commission leadership, affecting the advice and consent process. If key Senators or the President are satisfied with an incumbent member in a holdover capacity, nomination of a successor may be less likely. Some boards, like the Federal Election Commission, have experienced extended periods with members serving in holdover capacity. Several CRS reports discuss this process and related topics. The Senate's consideration of presidential nominations involves committee and floor procedures, cloture attempts, majority cloture implications, filling advice and consent positions, nominations during inter-term transitions, and changes made in the confirmation process. Multiple CRS reports cover these topics. The confirmation process for presidential nominations involves committee and floor procedures, cloture attempts, majority cloture implications, filling advice and consent positions, nominations during inter-term transitions, and changes made in the 112th Congress. Multiple CRS reports cover these topics. Presidential appointments to full-time positions in various agencies and boards during the 112th and 113th Congresses were covered in multiple CRS reports by different authors."
