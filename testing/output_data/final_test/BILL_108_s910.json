    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Non-Homeland Security Mission Performance Act of 2003\". Congress finds that federal agencies within the Department of Homeland Security perform vital non-homeland security functions, such as protecting fisheries, agriculture, communication, transportation, and medical supplies. These functions must continue alongside new homeland security responsibilities to meet daily needs and preserve national security. Non-homeland security functions complement homeland security efforts and often share personnel, resources, and assets. The Department of Homeland Security agencies perform essential non-homeland security functions like search and rescue, fisheries enforcement, immigration services, and citizenship benefits. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) assists local communities in preparing for and responding to natural disasters such as floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, and tornadoes. FEMA supplements State and local responses to disasters and helps mitigate damage and prevent disasters like earthquakes. The Secret Service protects payment and financial systems from various financial crimes, while the United States Customs Service safeguards free trade and monitors imports for compliance with laws. The Act aims to ensure federal agencies continue non-homeland security functions and develop management strategies and funding for these functions. The Act focuses on federal agencies maintaining non-homeland security functions and establishing management strategies and funding for these functions. SEC. 3 addresses the performance of non-homeland security functions. The Under Secretary of each non-homeland security entity in the Department of Homeland Security must submit a report on the entity's performance and functions to specified committees in Congress. The report should focus on the continuing level of performance of non-homeland security functions. The report required from non-homeland security entities in the Department of Homeland Security must include an inventory of functions, capabilities, personnel, budget, and flexibilities used to carry out those functions. It should also detail roles, responsibilities, organizational structure, and annual budgets related to accomplishing non-homeland security functions without any diminishment. The report from non-homeland security entities in the Department of Homeland Security must include information on necessary changes for roles, responsibilities, organizational structure, and resources to maintain functions without diminishment. It should also outline the strategy for performing both non-homeland security and homeland security functions. The Under Secretary in the Department of Homeland Security must submit an annual report. The Comptroller General of the United States will evaluate the implementation of this section and submit reports to the Senate and House committees. The Comptroller General of the United States will evaluate the Department of Homeland Security's performance in meeting non-homeland security functions and provide recommendations for legislation or administrative action. The Department must clarify and evaluate its performance in both homeland security and non-homeland security functions in its performance reports. The Coast Guard's performance will be evaluated by the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security for a 5-year period following its transfer to the Department. The evaluation will include the contents required in reports under subsections (a) and (b) of this section. Annual evaluations and performance reports for the Secret Service will be submitted by the Director as required under subsections (a), (b), and (c). Subsections (d) and (e) will apply to the reports under paragraphs (1)(B) and (2)."
