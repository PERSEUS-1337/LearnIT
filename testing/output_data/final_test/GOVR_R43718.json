    "content": "Since 1973, omnibus farm bills have included a rural development title, such as Title VI of the Agricultural Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-79). The current debate focuses on positioning rural areas to compete in the global economy as traditional agricultural dominance declines. Policymakers and rural development practitioners are seeking new sources of economic development for rural America. Congressional interest in rural community and economic development remains a key concern. Current challenges and reform of federal rural policies are evolving in an environment of increasing concern about economic competitiveness, a shift away from agriculture toward services, and new federal political strategies. A changing rural America is producing pressures for different policies and raising new questions about Congress's role in shaping rural policy. Agriculture and manufacturing issues are seen as elements of global and regional restructuring with significant implications for rural areas. Today, over 90% of total farm household income comes from off-farm sources, with the service sector dominating the rural labor market. Rural development in farm bills supports infrastructure, agricultural development, and rural business creation. Policymakers are advocating for innovative business development programs and alternative financing mechanisms to adapt to the changing structure of agriculture and diverse rural communities. Legislative support for technologies and local investments in industries are important aspects of rural development policy to address the changing structure of agriculture. Research is focused on agricultural waste management and environmental protections, with a shift towards value-added agriculture. Traditional strategies like value-added agriculture are being promoted in the farm sector, but there are limits to agriculture's role in rural economic prosperity. Commodity policy dominates the debate in the farm bill, but production agriculture is a small part of the rural economy. Farmers rely on a healthy rural economy, and there is a need to strengthen rural areas to compete globally. The debate on current farm policies focuses on their impact on economically viable rural communities, as traditional rural manufacturing faces challenges from foreign competition. Rural areas are transitioning to a service economy, but many face population and economic decline, prompting the need for new strategies. The decline in farming and rural areas is prompting the need for new strategies to create competitive advantages and provide public services. Economic development efforts are focusing on entrepreneurial strategies and microenterprise development to capitalize on local strengths and build an entrepreneurial culture. Building \"business incubators\" and forming commercial ties with colleges and universities are common strategies in these efforts. The trends in rural development focus on conservation, employment opportunities, population retention, agricultural integration, entrepreneurial capacity, infrastructure rebuilding, public service innovations, suburbanization conflicts, human capital deficiencies, regional economic development, and broadband connectivity. The 2014 farm bill's rural development title aimed to address challenges in rural areas such as poverty, outmigration, and lack of economic opportunities. The USDA leads federal efforts in rural development, administering numerous programs with approximately 50% of funds going directly to rural counties. The USDA's rural development mission area is managed by three agencies: the Rural Housing Service (RHS), the Rural Business-Cooperative Service (RBS), and the Rural Utilities Service (RUS). Most loan and grant programs are funded through annual appropriations, not covered by farm bills. These programs are \"permanently\" authorized and funded through annual appropriations. Farm bills provide discretionary funds for authorized programs for a specific time period. Congress addresses national rural policy issues in farm bills through loans, loan guarantees, and grant programs for rural infrastructure, business development, and investment capital. USDA Rural Development agencies support this policy. The USDA Rural Development agencies support national rural policy through various loan and grant programs focusing on infrastructure, business development, and investment capital. Newly authorized programs in farm bills emphasize regional perspectives in addressing rural development issues. The 2014 farm bill prioritized multijurisdictional planning for strategic rural development, moving towards a more comprehensive national rural policy. Concerns about the effectiveness of USDA rural development funding have been a recurring consideration. The 2014 farm bill prioritized multijurisdictional planning for strategic rural development, aiming for a more comprehensive national rural policy. Concerns exist regarding the effectiveness of USDA rural development funding, leading to the directive for USDA to collect data on economic activities created through grants and loans. This includes measuring the viability of award recipients and submitting reports every two years on rural employment generation, new business start-ups, and increased local revenue. Additionally, a new Strategic Economic and Community Development initiative has been authorized to prioritize projects supporting economic development plans on a multijurisdictional basis. The 2014 farm bill prioritized multijurisdictional planning for strategic rural development, aiming for a more comprehensive national rural policy. The program reserves 10% of the appropriation for community facilities, rural utilities, rural business, and cooperative development accounts for projects that meet the criteria of strategic development.

Additionally, a new Rural Gigabit Network Pilot Program is authorized to bring high-speed broadband to rural areas with an annual appropriation authorization of $10 million each year for FY2014 through FY2018. Another program, the Essential Community Facilities Technical Assistance and Training Program, provides technical assistance and training for public entities and nonprofit corporations to request financial assistance under the Community Facilities program. The program offers financial assistance for community facilities and training, funded by a carve-out of funds.
