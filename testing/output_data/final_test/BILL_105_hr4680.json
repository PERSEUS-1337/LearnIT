    "content": "The \"Infant Protection and Baby Switching Prevention Act of 1998\" requires hospitals to implement security procedures for infant patient protection and baby switching to receive Medicare and Medicaid payments. The \"Infant Protection and Baby Switching Prevention Act of 1998\" mandates hospitals to have security procedures meeting Secretary's standards for neonatal care to prevent infant abduction and baby switching. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must consult with various organizations and consider hospital size and services provided when promulgating regulations for neonatal and infant care under the Infant Protection and Baby Switching Prevention Act of 1998. The Secretary must publish regulations within 12 months of the Act's enactment, with the option to implement interim regulations. Hospitals violating the regulations may face civil money penalties of up to $50,000. A hospital with less than 100 beds may face civil money penalties for failing to have security procedures in place to prevent infant patient abduction and baby switching, as per standards set by the Secretary. Administrative provisions from section 1128A of the Act apply to these penalties. The amendments made by this section will take effect 18 months after the enactment of the Act and will apply to contracts under section 1866 of the Act on or after that date. \"Baby switching prohibited under SEC. 2.\" \"Sec. 1205 of Chapter 55 of title 18, United States Code, prohibits baby switching in interstate commerce. Altering or destroying a newborn patient's identification record with the intent to misidentify them can result in a fine of up to $250,000 for individuals and $500,000 for organizations, imprisonment for up to ten years, or both. An identification record includes footprints, fingerprints, photographs, written descriptions, and identification bracelets or anklets.\" An identification bracelet or anklet is placed on the newborn patient or mother by hospital staff. \"Baby switching occurs in hospitals where newborns or mothers are given identification bracelets to prevent mix-ups.\""
