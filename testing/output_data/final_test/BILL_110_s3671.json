These factors include whether the transaction is standardized. The Commission may exempt large over-the-counter transactions from position limits based on factors such as the use of standardized agreements and settlement against contract prices on registered entities.

A civil penalty of up to $1,000,000 may be imposed for each violation committed by the person.
