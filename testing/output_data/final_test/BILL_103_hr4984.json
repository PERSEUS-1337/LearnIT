    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Uniform Hazardous Waste Treatment Act of 1994\" and references to the Solid Waste Disposal Act are considered to be made to a section of the Act. The Congress acknowledges that cement kilns produce hazardous cement kiln dust, containing high levels of heavy metals, posing risks to human health and the environment. Current regulations on burning hazardous waste in cement kilns hinder more sustainable recycling practices. Existing laws are insufficient in monitoring and controlling these hazards. The current regulations allow cement kilns to burn hazardous waste materials, leading to environmental pollution. Public input on the increasing use of hazardous wastes in cement kilns is lacking. The regulations promote the use of polluting cement kilns over cleaner technologies available. SEC. 3. Specifications for hazardous waste fuels burned in combustion units. The amendment to Section 3004(q) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act prohibits facilities from burning fuel containing hazardous waste unless it meets specific criteria for conforming hazardous waste fuel. The Administrator is required to establish quantitative specifications within 12 months to ensure that such fuel is equivalent to standard fuels like coal and oil in terms of BTU content, metals content, and chlorinated hydrocarbon content. The term 'conforming hazardous waste fuel' refers to fuel containing hazardous waste that meets specified criteria for complete combustion and minimal ash residue in facilities for energy recovery. The term 'conforming hazardous waste fuel' refers to fuel containing hazardous waste that meets specified criteria for complete combustion and minimal ash residue in facilities for energy recovery. The specifications apply when the component first becomes subject to regulation under this subchapter. SEC. 4. CEMENT KILN DUST DISPOSAL. Section 3004(q) is amended to include new regulations for the disposal of cement kiln dust. It specifies that cement kiln dust must meet performance standards and technological requirements set by the Administrator. Additionally, there are specific standards for the land disposal of cement kiln dust produced in a cement kiln that burns hazardous waste fuel. The regulations for cement kiln dust disposal require it to meet performance standards and technological requirements. Cement kiln dust produced in a kiln burning hazardous waste fuel must adhere to specific land disposal treatment standards. SEC. 5. CEMENT KILN DESIGN AND OPERATING STANDARDS. The Administrator must establish regulations for cement kilns burning hazardous waste fuel within 12 months to protect human health and the environment. This includes standards for design, operation, handling, storage, combustion, and contingency plans for potential hazards. The regulations require cement kilns burning hazardous waste fuel to have contingency plans for potential hazards, considering location and proximity to population centers, wetlands, and waters of the United States. Modifications to a cement kiln burning hazardous waste fuel include adding a kiln, new waste feed process, or any alteration requiring a permit modification. SEC. 6. AIR EMISSIONS FROM CEMENT KILNS. Section 3004(n) is amended to establish standards for controlling emissions of cement kiln dust from cement kilns within specific timeframes. This includes addressing emissions from the operation of cement kilns, removal of dust from emission control equipment, handling, storage, transportation, and disposal of cement kiln dust, as well as the clinker grinding process. Additionally, regulations will be promulgated to control emissions of metals from units burning hazardous waste. Regulations will be established to control emissions of metals from units burning hazardous waste, including combustion units and incinerators, to protect human health and the environment. Standards will include minimum removal efficiency, emission limits for total metals (excluding mercury), carcinogenic metals, and mercury. The Administrator will promulgate regulations within 12 months for controlling stack emissions from cement kilns, ensuring standards are as stringent as those for other units burning hazardous waste. Regulations will be established to control emissions of metals from units burning hazardous waste, including combustion units and incinerators, to protect human health and the environment. Standards will include minimum removal efficiency, emission limits for total metals (excluding mercury), carcinogenic metals, and mercury. The Administrator will promulgate regulations within 12 months for controlling stack emissions from cement kilns, ensuring standards are as stringent as those for other units burning hazardous waste. Permit requirements will be implemented. Regulations will be established for controlling emissions from cement kilns burning hazardous waste fuel. The Administrator will promulgate regulations within 180 days for permit application procedures and requirements. Each person must submit a permit application within 12 months. The Administrator will issue a final permit for cement kilns burning hazardous waste fuel within 2 years of the enactment of the paragraph. The Administrator will issue a final permit for cement kilns burning hazardous waste fuel within 2 years of the enactment of the paragraph. Interim status for existing cement kilns burning hazardous waste fuel will terminate 12 months after enactment unless the owner/operator certifies compliance with section 3004(q) and submits a complete permit application. Interim status for cement kilns burning conforming hazardous waste fuel will terminate 12 months after enactment unless the owner/operator certifies compliance with specific requirements and submits a complete permit application. SEC. 8. MONITORING AND RECORDKEEPING. Section 3004(q) is amended to include new monitoring and recordkeeping requirements for owners and operators of combustion units burning hazardous waste fuel. This includes testing the fuel feed stream on a batch basis and maintaining records for 5 years. Owners and operators of combustion units burning hazardous waste fuel must maintain records for 5 years specifying source, date, quantity, and composition of all conforming hazardous waste fuel burned. SEC. 9. PERSONNEL TRAINING REQUIREMENTS.\n\nThe Administrator must establish regulations within 12 months for training personnel to operate cement kilns burning hazardous waste fuel and landfills for cement kiln dust disposal.\n\nSEC. 10. FUEL PROCESSORS. SEC. 10. FUEL PROCESSORS.\n\nRegulations must be established within 12 months for facilities producing fuel from hazardous waste to protect human health and the environment. The standards should be as stringent as those for hazardous waste fuel."
