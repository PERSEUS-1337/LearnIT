    "content": "President Bush signed the FY2006 Department of Defense appropriations bill (P.L. 109-148) on December 30, 2005, which included a one percent across-the-board rescission of non-emergency federal discretionary funding for FY2006. The bill also provided supplemental funding for federal agencies to respond to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma, including $2.8 billion for the Department of Transportation, $11.9 billion for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, $38 million for the General Services Administration, and $18 million for the Judiciary. Additionally, on November 30, 2005, President Bush signed H.R. 3058 into law (P.L. 109-115), which provided $137.6 billion in net budgetary resources, $4.1 billion more than the FY2005 enacted level. The House Committee on Appropriations published a revised suballocation for FY2006, reducing the budget authority by $1 billion. This change affected the House Appropriations Committee Transportation-Treasury-HUD-The Judiciary-DC Subcommittee. The discretionary budget authority was set at $65.9 billion, $1 billion less than the previous allocation. The Senate and House passed appropriations bills for FY2006, with the Senate approving $141.6 billion in funding, including restrictions on outsourcing and easing restrictions on agricultural exports to Cuba. The House approved $139.1 billion in funding, with a 3.1% pay raise included. The House approved the Appropriations Committee's recommendations for a 3.1% pay raise for federal civilian workers in 2006, along with easing restrictions on U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba. The bill also included amendments increasing funding for Amtrak and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and restricting outsourcing of federal work. The President's FY2006 request for the programs covered was $126.1 billion, which was $1.6 billion below the FY2005 enacted level. This included cuts for the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Transportation. The Executive Office of the President's budget for FY2006 was $300 million less than FY2005, mainly due to transferring the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas Program to the Department of Justice. The President's budget proposal for FY2006 included cutting funding for Amtrak and reducing funding for the FAA's Airport Improvement Program. The proposed budget for FY2006 includes reducing funding for various programs, such as community and economic development under HUD, housing for disabled persons, and payments to the United States Postal Service. Additionally, a new program administered by the Department of Commerce is proposed with a funding decrease of $1.9 billion compared to the programs it would replace. The House-passed version of H.R. 3058 for FY2006 provided $140.0 billion, $6.5 billion over FY2005 levels and $9.7 billion over the Administration's request. The bill included increased funding for Amtrak and programs within the Department of Housing and Urban Development, despite objections from the White House. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 3058, which included the FY2006 appropriations bill for the District of Columbia, provided $142.0 billion. The bill reflected Senate Committee on Appropriations recommendations, with amendments approved to delete restrictions on Amtrak service and limit eminent domain powers for economic development projects. The White House objected to some provisions and issued veto threats. The conference version of H.R. 3058, passed by the House and Senate in November 2005, was signed into law on November 30, 2005 (P.L. 109-115). It provided $137.6 billion in net budgetary resources, with increases for HUD and DOT. Conferees included directives for Amtrak and language limiting outsourcing of federal jobs. The conference version of H.R. 3058, signed into law in November 2005, included provisions for Amtrak and limited outsourcing of federal jobs. Conferees did not include provisions easing restrictions on agricultural exports to Cuba or prohibiting the use of federal funds to enforce certain gun laws in D.C. They also added language prohibiting the use of funds for projects using eminent domain for private entities and amended provisions regulating household moving companies. In early 2005, federal laws regulating moving companies were amended to limit state agencies' enforcement abilities, with the limitation expiring after one year. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations reorganized their subcommittee structures, reducing the number of subcommittees. The Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies subcommittee was combined with the District of Columbia subcommittee, gaining jurisdiction over appropriations for the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Judiciary. The Senate also made similar changes, adding jurisdiction over appropriations for the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Judiciary to the Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies subcommittee. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees reorganized their subcommittee structures in early 2005. The Senate added jurisdiction over appropriations for the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Judiciary to the Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies subcommittee. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported out a Transportation et al. appropriations bill (H.R. 3058) and a District of Columbia appropriations bill (S. 1446), with the appropriations for all agencies other than the District of Columbia in Division A and District of Columbia appropriations in Division B. Table 1 notes the status of the FY2006 Transportation et al. appropriations bill, while Table 2 lists the total funding provided for each title in the bill for FY2005 and the amount requested for FY2006. Funding trends over the five-year period FY2001-FY2005 are shown in Table 3, with agencies generally experiencing funding increases. The President's budget proposed $58.3 billion for the Department of Transportation, $1.4 billion less than FY2005. Major funding changes requested from FY2005 were in Amtrak and the Federal Aviation Administration's Airport Improvement Program. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $62.8 billion for the Department of Transportation, with increases in funding for the Federal Aviation Administration, Federal Highway Administration, and Federal Transit Administration. The increase in funding brought these programs up to their authorized levels for FY2006. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $62.8 billion for the Department of Transportation, with increases in funding for various programs. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $64.2 billion for DOT, with adjustments in funding for different departments. The Senate supported the Committee's recommendations regarding transportation funding. The conference version of H.R. 3058 provided $60.7 billion in net budgetary resources for the Department of Transportation, including $1.3 billion for Amtrak and provisions governing its operations. The bill aimed to improve transportation safety, mobility, and passenger experience. The President's budget did not request funding for Amtrak for FY2006, which received $1.2 billion in FY2005. The Administration proposed $360 million for the Surface Transportation Board to maintain commuter rail service in case Amtrak ceases operations. The Administration's reauthorization plan for Amtrak faced bipartisan criticism in Congress. The Administration's reauthorization plan for Amtrak faced little attention from the 108th Congress, leading to no FY2006 funding request. Concerns were raised about the potential bankruptcy of Amtrak and the need for significant reforms to support increased funding for intercity passenger rail. The House Committee on the Budget encouraged continued funding for Amtrak. The House Committee on the Budget supported funding for Amtrak, and the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure marked up the Amtrak Reauthorization Act of 2005. The bill would authorize $2 billion annually for three years for Amtrak. The Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation reported out the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2005, authorizing $11 billion for Amtrak over six years. The Senate attached similar language to the budget reconciliation bill, which was approved by a vote of 93-6. The House passed an amended version of the bill without including Amtrak. The House approved amendments to increase Amtrak's FY2006 appropriation from $550 million to $1.176 billion, which is less than what was recommended but more than the previous year's funding. The House approved amendments to increase Amtrak's FY2006 appropriation to $1.176 billion, less than the recommended amount but more than the previous year's funding. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $1.45 billion for Amtrak, with provisions including the adoption of a cost accounting system, restrictions on federal funding for certain services, and permission to impose fees on passenger tickets for capital improvements. The Senate supported the Amtrak funding level recommended by the Committee on Appropriations, with amendments deleting restrictions on food and beverage service and sleeper car service. The White House issued a veto threat against the Senate's funding level without fundamental reforms. The House voted to instruct conferees to agree to the Senate level for Amtrak funding, resulting in $1.3 billion provided for Amtrak in H.R. 3058. The appropriations for Amtrak in H.R. 3058 included $1.3 billion, with $495 million for operating subsidy grants, $780 million for capital and debt service grants, and $40 million for efficiency incentive grants. The Federal Aviation Administration's budget for FY2006 was $12.7 billion, with a request for $25 million to hire 1,249 air traffic controllers. The House Committee recommended $14.6 billion for FY2006. The House Committee recommended $14.6 billion for FY2006, $1.1 billion over the level enacted for FY2005 and $1.9 billion over the Administration request. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $14.3 billion, with lower funding for operations and grants-in-aid to airports. The conference committee provided $13.8 billion for aviation, with a cut to the Airport Improvement Program proposed by the President. AIP funds are used for airport planning. The conferees allocated $3.55 billion for airport development projects, including increasing airport capacity. The Administration suggested airports could offset reduced AIP funding by raising passenger facility charges, potentially generating an extra $350 to $400 million annually. Some Members of Congress questioned the impact of fee hikes on the struggling airline industry. The President's budget proposed a 51% cut in Essential Air Service program funding, from $102 million to $50 million. The House Committee recommended $104 million for the program. The House-passed bill allocated $104 million for the Essential Air Service program, with $54 million in funding struck out. The Senate and conference bills both provided $110 million. The program aims to maintain air service to rural communities by subsidizing costs. Supporters argue it was part of the deal made during airline deregulation in 1978. Concerns were raised about potential cuts impacting rural transportation connections. Previous budget requests have also proposed reducing funding. The President's budget requested $35.3 billion for federal highway programs and $7.8 billion for federal transit programs for FY2006. The House, Senate, and conference bills approved varying amounts for these programs. The funding authorization was increased due to the passage of H.R. 3, the SAFETEA-LU Act, providing a guaranteed authorization of $38.6 billion for the federal highway program. The FY2006 budget provides $38.6 billion for the federal highway program and $8.6 billion for federal transit programs. The Administration requested $220 million for the Maritime Administration, $85 million below the FY2005 enacted amount. The National Defense Tanker Vessel Construction Program saw changes with no new funding requested and a recommendation to rescind the FY2005 appropriation. The House and Senate supported varying funding amounts, with conferees ultimately providing $301 million. The Tanker Vessel Construction Program received $301 million in funding, with no new funding provided. The program aims to reduce the Department of Defense's reliance on foreign-flag oil tankers by supporting the construction of up to five privately-owned product-tanker vessels in the United States. Each vessel could receive up to $50 million for construction in U.S. shipyards, capable of carrying militarily useful petroleum products for the military's use in times of war. In FY2004, Treasury received $11.218 billion in funds, with most allocated to the IRS. The remaining $982 million was distributed among various Treasury bureaus and offices, including TFI, OFAC, TIGTA, CDFI, FinCEN, and others. For FY2005, Treasury received funding with the majority going to the IRS. The requested budget for FY2006 included $11.649 billion, with a significant portion allocated to the IRS. Other funds were designated for departmental offices, systems, and various programs within the Treasury. The Treasury Department's FY2006 budget request included funding for various agencies such as FinCEN, Financial Management Service, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, and Bureau of the Public Debt. The budget also aimed to increase full-time employment and support strategic objectives like improving taxpayer compliance and modernizing IRS systems. The Treasury Department's FY2006 budget request included funding for agencies like FinCEN, Financial Management Service, and IRS modernization. Congressional action on the budget request began with hearings in the House, leading to the approval of funding for Treasury and other federal agencies in FY2006. The House approved H.R. 3058 with 48 amendments, giving the Treasury Department $11.529 billion in funding for FY2006. The IRS would receive $10.556 billion, and funding for taxpayer service, tax law enforcement, and IRS information systems would not be combined into a single account as requested by the Administration. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved an amended version of H.R. 3058, with funding increases for various accounts in FY2006, including Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, Financial Management Service, TIGTA, Bureau of Public Debt, FinCEN, and departmental offices. Three accounts would receive less funding, and the Air Transportation Stabilization program would receive no funding. The full Senate approved a version of H.R. 3058 with funding increases for Treasury and the IRS in FY2006, differing from the House-passed version. The Senate allocated $11.698 billion to Treasury and $10.679 billion to the IRS, denying the Administration's request to combine funding for taxpayer service, tax law enforcement, and IRS information systems into a new single appropriations account. The Senate approved funding increases for Treasury and the IRS in FY2006, allocating $11.698 billion to Treasury and $10.679 billion to the IRS. The Senate also provided $4.726 billion for tax law enforcement, with increases in funding for various accounts and restoration of funding for two programs. Funding for three Treasury accounts would have been cut relative to FY2005 levels. The House and Senate had significant differences in their versions of H.R. 3058, leading to the formation of a conference committee. The committee reached an agreement outlined in a conference report (H.Rept. 109-307) released on November 18. The House approved the report by a vote of 392-31, followed by the Senate through unanimous consent. President Bush signed the measure on November 30, providing Treasury with $11.698 billion in appropriated funds for FY2006. In FY2006, Treasury received $11.698 billion in appropriated funds, with $10.671 billion going to the IRS. The IRS can only reorganize or reduce its workforce with approval from the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. Additionally, $197 million was allocated to Treasury's departmental offices, with $40 million designated for combating financial crimes. Other funded accounts include TIGTA at $133 million, FinCEN at $74 million, and the Air Transportation Stabilization program at $3 million. In FY2005, the IRS received $10.237 billion in funds, with allocations for processing, tax law enforcement, information systems management, business systems modernization, and health insurance tax credit administration. Congress specified $4 million for Tax operations. In FY2005, the IRS received $10.237 billion in funds for various programs. Congress allocated $4 million for the Tax Counseling for the Elderly program and $7.5 million for low-income taxpayer clinics. The Bush Administration requested $10.679 billion for IRS operations in FY2006, proposing a restructuring of the agency's budget to align with its major programs. The IRS budget for FY2006 would be reduced from six to three main categories: tax administration and operations (TAO), BSM, and administration of the health insurance tax credit. TAO would receive $10.460 billion in appropriated funds, 5% more than FY2005. Concerns were raised about potential non-compliance due to reduced funding for taxpayer service. The FY2006 IRS budget request aimed to enhance taxpayer service, enforce tax laws, and modernize information systems. The House approved $10.556 billion in funds, $319 million more than FY2005 but $123 million less than requested by the Bush Administration. The House approved $10.556 billion in funds for the IRS in FY2006, which was $319 million more than FY2005 but $123 million less than the Bush Administration's request. The approved funding allocated $4.182 billion for processing, assistance, and management, $4.580 billion for tax law enforcement, $1.575 billion for information systems, $199 million for BSM, and $20 million for administering the health insurance tax credit. The House approved $10.556 billion in funds for the IRS in FY2006, allocating money for various programs including Tax Counseling for the Elderly, low-income taxpayer clinics, and the IRS Oversight Board. The IRS planned to close 68 Taxpayer Assistance Centers but suspended the plan pending approval of the FY2006 budget. Additionally, the IRS intended to reduce the weekly hours of operation for toll-free telephone assistance for individual taxpayers. The Senate approved an amended version of H.R. 3058, providing the IRS with $10.679 billion in funding for FY2006. This amount was $443 million more than the previous year and $123 million more than the House had approved. The Senate rejected the Administration's proposed budget restructuring, citing concerns about accountability. The IRS would receive $4.137 billion for processing, assistance, and management, and $4.726 billion for tax law enforcement under the Senate-passed version of H.R. 3058. The Senate approved $10.679 billion in funding for the IRS for FY2006, $443 million more than the previous year. This included $4.726 billion for tax law enforcement, $1.598 billion for information systems, $199 million for BSM, and $20 million for administering the health insurance tax credit. The IRS may not cut services to taxpayers until TIGTA completes a study on planned reductions in services. The Senate approved $10.679 billion in funding for the IRS for FY2006, including provisions for the Tax Counseling for the Elderly program and grants to low-income taxpayer clinics. The Senate version of H.R. 3058 removed the cap on user fees collected by the IRS and prevented the agency from competing with the private sector in developing tax return preparation software. This led to the formation of a conference committee to resolve differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill. A committee was formed in late October to resolve funding issues for the IRS. On November 18, a conference report was released detailing the agreement reached. The House and Senate approved the conference agreement on H.R. 3058, with President Bush signing the measure on November 30. The IRS received $10.672 billion in FY2006, with specific allocations for processing, tax law enforcement, information systems, BSM, and health insurance tax credit administration. The act prohibits the IRS from reorganizing or reducing its workforce without approval from the Appropriations Committees. The IRS received $10.672 billion in FY2006 with specific allocations for processing, tax law enforcement, information systems, BSM, and health insurance tax credit administration. The act prohibits the IRS from reorganizing or reducing its workforce without approval from the Appropriations Committees. Additionally, the President's proposed FY2006 HUD budget of $29.1 billion represented a decline of almost 9% from the FY2005 enacted level of $31.9 billion. This decrease resulted from several factors including a proposed transfer of the Community Development Block Grant program (CDBG) to the Department of Commerce and the reduction or elimination of other HUD programs. Proposed cuts to HUD programs include reductions in Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction (-29%), Native American Block Grants (-6%), Fair Housing programs (-15%), and Housing for Persons with AIDS (-5%). Program increases were proposed for the Section 8 voucher program ($1.1 billion) and Homeless Assistance Grants ($200 million). The House passed a bill proposing over $4 billion more for HUD than the President requested, maintaining or increasing funding for programs slated for cuts. The Senate passed the FY2006 HUD funding bill, proposing over $34 billion for HUD, an increase over the FY2005 budget. The final conference agreement split the difference between the House and Senate-passed funding levels, funding CDBG within HUD but reducing its overall funding level. The bill also included a provision restricting the use of federal economic development funds in projects involving eminent domain. The FY2006 budget recommendations proposed consolidating 18 community and economic development programs into the \"Strengthening America's Communities Initiative (SACI).\" The proposal aimed to realign federal programs, including the Community Development Block Grant program, Empowerment Zones, Brownfield Economic Development Initiatives, and others. The Department of Commerce would administer the new program, replacing the 18 existing programs currently managed by five federal agencies. The Administration proposed consolidating 18 community and economic development programs into the \"Strengthening America's Communities Initiative (SACI)\" to realign federal programs. The new program would emphasize flexibility, be results-oriented, and targeted to communities in need. The proposal aimed to reduce funding from $5.6 billion in FY2005 to $3.7 billion in FY2006 for the new program, with HUD being the most affected agency. The Administration proposed consolidating 18 community and economic development programs into the \"Strengthening America's Communities Initiative (SACI)\" to realign federal programs. The agency's Community Development Block Grant formula grants represent 74% of the total funding. The House and Senate-passed budget resolutions for FY2006 both supported the continuation of the CDBG program, with the House version increasing funding by $1.1 billion. Groups representing state and local officials opposed the consolidation proposal. The FY2006 budget resolution assumed $1.5 billion more than the President requested for Community and Economic Development purposes. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $4.15 billion for the CDBG program and EDI grants, including $3.86 billion for CDBG formula grants and $290 million for EDI grants for congressional earmarked projects. The Committee recommended $290 million for EDI grants for congressional earmarked projects and did not fund several CDBG set-asides and related programs. Funding for CDBG-related set-asides was transferred to other HUD accounts. A new self-help and assisted homeownership account was included in the bill, providing funding for various programs. Indian CDBG would receive $45 million as a set-aside within the Native American Housing Block Grants account. The House approved transferring $29 million in funding for university programs to HUD's Office of Policy Development and Research, including assistance to historic black colleges and universities, institutions serving Hispanic populations, and a community development work study program. Two amendments were approved to increase FY2006 funding for the Community Development Fund account (CDF), adding $24 million for HUD's Brownfield program and $67.5 million overall. Up to $50 million of the increase was designated for the Youthbuild program. The House approved transferring $29 million in funding for university programs to HUD's Office of Policy Development and Research. Two amendments were approved to increase FY2006 funding for the Community Development Fund account (CDF), adding $24 million for HUD's Brownfield program and $67.5 million overall, with $50 million designated for the Youthbuild program. The remaining $17.5 million was designated for CDBG formula-based grants, aiming to restore funding to FY2005 levels. The Senate version of the bill proposed $4.3 billion for Community Development Fund (CDF) activities, including $3.77 billion for CDBG formula grants and $556.2 million for CDBG-related set asides and earmarks. The Senate bill recommended retaining funding for most CDBG-related set-asides within the CDF account, including $69 million for Native American CDBG and $32.4 million for college and university programs. It also allocated $40 million for the Neighborhood Initiative Program and $30 million for capacity building grants under the National Community Development Initiative. The Senate Appropriations Committee considered H.R. 3058 and approved $4.220 billion for Community Development Fund activities, including $3.748 billion for the CDBG formula grant program. Senator Bond introduced and withdrew an amendment regarding the use of federal funds in economic development projects involving eminent domain. The amendment would have allowed federal funds for projects involving airports, seaports, mass transit, or revitalizing blighted areas. The act includes $471 million for CDF set asides and earmarks, with $310 million allocated for 1,126 EDI earmarked projects. Additionally, $50 million is earmarked for Neighborhood Initiative projects, $1.6 million for the Working Capital Fund, and $50 million for local YouthBuild organizations. There are concerns about the use, growth rate, and non-competitive nature of earmarks. The conference version of the act shifts funding for various programs to other HUD accounts, including the SHOP program, National Community Development Initiative, Housing Assistance Council, National American Indian Housing Council, and the La Raza HOPE Fund. Assistance for minority universities and colleges is now funded under the Policy Development and Research account. The Senate version of H.R. 3058 recommended continued funding for the Section 108 loan guarantee program. The conference version of H.R. 3058 includes $3 million in loan subsidies for the Section 108 loan guarantee program, with a loan commitment ceiling of $137 million. Section 726 of the TTHUD Appropriations Act for FY2006 prohibits the use of funds for projects involving eminent domain, except for those with a public purpose. The provision in H.R. 3058 excludes economic development that primarily benefits private entities as an eligible public purpose, except in cases involving blighted areas, brownfield redevelopment, mass transit, transportation, and utility projects benefiting the general public. Eminent domain can be used for these projects without losing federal funds. A study on eminent domain usage will be conducted by various government and property rights organizations. For more details on the Administration's SACI proposal, refer to CRS Report RL32823. The rental assistance program, known as the Section 8 voucher program, received a 7% increase in funding over FY2005. The additional funds were allocated to renew existing subsidies rather than create new ones. The President's budget proposed to continue funding PHAs based on fixed costs and utilization rates, which has been controversial. The budget also included a proposal to reform the tenant-based voucher program to contain or reduce costs. The President's budget proposed reforms to the Section 8 voucher program to reduce costs and provide flexibility to Public Housing Authorities (PHAs). The reform proposal was introduced in Congress in 2005 but no further action was taken. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $15.5 billion for tenant-based rental assistance, slightly less than the President's request. The House bill allocated $15.5 billion for tenant-based rental assistance, with an additional $100 million added by an amendment. The Senate-passed bill also funded the voucher program at $15.6 billion for FY2006. The conference version of H.R. 3058 proposed to allocate renewal funds based on agencies' recent cost and utilization data, with $45 million set aside for adjustments. The President's FY2006 request for the Section 811 housing program included a 50% funding cut, eliminating capital grants for housing units for the disabled. The FY2006 HUD funding bill proposed changes to Section 811 housing program, reallocating funds for vouchers instead of capital grants for housing units for the disabled. The enacted appropriation for FY2006 increased Section 811 funding to $239 million, with funds permitted to be used for capital subsidies. The FY2006 HUD funding bill increased funding for Section 811 to $239 million, with funds for vouchers instead of capital grants. The President's budget requested no new funding for the HOPE VI program, which provides grants for redevelopment of troubled public housing projects. Despite the President's request, Congress funded HOPE VI in FY2004 and FY2005, but at a lower level than in FY2003. In FY2006, the President's budget requested Congress to rescind funds provided to the HOPE VI program in FY2005. The House Appropriations Committee recommended no FY2006 funding for HOPE VI but did not support the rescission of FY2005 funds. The Senate proposed $150 million for HOPE VI in FY2006, slightly more than in FY2005. The final H.R. 3058 bill funded HOPE VI at $100 million and did not enact the rescission of FY2005 funds. The Administration's FY2006 budget includes proposals for two new FHA initiatives. The FHA Zero Downpayment Homeownership Option would allow first-time buyers with strong credit to finance 100% of their home purchase price. The House Committee on Appropriations did not assume the revenue from this proposal in their re-estimate of the budget. Another initiative, the FHA Payment Incentive Homeownership Initiative, aims to attract borrowers who would otherwise seek loans in the subprime market. The FHA Payment Incentive Homeownership Initiative aims to attract borrowers who would otherwise seek loans in the subprime market. HUD estimates the program would generate 64,000 loans a year and increase net revenues by $37.4 million. The Judiciary presents its budget to the President, who transmits it to Congress unaltered. The Judiciary's budget includes funding for the Supreme Court and \"lower\" federal courts. The Supreme Court's expenses make up less than 1.2% of the total budget, with the rest covering salaries, benefits, and operating expenses of circuit and district judges. The Judiciary's budget covers funding for the Supreme Court and \"lower\" federal courts, including salaries, benefits, and operating expenses. The budget does not fund three \"special courts\" in the U.S. court system. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist expressed concern about a \"funding crisis\" in 2004 due to rising fixed costs and increased workload. The Judicial Conference has implemented a cost containment strategy in response. The Judiciary has implemented a cost containment strategy to reduce costs and improve efficiency. They have requested a partial rent exemption from the General Services Administration to alleviate budget pressures. Court security has become a top priority following various security threats and incidents. The Judiciary has made security a top priority, leading to congressional hearings and the introduction of legislation such as H.R. 1751. This legislation aims to enhance security by prohibiting weapons in federal courthouses, increasing penalties for crimes against judges, and funding witness protection programs. On October 27, 2005, the House Judiciary Committee voted 26 to 5 to approve H.R. 1751, including amendments by Representatives Chabot, Jackson-Lee, and Schiff. Amendments included authorizing judges to allow photographing court proceedings, funding grants for state prosecutors and protective services for young witnesses, and creating a threat assessment database for analyzing domestic terrorism trends. Representative Adam Schiff sponsored amendments authorizing $20 million annually for U.S. Marshals Service hiring and courtroom safety planning. Representative Robert C. Scott's amendment removed habeas corpus provisions from the bill. On November 9, the House passed H.R. 1751 with amendments clarifying the death penalty application and tribal court eligibility for security grants. Representative Steve King's amendment authorizes federal officials to carry firearms with training and regulation. Representative Henry Cuellar's amendment adds a new category for witness protection grants in border jurisdictions facing cross-border crime threats. Representative Sheila Jackson-Lee's amendment requires grants to state courts participating in threat assessment databases. Representative Bob Filner's amendment provides grants for young witness protection. Bob Filner's amendment expands grants for young witness protection to include support for those trying to leave criminal gangs or prevent gang recruitment. Representative Anthony Weiner's amendment makes state and local courts eligible for various grant programs. Representative Scott sponsored amendments to replace mandatory minimum sentences with higher maximum sentences and remove the death penalty for killing federally funded public safety officers. H.R. 1751 was referred to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary on November 10, 2005. The Senate Committee held a hearing on \"Protecting the Judiciary\" on May 18, 2005. On May 18, 2005, the Senate Committee on the Judiciary held a hearing on \"Protecting the Judiciary at Home and in the Courthouse,\" addressing security challenges and recommendations. Senator Jon Kyl introduced the Law Enforcement Officers' Protection Act of 2005 (S. 1605) on July 29, 2005, calling for mandatory punishment for criminals who harm public safety officers. Senator Arlen Specter introduced the Courtroom Security Improvement Act of 2005 (S. 1968) on November 7, 2005. The Senate bills, similar to H.R. 1751, aim to enhance protection for judges, prosecutors, witnesses, victims, and their families. The Judiciary requested $101.8 million in FY2005 for anticipated workload costs due to recent Supreme Court rulings. The Senate allocated $65 million in its version of the FY2005 supplemental, but no funding was included in the conference agreement. For FY2006, the Judiciary initially sought $5.95 billion in total appropriations, a 9.7% increase from FY2005.

Since 2001, U.S. sanctions have allowed commercial agricultural exports to Cuba under the TSRA, with restrictions on financing and payment terms. In 2005, OFAC clarified that payment must be received before shipment, tightening economic sanctions against Cuba. OFAC clarified in 2005 that for the commercial sale of U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba, vessels can leave U.S. ports once a foreign bank confirms receipt of payment from Cuba, ensuring goods are not vulnerable to seizure. This action was met with objections from U.S. agricultural exporters and some Members of Congress who believed it violated the intent of TSRA. The American Farm Bureau Federation welcomed the clarification on the commercial sale of U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba in 2005. Cuba has purchased over $1 billion in agricultural products from the U.S. since late 2001. U.S. exports to Cuba have increased over the years, with a decline in 2005.
