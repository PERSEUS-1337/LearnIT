    "content": "Immigration programs for foreign temporary workers have been a topic of discussion among policymakers. Various bills have been introduced to reform existing programs and create new ones, but comprehensive reform bills have not been enacted into law. In the absence of new legislation, the Bush Administration aimed to streamline existing guest worker programs in 2007. In 2008, final rules were published to amend regulations on temporary agricultural and nonagricultural worker programs. In January 2009, new rules were implemented for the H-2A and H-2B temporary worker programs. In February 2010, a new H-2B final rule was published under the Obama Administration. Guest worker programs have historically addressed labor shortages during times of war, such as the Bracero program bringing Mexican agricultural workers to the US. The Bracero program, in effect until 1964, brought millions of Mexican agricultural workers to the US. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 established the H-2 program for temporary foreign workers. The 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act subdivided the H-2 program into H-2A and H-2B programs. The H-2A and H-2B visas are part of the \"H\" nonimmigrant visa category for temporary workers in the US. The H-2A program is for agricultural workers, while the H-2B program is for other temporary workers. Both programs are administered by the DOL and DHS. Legislation has been introduced to reform these programs and create new temporary worker visas. In 2007, the Senate debated immigration reform that included changes to the H-2A program and the creation of new guest worker visas. The H-2A program allows for the temporary admission of foreign workers to the United States to perform agricultural labor or services of a seasonal or temporary nature, provided that U.S. workers are not available. The H-2A visa allows for temporary admission of foreign workers for agricultural labor for up to three years. Employers must demonstrate a need for foreign workers and show that their employment will not negatively impact U.S. workers. The H-2A visa program allows for temporary admission of foreign workers for agricultural labor. Employers must recruit U.S. workers, provide a three-fourths guarantee, pay the highest wage rates, and offer benefits such as housing and transportation. The program has grown significantly since 1992, with no numerical limits on visas issued annually. The H-2A visa program has seen significant growth since 1992, with visa issuances increasing from 6,445 in FY1992 to 64,404 in FY2008. Despite this growth, the program remains small compared to total hired farm employment. The final H-2A rules issued in December 2008 aimed to address criticisms from growers and labor advocates. The DHS and DOL H-2A rules were implemented in January 2009 to provide legal workers for agricultural employers and reduce reliance on unauthorized workers. The 2008 H-2A rule under the Obama Administration reduced the waiting period for H-2A workers to return to the U.S. from six months to three months. The DHS rule extends the period of time for H-2A workers to remain in the U.S. after their petition expires from 10 days to 30 days. It also allows H-2A workers awaiting an extension of stay to start a new job before the extension is granted, as long as the new employer is registered with E-Verify. Additionally, the rule prohibits payments by H-2A workers to employers or recruiters as a condition of obtaining employment. The DHS H-2A rule establishes conditions for obtaining H-2A employment, limits participation to designated countries, and introduces a Temporary Worker Visa Exit Program Pilot. The DOL's 2010 H-2A rule reverts to the pre-2008 labor certification process. The 2010 rule for H-2A employers requires submission of a job order to the state workforce agency before filing a labor certification application, detailing job qualifications, minimum benefits, and wages. The job order serves as the basis for recruiting U.S. workers, with potential documentation requirements for job qualifications. The 2010 DOL rule amends H-2A wage provisions for employers, requiring payment of the highest of four wage rates: federal or state minimum wage, prevailing wage rate, adverse effect wage rate (AEWR), or collective bargaining wage. This rule reinstates pre-2008 wage requirements and emphasizes the use of collective bargaining wage if it is the highest. The 2010 DOL rule reinstates the fifty-percent rule for H-2A employers, requires post-certification audits, expands debarment authority, and includes logging employment in the definition of agricultural labor. The H-2B program allows foreign workers for temporary non-agricultural services if no unemployed U.S. workers are available. The H-2B visa program allows foreign workers to perform temporary non-agricultural service or labor if unemployed U.S. workers cannot be found. Foreign medical graduates are excluded from the program. The work must be temporary, such as a one-time occurrence, seasonal need, peak load need, or intermittent need. An H-2B worker's stay cannot exceed three consecutive years, and they must leave the country for a specified period before seeking an extension or readmission. Prospective H-2B employers must apply to the Department of Labor for certification. The H-2B visa program requires employers to apply for certification from the DOL to show that U.S. workers are not available and that hiring foreign workers will not harm American workers' wages or conditions. H-2B workers must be paid at least the prevailing wage rate and are typically low-skilled. Unlike the H-2A program, H-2B employers are not required to provide housing, transportation, or other benefits. Top H-2B occupations include landscape laborer, forest worker, housekeeping cleaner, and construction worker. The H-2B visa program has a cap of 66,000 visas per fiscal year, with exceptions for current workers. The number of H-2B visas issued increased steadily from FY1993 to FY2004, with a peak of 78,955 visas in FY2003. USCIS acknowledged exceeding the cap in FY2003. In FY2003, the H-2B visa cap was divided into two six-month caps of 33,000 each. Temporary provisions exempted returning H-2B workers from the cap in FY2005 and FY2006. The cap exemption was extended through FY2007, resulting in 129,547 H-2B visas issued that year. The returning worker exemption expired in FY2008. In FY2008, the H-2B cap was exceeded with 94,304 visa issuances. In FY2009, visa issuances fell to 44,847, the lowest since 2000. The DHS and DOL made changes to the H-2B program in December 2008, including redefining temporary employment and setting limits on employer's need for workers. The DOL final rule for H-2B employers requires re-testing the labor market for needs lasting over 18 months. Changes to DHS's H-2B regulations include a prohibition on payments to employers, limits on participant countries, and inclusion in the Temporary Worker Exit Visa Program Pilot. The 2008 H-2B rule requires employers to have an approved labor certification before petitioning for H-2B workers. DOL established an appeals process for labor certification denials. The process is now attestation-based, with employers attesting to compliance with program requirements and recruiting U.S. workers before filing a certification application. The 2008 H-2B rule includes new enforcement measures such as post-certification audits and penalties for violations. The rule also allows for the debarment of employers from the H-2B program. The discussion on guest worker programs is driven by high levels of illegal immigration to the U.S. and estimates show a large unauthorized resident alien population. The unauthorized resident alien population in the U.S. totaled 11.9 million in March 2008, with estimates slightly lower at 11.6 million in January 2008 and 10.8 million in January 2009. Mexico is the largest source country for unauthorized immigration, with about 7.0 million unauthorized Mexicans in 2008 and 6.7 million in 2009. More than 300 migrants have died at the U.S.-Mexican border each year since FY2000, with 423 migrant deaths in FY2009. In FY2009, there were 423 migrant deaths at the U.S.-Mexican border. An estimated 8.3 million unauthorized workers were in the U.S. civilian labor force in March 2008, representing about 5.4% of the labor force. Unauthorized immigrants are overrepresented in sectors like agriculture, construction, leisure/hospitality, and services. Unauthorized workers make up between 10% and 25% of workers in certain occupations and are overrepresented in industries like landscaping, private household employment, and dry cleaning. Supporters of a guest worker program believe it could reduce unauthorized immigration, but critics disagree. Critics argue that a guest worker program could worsen illegal immigration issues, as many workers may not leave the country after their authorized stay. Bills in the 111th Congress, such as the AgJOBS Act of 2009, aim to reform the H-2A program and make changes to the H-2B program. The Senate bill introduced by Senator Feinstein, with bipartisan support, includes an AgJOBS title and aims to streamline the process of importing H-2A workers. Employers would need to file applications with the Department of Labor, with specific assurances required for jobs covered by collective bargaining agreements. The Senate bill aims to streamline the process of importing H-2A workers by requiring employers to file applications with specific assurances for job recruitment and benefits. The Department of Labor would need to certify the employer's application within seven days before they can petition for H-2A workers. Proposed changes include maintaining the adverse effect wage rate at the January 2009 level for three years. The Senate bill aims to streamline the process of importing H-2A workers by requiring employers to file applications with specific assurances for job recruitment and benefits. The Department of Labor would need to certify the employer's application within seven days before they can petition for H-2A workers. The rate would remain at the January 2009 level for three years after the date of enactment, and employers could provide housing allowances to their workers if adequate housing was available. An H-2A worker's initial period of employment could not exceed 10 months, with the possibility of extensions up to three years. Both AgJOBS bills propose a legalization program for agricultural workers, granting \"blue card status\" to eligible alien workers. The House bill proposes granting \"blue card status\" to eligible alien workers in agricultural employment, allowing them to adjust to LPR status by meeting specific work requirements. No more than 1,350,000 blue cards could be issued over a five-year period. Existing numerical limits under the INA would not apply to adjustments of status under the bill. Several H-2B bills have been introduced in the House and Senate, proposing significant reforms to the H-2B visa program. The H-2B Program Reform Act of 2009 (H.R. 4381) and the Increasing American Wages and Benefits Act of 2010 (S. 2910) would amend the INA to add requirements for the admission of H-2B workers. H.R. 4381 would require prospective H-2B employers to register with DOL and set the number of positions each employer could use. It would also establish new wage requirements for the program. S. 2910 would set different wage requirements and only permit adjustments of status under the bill. The H-2B visa program is undergoing significant reforms with new wage requirements and restrictions on hiring H-2B workers in specific occupational classifications. Bills like H.R. 4321 and H.R. 1136 aim to reinstate the H-2B returning worker provision that expired in FY2007. Representative Kratovil and Senator Mikulski have introduced bills to temporarily reinstate this provision. The H-2B visa program is undergoing reforms with new wage requirements and restrictions on hiring workers in specific occupations. H.R. 1136 proposes a permanent exemption for workers who were H-2B nonimmigrants in the prior three fiscal years. Policy issues related to temporary worker programs and the evaluation of guest worker proposals are likely to arise, including considerations for U.S. and Mexican economic development, law enforcement, and worker protections. A new guest worker program could include agricultural or nonagricultural workers, potentially replacing or supplementing the existing H-2A and H-2B programs. A comparison of the requirements of the proposed and existing programs, especially in the case of a new program covering both agricultural and nonagricultural workers. The area of wages provides an example, with potential changes in wage requirements for employers. The possible participation of illegal aliens in a guest worker program is controversial. The controversy surrounding the possible inclusion of illegal aliens in a guest worker program is a key issue. Some argue that it could reward lawbreakers and lead to future unauthorized immigration. Excluding unauthorized aliens could leave them vulnerable to exploitation by employers. The eligibility of nationals from certain countries is also a consideration, with past discussions involving Mexico. Some argue for a special immigration relationship with Mexico in guest worker program talks, while others oppose singling out Mexicans. The debate includes whether to include a legalization or earned adjustment program, with differing views on permanent legalization. The current debate on immigration reform includes reference to two legalization programs established by the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. Approximately 2.7 million individuals have adjusted to LPR status under these programs. Recent H-2A reform bills suggest a willingness to establish an earned adjustment program, especially for agricultural workers. Key questions revolve around the proposed legalization process and requirements for any guest worker program. Major H-2A reform proposals in the 107th Congress would address these issues. The 107th Congress proposed legislation (S. 1313 / H.R. 2736 and S. 1161) for earned adjustment programs for agricultural workers. Workers could apply for temporary resident status after meeting work requirements, with differing hours or work days needed. To qualify for LPR status, workers needed to meet specific agricultural work hours over a period of years. S. 1161 proposed increasing the agricultural work requirements for legalization to 900 hours or 150 work days per year over a six-year period. Concerns were raised about the feasibility of workers meeting these requirements and the potential for exploitation due to multiyear work requirements. The availability of workers for low-skilled industries like agriculture, meat packing, and services is a concern with quick legalization processes. The treatment of family members under a guest worker proposal is also an issue, with questions about whether spouses and children could accompany guest workers from abroad. The guest worker program raises questions about the treatment of family members, including whether unauthorized spouses and children would be granted legal status. The 1986 legalization programs did not provide derivative LPR status to family members, requiring them to file immigrant visa petitions separately. The Immigration Act of 1990 provided additional visa numbers for spouses and children of IRCA-legalized aliens, along with temporary stays of deportation and work authorization. The treatment of family members in any guest worker program with a legalization component could have broad implications for the U.S. immigration system. The treatment of family members in a guest worker program with a legalization component could impact alien participation. Labor certification is required for employers hiring foreign workers under the H-2A and H-2B programs to protect job opportunities for U.S. workers. Recruitment is the main method to determine U.S. worker availability. The labor certification process is criticized for being slow and ineffective in protecting U.S. workers. A proposed guest worker program could establish a different process for bringing in foreign workers, such as worker registries or labor attestation. DOL amended its regulations in 2008 to adopt an attestation-based labor certification process, but some argue that it is inadequate for unskilled workers. The labor certification process is criticized for being slow and ineffective in protecting U.S. workers. Some argue that labor attestation is inadequate for unskilled jobs without educational requirements. The labor market test in any guest worker program needs evaluation to ensure U.S. worker protection. Numerical limitations on guest worker programs, like the H-2B program capped at 66,000 annually, provide a means of limiting foreign workers. Former Senator Phil Gramm outlined a guest worker program during the 107th Congress, but it was never introduced as legislation. Former Senator Phil Gramm proposed a guest worker program during the 107th Congress with numerical caps that would vary based on regional unemployment rates. Other recent proposals, such as the Y-2 visa in the 110th Congress, also include numerical limitations based on demand. Some view a temporary worker program as a way to reduce unauthorized immigration. A guest worker program's size and enforcement are key considerations. Critics argue that a large program could increase unauthorized immigration. Enforcement mechanisms, such as penalties for non-compliance, are crucial for ensuring employer adherence to program requirements. Enforcement mechanisms for a guest worker program are essential to ensure employer compliance with program requirements. Questions remain about whether the enforcement system would be complaint-driven and how to ensure guest workers depart the country at the end of their authorized stay. Historically, the U.S. immigration system has not prioritized the removal of aliens who overstay their visas but have not committed crimes. Some believe a large-scale guest worker program could help address visa overstaying and unauthorized immigration by limiting job opportunities for unauthorized aliens. Many suggest that a new guest worker program may increase unauthorized alien population as workers overstay visas. Ideas to facilitate workers' departure include involving home countries and providing financial incentives. Questions arise about the effectiveness of such incentives in encouraging workers to return home. Supporters of new temporary worker programs argue that it would enhance homeland security by knowing the identities of individuals in the country and legalizing alien workers. Opponents are concerned about rewarding immigration law violators with legal status. Security provisions may be included in a new guest worker program. New guest worker programs may include special screening, monitoring, and fraud-resistant documents. Legislation in previous Congresses focused on H-2A program changes, with limited discussion on nonagricultural guest worker bills. It is uncertain if major proposals for new guest workers will arise. The Senate proposed changes to the H-2A program, including a system of worker registries and modified wage requirements. These changes were not enacted, but similar proposals were introduced in the 106th Congress. In the 106th Congress, a two-stage legalization program for farm workers was proposed but fell apart. Another reform bill, H.R. 4548, aimed to establish a pilot H-2C alien agricultural worker program without a legalization component. Key bills in the 107th Congress also focused on H-2A reform coupled with legalization efforts. In the 107th Congress, bills aimed at significant H-2A reform and legalization for foreign agricultural workers were proposed. S. 1161 and S. 1313 / H.R. 2736 would have streamlined the process for importing H-2A workers and allowed workers to adjust to LPR status through specified work requirements. Differences in wage requirements and a study mandate were key distinctions between the proposals. No further action was taken on either proposal. In the 108th Congress, various bills were introduced regarding guest worker programs, including the H-2A program and the \"H\" visa category. Congressional committees held hearings on the impact of guest workers on U.S. workers and border security under a guest worker program. No further action was taken on the bills introduced. The AgJOBS Act of 2003 aimed to overhaul the H-2A agricultural worker program by streamlining the process of importing workers, especially for jobs covered by collective bargaining agreements. Prospective employers would have had to file applications with certain assurances, including notifying bargaining representatives of the filing for H-2A workers. The proposed changes to the H-2A program under S. 1645 / H.R. 3142 included requirements for employers to assure recruitment of U.S. workers, provide benefits, wages, and working conditions, offer jobs to qualified U.S. workers, and certify applications within seven days. Additionally, changes were proposed regarding minimum benefits, wages, and working conditions for H-2A workers. Proposed changes under S. 1645 / H.R. 3142 included maintaining the adverse effect wage rate at the January 2003 level for three years, allowing housing allowances instead of housing if certified by the state governor, limiting H-2A worker's initial employment to 10 months with possible extensions up to three years, and establishing a two-stage legalization program for agricultural workers. The bill S. 1645 introduced by Senator Craig and Senator Kennedy proposed a two-stage legalization program for agricultural workers. It required alien workers to meet specific requirements for adjusting to LPR status, including hours of agricultural work in the United States. Senator Craig later introduced a modified version of the bill, S. 2823, with differences in legalization provisions. S. 2823 introduced a provision that aliens with temporary resident status would not be eligible for federal benefits until five years after obtaining permanent resident status. H.R. 3604 aimed to reform the H-2A agricultural worker program by streamlining the process for importing workers and requiring certain assurances from employers. H.R. 3604 aimed to reform the H-2A agricultural worker program by making changes to minimum benefits, wages, and working conditions. Employers would have had to pay workers the higher of the prevailing wage rate or the state minimum wage, and could provide housing allowances instead of housing if certified by the state governor. Workers' initial employment period could not exceed 10 months, with possible extensions in 10-month increments. H.R. 3604 and S. 2185 aimed to reform the H-2A agricultural worker program by setting limits on stay duration and streamlining the worker import process. S. 2185 required employers to provide assurances regarding job temporariness, benefits, wages, and recruitment of U.S. workers. S. 2185 proposed changes to H-2A requirements, including higher wages and housing allowances instead of offering housing. It did not address worker admission periods or LPR status. The Reform Act of 2004 (S. 2010) aimed to reform the H-2B nonimmigrant visa by allowing workers to perform short-term service or labor lasting up to 9 months. It also proposed a new H-2C visa for temporary workers in occupations not covered by existing visa categories, with numerical limits for both programs. The H-2B program would have been capped at 100,000 for five years before reverting to the current level of 66,000. The Reform Act of 2004 (S. 2010) proposed reforms to the H-2B and introduced the new H-2C visa program with numerical limits. The H-2B program would have been capped at 100,000 for five years before reverting to 66,000. The H-2C program would have been capped at 250,000 for five years before termination. Both programs would have been subject to recruitment requirements and worker protections. Employers would have had to recruit U.S. workers before applying for H-2B or H-2C workers. The Reform Act of 2004 (S. 2010) proposed reforms to the H-2B and introduced the new H-2C visa program with numerical limits. The H-2B program would have been capped at 100,000 for five years before reverting to 66,000. The H-2C program would have been capped at 250,000 for five years before termination. Both programs would have been subject to recruitment requirements and worker protections. Employers would have had to recruit U.S. workers before applying for H-2B or H-2C workers. The proposed legislation also outlined specific conditions for the admission and extension of stay for H-2B and H-2C workers, with provisions for LPR status. S. 2010 proposed enabling H-2B and H-2C nonimmigrants to obtain LPR status and establishing a legalization program for certain unauthorized aliens. S. 2381 / H.R. 4262, known as the \"S.O.L.V.E. Act,\" aimed to reform the H-2B nonimmigrant visa by eliminating certain restrictions. S. 2381 / H.R. 4262 proposed reforms to the H-2B nonimmigrant visa, including the creation of a new H-1D visa for temporary workers. The H-2B program would have been capped at 100,000 annually, while the H-1D program would have been capped at 250,000 annually. Both programs would have been subject to various requirements regarding recruitment, application procedures, and worker protections. Prior to filing an application with DOL for H-2B or H-1D workers, prospective employers would have had to take specified steps to recruit U.S. workers, including posting the job on DOL's America's Job Bank and with local job banks. The employer would have had to offer the job to any qualified, available U.S. worker who applied and attest to various items in the application, such as offering the prevailing wage and abiding by all applicable laws. DOL would review the application and issue a determination within 10 working days. The initial period of admission for an H-2B worker could not have exceeded nine. S. 2381 / H.R. 4262 would have allowed H-2B and H-1D nonimmigrants to apply for LPR status without numerical limits on employment-based immigrant visas. An employer or the alien could file an employment-based petition after two years of H-2B or H-1D status. Additionally, a legalization program for certain unauthorized aliens in the U.S. would have been established. H.R. 3534 proposed to amend the INA's \"H\" visa category, replacing subcategories with a single category for skilled or unskilled work if qualified U.S. workers were not available. Employers would have to file an application with DOL and post a job announcement on an Internet-based job bank. Wage requirements and other program conditions would have been in place. The proposed H.R. 3534 aimed to amend the INA's \"H\" visa category, creating a single category for skilled or unskilled work if qualified U.S. workers were unavailable. Employers had to offer prevailing wages, provide health insurance, and follow specific program conditions. H nonimmigrants would apply to a worker database, stay in their home countries until hired, with a maximum 365-day admission period. The guest worker program required certifications from the Secretary of Homeland Security before implementation. The Border Security and Immigration Reform Act of 2003 (S. 1387) introduced new temporary worker programs for seasonal and nonseasonal workers under the INA. It would have created a new \"W\" nonimmigrant visa category without numerical limits for these workers. The proposal involved joint administration of guest worker programs by the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of State with foreign countries. The Border Security and Immigration Reform Act of 2003 proposed new guest worker programs with foreign countries, overseen by the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of State. Employers would need to apply for worker importation through the programs, providing assurances and attestation from the Department of Labor. The Border Security and Immigration Reform Act of 2003 proposed new guest worker programs overseen by the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of State. Employers would need to provide assurances in the application, including job offers to equally qualified U.S. workers, advertising job openings, and paying workers at least minimum wage. DOL would certify applications within 14 days. Employers would face increased penalties for hiring unauthorized aliens. W-1 seasonal workers could stay for up to 270 days per year and could reapply annually. W-2 nonseasonal workers could initially stay for one year, with extensions possible in one-year increments. The Border Security and Immigration Reform Act of 2003 proposed new guest worker programs overseen by the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of State. Workers could have applied for U.S. legal permanent residency only after returning to their home countries, with evaluations based on a point system established by the Secretary of Homeland Security. Investment accounts for guest workers would have been created, funded by Social Security taxes, and distributed only after workers left the program and returned home. The Border Security and Immigration Improvement Act proposed new temporary worker visas, H-4A and H-4B, with no numerical limits. The H-4A visa would cover aliens coming to the US for temporary full-time employment, requiring employers to file a petition with DHS for approval. The H-4A visa proposed under the Border Security and Immigration Improvement Act required employers to meet recruitment requirements and attest to providing equal benefits to U.S. workers. Aliens granted H-4A status would receive machine-readable visas with biometric identifiers and an initial authorized stay of three years. The H-4A visa proposed under the Border Security and Immigration Improvement Act allowed for a three-year initial authorized stay, extendable for another three years. It also provided a pathway for H-4A nonimmigrants to adjust to LPR status and allowed for petitions for employment-based immigrant visas. Additionally, the bill introduced the H-4B visa for aliens unlawfully present and employed in the U.S. since before August 1, 2003, with a three-year authorized stay period. H.R. 3651, introduced by Representative Issa, proposed a new \"W\" nonimmigrant visa category under the INA for unauthorized aliens present in the U.S. on December 8, 2003, or residing in foreign contiguous territory. To be eligible for W status, aliens would have had to register with DHS, with employment not being a strict requirement. The proposed W nonimmigrant visa category under H.R. 3651 would not have required strict employment for eligibility but would have required aliens to demonstrate financial support. The initial authorized admission period would have been one year, renewable up to five times. The bill did not include a special adjustment mechanism to LPR status but did not prevent it if requirements were met under current law. Legislation in the 109th Congress also aimed to reform H-2A and H-2B programs and establish new temporary worker visas. The H-2B bills (S. 352/H.R. 793) were enacted as part of the FY2005 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Tsunami Relief. The John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for FY2007 extended one of the temporary H-2B provisions. The Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 would have reformed the H-2A program and established a new guest worker program for nonagricultural workers. Efforts to add guest worker programs to the Border Protection, Antiterrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005 were unsuccessful. The 109th Congress held hearings on immigration issues related to a guest worker program. The House Judiciary Committee and Senate Judiciary Committee discussed employment verification, work site enforcement, and comprehensive immigration reform. Bills like S. 352/H.R. 793 aimed to revise the H-2B program. During Senate consideration of the FY2005 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill, Senator Mikulski proposed an amendment based on S. 352/H.R. 793, which was adopted and included in the enacted measure (P.L. 109-13). The H-2B title of P.L. 109-13 capped the number of H-2B slots at 33,000 for the first six months of a fiscal year, required DHS to submit information to Congress regularly, imposed a fraud-prevention fee on H-2B employers, and authorized additional penalties in certain circumstances. The John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for FY2007 extended the exemption for returning H-2B workers through FY2007. The Senate Judiciary Committee considered an immigration measure proposing reforms to the H-2A program and a new guest worker program for nonagricultural workers, which evolved into the Comprehensive Immigration Act of 2006 (S. 2611) passed by the Senate. Title VI, Subtitle B of S. 2611, passed by the Senate, aimed to streamline the process of importing H-2A workers for agricultural jobs, similar to the AgJOBS Act. Employers would have had to file applications with DOL, including assurances for jobs covered by collective bargaining agreements. Title VI, Subtitle B of S. 2611 aimed to streamline the process of importing H-2A workers for agricultural jobs. Employers had to file applications with DOL, including assurances for jobs not covered by collective bargaining agreements. Required assurances included steps to recruit U.S. workers, provide benefits, wages, and working conditions, and offer the job to equally qualified U.S. workers. Changes were proposed for minimum benefits, wages, and working conditions under the H-2A program. The proposed changes under Title VI, Subtitle B of S. 2611 included keeping the adverse effect wage rate at the January 2003 level for three years, allowing employers to offer housing allowances instead of housing, limiting an H-2A worker's initial employment period to 10 months with possible extensions up to three years, and introducing a legalization program for agricultural workers with \"blue card status\" conferred by the Secretary of DHS. Under S. 2611, the Secretary of DHS would confer \"blue card status\" on alien workers meeting specific agricultural employment criteria. A maximum of 1.5 million blue cards could be issued over five years. Eligibility for LPR status adjustment required continued agricultural work post-enactment. The bill also proposed a new H-2C nonagricultural guest worker program. Title IV, Subtitle A of S. 2611 proposed a new H-2C nonagricultural guest worker visa capped at 200,000 annually. Employers would have to file a petition with DHS, attesting to offering prevailing wages and the lack of qualified U.S. workers. The H-2C nonagricultural guest worker visa proposed in S. 2611 required employers to file a petition with DHS, offering prevailing wages and demonstrating the lack of qualified U.S. workers. To be eligible, the alien needed evidence of employment and had to meet specific requirements. The initial authorized stay for H-2C workers was three years, extendable for another three years. They were not allowed to switch to another nonimmigrant visa category. Failure to depart the U.S. on time would make them ineligible for immigration relief, except for humanitarian forms. H-2C nonimmigrants could apply for LPR status, and their employers could file petitions for employment-based immigrant visas. The Agricultural Job Opportunities, Benefits, and Security Act of 2005 (AgJOBS Act) aimed to overhaul the H-2A agricultural worker program by streamlining the process of importing H-2A workers, especially for jobs covered by collective bargaining agreements. Employers would have to file applications with the Department of Labor containing specific assurances, including those related to applicable union contracts. Employers interested in hiring H-2A workers would need to provide assurances related to union contracts and notifying bargaining representatives. Additional assurances were required for jobs not covered by collective bargaining agreements, including steps to recruit U.S. workers and provide necessary benefits. The job had to be temporary or seasonal, and offer the position to equally qualified U.S. workers. The Department of Labor would certify the application within seven days if complete and accurate. S. 359 / H.R. 884 proposed changes to the H-2A program, including maintaining the adverse effect wage rate for three years, allowing housing allowances instead of housing, and limiting an H-2A worker's stay to three years with extensions. Additionally, the bill would establish a two-stage legalization process. S. 359 / H.R. 884 proposed H-2A program changes, including a two-stage legalization process for agricultural workers based on hours worked. Adjusting to LPR status required specific hours of agricultural work within a set timeframe. H.R. 3857, introduced by Representative Goodlatte, was a revision of a bill related to H-2A reform. H.R. 3857, introduced by Goodlatte and cosponsors, aimed to streamline the process of importing H-2A workers by requiring attestations from employers to DHS instead of DOL. The bill would have changed current H-2A requirements for benefits, wages, and working conditions, with DHS providing a decision on petitions within seven days. Under H.R. 3857, H-2A employers would pay workers prevailing wage or state minimum wage, not subject to adverse effect wage rate. Housing allowances could replace housing if certified by state governor. H-2A workers admitted for up to 20 months, with no LPR status mechanism. The Agricultural Employment and Workforce Protection Act of 2005 (S. 2087) aimed to reform the H-2A program by expanding the types of agricultural labor covered and streamlining the process for importing H-2A workers. Employers would have to provide required benefits, wages, and working conditions, make efforts to recruit U.S. workers, and offer jobs to equally qualified U.S. workers. S. 2087 aimed to reform the H-2A program by changing requirements for minimum benefits, wages, and working conditions. Employers would have to pay workers the prevailing wage rate or state minimum wage, with no adverse effect wage rate. Housing allowances could be provided instead of housing if certified by the state governor. H-2A workers would be admitted for an initial 11-month period, extendable for up to two. S. 2087 proposed changes to the H-2A program, including establishing subcategories of H-2A nonimmigrants such as \"Level II H-2A workers\" and \"H-2AA workers.\" Level II H-2A workers could apply for employment-based adjustment of status after five years, while H-2AA workers would participate in a cross-border worker program. The bill proposed establishing a blue card program for agricultural workers, allowing them to work in the US for up to two years before returning to their home country. Additionally, S. 278 aimed to make changes to the numerical limits under the H-2B program. The bill proposed changes to the H-2B program, including increasing the annual cap to 131,000 and implementing new requirements. It aimed to allocate 65,500 slots in the first six months of the fiscal year and required regular reporting to Congress by DHS. H.R. 1587 and S. 1918 proposed changes to the H-2B program, including new recruitment requirements for employers and participation in the Basic Pilot program. S. 1918 aimed to revise the H-2B visa, allowing workers to perform short-term service lasting not more than nine months and introducing a new H-2C visa. S. 1918 proposed a new H-2C visa for temporary workers to perform labor or services not covered by existing visa categories. The H-2B visa would be capped at 100,000 annually, and the H-2C visa at 250,000 annually, with recruitment and worker protection requirements. Employers would need to recruit U.S. workers before applying for H-2B or H-2C workers. The employer applying for H-2B or H-2C workers had to attest to offering wages at prevailing rates, following labor laws, and DOL would review the application within 21 days. H-2B workers could stay for up to nine months in a year, with a total of 36 months in four years. H-2C workers could stay for up to two years, extendable for another two years. S. 1918 and H.R. 3333 proposed extending the period of admission for H-2C workers up to four years and allowing them to obtain LPR status. H.R. 3333 aimed to replace current \"H\" visa subcategories with a single \"H\" visa. The proposed legislation aimed to replace current \"H\" visa subcategories with a single \"H\" visa, removing the cap and requiring employers to recruit U.S. workers before hiring H nonimmigrants. Applicants would have to be included in a database maintained by the Department of Labor. The proposed legislation aimed to replace current \"H\" visa subcategories with a single \"H\" visa, removing the cap and requiring employers to recruit U.S. workers before hiring H nonimmigrants. Aliens admitted on H visas could not change to another nonimmigrant status or be adjusted to LPR status in the United States. H.R. 3333 required certifications from the Secretary of Homeland Security before implementing the new H visa program, including a fully operational automated entry-exit system and the removal of at least 80% of aliens who overstayed their visas within one year. S. 1033 / H.R. 2330, known as the Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act, was introduced by Senator McCain and Representative Kolbe for comprehensive immigration reform. The proposed legislation in July and October 2005 aimed to establish new temporary worker visas, H-5A and H-5B, with initial caps and no cap, respectively. The H-5A visa would cover aliens coming to the U.S. for labor or services not covered by other visa categories. Employers would not file petitions for H-5A nonimmigrants. Under S. 1033 / H.R. 2330, employers would have been able to hire H-5A workers by posting job opportunities on a DOL electronic job registry. H-5A workers would need to meet employment requirements and comply with all laws. Their initial authorized stay would be three years, extendable for another three years. Under S. 1033 / H.R. 2330, H-5A nonimmigrants in the United States could have adjusted to LPR status. Petitions for employment-based immigrant visas could have been filed by an H-5A worker's employer or by the worker after maintaining H-5A status for four years. The bill also introduced the H-5B visa for aliens present and employed in the United States before May 12, 2005, with a six-year authorized stay and the opportunity to apply for LPR status. The Immigration Reform Act of 2005 (S. 1438) introduced a new \"W\" temporary worker visa without a cap, allowing DOL to set one in the future. It also proposed a Deferred Mandatory Departure (DMD) status for certain unauthorized aliens, with no limit on recipients. The W visa would cover temporary labor not under H-2A or high-skilled visa categories. S. 1438 introduced a new \"W\" temporary worker visa without a cap, allowing DOL to set one in the future. Prospective W nonimmigrants would file applications on their own behalf, with employers not filing petitions on their behalf. The Secretary of State could grant a W visa to aliens demonstrating intent to perform eligible work, requiring evidence of employment and other requirements. Employers would need authorization through a system established by DHS, posting positions on a DOL job registry and offering them to equally qualified U.S. workers. S. 1438 would have required all employers, including W employers, to verify new hires' employment eligibility through an electronic system. W nonimmigrants would have a two-year authorized stay, with a maximum total stay of six years. They could be readmitted after one year in their home country. W nonimmigrants would be ineligible to change to another nonimmigrant status. The proposed legislation would have made W nonimmigrants ineligible to change to another nonimmigrant status and would not have provided them with a special mechanism to obtain LPR status. Aliens present in the US since July 20, 2004, and employed since before July 20, 2005, could have applied for Deferred Mandatory Departure (DMD) status for up to five years. Employers would need to apply for authorization to employ aliens in DMD status through the Alien Employment Management System. Aliens granted Deferred Mandatory Departure (DMD) status could have sought admission as nonimmigrants or immigrants if they complied with the terms and departed before expiration. Failure to depart would result in ineligibility for immigration benefits for 10 years, except for humanitarian relief. H.R. 4065 aimed to establish a registration process for temporary workers. H.R. 4065, introduced by Representative Osborne, proposed a registration process for aliens unlawfully present in the US since 2005. Registered aliens would receive work authorization and be eligible for a new \"W\" temporary worker visa with no numerical limit. The W visa would allow for three-year increments of authorized admission with continuous employment required. Legislation in the 110th Congress aimed to reform the H-2A and H-2B programs and establish new temporary worker visas. The Senate debated immigration reform in 2007, including provisions for H-2A program reform and new guest worker programs, but the final reform bill failed to pass. The House also held hearings on guest worker issues. Several committees held hearings on guest worker programs, including discussions on H-2B returning worker bills. Various bills proposed reenacting an exemption for returning H-2B workers who had been counted against the cap in previous fiscal years. Legislation in the 110th Congress aimed to reform the H-2A and H-2B programs and establish new temporary worker visas. Several bills in the 110th Congress aimed to revise the H-2B returning worker exemption, with proposals to exempt workers who were present in the US in H-2B status in the three years preceding the year at issue. S. 1639, introduced by Senator Kennedy, was based on S.Amdt. 1150 to S. 1348 and debated in late June 2007. The Senate debated S. 1639 in late June 2007, but failed to invoke cloture on the bill. Among its provisions were the repeal of the H-2B program, reform of the H-2A program, and establishment of new guest worker programs. The H-2A reform provisions in Title IV, Subtitle B, aimed to streamline the process of importing H-2A workers, especially for jobs covered by collective bargaining agreements. Employers would have had to file applications with DOL containing specific assurances. Employers interested in filling jobs not covered by a collective bargaining agreement would have to ensure specific assurances, including recruiting U.S. workers, providing benefits, wages, and working conditions. DOL would certify the application within seven days if complete. The proposed changes to the H-2A program under Section 404 of S. 1639 included adjustments to minimum benefits, wages, and working conditions. These changes would have kept the adverse effect wage rate at the January 2003 level for three years after enactment. Employers could offer housing allowances instead of housing if certified by the state governor. Additionally, the maximum continuous period of authorized status for H-2A workers would have been limited to 10 months. S. 1639 proposed H-2A program reforms and a legalization process for agricultural workers. It included granting Z-A nonimmigrant visas to those meeting specific criteria, with a limit of 1.5 million visas. Spouses and children of Z-A nonimmigrants could also apply for dependent visas. After eight years, Z-A nonimmigrants would need to renew their visa status or apply for legal permanent resident status. The bill proposed granting Z-A nonimmigrant visas to agricultural workers meeting specific criteria, with the option to adjust to legal permanent resident status by meeting work requirements, paying fines and taxes, and filing the application in person with a U.S. consulate abroad. The bill also proposed establishing a new Y temporary worker visa category. The bill proposed a new Y temporary worker visa category, including Y-1 for temporary labor, Y-2 for seasonal nonagricultural labor, and Y-3 for spouses or children. Employers would need to file a labor certification application with DOL, make efforts to recruit U.S. workers, and then file a petition with DHS to import Y workers. The bill proposed a new Y temporary worker visa category with annual numerical limits. Y-1 nonimmigrants could stay for two years, extendable for two more periods with 12 months outside the US in between. Y-2B nonimmigrants could stay for 10 months, with a two-month break required before readmission. The Y-1 visa annual cap was set at 200,000, Y-3 at 20% of Y-1, and Y-2 at 100,000 for the first fiscal year. The Y-2 visa would have been capped at 100,000 for the first fiscal year, with a maximum cap of 200,000 in subsequent years. An exemption from the Y-2B cap would have been established for certain workers. Additionally, a new Z nonimmigrant category would have been created for certain alien workers in the United States, allowing for work authorization and potential legalization of status. Under Section 601 of S. 1639, the Z nonimmigrant category would have allowed certain alien workers in the United States to remain lawfully under specified conditions. The Z-1 classification would cover aliens continuously present in the US since January 1, 2007, and employed, with Z-2 and Z-3 covering their specified family members. Applicants for Z status would have to pay penalties, with probationary benefits including employment authorization. The Z nonimmigrant category would have allowed certain alien workers in the United States to remain lawfully under specified conditions. The period of admission for a Z nonimmigrant would have been four years, with the possibility of unlimited four-year extensions. The Secretary of DHS could have adjusted the status of a Z nonimmigrant to LPR status if specified requirements were met, including paying a $4,000 penalty for a Z-1 nonimmigrant. The Agricultural Job Opportunities, Benefits, and Security Act of 2007 proposed changes to the H-2A agricultural worker program, including streamlining the process for importing workers and requiring certain assurances from employers. The employer would need to ensure compliance with a collective bargaining agreement or provide additional assurances for job not covered by one when applying for H-2A workers. This includes recruiting U.S. workers, offering required benefits, wages, and working conditions, and certifying job temporariness or seasonality within seven days of filing. The AgJOBS Act of 2007 proposed changes to the H-2A program, including maintaining the adverse effect wage rate for three years, allowing housing allowances instead of housing, limiting an H-2A worker's initial employment to 10 months, and extending stay in increments of up to 10 months for a total of three years. The AgJOBS Act of 2007 proposed a legalization program for agricultural workers with \"blue card status\" granted to those who met specific requirements. No more than 1.5 million blue cards could have been issued over a five-year period. To adjust to LPR status, workers had to meet certain agricultural work requirements for a specified number of years after enactment. The modified version of the AgJOBS Act of 2007, approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee, included provisions to streamline the H-2A program but with different wage provisions. The Feinstein amendment proposed an emergency agricultural worker program for foreign workers without enabling them to become LPRs. The STRIVE Act of 2007 proposed an emergency agricultural worker program for individuals who met specific criteria, granting them legal temporary resident status for up to five years. The program required participants to maintain their status by performing a minimum amount of agricultural work each year. Additionally, the Act included provisions for a new H-2C temporary worker program. Title IV of H.R. 1645 proposed a new H-2C temporary worker program for aliens coming to the U.S. for temporary labor or services not covered by other visas. Employers would have to file a petition with DOL, attest to offering competitive wages, and demonstrate efforts to recruit U.S. workers before hiring H-2C workers. The Border Security and Immigration Reform Act of 2007 proposed a new W temporary worker program for agricultural or nonagricultural workers. Employers would need to recruit U.S. workers, provide evidence of employment, and meet specific requirements. H-2C workers could stay for up to six years, apply for LPR status, and file for employment-based immigrant visas. The bill proposed a new W temporary worker program for agricultural or nonagricultural workers. Employers would need to apply for labor certification from DOL and then file an application with DHS. Aliens unlawfully employed in the US since January 1, 2007, could participate in the program by applying for registration. W visas would be issued for up to two years and could be renewed indefinitely. The program would only take effect after DHS certified specified border security and enforcement measures. The Reform Act of 2007 (H.R. 1792) aimed to overhaul the H-2A agricultural worker program by streamlining the process of importing workers. Employers would include specified attestations in petitions filed with DHS, ensuring temporary employment, required benefits, wages, and efforts to recruit U.S. workers. Under H.R. 1792, H-2A employers would have been required to verify identity and employment eligibility of hired individuals through a DHS program. Changes included no longer being subject to adverse effect wage rate, paying workers prevailing wage rate or state minimum wage, and not providing housing. H-2A workers would have been admitted for up to 10 months, with possible extensions. H.R. 2413 proposed a new W seasonal agricultural worker program with monthly and annual numerical limitations on W visas by region. Employers would have to offer jobs to equally qualified U.S. workers and provide eligible workers. S. 2094, the Increasing American Wages and Benefits Act of 2007, introduced changes to the H-2B program including recruitment requirements, wage rate adjustments, and enforcement authority granted to the Department of Labor. It also placed requirements on employers and foreign labor contractors engaging in foreign labor contracting, with penalties for violations."
