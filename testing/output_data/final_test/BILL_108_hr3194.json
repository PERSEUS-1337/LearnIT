    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Diabetes Self-Management Training Act of 2003\". Congress finds that diabetes is the fifth leading cause of death in the United States, with over 17,000,000 Americans currently living with the disease. Diabetes is a significant public health threat, with direct and indirect healthcare costs totaling $132,000,000,000 in 2002. There are two forms of diabetes - type 1, caused by the body's inability to produce insulin, and type 2, where the body either doesn't make enough insulin or doesn't use it properly. Type 2 diabetes can be managed through diet, nutrition, and lifestyle changes, affecting 8 percent of the population age 20 and older. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes has tripled in the last 30 years, largely due to an increase in obesity. Lifestyle changes can reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 58 percent. Diabetes self-management training provides knowledge and skill training. Diabetes education involves providing knowledge and skill training to patients with diabetes to help them manage the condition effectively. Certified diabetes educators, such as nurses, dietitians, or pharmacists, specialize in assisting patients with developing self-management skills to prevent complications and secondary conditions. There are over 13,000 diabetes educators in the United States. Certified diabetes educators (CDEs) in the United States must have a relevant public health degree, 2 years of experience in diabetes self-management training, and provide 1000 hours of training. CDEs are the most skilled professionals for diabetes self-management compared to others who have less experience. Certified diabetes educators (CDEs) are the only group of healthcare professionals providing diabetes self-management training not recognized as providers by Medicare, preventing them from billing for services. Including CDEs as providers would improve access to care for diabetes patients. Certified diabetes educators (CDEs) are not recognized as Medicare providers for diabetes outpatient self-management training services, limiting their ability to bill for services. This recognition would enhance access to care for diabetes patients. Certified diabetes educators (CDEs) are now recognized as Medicare providers for diabetes outpatient self-management training services, allowing them to bill for services and enhancing access to care for diabetes patients. Certified diabetes educators (CDEs) are health care professionals specializing in helping individuals with diabetes develop self-management skills. They must be licensed in various healthcare fields or have advanced degrees in related areas, with at least 2 years of professional practice. Certified diabetes educators must have 2 years of professional practice experience, provide 1000 hours of diabetes self-management training within 5 years, and pass a certification exam. A study will be conducted to identify barriers in rural areas to becoming recognized diabetes education programs. Individuals with diabetes in rural areas face barriers accessing self-management training. A report must be submitted to Congress within a year of this Act's enactment. The effective date for the amendments is October 1, 2003."
