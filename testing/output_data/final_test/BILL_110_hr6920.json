    "content": "The Act titled \"Home Heating Loan Guarantee Act of 2008\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 contains findings related to the Act. The Congress finds that heating oil, propane, and natural gas are essential for heating 70 percent of US households. The cost of heating oil has nearly tripled over the last year and a half, with projections of $4.13 per gallon from October 2008 to March 2009. Increases in natural gas and propane prices this winter are projected, making it difficult for many homeowners to afford heating. In Northeastern Pennsylvania, the average homeowner using 950 gallons of heating oil will have to pay between $3,000 to $4,000 for heating. While the LIHEAP program provides assistance, it is not enough to meet the challenge, and Congress should increase its funding. Heating oil dealers are facing ongoing challenges due to the rising costs. Heating oil dealers are under significant stress due to price increases, leading to cash flow problems and potential supply disruptions if customers cannot make timely payments. SEC. 3. GUARANTEED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION LOANS TO HOME HEATING SUPPLIERS. Definitions for this section include the meaning of \"consumer\" as an individual or household acquiring goods or services from a home heating supplier, \"depository institution\" as defined in the Federal Reserve Act, \"eligible consumer\" as an individual or household with income not exceeding 150 percent of the national median household income, and \"qualified home heating loan\" as an unsecured consumer loan to an eligible individual or household. The \"heating loan\" is an unsecured consumer loan for paying a home heating supplier during the 2008-2009 season. The Secretary may guarantee qualified home heating loans made by depository institutions. A \"home heating supplier\" is a business distributing heating oil, propane, or natural gas to consumers. During the 2008-2009 home heating season, the Secretary can guarantee home heating loans to minimize disruptions in supply. The interest rate on guaranteed loans cannot exceed 5 percent, and origination fees are limited. The Secretary can guarantee home heating loans with limited fees and a maximum amount of $5,000. Repayment must be completed within a 2-year period, and additional terms may be established by the Secretary. The Secretary may establish additional terms and conditions for qualified home heating loans. Loan proceeds may be disbursed directly to a designated home heating supplier to prevent fraud, with consumers potentially required to cosign for protection. The Secretary can also conduct background checks or require verification by a depository institution as needed. The Secretary may establish criteria to assess the character and creditworthiness of home heating suppliers and consumers applying for loans. Regulations may limit the number of loans or total amounts guaranteed to customers of a single supplier. To expedite the program, a depository institution can self-certify consumer loans for qualified home heating loans, subject to demonstrating eligibility. The Secretary may enforce the requirements of the program by utilizing powers under existing laws, including section 5318 of title 31, to ensure compliance with regulations and obligations."
