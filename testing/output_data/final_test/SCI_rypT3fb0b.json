    "content": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) often have millions or billions of parameters, leading to high storage and computation costs. To address this, researchers have explored methods like sparsity-inducing regularizers and parameter sharing. A new approach called GrOWL encourages sparsity while determining which parameter groups should share values, reducing network complexity. GrOWL is a new approach that encourages sparsity in deep neural networks by identifying significant neurons and parameter groups that should share values. This two-stage procedure helps in dramatically compressing the network while maintaining performance. The GrOWL approach encourages sparsity in deep neural networks by identifying significant neurons and parameter groups to compress the network without loss on generalization performance. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have revolutionized machine learning by advancing state-of-the-art in various applications. Research has focused on regularization in DNN learning to reduce generalization error and tackle redundancy in parameterization. Weight decay is a common regularization method used in DNNs. Regularization methods like Lasso and group-Lasso have become standard tools in statistics and machine learning, including in deep learning. These methods help reduce the number of parameters in a DNN, leading to lower memory storage requirements and computational costs. The text discusses the drawbacks of Lasso regularization in the presence of highly correlated features in deep neural networks. It highlights the instability of the learning process and the tendency to select only one feature from each group of correlated covariates. In this work, the group-OWL (GrOWL) regularization is proposed for learning deep neural networks. GrOWL can identify groups of correlated features and set their parameters to be close or equal, promoting adaptive parameter sharing. This addresses the limitations of group-Lasso regularization in handling strongly correlated features. The GrOWL regularization in learning deep neural networks promotes parameter sparsity and group-clustering by enforcing weights to share a common value within the same cluster. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets show that GrOWL reduces the need for memory while maintaining accuracy, outperforming weight decay and group-Lasso regularization. GrOWL regularization reduces free parameters in DNNs without compromising accuracy. Weight sharing has been a technique for over 30 years, with recent interest in compressing DNN descriptions to reduce storage costs. Various methods exist to approximate or quantize learned weights post-training. Some methods to compress DNNs include replacing weight matrices with low-rank approximations, retraining network layers while seeking sparse transform matrices, using vector quantization, and network pruning techniques. Network pruning involves removing less important weights using information from the loss function's Hessian or by pruning parameters below a certain threshold. This approach can reduce the number of parameters significantly. Some methods for DNN compression involve weight sparsity regularization techniques like 1 and 0 regularization, Group-Lasso for seeking sparsity in neurons or other structures, and parameter sharing in convolutional DNNs. These approaches aim to reduce the network's size without sacrificing performance. In contrast to weight sparsity regularization techniques, GrOWL regularization aims to learn weight sharing from data rather than specifying it beforehand. Dropout methods are popular for preventing overfitting by reducing co-adaptation among neurons. Decorrelation is another technique used in deep learning pipelines. GrOWL regularization complements dropout and decorrelation techniques by addressing co-adaptation through tying weights of co-adapted nodes. It aims to learn weight sharing from data, unlike weight sparsity regularization methods. The GrOWL regularizer is a group version of the OWL regularizer, used in multiple/multi-task linear regression to encourage correlated features to form predictive clusters. It complements dropout and decorrelation techniques by tying weights of co-adapted nodes. The GrOWL regularizer induces sparsity and parameter tying in DNN learning. A feed-forward DNN can be represented as a function with nonlinear activation functions. DNN learning is an optimization problem with a regularizer, such as GrOWL penalties for each layer. Bias terms are not regularized. The GrOWL regularizer induces sparsity and parameter tying in DNN learning by treating weights associated with each input feature as a group. For fully connected layers, each group is a row of the weight matrix, while in convolutional layers, the weight matrix is reshaped and GrOWL is applied to each row to select relevant features. The GrOWL regularizer aims to reduce network complexity by pruning unimportant neurons and grouping rows with highly correlated features. This allows for further compression during retraining by enforcing parameters within each neuron to share the same values. Group-Lasso regularization is used to achieve group sparsity and eliminate redundant neurons in each layer. GrOWL regularization enforces parameter sharing within neurons to prune redundant neurons and group correlated features, achieving group sparsity in DNN layers. GrOWL is used to prune redundant neurons and group correlated features in DNN layers, while BID3 algorithm is employed to update parameter estimates. The BID3 algorithm computes the sum of squares of differences between components of matrices and vectors. It is shown that the prox of GrOWL can be computed using a matrix V, with corresponding rows u and v. For vectors in R N, prox \u2126 \u03bb (l) can be computed with O(n log n) cost using the pool adjacent violators algorithm for isotonic regression. In this paper, the proximal gradient algorithm is applied per epoch for training. GrOWL is a family of regularizers with different variants obtained by choosing weight sequences. The proposed choice involves linear decay for the first weights and equal values for the rest. The weights control the sparsity and clustering properties of GrOWL, with clustering encouraged among the largest coefficients. After training with the proximal gradient algorithm, GrOWL encourages clustering among the largest coefficients by grouping rows of the DNN into clusters based on pairwise similarity. Parameter sharing is enforced by replacing values with cluster averages, leading to compression of the network. After training with the proximal gradient algorithm, GrOWL encourages clustering among the largest coefficients by grouping rows of the DNN into clusters based on pairwise similarity. In the subsequent retraining process, rows close to each other are clustered together and forced to share common values by replacing them with cluster averages. The proposed method is evaluated on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets using different networks, comparing GrOWL with group-Lasso and weight decay in terms of compression vs accuracy trade-off. The training-retraining pipeline is used with various regularizers, and the effect is assessed using sparsity, compression rate, and parameter sharing metrics. All models are implemented using Tensorflow. In a synthetic data matrix X with block-diagonal covariance matrix \u03a3, clusters of correlated features are considered with a gap between them. Covariance within clusters is defined, and features from different clusters are independent. Parameters such as n, K, block size, and gap are set, and training examples are generated. A neural network with a single fully-connected layer is trained, and pairwise similarity matrices are analyzed using GrOWL with different parameters to encourage clustering among the largest coefficients. GrOWL encourages clustering among the largest coefficients, leading to more parameter tying than OSCAR. Smaller p values promote parameter tying among loose correlations. Weight decay also pushes parameters together, achieving better generalization than sparsity-inducing regularizers. GrOWL is compared with group-Lasso and weight decay for compression performance. Sparsity-inducing regularization is used to improve accuracy vs compression trade-off. MNIST dataset with images of handwritten digits is used. A network with 300 hidden units is trained for 300 epochs with momentum. The neural network is trained for 300 epochs with momentum and then retrained for an additional 100 epochs. The initial learning rate is 0.001, reduced by 0.96 every 10 epochs. GrOWL outperforms group-Lasso in identifying correlations, while weight decay does not induce sparsity. Results on MNIST dataset show compression rates for different regularization methods. The study compares different regularization methods on MNIST dataset for neural network compression. Results show that applying 2 regularization with group-Lasso or GrOWL leads to higher compression ratios without affecting accuracy. GrOWL (+2) achieves higher compression even with lower sparsity after initial training. GrOWL (+2) compresses the network more than group-Lasso (+2) by identifying significant correlations and selecting all correlated features. Group-Lasso only selects a subset of correlated features and suffers from randomly selecting them. The mean ratios of changed indices are 11.09%, 0.59%, 32.07%, and 0.62% for group-Lasso, GrOWL, group-Lasso+2, and GrOWL+2, respectively. The evaluation was done on a VGG-like BID33 architecture on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The VGG architecture BID33 is modified by replacing fully connected layers with smaller ones and adding batch normalization layers. Unlike BID38, dropout is not used. The network is trained with different regularizers for 150 epochs, then retrained for 50 epochs with a learning rate decay scheme. Sparsity and parameter sharing of VGG-16 on CIFAR-10 are reported, with results averaged over 5 runs. Weight decay and learning rate details are provided for the training and retraining phases. The study modified the VGG architecture by replacing fully connected layers with smaller ones and adding batch normalization layers. Different regularizers were used for training and retraining phases, with results summarized in Table 2. It was challenging to encourage parameter tying in the first 7 convolutional layers due to large feature maps. Cosine similarity analysis showed significant similarities between output channels of layers 10 and 11 compared to layer 6. The study found that layers 10 and 11 have more similarities in outputs compared to layer 6. GrOWL and weight decay do not tie associated weights in layer 1, maintaining input diversity. Weight decay in layers 9-13 encourages parameter tying but does not compress the network significantly. Pruning small weights after initial training with weight decay only achieves a compression ratio of around 3. The study found that layers 10 and 11 have more similarities in outputs compared to layer 6. GrOWL and weight decay do not tie associated weights in layer 1, maintaining input diversity. Pruning small weights after initial training with weight decay only achieves a compression ratio of around 3. However, GrOWL and group-Lasso effectively compress layers 3-7 with minor accuracy loss, showing an improved accuracy-memory trade-off on simple datasets like CIFAR-10. Further research is needed to explore this trade-off in larger networks on more complex datasets. The recent GrOWL regularizer achieves significant reduction of model complexity in DNN learning by pruning redundant parameters and tying highly correlated features. It can compress large DNNs by factors ranging from 11.4 to 14.5 with negligible loss in accuracy. GrOWL identifies correlation patterns close to input features, aiding in the interpretability of deep learning models. Additionally, it alleviates the negative effects of strong correlations by tying parameters together. GrOWL helps reduce model complexity in DNN learning by pruning redundant parameters and addressing strong correlations. Applying GrOWL to large DNNs shows a decreasing gap in accuracy vs memory trade-off. One potential future direction is to apply GrOWL within each neuron to encourage parameter sharing among smaller units. Various methods exist to compute the proximal mapping of OWL. In this paper, Algorithm 2 from BID5 is used for Affinity Propagation, a method that does not require the number of clusters as input, making it suitable for neural network compression. The input preference of Affinity Propagation determines the likelihood of each sample being chosen as an exemplar, affecting the number of clusters created. The paper also includes a table showing clustering results for VGG-16 on CIFAR-10 using the affinity propagation algorithm. The study utilizes Algorithm 3 to evaluate clustering accuracy, compression rate, and parameter sharing of layers 9-14 in neural network compression. Different preference values are used to cluster rows during initial training, followed by network retraining. Results show averages over 5 runs with varying preference values, showcasing the impact on clustering metrics."
