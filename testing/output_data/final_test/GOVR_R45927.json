    "content": "The U.S. financial system processes millions of transactions daily to facilitate purchases and payments through various cash substitutes like checks, drafts, and electronic funds transfers. The Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) has defined a payment system as a set of instruments, banking procedures, and interbank funds transfer systems that ensure money circulation and allow for the processing of financial transactions. Making a payment from a consumer's perspective is simple and quick, involving swiping a card, clicking a button, or tapping a mobile device for instant approval. The payment system involves three main parts: the sender initiates the payment through an end-user service, the payer's bank sends payment details to the recipient's bank, and the payment is completed when the two banks transfer funds through a settlement system. Different systems compete to provide these services. Retail payment services, operated by the private sector, enable consumers to make purchases, pay bills, withdraw cash, and send money to others. These services include debit cards, credit cards, checks, and prepaid debit cards. The Federal Reserve operates key bank-to-bank payment systems in the United States. The Federal Reserve in the United States operates key bank-to-bank payment systems, while private-sector organizations also handle clearing and settlement of bank-to-bank payments. Electronic payments have become more popular due to technological advancements, with debit card, credit card, and ACH transactions increasing significantly. Cash and check payments have declined as electronic transactions have risen. Cash payments declined by 4.4% annually, totaling 17.3 billion transactions worth $27 trillion in 2015. Cash transactions fell from 40.7% to 32.5% between 2012 and 2015, attributed to new payment technologies like Venmo, Zelle, and Cash App. Companies like PayPal, Square, and Stripe offer hardware and software for debit and credit card payments. Mobile payment services like Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Samsung Pay store payment information securely in a digital wallet. These services require linking to a bank account, debit card, or credit card for transactions to be settled. The use of new technology in payment systems raises questions about regulation related to cybersecurity, data privacy, industry competition, and consumer protection. Federal regulation of payments depends on whether they are provided by banks, which are subject to prudential regulation and supervision. Nonbank payment processors are also regulated, especially if they provide services to banks. Companies not serving banks may be regulated as money transmitters at the state level. Nonbank payment processors that do not serve banks may be regulated as money transmitters at the state level by state agencies and at the federal level by the Department of the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. They are subject to federal consumer protection regulation, anti-money laundering requirements, and various state licensing and consumer protection requirements. The debate over the effectiveness and efficiency of regulating companies providing retail payment services is a key issue. The current debate revolves around the regulatory regime for nonbank payment companies, with state regulators advocating for state-level regulation citing their expertise, while others argue for a federal role to streamline and standardize regulations. One proposed solution is to allow certain nonbank payment companies to be federally regulated through mechanisms like the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The OCC and state-level ILC charters with FDIC insurance are controversial mechanisms for payment firms to access Fed wholesale payment systems. Proponents argue they reduce regulatory burden, while opponents question the OCC's authority to charter such companies. ILC charters are controversial as they allow commercial firms to own banks, blurring the line between commerce and banking. State regulators have filed lawsuits to block these charters, with no companies applying so far due to legal uncertainty. The FDIC has not approved deposit insurance for a new ILC since 2006, and opponents argue that it exposes the economy to risks like imprudent underwriting and taxpayer exposure. Proponents of ILC charters argue that concerns about risks like imprudent underwriting and taxpayer exposure are overstated. They highlight potential benefits such as economies of scale, risk diversification, and customer convenience. Recently, three fintech companies applied for ILC deposit insurance, but two have withdrawn their applications. Square, a payment system provider, still has a pending application. All payment methods carry risks such as money theft or fraudulent payments. New payment technologies reduce certain risks but create others. For example, digital wallets on mobile devices can eliminate the need to carry physical cards that can be lost or stolen and can protect sensitive information at the point of sale through tokenization. However, identity thieves can steal card information using card reader skimmers, allowing thieves to open and use lines of credit in victims' names without their knowledge. The device itself can be compromised by malware, leading to fraudulent activities. Recent breaches at financial and nonfinancial companies have highlighted the risks of storing payment information on multiple platforms, leading to potential fraudulent charges. Policymakers are considering stricter cybersecurity measures, such as a federal breach notification law, cybersecurity standards, and increased penalties for companies that fail to protect consumer data. Payment systems collect detailed transaction information, raising concerns about consumer privacy and security. Payment data collected from transactions can reveal valuable information about consumers, including demographics and spending habits. This data is used for targeted marketing but also poses risks for fraud. There are concerns about consumer privacy and security, leading to calls for stricter cybersecurity measures and increased consumer control over their data. Electronic payments have led to the proliferation of personal information, raising policy questions about data usage and consumer understanding. Payment data has the potential to improve consumer outcomes through financial management tools. The use of tools to track payments, automate saving, and shop for financial products is beneficial for consumers. However, the question arises about how much access companies should have to individuals' information. Privacy policy disclosures may become more challenging as payments become faster with new technology, especially in the mobile environment where small screens make it difficult to read lengthy disclosure documents. Stakeholders emphasize the importance of clear privacy policies for informed decision-making. Consumer protection is crucial in the development of new retail payment systems. The Electronic Fund Transfer Act, enforced by the CFPB through Regulation E, provides important consumer safeguards for electronic fund transfers, including disclosures, limited liability for unauthorized transfers, and error resolution procedures. Stakeholders stress the need for clear privacy policies and consumer control over data usage in the digital environment. When developing a new faster payment system, Congress and federal regulators may need to consider compliance with relevant regulations such as Regulation E and the Expedited Funds Availability Act. Consumer protection rules may need to be updated to address potential risks and disputes in the new system. In 2015, the CFPB released consumer protection principles for faster payment systems, including consumer control over payments and fraud prevention. The CFPB released consumer protection principles for new faster payment systems in 2015, emphasizing consumer control, fraud prevention, and clear costs. Financial education, specifically digital financial literacy, may be necessary for consumers to adapt to new technology in financial products. This education is crucial to ensure inclusion of lower-income and older consumers in the new payment system. New retail payment options linked to bank accounts, internet-based, or requiring mobile devices may disadvantage consumers who rely on cash payments or lack easy internet/mobile access. The unbanked and underbanked may face participation limits to faster payments. However, innovation in technology can help marginalized groups access the financial system, with new payment products like pre-paid cards allowing cash to be used for online payments. Cost of internet/mobile data plans may limit underserved consumers' access to faster payment systems. Access to faster payment systems for underserved consumers may be limited by data plans, but as internet and mobile device access increases, barriers may decrease. A national survey found that a majority of underbanked and unbanked consumers have smartphones, with underbanked consumers more likely to use mobile banking services. Faster payment systems can benefit low-income consumers who need quick access to funds. Faster payments can benefit lower-income consumers who need immediate access to funds and may help them avoid overdraft fees. However, faster payment systems could also harm underserved households by debiting their accounts more quickly. Traditional payment systems tend to be highly concentrated due to economies of scale and network effects. New payment systems based on the internet may avoid market concentration seen in traditional systems. Entry of new services and companies has supported competition and consumer choice. Concerns arise with the entrance of large global technology companies into the industry. The entrance of large global technology companies like Google, Apple, Amazon, and Facebook into the payment industry raises concentration concerns due to their dominance in other industries and potential competition issues. This could also impact the regulatory framework and traditional banking activities. Real-time payments within the same end-user service can occur instantly by verifying sufficient funds, while payments involving parties outside the service require banking system processing. Settlement must happen in real-time for debit/credit card payments to merchants. The entry of tech giants into the payment industry raises concerns about market concentration and regulatory impact on traditional banking. The Fed announced plans to create a wholesale real-time payment system to improve the speed of end-user services, which are currently limited by existing payment systems. This initiative compares recent real-time payment efforts by the Fed, private sector, and abroad, and raises policy issues. The Federal Reserve, known as a \"banker's bank,\" was established to enhance the national banking system dominated by small, local banks. Initially focused on bank-to-bank check-clearing services, the Fed has expanded to offer various payment and settlement systems. It connects all banks' accounts at the Fed to meet reserve requirements. Despite private sector competition, the Fed regulates and operates payment systems like the Automated Clearing House (ACH) alongside private entities like the Electronic Payments Network. The Federal Reserve operates various payment and settlement systems, including the Automated Clearing House (ACH) for direct debit and credit messages. They also operate the Fedwire Funds Service and the National Settlement Service. The Clearing House Interbank Payment System (CHIPS) is a competing private-sector gross settlement system. The Fed plans to introduce an RTP system called FedNow in 2023 or 2024, which will be a real-time gross settlement service for faster payments in the United States. The Federal Reserve plans to introduce FedNow, a real-time gross settlement system for faster payments in the United States. FedNow will process individual payments within seconds and incorporate clearing functionality with necessary information for end-to-end payments. It will be available to all banks with a reserve account at the Fed, requiring immediate availability of transferred funds to customers upon settlement notification. Additionally, the Fed proposed a liquidity management tool for transfers between Federal Reserve accounts to support real-time interbank settlement services. The Federal Reserve is exploring expanding Fedwire Funds Service and the National Settlement Service for 24x7x365 real-time gross settlement. Private-sector initiatives, like the Clearing House's RTP network, are also working on faster payment solutions with real-time settlement. The Federal Reserve is working on expanding real-time gross settlement services, while private-sector initiatives like the Clearing House's RTP network are also developing faster payment solutions. The Fed aims to reach nearly all U.S. transaction accounts with faster payments in the next few years, with joint standards and governance frameworks being established to promote interoperability between systems. Fed Chair Jerome Powell notes that the U.S. lags behind other countries in offering real-time payments to the public, which would benefit businesses and consumers, especially with the increasing use of online payments. The Federal Reserve is considering entering the real-time payment (RTP) market to improve the speed of fund transfers, especially with the rise of online and mobile payments. There is a debate on whether Fed involvement in RTP is beneficial, with considerations on cost recovery, public benefits, and unique services that other providers cannot offer. Stakeholders are divided over the introduction of FedNow, with concerns about its impact on private-sector initiatives and potential monopolistic behavior in payment systems. The Treasury Department supports Fed involvement to aid retail-level initiatives, while small banks fear negative consequences for financial institutions and customers accessing real-time payments. The Justice Department approved the Clearing House's RTP system in 2017. The debate over having a single provider or multiple providers for natural monopolies remains unclear. Competition between the Fed and private sector in RTPs may impact innovation and cost structures. The Fed's involvement in Real-Time Payments (RTP) could potentially delay universal adoption if banks wait for FedNow instead of joining the Clearing House's network. Interoperability between different payment systems is a challenge, but competition may improve the ability for institutions to exchange funds. The technology involved in RTP may make interoperability more difficult between competing Fed and Clearing House systems. The Fed did not commit to ensure interoperability but stated it as a desirable goal. The Clearing House has attempted to address equity concerns by pledging equal access to its system for all banks, regardless of size. Security coordination across competing systems could be challenging, but systems may compete by offering better security features. The Fed argues that having competing RTP systems reduces operational and systemic risks compared to a single provider system. The Fed states that participating banks would continue to serve as a primary line of defense against fraudulent transactions under FedNow. The Fed is exposed to default risk due to its provision of intraday and overnight credit when banks use its payment and settlement systems. The time lag between payment and settlement can cause mismatches in amounts, leading the Fed to extend intraday credit to avoid settlement. The Fed extends intraday credit to avoid settlement failures, with daily overdrafts peaking during the financial crisis. Introducing real-time payments could increase the use of intraday credit. The Fed may need to extend availability of intraday credit to off-hours under FedNow. Eliminating intraday credit could reduce financial stability, but private sector real-time payments could align with existing regulatory framework. Fed regulates private payment systems for risk management and transparency, but not pricing. RTPs could alleviate some existing risks. Real-time payments (RTP) could alleviate existing risks but pose new ones, requiring active liquidity management. A private RTP system could be designated as systemically important under the Dodd-Frank Act to address systemic risk concerns. The Financial Stability Oversight Council can designate a payment system as systemically important to prevent liquidity or credit problems spreading among financial institutions. The Federal Reserve has supervisory and enforcement powers over Financial Market Utilities (FMUs) like the Clearing House Interbank Payments System to ensure regulatory standards are met and prevent threats to the U.S. financial system. Policymakers may need to consider whether systemic risk concerns are better addressed through Fed operation of payment and settlement systems or regulation of private systems."
