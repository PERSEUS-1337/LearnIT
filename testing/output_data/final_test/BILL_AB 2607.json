    "title": "AB 2607",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 18150 of the Penal Code is amended to allow certain individuals to file a petition for a gun violence restraining order, restricting the subject from possessing firearms or ammunition. Immediate family members, employers, mental health workers, school employees, or law enforcement officers can request this order without being required to do so. A court may issue an ex parte gun violence restraining order based on a petition showing a significant likelihood that the subject poses a danger by having access to firearms, and that the order is necessary to prevent harm. An affidavit supporting a petition for an ex parte gun violence restraining order must present facts establishing the grounds for the petition. The order must be issued or denied on the same day the petition is submitted, unless filed too late for review, in which case it will be decided the next judicial business day. Section 18170 of the Penal Code is amended accordingly. Section 18170 of the Penal Code is amended to allow certain individuals to request a gun violence restraining order for one year. An immediate family member, employer, coworker, mental health worker, school employee, or law enforcement officer can make the request. Section 18190 of the Penal Code allows specific individuals to request a renewal of a gun violence restraining order within three months before it expires. This includes immediate family members, employers, coworkers, mental health workers, school employees, and law enforcement officers. The request can be made without the need to seek a gun violence restraining order. A court may renew a gun violence restraining order if clear and convincing evidence shows continued risk for violence. The petitioner must prove the facts outlined in the order, and if successful, the order will be renewed. The renewal of a gun violence restraining order issued under this section lasts for one year and can be terminated or renewed by court order. The renewed order must include the information specified in Section 18180."
