    "content": "The United States Constitution, as amended, outlines the structure of the federal government, legal authorities, and restrictions on those authorities. Judicial interpretation of the Constitution has evolved over time, raising concerns about the validity of decisions. Theories of constitutional interpretation aim to determine how the Constitution's meaning should be applied to specific issues. The United States Constitution outlines the structure of the federal government and legal authorities. Constitutional interpretation theories aim to apply the Constitution's meaning to specific issues. Debate exists on whether a unified theory is necessary for all constitutional analysis. Some provisions may require straightforward interpretation, while others, like the Fourteenth Amendment, may need external information for analysis. Some scholars argue that a unified constitutional interpretive theory may not be suitable for all provisions of the Constitution. There is no definitive list of constitutional theories, and judges use various tools of interpretation based on the issue at hand. Even when applying the same method, different judges may reach dramatically different conclusions. For this report, it is assumed that judges and commentators are comfortable using the plain meaning of the text and historical documents to interpret constitutional provisions. While originalism is often associated with referencing historical documents, there is no theory that rejects their use. Other historical sources like dictionaries are also used in constitutional interpretation. Various theories of constitutional interpretation diverge from originalism when referencing documents or sources outside of the Constitution, such as foreign law to interpret terms like \"cruel and unusual punishment.\" While not a primary tool, the use of such sources has been criticized for moving beyond legitimate sources for constitutional interpretation. The separation between \"originalist\" and other theories of constitutional interpretation arises when originalists' reference sources lack clarity on the contemporaneous meaning of a constitutional provision. This issue is most prevalent with provisions subject to varying levels of generality, impacting constitutional interpretation significantly. For example, the Supreme Court has recognized decisions on procreation and child-rearing as \"fundamental rights\" under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In Michael H. v. Gerald D., the biological father was denied visitation rights under a California law that presumed a child born into a marriage belonged to both parents. Justice Scalia rejected the claim of a constitutionally protected liberty interest in the relationship with the child, stating it was not fundamental. Justice Brennan argued for a more generalized liberty interest in family relationships under the Due Process Clause. Justice Scalia advocated referring to specific traditions when determining claimed liberty interests. The Anglo-American legal system values judicial precedent, with stare decisis playing a crucial role in constitutional analysis. The Supreme Court may overturn long-held decisions when other considerations outweigh the value of legal precedent. The overturning of long-held decisions is a subject of debate among constitutional theorists. Federal court cases not linked to originalist doctrine often focus on theories that emphasize historically based moral values, such as fundamental rights theories. These theories justify the application of certain rights, like free speech and liberty interests, to states through incorporation via the Fourteenth Amendment. The report will focus on selected originalist theories and major theories addressing perceived problems with originalism. It will examine original intent and original meaning, criticism of these schools, the role of judicial precedent and pragmatism in constitutional interpretation, and theories justifying heightened constitutional protections for fundamental rights. Constitutional interpretation involves discerning the intended mode of interpretation by the drafters and ratifiers of the Constitution. There is no explicit provision in the Constitution dictating the principles of interpretation, and it is unclear which method of interpretation was favored by the Founding Fathers. Different doctrines of legal analysis offered varying templates for interpretation, with at least two prominent methods at the time of the Constitution's passage, distinguished by their reliance on precedence. The Founding Fathers were likely influenced by the Protestant tradition of strict textual interpretation and the English common law tradition of discerning intent when interpreting the Constitution. The complex history of the Constitution's ratification makes applying these principles challenging. The application of interpreting the Constitution based on the intent of the drafters, ratifiers, and the people of the United States is complex and challenging. This includes distinguishing between subjective and objective intent, with the latter being conveyed by the language used in the Constitution. The Founding Fathers likely preferred the objective intent of constitutional text to control, despite the novelty of legal interpretation at the time. They understood the need for judicial construction due to unforeseen situations. During the ratification process, debates arose between Federalists and Anti-Federalists over the interpretation of the Constitution. Anti-Federalists argued that broad language in the Constitution would give too much power to the Supreme Court, allowing the federal government to undermine states and individuals. Federalists countered that the document was not overly broad and would be interpreted under common law principles. The Federalists argued that the Constitution should be interpreted based on the intent of the people, represented by state conventions, and not the subjective intent of the drafters. They believed in interpreting the Constitution in line with its \"common sense\" meaning and simple inferences. The Constitution's indeterminacy was seen as necessary, as all compositions are liable to ambiguity. These debates during ratification continue to be relevant today, especially regarding interpreting the Constitution based on its provisions. The theory of originalism, also known as intentionalism, asserts that laws should be applied based on the subjective intent of the Constitution's authors, such as the Founding Fathers. Judge Robert Bork was an early proponent of intentionalism, recognizing the challenges of applying an original intent standard due to the problem of generality. Judge Bork proposed that intentionalist judges should focus on identifying the core value intended by the framers to protect constitutional freedoms, allowing for the application of the Constitution to unforeseen situations while maintaining the original intent. An example is interpreting \"equal protection\" in the Fourteenth Amendment. Judge Bork proposed a neutral application of the Fourteenth Amendment's \"equal protection\" clause to enforce racial equality, regardless of the race being discriminated against. This approach could challenge decisions like Grutter v. Bollinger, which upheld affirmative action, by focusing on judicial grounds rather than policy preferences. Judge Bork argues that the Equal Protection Clause should not extend to laws discriminating based on gender, as the drafters of the Fourteenth Amendment did not intend for it to cover such cases. He questions the legitimacy of extending constitutional protections beyond race and ethnicity, despite the broadly written language of the Fourteenth Amendment. Judge Bork criticizes the Court for not clarifying why certain groups are included under the Equal Protection Clause. He argues that interpreting the Constitution should be based on original intent, but this theory is challenged due to the diverse intentions of the framers and the idea that future generations should interpret the Constitution differently. The doctrine of original intent in interpreting the Constitution was criticized for its focus on subjective intent. Instead, the emphasis shifted to seeking the objective meaning of the terms used, known as the doctrine of objective \"original meaning.\" This approach highlights understanding the Constitution as a reasonable person would have interpreted it. Justice Scalia advocated for analyzing the original meaning of the text, rather than the drafters' intentions. The theory of original meaning emphasizes understanding the Constitution as a reasonable person in the historical period would have interpreted it. It involves studying contemporaneous dictionaries and legal sources to determine the established meanings of phrases like \"due process\" and \"freedom of the press\" in English law. Justice Scalia supported analyzing the original meaning of the text over the drafters' intentions. The theory of originalism, as explained by Justice Scalia, focuses on interpreting the Constitution based on the original meaning of its words at the time of promulgation. This approach disregards the intent of the framers and instead looks at the understood meaning of the words by the people at that time. It aims to link constitutional interpretation to the historical era in which it was passed, rather than allowing for evolving interpretations. The Founding Fathers may have expected the Constitution to evolve, including the interpretation of phrases like \"cruel and unusual punishment.\" Originalism suggests that the meaning of constitutional phrases should remain historically fixed, even if they were intended to be flexible. This raises the question of how to interpret phrases that may have been meant to evolve over time. The text discusses the ambiguity in constitutional interpretation, including the broad phrases that may imply a presumption of liberty and the debate over whether constitutional provisions should be interpreted anew each time or become part of constitutional law through judicial interpretations. The Founding Fathers had different models of legal interpretation available to them, with English courts operating under the common law tradition. This tradition allows for consistent legal interpretation and social stability, but may not align strictly with originalism. The Supreme Court can narrow or overrule precedent, which is compatible with originalist theory. In practice, litigants before the Supreme Court generally address recent constitutional precedent, not the most dated. The length and depth of constitutional precedence for a recent case may increase its stature, while an older case with little modern application is vulnerable to being overturned. Some suggest tension between originalism and stare decisis due to readjustments in interpreting the Constitution and affecting government function. The Constitution's original understanding should be used as a starting point for judges, but they should also consider how generations of interpretation have shaped its application. The Fourteenth Amendment, particularly the Privileges or Immunities Clause, illustrates the evolution of constitutional interpretation to address new situations and protect citizens' rights. The Privileges or Immunities Clause, intended to protect state citizens' rights, was undermined by the Slaughterhouse Cases. Substantive individual rights against state encroachment were instead developed under the Due Process Clause. The Supreme Court is unlikely to revisit this debate, posing a challenge for originalism in accounting for fundamental rights analysis in the Constitution. The concept of fundamental rights, including \"fundamental rights,\" \"privacy rights,\" \"liberty interests,\" and \"incorporated rights,\" has evolved under the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment. These rights are considered so essential that any legislation infringing on them must undergo close scrutiny by the courts. This analysis, criticized for being based on natural law rather than constitutional text, has led to significant constitutional rulings. Fundamental rights theories emphasize specific constitutional values. The concept of fundamental rights, including \"privacy rights\" and \"liberty interests,\" has evolved under the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment. These theories focus on attributes of personhood with constitutional significance, such as intimate association like marriage. The constitutional justifications for fundamental rights analysis vary, with some commentators emphasizing consensus and conventional morality theories. This line of adjudication resembles common law statutory adjudication, considering the Constitution in the context of principles derived from common public morality. The process of case-by-case judicial evaluation and adherence to precedence in constitutional interpretation resembles common law principles derived from public morality. This theory of analysis differs significantly from originalism and raises questions about the possibility of a unified theory of constitutional interpretation. Portions of the Constitution may not be easily interpreted due to varying levels of generality. The Anglo-American system of stare decisis can lead to different interpretations of constitutional issues. Historical documents relevant to the era of the Constitution's drafting can be persuasive in some cases, but their value may be questioned in cases where the meaning of a constitutional term was not intended to be fixed in time."
