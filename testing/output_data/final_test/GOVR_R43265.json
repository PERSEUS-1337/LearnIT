    "content": "The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA; P.L. 105-220) is the primary federal program supporting workforce development. It includes four main titles: Title I focuses on job training and services for unemployed individuals, Title II on adult education and literacy, and Title III on workforce development. Title III of the Workforce Investment Act integrates the U.S. Employment Service into the One-Stop system. Title IV amends the Rehabilitation Act to provide services for individuals with disabilities. Authorization for WIA programs expired in FY2003, leading to funding through annual appropriations. Reauthorization bills were passed in the 108th and 109th Congresses, but no further action was taken. In the 113th Congress, H.R. 803 was ordered reported by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. In the 113th Congress, the House Committee on Education and the Workforce ordered reported H.R. 803, the SKILLS Act, introduced by Representative Virginia Foxx. The bill was debated and passed in the House of Representatives. In the Senate, Senators introduced S. 1356, the Workforce Investment Act of 2013, which was ordered reported by the HELP Committee. The report summarizes the major features of S. 1356, the Workforce Investment Act of 2013, comparing it to current law. It covers provisions for workforce investment systems, state formula grants, planning procedures, and the One-Stop delivery system. WIA established the One-Stop delivery system to coordinate employment programs for adults, youth, and targeted subpopulations. The tables in the report outline the provisions of Title II and Title III of WIA and S. 1356, focusing on adult education, literacy activities, and amendments to the Wagner-Peyser Act of 1933. Title IV of WIA and S. 1356 address changes to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, specifically related to employment services for individuals with disabilities. The Workforce Investment Act establishes the One-Stop delivery system for state and local training and employment activities. S. 1356 would maintain the existing One-Stop delivery system for employment and training services but would change the governing structure, performance accountability, and some programs. It would split the current Title I into a new Title I (system alignment and governance) and a new Title II (programs). S. 1356 would maintain the One-Stop system for workforce development programs and make adjustments to increase coordination and alignment. It would add TANF as a required partner, rename WIBs to WDBs, require a Unified State Plan for core programs, allow a Combined State Plan, expand demonstration activities, and emphasize collaborative partnerships to improve outcomes for individuals with barriers to employment. S. 1356 aims to improve outcomes for individuals with barriers to employment by establishing Workforce Innovation and Replication Grants (WIRG) and Youth Innovation and Replication Grants (YIRG). It authorizes appropriations for various workforce programs and maintains the One-Stop system while increasing coordination and alignment. S. 1356 would modify formula grant programs for WIA Youth, Adult, and Dislocated Worker Activities by changing factors and weights, including new definitions for \"disadvantaged youth\" and \"disadvantaged adult\" based on income levels. S. 1356 would add provisions for hold harmless and stop gain to prevent large funding losses or gains. It would also increase the transfer percentage between Adult and Dislocated programs to 100% and allow local Workforce Development Boards to choose how to fund One-Stop center infrastructure. S. 1356 would rename Workforce Investment Board to Workforce Development Board, maintain business majority requirement, and change membership provisions to include 20% representation of the workforce. It would also add functions for state WDBs to align programs, develop career pathways, and expand industry partnerships. S. 1356 aims to enhance workforce development by requiring expanded regional economic analysis, engagement with local employers, and promotion of best practices. It also mandates qualifications for directors of state and local Workforce Development Boards and establishes state performance accountability measures. The bill aims to improve workforce development by implementing state performance accountability measures, including indicators such as employment rates, earnings, credential attainment, and skill gains for program participants. S. 1356 aims to establish indicators of performance for various workforce programs under WIA, including Adult and Dislocated Worker grants, national programs, adult education, Employment Service, and Vocational Rehabilitation. It also introduces a statistical model to adjust performance levels based on economic conditions and population characteristics. Additionally, the bill requires states to submit a Unified State Plan every four years, combining multiple programs into a single planning process. S. 1356 introduces a Unified State Plan (USP) that covers core workforce programs every four years, including strategic and operational planning elements. States can also submit a Combined State Plan (CSP) for core and partner programs in the One-Stop system. S. 1356 would increase funding for out-of-school youth to 75% and add new allowable activities like industry sector strategies and incumbent worker training. It also requires local areas to designate a business liaison and increases the allowable wage reimbursement rate for on-the-job training. The Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA) supports basic education for out-of-school adults, including secondary education and English language training. Approximately 95% of AEFLA funding is allocated to states through formula grants. The act allows for an increase in the allowable wage reimbursement rate for on-the-job training and the addition of local activities related to coordinating with non-WIA programs and developing sector strategies. The requirement for sequences of services has been removed, allowing individuals to receive training without core or intensive services if deemed ready by a One-Stop operator. The Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA) allocates 95% of its funding to states through formula grants. States must subgrant most of these funds to local providers for educational services. S. 1356 would authorize necessary sums for FY2014-FY2018, maintaining a 2% set-aside for National Activities and repealing other set-asides. AEFLA grantees report educational progress and outcomes for participants. S. 1356 would amend AEFLA to introduce new common performance metrics focusing on employment, earnings, and credential attainment across all programs. Reporting educational progress without credential attainment would no longer be required. States awarding subgrants must consider providers' ability to meet these new metrics and provide integrated education and training. Additionally, the bill would increase state grant funds for leadership activities and require their use to enhance adult education alignment with employment and training activities. S. 1356 would amend AEFLA to introduce new common performance metrics focusing on employment, earnings, and credential attainment across all programs. It would create a new set-aside of 12% of state grant funds for English Language-Civics grants based on recent levels of authorized immigration to the state. The bill also makes amendments to the Wagner-Peyser Act of 1933, which authorizes the Employment Service (ES) as a central component of One-Stop delivery systems. The ES office is a required partner in the One-Stop delivery system, facilitating the match between job seekers and employers. S. 1356 proposes changes such as colocation of ES offices with One-Stop centers, a grant program for professional development, and the establishment of a Workforce Information Advisory Council to improve labor market information. The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 authorizes programs supporting employment for individuals with disabilities, including Vocational Rehabilitation grants to states. S. 1356 would authorize funding for programs under the Act from FY2014 to FY2018. In FY2013, $3.4 billion was appropriated, with $3.1 billion for VR grants. S. 1356 proposes three new purposes under the Act. The bill S. 1356 proposes changes to the Rehabilitation Act to emphasize competitive integrated employment for individuals with disabilities, increase regulation of subminimum wage employers, and encourage transition to competitive integrated employment. It also aims to enhance employment opportunities by involving employers in the process. S. 1356 would amend the Rehabilitation Act to allow states to use VR funds for outreach and services to employers, promote competitive integrated employment, reauthorize Projects with Industry grants, and create a public education campaign on hiring individuals with disabilities. It also focuses on services for youth and students with disabilities transitioning to postsecondary education or competitive integrated employment. Each state would need to reserve 15% of VR grants for pre-employment transition services. The bill S. 1356 aims to reserve 15% of state VR grants for pre-employment transition services for youth with disabilities and 50% of supported employment state grant funding for the same group. It also proposes creating pre-employment transition coordinators at national and local levels. Additionally, the bill suggests transferring the administration of programs authorized by the Rehabilitation Act to new departments, such as the Department of Labor and the Department of Health and Human Services. Title V of the Workforce Investment Act of 2013, S. 1356, would amend the seven titles of the Rehabilitation Act and add an eighth title. The accompanying table refers to titles of the Rehabilitation Act, not titles of WIA."
