Congress finds that certain private lands adjacent to Montezuma Castle National Monument in Arizona and inholdings in Coconino National Forest are desirable for Federal acquisition to protect important values. Additionally, 108 acres of land in Tonto National Forest occupied by residential cabins since the 1950s are suitable for transfer to cabin owners in exchange for lands with higher potential. The purpose of this Act is to authorize, facilitate, and expedite land exchanges to transfer encumbered lands to cabin owners in exchange for higher public use value lands. The Secretary of Agriculture has been offered approximately 495 acres of non-Federal land known as the Q Ranch within the Tonto National Forest to increase National Forest management efficiency and promote public access and enjoyment.
