    "content": "The \"Meth Mouth Correctional Costs and Reentry Support Act\" includes sections on findings, definitions, and grants for dental care offender reentry projects. It aims to address methamphetamine-related oral health costs in jails and prisons. The Congress finds that the methamphetamine epidemic has led to a significant need for costly dental care among prisoners, with a high percentage suffering from \"meth mouth.\" Approximately 40% of correctional dental spending is used to repair or remove teeth damaged by methamphetamine use. Around 600,000 inmates are released from Federal and State prisons annually, and ex-offenders with good health have better success in reintegrating into society and avoiding re-incarceration. There is a lack of comprehensive studies on the oral health of inmates and the provision of dental care in prisons. The Act aims to investigate and address the oral health of inmates in correctional facilities, particularly focusing on the impact of methamphetamine use on dental care. It also seeks to ensure that dental programs in prisons are adequately funded and staffed, and that oral health is considered in prisoner reentry initiatives by the Department of Justice. The terms \"correctional facility\" and \"detention facility\" refer to places for confining or rehabilitating offenders. An \"inmate\" is a person incarcerated or detained for criminal offenses. \"Meth mouth\" is severe oral decay linked to methamphetamine use. \"Offender reentry\" is the process of reintegrating individuals into society after incarceration. Offender reentry is the process of reintegrating individuals into society after incarceration in a prison, jail, or detention facility. SEC. 4.
