    "content": "Section 1 introduces a new provision in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 regarding the coordination of collection of domestic service employment taxes with collection of income taxes. The new provision in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 states that returns for domestic service employment taxes are to be filed on a calendar year basis by the 15th day of the fourth month following the employer's taxable year. No deposit requirements apply to these taxes. Domestic service employment taxes are subject to estimated tax provisions for the employer's taxable year. The provision in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 requires returns for domestic service employment taxes to be filed on a calendar year basis by the 15th day of the fourth month following the employer's taxable year. Adjustments are made in the application of section 6654(d)(2) for the amount treated as tax, with a transitional rule for taxable years beginning in 1993. Domestic service employment taxes include taxes imposed on remuneration for domestic service in a private home under chapter 21 or 23. The Internal Revenue Code requires returns for domestic service employment taxes to be filed on a calendar year basis. The term 'domestic service in a private home of the employer' excludes certain services. Regulations may be prescribed to carry out the purposes of this section. The Internal Revenue Code allows for regulations to be established regarding domestic service employment taxes, treating them as taxes under chapter 1 for coordination with domestic employers' income taxes. The Secretary is authorized to enter agreements with states to collect their unemployment taxes on domestic service remuneration, treating them as domestic service employment taxes for this purpose. Amounts collected under such agreements are transferred to the state account. The Secretary can transfer amounts collected under agreements with states for unemployment taxes on domestic service remuneration to the state's account in the Unemployment Trust Fund. This amount is treated as a tax imposed by chapter 23 for subtitle F purposes. The term 'State' is defined as per section 3306(j)(1). The amendments in Sec. 3510 coordinate the collection of domestic service employment taxes with income taxes, effective for remuneration paid after December 31, 1993. The Secretary of the Treasury will provide information to employers on federal tax obligations for employees in private homes, including potential state law obligations. Additionally, Sec. 2 establishes a threshold requirement for Social Security taxes. Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code include changes to the treatment of cash remuneration for domestic service in private homes. A new applicable dollar threshold is introduced for domestic employees. These amendments aim to coordinate the collection of domestic service employment taxes with income taxes, effective after December 31, 1993. The Secretary of the Treasury will provide guidance on federal tax obligations for employers of domestic workers. The applicable dollar threshold for domestic employees is set at $800, to be adjusted annually. Employment of domestic employees aged 16 and under is excluded from coverage under the Internal Revenue Code. The Internal Revenue Code is amended to exclude domestic service in a private home of the employer performed by individuals aged 16 and under during any portion of the year. Conforming amendments are made to change \"calendar quarter\" to \"calendar year\" and replace \"$50\" with the applicable dollar threshold for the year. This amendment aligns with the exclusion of domestic employees aged 16 and under from coverage under the Social Security Act. The Social Security Act is amended to exclude cash remuneration paid by an employer to an employee for domestic service in a private home if the payment is below the applicable dollar threshold for the year. Additionally, individuals aged 16 and under working as domestic employees are excluded from coverage under the Act. The Social Security Act is amended to exclude cash remuneration paid by an employer to an employee for domestic service in a private home if the payment is below the applicable dollar threshold for the year.
