    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Asthmatic Schoolchildren's Treatment and Health Management Act of 2004\". Congress finds that asthma is a chronic condition requiring ongoing medical intervention. In 2001, 20.3 million Americans had asthma, including 6.3 million children under 18. The prevalence of asthma is higher among African-American children, with 26% of asthma deaths occurring in this population. In 2000, there were 1.8 million asthma-related emergency department visits and 465,000 hospitalizations, resulting in 4,487 deaths, including 223 children. In 2000, 4,487 people died from asthma, including 223 children. Asthma causes approximately 14,000,000 missed school days annually and results in an estimated $1,000,000,000 loss in productivity for working parents of children with asthma. Some states have legislation protecting children's rights to carry and self-administer asthma inhalers and epinephrine auto-injectors, but tragic refusals by schools have led to deaths and legal action. Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction that can be fatal, especially in asthma patients. It is crucial for schools to have policies in place for the correct use of asthma inhalers and epinephrine auto-injectors to prevent complications and improve health outcomes. Patients at risk of anaphylaxis should carry an epinephrine auto-injector at all times. An increasing number of students and school staff have life-threatening allergies, requiring them to carry an epinephrine auto-injector at all times for prompt medical intervention in case of anaphylaxis. Preference for states allowing students to self-administer medication for asthma and anaphylaxis. Amendments to the Public Health Service Act give preference to states that allow students to self-administer medication for asthma and anaphylaxis in schools. Amendments to the Public Health Service Act prioritize states that permit students to self-administer asthma and anaphylaxis medication at school if certain conditions are met. Amendments to the Public Health Service Act allow students to possess and use their asthma or anaphylaxis medication at school and school-sponsored activities if certain conditions are met, including completion of required documentation by the parent or guardian. The amendments to the Public Health Service Act allow students to possess and use their asthma or anaphylaxis medication at school and school-sponsored activities. Authorization must be renewed each school year by the parent or guardian, and backup medication provided by the parent must be kept at the school for immediate student access. The State must require that information be kept on file at the student's school for immediate access in case of an asthma or anaphylaxis emergency. This subsection does not affect liability under any other law. The terms 'health care practitioner', 'medication', and 'self-administration' are defined in accordance with specific sections of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for the purposes of student asthma or anaphylaxis medication use in schools. The amendments made by this section apply to grants given 9 months after the enactment of this Act, for medication use in schools as directed by a health care practitioner. Congress commends the CDC for creating strategies to address asthma in schools and encourages all schools to adopt these policies to meet the needs of their students."
