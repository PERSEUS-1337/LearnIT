    "content": "The Act is titled the \"American Land Sovereignty Protection Act\" and its purpose is outlined in Section 2. Congress finds that the power to govern US property is vested in Congress under the Constitution. Some international property designations require congressional approval, such as those under the US Biosphere Reserve Program. The National Man and Biosphere Committee lacks legislative authorization from Congress, potentially impacting nearby non-Federal property use and value. State sovereignty is crucial in our Federal system, protecting against power concentration. Private property rights are vital for freedom protection. US actions designating property under international agreements may conflict with congressional responsibilities and State powers. Presidential application of international agreements to US-owned property raises concerns. The Act aims to reaffirm Congress's authority over international agreements concerning US property, protect State powers, and ensure no loss of individual rights due to Federal actions. The curr_chunk states that the purpose of the agreement is to impose restrictions on property use, protect private interests from diminishment due to Federal actions, and provide a process for the US to designate property under international agreements. SEC. 3. CLARIFICATION OF CONGRESSIONAL ROLE IN WORLD HERITAGE SITE LISTING. Amends Section 401 of the National Historic Preservation Act Amendments of 1980 to clarify the participation of the United States in designating property under international agreements. The text chunk discusses amendments to the National Historic Preservation Act regarding the Secretary of the Interior's role in nominating properties to the World Heritage Committee. Amendments to the National Historic Preservation Act require the Secretary of the Interior to follow specific requirements when nominating properties to the World Heritage Committee. This includes publishing a proposed nomination in the Federal Register and conducting a proceeding under relevant sections of the United States Code. The Secretary of the Interior must follow specific requirements when nominating properties to the World Heritage Committee, including considering natural resources and impacts on existing uses within 10 miles of the property. Commercially viable uses must be determined for the nominated property. The Secretary must ensure that the property nominated for the World Heritage List does not adversely affect nearby properties. A report must be submitted to Congress outlining the necessity for inclusion and proposing legislation for nomination. Authorization by Congress is required for the nomination. The Secretary can object to the inclusion of a property on the list. The Secretary can object to the inclusion of a property on the World Heritage in Danger list unless Congress authorizes it after a report is submitted. Land management decisions for Federal or State land remain the responsibility of the administering agency. SEC. 4. PROHIBITION AND TERMINATION OF UNAUTHORIZED UNITED NATIONS BIOSPHERE RESERVES. This section amends Title IV of the National Historic Preservation Act Amendments of 1980 by adding a prohibition and termination clause for unauthorized United Nations Biosphere Reserves. No Federal official can nominate US property for designation as a Biosphere Reserve under the UN Man and Biosphere Program without the Secretary of State publishing a proposed nomination and conducting a proceeding. The Secretary must consider natural resources and impacts within 10 miles of the property. The Secretary of State must assess the impact of designating a property as a Biosphere Reserve on existing and future uses within 10 miles. It must be determined that commercially viable uses will not be negatively affected. A report containing specific information must be submitted to Congress. The Secretary of State must object to designating US property as a Biosphere Reserve under the Man and Biosphere Program unless authorized by Congress and specific criteria are met. Properties designated as Biosphere Reserves before the enactment of this section will terminate unless authorized by a law enacted after this section and before December 31, 2003, and meet specific criteria. The designation of Biosphere Reserves ensures that nearby non-Federal property use is not restricted. Land management decisions for Federal or State land remain the responsibility of the administering agency. SEC. 5. TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS. Title IV of the National Historic Preservation Act Amendments of 1980 is amended to change references to committees and clarify mitigation of adverse effects of federal undertakings outside the United States."
