In 2018, an estimated 175 million workers paid FICA or SECA taxes on their wages and self-employment income. Both employers and employees contribute taxes at the FICA rate, while SECA taxes are paid by the self-employed. The taxes include OASI, DI, and HI components, with OASDI tax levied on earnings up to $128,400 in 2018. The HI tax is levied on all earnings, and the base is raised whenever a cost-of-living adjustment is granted to Social Security recipients. The taxable earnings base limits the amount of wages used for Social Security contributions. Workers above the limit pay the same amount in payroll taxes. In 2018, the limit was $128,400, with a maximum contribution of $7,961 for wage workers and $15,922 for self-employed individuals. The base also sets a ceiling on benefit calculations and payouts. According to SSA statistics, in 2015, 6.3% of workers earned above the taxable earnings base, with most being men. Roughly 9% of male workers and 3% of female workers had earnings above the maximum. The majority were wage and salary workers, while a small percentage were self-employed. In 1935, the designers of Social Security did not recommend a maximum level of taxable earnings in their plan. The goal was to provide immediate cash aid to the aged poor and create an earnings-replacement system to reduce the need for welfare benefits. President Roosevelt's Committee on Economic Security focused on covering individuals in need during the Depression. The Social Security system was designed to provide cash aid to the aged poor and create an earnings-replacement system. The proposed system aimed to reduce the need for welfare benefits in the long run by providing a \"core\" benefit as a protection against poverty. The House Ways and Means Committee established a maximum taxable amount of $3,000 per year, equivalent to 12 months of earnings at the $250 level. Nonmanual workers earning $250 or more a month were exempted from coverage initially, but this exemption was later dropped. The taxable limit was established without clear reasoning, but eliminating the high-earner exemption would increase income to the system for redistribution. The size of the base and its impact on Social Security development were major concerns in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Proponents argued for raising the taxable earnings base to ensure higher benefits and prevent erosion over time. Critics believed this would benefit those who could save on their own and make private saving more difficult. Automatic adjustments were recommended to address concerns about rising cost of living reducing Social Security benefits' purchasing power. In 1972, H.R. 1 included a COLA provision that split off from the main text and was enacted under P.L. 92-336. This law increased the taxable earnings base automatically to finance COLAs for Social Security recipients, tied to average wages. Subsequent amendments in 1977 gradually raised the base beyond automatic adjustments, resulting in a $7,500 increase by 1981. The taxable earnings base was increased by $7,500 in 1981 to raise revenue for the Social Security program. The Medicare program, financed by payroll taxes, was enacted in 1965 with the HI tax initially set at 0.35%. The HI tax rate was gradually increased to 1.45% by 1986 to meet program financing needs. The taxable earnings base for HI remained the same as Social Security's until 1990. In 1990, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act raised the HI base to $125,000, which then increased to $135,000 by 1992. In 1993, the HI base was eliminated as part of efforts to reduce budget deficits. The taxable earnings base for Social Security has fluctuated over time, starting at 92% in 1937 and dropping to 71% by 1965. Congress periodically updated the taxable earnings base before 1972, leading to dramatic fluctuations in the 1950s and 1960s. Since the 1980s, the taxable earnings base for Social Security has been indexed to wage increases, reducing volatility. The share of covered workers below the base remains stable at 94%, but the share of earnings taxed has decreased from 90% in 1982 to 83% in 2016. Top earners' salaries grew faster than lower earners, leading to declines in the percentage of covered earnings. Real wage growth from 1979 to 2017 was 34.3% for high-wage earners, 6.1% for middle-wage earners, and 1.2% for low-wage earners. The increasing gap between top earner salaries and the taxable maximum has led to more earnings not covered by payroll taxes, resulting in a decline in the percentage of aggregate covered earnings below the taxable maximum. The share of payroll that is taxed is expected to decline further due to increasing earnings inequality, with the percentage of covered earnings that is taxable projected to decrease to 82.5% by 2027 under the 2018 Trustees Report's intermediate assumptions. The taxable earnings base is projected to decline to 82.5% by 2027, with levels assumed to remain stable thereafter. SSA's projections show that almost 20% of current and future covered workers will have earnings above the base, with about 6% of workers earning more than the base in 2015. Raising or removing the taxable earnings base could stabilize Social Security deficit in the long term. This policy change would potentially increase monthly benefit payments for individuals with earnings above the current base, leading to higher program outlays. Raising or removing the taxable earnings base could stabilize Social Security deficit in the long term by increasing tax revenues. Maintaining a consistent tax base would improve the system's solvency without breaking the link between contributions and benefits. Raising the taxable earnings base could increase revenue and improve Social Security solvency. Some propose raising it to tax 90% of earnings, similar to levels in 1982. Analysis by SSA and JCT shows the impact on trust funds and the budget. Projections using MINT7 model examine effects on taxes, benefits, federal revenue, and behavior. The estimates for raising the amount of earnings subject to the payroll tax to 90% of covered earnings are based on a phase in from 2015 to 2024. SSA also provides estimates of the median percentage change of benefits for all beneficiaries and affected beneficiaries. However, projections of changes in taxes paid by demographic groups are not provided. The change in benefits gives an idea of how many individuals are paying more taxes, but the values are not identical. Dependents receive higher benefits when a worker pays more in taxes. If the taxable earnings base were eliminated and all earnings were subject to the Social Security payroll tax, a percentage of beneficiaries would receive a higher benefit amount in the future. The increase in the taxable earnings base to make 90% of covered earnings subject to the payroll tax leads to a median percentage change in benefits for affected beneficiaries. Retired worker benefits make up the majority of affected beneficiaries, with projections showing potential increases in benefits over time. The impact of eliminating the taxable earnings base on benefits varies by income group, with few beneficiaries in the lowest quintile seeing an increase in benefits compared to 17% of beneficiaries in the highest quintile. The percentage of beneficiaries in the highest quintile affected by an increase in the taxable earnings base more than doubles by 2050, with almost half seeing an increase in benefits by 2070. Benefit amounts for lower quintiles show a median percentage change between 3% and 7% across projection years, while the highest quintile sees a median change from 5% in 2030 to 13% in 2070. In 2050, older cohorts aged 80 and older would have higher benefits if the taxable earnings base had been eliminated. The percentage of beneficiaries with higher benefits increases over time, with the largest change in beneficiaries happening in 2070 for older cohorts. Older cohorts have a smaller median change in benefit amounts due to fewer years of contributing higher taxes. By 2070, all age cohorts would have most of their careers without the taxable earnings base, resulting in an approximate 8% median increase in benefits. The 2018 Trustees Report predicts OASDI trust funds depletion by 2034 without changes. To achieve solvency over the next 75 years, a 2.78% increase in combined payroll taxes is needed. Various policies related to the taxable earnings base could impact the trust funds. To address the potential depletion of OASDI trust funds by 2034, proposals related to the taxable earnings base include eliminating the base immediately or in the future, raising the base to subject more earnings to payroll tax, or taxing earnings above a certain threshold at a lower rate. Changes to the payroll tax could impact benefits associated with earnings above the base, with options such as crediting them the same as earnings below the base, reducing the benefit rate, or not crediting them at all. Table 3 shows trust fund solvency outcomes for some of these proposals. The proposal aims to eliminate the 75-year shortfall by adjusting the taxable earnings base. Different proposals on changing benefits are considered, showing how contributions and benefits impact the long-term shortfall. The Social Security Administration analyzed various options involving immediate elimination of the taxable earnings base. The proposal aims to eliminate the 75-year shortfall by adjusting the taxable earnings base. Different proposals on changing benefits are considered to push back the trust fund depletion date by at least 30 years. If no credits to benefits are provided for earnings above the current taxable earnings base, the trust fund becomes depleted a little less than a decade before the long-range 75-year solvency target. Increased revenue would eliminate 83% of the projected shortfall, with a projected shortfall equal to 0.49% of taxable payroll. Payroll tax rate would need to be increased to 12.89% for the system to be solvent for the next 75 years. To address the Social Security program's financial shortfall, adjusting the taxable earnings base is proposed. This change would deplete the trust fund in 2067 if all wages counted towards benefits, eliminating 68% of the projected shortfall. To ensure solvency for 75 years, a 0.91% increase in the total payroll tax rate or other policy changes are needed. High earners would pay more taxes but also receive higher benefits, maintaining the link between tax paid and benefits received. The net benefit to the trust funds remains positive, with $5 in additional revenue providing only $1 in additional benefits on average over 75 years. Some Social Security benefit payments would exceed the current maximum. To maintain the link between contributions and benefits, proposals suggest adjusting the benefit formula by adding a new bend point with a lower conversion rate for additional contributions above the current taxable earnings base. This change would impact high earners, limiting their benefits while still tying contributions to benefits received. The Social Security benefit payments for high earners could be significantly reduced under this new formula. The proposal to change the benefit computation formula includes a new bend point at the taxable earnings base, extending trust fund depletion to 2074. It eliminates 76% of the projected shortfall but requires a payroll tax increase to 13.08% or other policy changes for solvency. Some proposals suggest gradually eliminating the taxable earnings base by 2024-2030, accompanied by a secondary PIA formula involving AIME+. AIME+ is derived from annual earnings above the current-law taxable maximum, with a new formula factor between 2% and 5%. This proposal aims to increase Social Security trust fund revenue and eliminate 68%-77% of the projected 75-year shortfall. To maintain solvency, the payroll tax rate may need to increase to 13.06%-13.31%, or other policy changes may be necessary. Some proposals suggest applying the current payroll tax rate on earnings above a certain threshold and introducing a secondary PIA formula involving AIME+. The proposal involves creating a new item called AIME+ based on earnings exceeding the taxable maximum, with a formula factor of 2%-3%. This would eliminate 67%-77% of the projected financial shortfall and require a 0.64%-0.94% increase in the payroll tax. Some proposals aim to delay trust fund depletion by 30 years by increasing the taxable earnings base. Options include phasing in the increase over 10 years or adding 2% annually until 90% of earnings are covered. Earnings cover 90% of covered earnings in option 4, taking around 40 years. Most proposals in option 3 would delay trust fund depletion by fewer than eight years. Phasing in the increase over 10 years could cover 28%-35% of the projected shortfall, requiring a 1.86%-2.05% payroll tax increase. Another option (3D) suggests applying a 6.2% tax rate for earnings above the taxable maximum, eliminating 50% of the financial shortfall. Raising the taxable earnings base by 2% annually would cover 23%-26% of the shortfall. The National Academy of Social Insurance proposed increasing the taxable earnings base to 90% of covered earnings for employees only, while eliminating the taxable maximum for employers. This could eliminate 51% of the projected long-range shortfall, requiring a payroll tax rate increase to about 13.79%. Other proposals suggest applying a lower payroll tax rate to earnings above the taxable earnings base, similar to eliminating the base but with a reduced rate. Some proposals suggest reducing the payroll tax rate on earnings above the taxable maximum, with rates ranging from 2% to 6%. The Social Security Forever Act of 2009 proposes a 6% tax rate on earnings above the maximum. Other proposals would tax a portion of earnings above the current maximum at a lower rate, like 2%, with benefits adjusted accordingly. Raising the taxable earnings base to cover 90% of earnings to $245,000 in 2017 would generate significant additional revenue according to estimates from JCT and CBO. This increase in revenue would come from higher Social Security payroll taxes, offset by a reduction in individual income tax revenues. The reduction in income tax revenue is due to decreased take-home pay, leading to fewer hours worked and a shift to tax-exempt fringe benefits. Additional Social Security benefits payments would total $15 billion over 10 years, classified as off-budget. The impact of raising the taxable earnings base on high-earning workers and their employers is uncertain. Workers above the taxable maximum may have reduced work incentives due to higher taxes than lifetime benefits. The extent of the work effort reduction is debated. The impact of raising the taxable earnings base on workers and employers is uncertain. Workers may face a choice between reduced earnings and more leisure time, while employers may increase labor costs or reduce nonwage compensation. The Social Security taxable earnings base creates a regressive tax structure, with workers earning less than the base taxed at a higher proportion than those earning above it. Supporters of changing the wage base argue that only 6% of workers exceed it, but rising earnings inequality has increased the proportion of their earnings escaping taxation. Taxation has increased from 12% to 17% since 1991, favoring higher-earning workers. Supporters propose adjusting the payroll tax to account for the longer life expectancies of high earners. This would make the Social Security system less progressive as high earners receive benefits for more years. There is debate among supporters on how much the taxable earnings base should be raised. Several proposals suggest raising the taxable earnings base to cover 90% of wages, while others propose removing the taxable maximum but lowering the tax rate on higher earnings. Some advocate for taxing employers and employees at different rates above the current base. Proponents argue these changes could address Social Security's deficit without significantly increasing taxes for upper-middle-income individuals. Critics argue that keeping the base as it is may offset the regressive nature of the payroll tax above the taxable maximum. Supporters argue that the regressive nature of the payroll tax above the taxable maximum is partially offset by the progressive calculation of benefits. They mention the earned income tax credit (EITC) as a way to mitigate the Social Security tax burden for low earners. Additionally, low-income families receive a greater share of government transfer payments not subject to Social Security payroll taxes, which helps balance out the tax burden. The tax is seen as proportional for most workers, with only those at the upper end of the income spectrum facing a flat-rate tax. Critics argue that raising the cap on taxable earnings for Social Security could discourage work and harm the economy. They believe that higher earners would pay more in taxes but receive poor returns in benefits. Maintaining the taxable earnings base is seen as a way to differentiate Social Security from ordinary income taxation. Some question the wisdom of paying large benefits to higher-income people, arguing that the purpose of the program is to provide a floor of protection for retirement, not large benefits for those who can save on their own. Eliminating the base would raise public cynicism about a publicly financed system that pays enormous benefits to well-off individuals."
