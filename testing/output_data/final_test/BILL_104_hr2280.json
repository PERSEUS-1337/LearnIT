    "content": "The Medicare and Medicaid Payment Integrity Act of 1995 aims to address fraud and abuse in healthcare services by creating a fraud and abuse control fund. This Act directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to combat these issues and provide funding for quality assurance programs. The Secretary is responsible for ensuring accuracy of payments from Medicare Trust Funds and Medicaid appropriation by using innovative techniques to combat fraudulent practices. This is supported by a reliable funding source to encourage cost-effective activities. In order to support the Secretary's activities and promote cost-effective innovation, the `HHS Fraud and Abuse Control Fund' is established in the Treasury of the United States. This fund receives recovered amounts related to Medicare and Medicaid claims, as well as payments for investigation and monitoring costs. The `HHS Fraud and Abuse Control Fund' supports investigations, audits, and monitoring of compliance plans related to Medicare and Medicaid programs. Penalties and damages imposed under false claims cases involving these programs are also covered. The Fund is available for expenses incurred by the Secretary without the need for appropriations Acts, with a limit of $2,000,000 deposited annually. In fiscal year 1996, an amount is authorized to be appropriated for the initial implementation of activities under the HHS Fraud and Abuse Control Fund. Additional amounts can be deposited in the Fund, subject to a limit of $2,000,000 annually. The Security Act, as amended, applies to amounts recovered, payments made, and penalties imposed after fiscal year 1995. SEC. 4. MEDICARE BENEFIT QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM. Part C of title XVIII is amended to include a new section for a benefit quality assurance program. The Secretary shall enter into contracts with organizations to improve benefit quality assurance activities and safeguard program funds. Sections 1816 and 1842 do not apply to contracts under this section. The Secretary will determine the number of contracts needed for benefit quality assurance activities, ensuring efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Contracts must be in place by October 1, 1998, and each fiscal year thereafter. These contracts must include cooperation with relevant authorities for program oversight. The Secretary will work with law enforcement agencies to investigate and prevent fraud and abuse related to the program. Competitive procedures must be used for new contracts, but existing contracts can be renewed without competition if performance requirements are met. The Secretary may not contract with organizations or entities with financial conflicts that could affect contract performance. Regulations will limit contractor liability for actions under the contract. Funds for benefit quality assurance activities will come from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. The Secretary may transfer funds between the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund to settle accounts. Benefit quality assurance program activities include reviewing providers' activities for medical and utilization review and fraud review. The Secretary may transfer funds between trust funds to settle accounts. Benefit quality assurance program activities include audit of cost reports, determinations on payment eligibility, recovery of improper payments, and education on payment integrity and benefit quality assurance. Effective after fiscal year 1995. SEC. 5. REDUCTION IN DISCRETIONARY SPENDING LIMITS. Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to reduce new budget authority and outlays for fiscal years 1996, 1997, and 1998."
