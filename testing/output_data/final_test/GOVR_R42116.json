The Pakistan People's Party faced a major defeat but retained control of the Sindh government. The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, led by Imran Khan, now heads a coalition government. In June 2013, Nawaz Sharif began his third term as Prime Minister of Pakistan amidst concerns over election violence and rigging. Analysts predict no major changes in US-Pakistan relations, as Sharif focuses on resolving energy crisis and economic decline, aligning with US assistance goals. Tensions between the two countries escalated after the 2011 US raid to kill Osama bin Laden, leading to potential restrictions on billions in annual aid.

Admiral Mike Mullen and then-Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta accused Pakistan's main intelligence agency in September 2011. In a hearing, officials accused Pakistan's ISI of supporting Haqqani Network insurgents attacking U.S. targets in Afghanistan. Secretary Panetta supported conditioning U.S. aid to Pakistan. President Obama praised Pakistan's cooperation but stated the relationship would be evaluated based on U.S. interests.
