    "content": "The Act titled \"Beaches Environmental Assessment, Closure, and Health Act of 1997\" is cited as the short title. The findings and purposes of the Act are outlined in section 2. Congress finds that the Nation's beaches are valuable for recreation, attracting millions of visitors annually and generating billions of dollars in tourism. Increased population has led to declining environmental quality in coastal waters, with pollution crossing political boundaries. Coastal States have varying methods for testing water quality, highlighting the need for consistent monitoring criteria. The purpose of this Act is to establish uniform criteria and procedures for monitoring coastal recreation waters at public beaches to protect public health and safety. It aims to enhance environmental quality by addressing pollution sources through a watershed approach. SEC. 3. ADOPTION OF COASTAL RECREATIONAL WATER QUALITY CRITERIA BY STATES. States must adopt water quality criteria for coastal recreation waters consistent with federal guidelines within 3.5 years of this Act's enactment. Criteria must be revised within 3 years of any updates by the Administrator. Failure to comply will result in consequences. If a State fails to adopt water quality criteria for coastal recreational waters within 3.5 years of the Act's enactment, the Administrator's criteria will apply and be considered promulgated under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. SEC. 4. REVISIONS TO WATER QUALITY CRITERIA. The Administrator will conduct studies, in cooperation with the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere, to gather additional information on potential health risks in coastal recreational waters, improve indicators for detecting harmful pathogens, and develop faster methods for detecting these pathogens. The Administrator will issue revised water quality criteria for harmful pathogens in coastal recreation waters, including indicators and testing methods, based on studies conducted in collaboration with federal, state, and local officials. SEC. 5. COASTAL BEACH WATER QUALITY MONITORING. Amendment to Title IV of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to include a new section on coastal beach water quality monitoring. The Administrator must publish regulations within 18 months for monitoring coastal recreation waters at public beaches to ensure compliance with water quality criteria and public safety. Monitoring requirements will include frequency based on recreational use periods, extent of use, proximity to pollution sources, and storm events. The regulations must specify methods for detecting harmful pathogens in coastal recreation waters, including during storm events, and outline conditions for exempting certain areas from monitoring if it won't impact water quality criteria or public safety. States must promptly notify local governments and the public of water quality exceedances in coastal recreation waters. This includes communicating the nature of the exceedance and posting signs to alert the public of potential risks. The Administrator will issue guidance on monitoring floatable materials in coastal waters and specify when their presence poses a threat to public health. States must implement a monitoring program within 3.5 years of enactment and update it within 2 years of any revisions by the Administrator. The Administrator will establish core performance measures for testing, monitoring, and posting programs within 18 months of enactment. State resources must be provided to local government authorities for program implementation. Regulations will be reviewed and revised at least once every 5 years. In this section, definitions for coastal recreation waters and floatable materials are provided. Coastal recreation waters refer to Great Lakes and marine coastal waters used for water activities. Floatable materials include plastic, aluminum cans, wood, bottles, and paper products. SEC. 6. REPORT TO CONGRESS. The Administrator will submit a report to Congress every 4 years, with recommendations for improving coastal water quality and evaluating State implementation of the Act. SEC. 7. GRANTS TO STATES. SEC. 7. GRANTS TO STATES. The Administrator may make grants to States for fulfilling requirements under this Act and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. Grants shall not exceed 50% of the State's implementation costs. After 3.5 years, grants will only be given if the State shows compliance with monitoring and posting programs. SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS. Definitions for terms like Administrator, coastal recreation waters, and floatable materials are provided in this Act. SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of appropriations is outlined in this section. Authorization of appropriations for the Administrator includes $4,500,000 for grants to States under section 7 and $1,500,000 for other provisions of the Act for each fiscal year from 1998 to 2002."
