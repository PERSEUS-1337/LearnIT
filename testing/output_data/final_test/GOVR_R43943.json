    "content": "On May 27, 2015, the Army Corps of Engineers and the EPA finalized a rule revising regulations defining the scope of waters protected under the Clean Water Act. Discharges to these waters require a permit, and the rule was proposed in 2014 due to uncertainty from Supreme Court rulings. The revised rule became effective on August 28, 2015, but faced legal challenges in federal courts. On June 9, 2015, a federal appeals court in Cincinnati granted a request by 18 states to stay the new Clean Water Act rule nationwide. Legal proceedings are ongoing, and the new rule is not in effect. The rule aims to clarify CWA jurisdiction, but it has faced controversy for potential federal overreach. State and local officials generally support clarifying CWA-regulated waters. Some support clarifying CWA-regulated waters, while others fear new costs for states and localities. Environmental groups welcome the proposal but some want a stronger rule. Critics want the proposed rule withdrawn, but EPA and the Corps argue against it. Congress debates halting the agencies' approach to defining \"waters of the.\" The federal court and some in Congress are considering halting the agencies' approach to defining \"waters of the United States\" under the Clean Water Act. The act protects \"navigable waters,\" which includes all waters of the United States, regardless of navigability. Congress has discussed various options for defining CWA jurisdiction in bills during the 114th Congress. The Clean Water Act (CWA) granted agencies the authority to define \"waters of the United States\" in regulations. EPA and the Corps share implementation of the dredge and fill permitting program in Section 404. Supreme Court rulings in 2001 and 2006 narrowed the regulatory scope of the CWA, creating uncertainty about protected waters. In response, agencies issued guidance in 2003 and 2008 to clarify the Court's rulings. The agencies issued guidance in 2003 and 2008 to clarify Supreme Court rulings on the Clean Water Act. The Obama Administration proposed revised guidance in 2011, which served as the basis for the 2014 proposed rule. In 2015, a final rule was issued to amend the definition of \"waters of the United States\" to reduce confusion and address suggestions from the Rapanos case. The final rule clarifies the regulatory status of surface waters in isolated places and seasonal streams, along with nearby wetlands. It defines all tributaries to navigable waters as jurisdictional and requires case-specific evaluation for other waters. Adjacent waters like wetlands, ponds, and lakes are also included in the jurisdictional scope. The final rule establishes boundaries on what is considered \"adjacent\" waters to traditional navigable waters. It identifies two sets of additional waters that will be considered \"waters of the United States\" if they have a significant nexus to jurisdictional waters. Certain types of waters are excluded from Clean Water Act jurisdiction, including prior converted cropland. The final rule clarifies Clean Water Act jurisdiction by excluding certain types of waters and maintaining existing statutory exclusions. This aims to address the controversy surrounding the need for case-specific evaluations to determine CWA jurisdiction for activities. The final rule aims to clarify Clean Water Act jurisdiction by clearly articulating categories of waters that are and are not protected, addressing controversy over the need for case-specific evaluations. However, industry, agriculture, states, and local governments criticized the rule as vague and ambiguous, potentially expanding regulatory jurisdiction beyond statutory limits. Corps and EPA officials defended the rule but acknowledged the need for clarification in the final version. The final rule, undergoing interagency review, aims to clarify Clean Water Act jurisdiction by defining tributaries, protected waters, and limiting protection of ditches. Changes from the proposal provide more clear boundaries and simplify definitions for protected waters. Stakeholders largely believe the agencies succeeded in making jurisdictional determinations more predictable and less ambiguous. Some believe the agencies largely succeeded in clarifying Clean Water Act jurisdiction with the final rule, while others disagree. Congressional interest in the rule has been strong since its proposal in 2014, with multiple hearings held in the 113th and 114th Congress. Several bills were introduced in the 114th Congress to either prohibit the agencies from finalizing the rule or detail procedures for a new rulemaking. Some in Congress have long favored halting EPA and the Corps' current approach to defining \"waters of the United States.\" There are four options available to change the agencies' course legislatively: a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act, appropriations bill provisions, standalone legislation, and broad amendments to the Clean Water Act. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to disapprove regulatory rules issued by federal agencies, preventing them from taking effect. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to disapprove regulatory rules issued by federal agencies, preventing them from taking effect. Joint resolutions of disapproval of the final clean water rule have been introduced in Congress. The Senate passed a resolution, but President Obama vetoed it. The CRA applies to major rules, non-major rules, final rules, and interim final rules. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to disapprove regulatory rules issued by federal agencies, such as guidance documents and policy memoranda. A joint resolution of disapproval must be introduced within a specific 60-day period. Enacting a CRA joint resolution is challenging, with only one resolution ever enacted in nearly two decades. Overriding a presidential veto of a resolution requires a two-thirds majority in both the House and Senate. The potential advantage of the CRA lies in the procedures for considering a resolution of disapproval. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to disapprove regulatory rules within a 60-day period. The expedited procedure in the Senate allows for consideration of a joint resolution of disapproval if the committee does not report it within 20 days. If 30 Senators submit a petition, the resolution is placed on the Senate Calendar for further consideration. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) expedited procedure in the Senate limits debate to 10 hours and prohibits amendments on a disapproval resolution. There are no expedited procedures for initial House consideration of a joint resolution of disapproval. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) provides procedures for House consideration of a joint resolution of disapproval. If the committee of jurisdiction does not report a disapproval resolution, it can still reach the floor through special rules, a motion to suspend the rules, or discharge of the committee. If the President vetoes a disapproval resolution, Congress would need to attempt an override using normal procedures. If a joint resolution of disapproval becomes law, the \"waters of the United States\" rule cannot take effect, and a similar rule cannot be created without new legislation. Another option to stop the rule is to include a provision in an appropriations bill to limit agency funds. Congressional opponents have not yet been successful in using this method to halt or delay the rule. In the 114th Congress, attempts to block the \"waters of the United States\" rule through appropriations bills were made but faced opposition from the Administration, leading to potential veto threats. In the 114th Congress, attempts to block the \"waters of the United States\" rule through appropriations bills faced opposition, leading to potential veto threats. The Senate Appropriations Committee included a provision in legislation for EPA (S. 1645) in FY2016, but the full Senate did not consider it. Full-year FY2016 appropriations for EPA and the Corps were provided in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113), without any provisions on the rule. Similar provisions were included in FY2017 appropriations bills, such as H.R. 5055 for the Army Corps, but controversies led to its defeat in the House. Provisions to block the rule were also included in bills for EPA funding in FY2017 reported by the House Appropriations Committee (H.R. 5538) and the Senate. In FY2017, Congress did not finalize legislation to fund the Corps or EPA before October 1, 2016. Continuing resolutions extended FY2016 funding levels with reductions through April 28, 2017. No legislative language affecting the \"waters of the United States\" rule was included in these stopgap funding bills. In recent years, controversies over environmental issues have led to provisions in bills to restrict funds for EPA programs, but few have been enacted due to Senate opposition. A funding prohibition in an appropriations bill may not have stopped finalizing a rule but could block funds for implementation. In the 114th Congress, there was opposition in the Senate to restrictions on EPA programs. A bill like H.R. 594 aimed to redirect development of the \"waters of the United States\" rule by limiting EPA and Corps actions and requiring consultation with state and local officials on CWA jurisdiction. In the 114th Congress, bills like H.R. 2599 and H.R. 1732 aimed to restrict EPA actions on the \"waters of the United States\" rule by requiring consultation with state and local officials. H.R. 1732, the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act, was approved by the House on May 12, 2015. The House adopted an amendment to give states two years to comply with a new rule without losing authority over their permitting programs. The Obama Administration opposed H.R. 1732, and the Senate fell short of the votes needed to consider S. 1140. The bill S. 1140 considered public comments on the 2014 proposal and required adherence to certain principles in developing new rules under laws like the Regulatory Flexibility Act. It identified waters to be included in defining \"waters of the United States\" and excluded groundwater, isolated ponds, and prior converted cropland. The bill reflected a narrow interpretation of CWA jurisdiction. The legislation proposed two approaches to defining CWA jurisdiction. S. 1140 followed a narrow interpretation, limiting jurisdiction to waters with a continuous surface hydrologic connection to traditional navigable waters. S. 1178 suggested establishing a commission to determine if a waterbody has a significant nexus to traditional navigable waters. Both bills aimed to restrict the EPA and Army Corps from enforcing the 2014 proposed rule without proper criteria development. The bill aimed to address criticisms of the 2014 proposed rule on defining \"Waters of the United States\" by requiring thorough peer review and public comment before enforcement. Targeted legislation may focus on key definitions like \"tributary\" and \"significant nexus\" that were widely criticized. Critics of the 2014 proposed rule on defining \"Waters of the United States\" raised concerns about ambiguous terms like \"tributary\" and \"significant nexus.\" They suggested that vague language could lead to an expanded regulatory scope under the Clean Water Act. Some in Congress believe that agencies failed to address these issues adequately, leading to calls for potential legislative amendments to the Act. Since the 2001 SWANCC and 2006 Rapanos rulings, stakeholders have called for legislative action to clarify CWA jurisdiction. Bills addressing this issue have been introduced in multiple Congresses, including the Clean Water Authority Restoration Act, which aimed to define \"waters of the United States\" broadly and emphasize protection from pollution. In the 111th Congress, bills were introduced to assert constitutional authority over waters and wetlands, but no further action was taken. Legislation in the 108th and 109th Congresses aimed to narrow the definition of \"navigable waters\" to exclude certain isolated wetlands and non-navigable tributaries from federal regulatory jurisdiction. No legislative action was taken on these bills. In the 114th Congress, bills were introduced to clarify the term \"navigable waters\" in the Clean Water Act, but no legislative action was taken on them. One bill aimed to define the term in line with Justice Scalia's opinion in the 2006 Rapanos decision. Another bill sought to repeal a final rule announced in May 2015 and narrow the definition of \"navigable waters\" to include only certain types of water bodies. Enacting legislation to broaden or restrict CWA jurisdiction would require EPA and the Corps to issue new regulations, leading to lengthy rulemaking processes and potential legal challenges. Congressional consensus on redefining CWA jurisdiction has been elusive, with President Obama likely vetoing any legislation that narrowly defines CWA jurisdiction. This report discusses legislative options for Congress to consider in halting or modifying CWA jurisdiction. The report discusses legislative options for Congress to halt or redirect the EPA and Corps' \"waters of the United States\" rule. Options include the Congressional Review Act, appropriations bill limitations, standalone legislation, and amendments to the Clean Water Act. Some options would not only block the 2015 rule but also prevent similar rules in the future. Blocking the rule and future actions would maintain the current status quo of CWA jurisdiction. The federal appeals court placed a nationwide stay on the clean water rule in 2015, maintaining the status quo for determinations of CWA jurisdiction. Critics of the rule endorse this outcome, while others support legislation to develop a different rule due to potential lengthy legal challenges. Stakeholder groups are involved in the ongoing debate over \"waters of the United States.\" The debate over the \"waters of the United States\" issue continues with stakeholders having differing opinions on the 2015 rule. Legislative activity in Congress suggests ongoing interest in changing the course of action, especially with a new administration likely to revisit the issue. The status of addressing ongoing litigation of the 2015 rule and potential new CWA jurisdiction rule remains unclear. Congress may explore legislative options to halt or redirect the rule despite the unavailability of a resolution of disapproval under the CRA."
