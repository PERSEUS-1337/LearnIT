    "content": "The FY2007 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act extended the deadline for U.S. citizens traveling to the Caribbean, Canada, Mexico, and Central/South America to have passports or other identity documents. The deadline was moved to June 1, 2009, with a January 8, 2007 deadline for air travel. President Baharrat Jagdeo was re-elected in Guyana's national elections on August 28, 2006. President Baharrat Jagdeo was re-elected in Guyana's national elections with almost 55% of the vote, which were peaceful and orderly. Haiti's participation in CARICOM was reinstated, and the House approved a resolution recognizing Guyana's independence anniversary. Tragically, Guyana's Agriculture minister and his siblings were killed in a robbery. U.S. and CARICOM trade officials began discussions in Washington. On March 30, 2006, Portia Simpson Miller became Jamaica's first female Prime Minister, succeeding P.J. Patterson. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice met with CARICOM foreign ministers in Nassau, Bahamas, expressing the U.S.'s desire to strengthen relations with the region and support Haiti's new government. The Senate approved a resolution for Caribbean-American Heritage Month on February 14, 2006. President Bush proclaimed June as Caribbean-American Heritage Month in 2006, recognizing the diverse region of 16 independent nations with a shared history of colonial heritage. The Caribbean includes countries with African, British, Spanish, French, and Dutch influences, with varying dates of independence. The Caribbean nations range from Haiti in 1804 to St. Kitts and Nevis in 1983. Guyana and Suriname are the largest in land area, while Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti have the largest populations. Most Caribbean nations have elected democratic governments, except for communist Cuba. 14 nations belong to CARICOM for regional economic integration, formed in 1973. Progress has been made in moving towards a single economic market in CARICOM and establishing the Caribbean Court of Justice. Six Eastern Caribbean nations are members of the OECS, sharing a common currency managed by the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank. The Caribbean Development Bank in Barbados promotes economic development and regional integration. Regular elections have been the norm in the region, with exceptions in Cuba and Haiti. In December, elections were held in the Grenadines. Haiti's elections were postponed multiple times due to political instability, finally taking place on February 7, 2006. Guyana's presidential elections were postponed to improve the electoral register, eventually held on August 28, 2006 without violence. St. Lucia is due for parliamentary elections by December 2006, while the Bahamas, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago are scheduled for 2007. Many Caribbean nations have strong democratic traditions but are not immune to terrorism. Caribbean nations have strong democratic traditions but are not immune to threats to political stability. Instances include violent protests in St. Kitts in 1993, a coup attempt in Trinidad and Tobago in 1990, a coup plot in Dominica in the 1980s, and a socialist-oriented government in Grenada in 1979. The United States intervened in Grenada in 1983 to restore order. Many Caribbean nations faced economic challenges in 2001-2002 due to tourism and agriculture downturns, impacted by events like the 9/11 attacks and U.S. recession. The banana and sugar sectors in the Eastern Caribbean were also affected by natural disasters. Haiti's economy declined with political instability worsening conditions. The Dominican Republic had one of the strongest economies in recent years. In 2003, the Dominican Republic's economy declined due to a bank collapse. In 2004 and 2005, Antigua and Barbuda, Cuba, Dominican Republic, and others had strong economic growth. Haiti and Grenada faced GDP declines in 2004, but Grenada rebounded in 2005. Guyana's economy has been stagnant. The economy in the Caribbean has been stagnant or minimal in growth over the past few years, with concerns about high oil prices and public debt levels exceeding 100% of GDP in some countries. U.S. interests in the region include economic, political, and security concerns, with a shift in focus from security concerns during the Cold War to other policy interests post-Cold War. The U.S. has shifted its policy focus in the Caribbean from security concerns to economic relations post-Cold War. However, after the 9/11 attacks, security concerns have resurfaced as a major interest. The Caribbean is seen as America's \"third border\" with direct impacts on homeland security. The U.S. has close relations with most Caribbean nations except Cuba, with extensive economic linkages and cooperation on counter-narcotics efforts and security. The U.S. has close economic and security ties with most Caribbean nations, with a focus on counter-narcotics efforts and foreign assistance programs. Tensions have arisen at times, such as when CARICOM nations called for an investigation into President Aristide's departure in 2004. After Haiti's 2006 elections, CARICOM reinstated Haiti's participation. Concerns arose in Caribbean nations like Jamaica and the Bahamas due to a new U.S. passport requirement for air travel to the region, Canada, and Mexico. The requirement, mandated by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, had deadlines set for different modes of travel. Congress later approved legislation to adjust the deadlines. The U.S. Congress approved legislation extending the deadline for requiring passports for land or sea travel to June 1, 2009. The Caribbean tourism industry is concerned about the impact of the air travel passport requirement starting on January 8, 2007. Caribbean governments argue that the majority of tourism revenues come from tourists arriving by air and believe the different deadline for sea travel was to appease cruise ship carriers. A WTO complaint was filed by Antigua and Barbuda challenging U.S. restrictions on Internet gambling. Antigua claims to have lost millions due to these restrictions. The U.S. has not complied with a 2005 WTO ruling on the matter. In response, Congress passed legislation to crack down on unlawful Internet gambling. CARICOM officials have expressed concerns about U.S. inaction in the WTO case regarding Internet gambling restrictions. U.S. relations with Haiti have improved under the newly elected government of President Rene Preval. The Bush Administration's policy towards Haiti focuses on supporting the development of institutions, reducing violence, improving human rights, decreasing poverty, and combating narcotics trafficking. In contrast, U.S. policy towards Cuba has historically involved isolating the country through economic sanctions, including a trade embargo. The Bush Administration has tightened economic sanctions on Cuba, especially on travel. U.S. policy also includes support measures for the Cuban people, such as humanitarian donations and funding for democracy and human rights. Immigration policy towards Cuban migrants involves a \"wet foot/dry foot policy,\" with the Coast Guard intercepting migrants at sea. Those who reach shore can apply for permanent resident status. The United States has provided significant foreign assistance to the Caribbean over the past 25 years, with aid programs focused on countries like Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and the Eastern Caribbean. In the 1980s, assistance amounted to about $3.2 billion, decreasing to $2 billion in the 1990s. Haiti was the largest recipient of aid during this period, followed by Jamaica. In the 1990s, the United States provided significant aid to the Caribbean region, with Haiti receiving the most assistance followed by the Dominican Republic and Eastern Caribbean nations. The bulk of the aid was economic, with some military assistance given. Since FY2000, aid to the region has totaled almost $1.6 billion, with increased support for HIV/AIDS, disaster relief, and assistance to Haiti after President Aristide's departure. In the 2000s, the United States provided significant economic assistance to the Caribbean region, with Haiti receiving the most aid. Congress allocated $100 million in emergency assistance for Caribbean nations in 2004, with $42 million for Grenada, $38 million for Haiti, $18 million for Jamaica, and $2 million for other affected countries. Overall assistance to the Caribbean amounted to $393 million in FY2005 and an estimated $306 million in FY2006. For FY2007, the Administration requested about $322 million in assistance for the Caribbean, with almost 62% allocated to Haiti. The USAID's Caribbean Regional program provides assistance to small nations in the Eastern Caribbean, with funding for various projects. The FY2007 budget includes $11.6 million for the program, $1.5 million for military assistance, $3.2 million for Peace Corps presence, $3 million for the Third Border Initiative (TBI) focusing on regional projects for CARICOM and the Dominican Republic, and $4 million for Operation Enduring Friendship to increase maritime security in select countries. Several Caribbean nations are potential recipients for Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) assistance, targeting countries with strong governance and economic policies. Haiti and Guyana have been candidate countries for MCA funds since FY2004, but have not met performance criteria. Guyana was designated an MCA threshold country for FY2005 and FY2006. In FY2006, the per capita income level for MCA eligibility increased to $3,255 or below, including the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and Suriname. Several Caribbean countries, including the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and Suriname, were considered for Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) funding but were not approved. The Millennium Challenge Corporation listed Haiti, Guyana, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and Suriname as potential candidates for MCA funding in FY2007. U.S. military assistance to the Caribbean has been hindered by countries that are parties to the International Criminal Court (ICC) and have not signed Article 98 agreements. The Administration terminated military assistance to six Caribbean nations in July 2003 due to their lack of Article 98 agreements with the ICC. Antigua and Barbuda, Belize, and Dominica later signed agreements, leaving Barbados, St. Vincent, and Trinidad and Tobago without U.S. military assistance. Trinidad and Tobago and Barbados have resisted signing agreements despite being transit countries for cocaine. Many Caribbean nations serve as transit countries for drugs from South America to the U.S. and Europe. Jamaica and St. Vincent and the Grenadines are major marijuana producers. President Bush designated the Bahamas, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Jamaica as major drug-producing or drug-transit countries. The U.S. urged Haiti to strengthen law enforcement to combat drug trafficking. Jamaica is the largest marijuana exporter in the Caribbean and cooperates with the U.S. on counternarcotics measures. The Bahamas, Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and Haiti cooperate with the United States on counternarcotics efforts. Challenges such as corruption and weak institutions hinder drug control in the Dominican Republic. Jamaica's cooperation is praised, but it needs to intensify law enforcement efforts. Haiti faces obstacles in anti-drug efforts due to weak enforcement. In Haiti, anti-drug efforts have been hindered by weak institutions, poor economic conditions, and political instability. The new Director General of the Haitian National Police is working to combat drug-related crime and police corruption. Other Caribbean nations are vulnerable to drug trafficking due to their geographic location, which could threaten the stability of small states in the Eastern Caribbean. Some observers believe that diversifying Caribbean economies away from banana production is crucial to contain marijuana production. St. Vincent and the Grenadines is the largest marijuana producer in the Eastern Caribbean. Efforts to combat money laundering are a key component of U.S. anti-drug strategy, especially post-9/11. Several Caribbean countries, including Antigua and Barbuda, are on the State Department's list of major money laundering countries. The State Department notes that Antigua and Barbuda's financial sector is vulnerable to money laundering due to loose regulations and its Internet gaming industry. The Bahamas has strong anti-money laundering laws, leading drug traffickers to store cash in safe houses and invest in real estate and businesses. Money laundering in Belize is centered around its offshore financial center, while the Dominican Republic and Haiti are major drug transhipment points. Financial institutions in the Dominican Republic engage in transactions with money from illegal drug sales in the United States. The United States sees money laundering through courier and wire transfers as a major issue, especially in St. Kitts and Nevis. The Financial Action Task Force has been evaluating countries since 2000 to combat money laundering, with several Caribbean nations initially listed as non-cooperative. Several Caribbean nations, including the Bahamas, the Cayman Islands, Dominica, St. Kitts and Nevis, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, were initially listed as non-cooperative in combating money laundering. However, through efforts to improve their anti-money laundering regimes, they were all removed from the list by June 2003. Despite complaints from some officials about the impact on offshore financial sectors, the Financial Action Task Force continues to monitor these countries for compliance. The USA PATRIOT Act's anti-money laundering provisions, including restrictions on correspondent accounts with shell banks and tighter record-keeping requirements, raised concerns about the impact on Caribbean offshore financial sectors. However, some believe that strengthening anti-money laundering measures in the region will ultimately make it more attractive for legitimate business transactions. The USA PATRIOT Act's anti-money laundering provisions aim to improve the reputation of the Caribbean as a haven for money launderers and tax evaders. The United States has provided duty-free trade incentives for Caribbean Basin nations since the 1980s through the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA), part of the broader Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) to promote investment and export production in the region. In the late 1980s, imports of apparel from CBERA countries assembled from U.S. components were eligible for reduced duties, boosting the apparel sectors of Caribbean Basin countries. Congress enacted CBI II legislation in 1990, enhancing CBERA benefits and making provisions permanent. The CBTPA, approved in 2000, expanded preferential tariff treatment for Caribbean Basin nations, including textile and apparel products. These benefits are set to expire in September 2008. The CBTPA benefits for Caribbean countries are set to expire in September 2008 or upon the entry into force of the Free Trade Area of the Americas. Only 8 out of 15 eligible countries fully meet the criteria for participation in the program. The remaining countries benefit from the CBERA program, except for Cuba and Suriname. The overall export performance under preferential trade programs for Caribbean Basin imports has been mixed since 1984. In 1984, Caribbean Basin exports to the United States had mixed results. The Dominican Republic saw significant growth in its apparel sector due to production-sharing arrangements. Overall U.S. imports from the Caribbean increased by $9.7 billion from 1984 to 2005, with the Dominican Republic accounting for $3.6 billion of the increase. Trinidad and Tobago, an oil and gas exporter, also increased its exports to the U.S. Other Caribbean nations like Haiti and the Bahamas saw declines or stagnant exports to the U.S. The Caribbean's economy shifted to tourism and financial services after the oil refinery closed in 1985. U.S. exports to the region rose from $8.9 billion in 2001 to $12.3 billion in 2005, with the Dominican Republic, Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica, and the Bahamas being the main destinations. The U.S. had a trade deficit of $2.2 billion with the Caribbean in 2005, mainly due to natural gas imports from Trinidad and Tobago. All Caribbean nations except Cuba are involved in negotiations for the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). Negotiations for the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) have been stalled since 2004. Some Caribbean governments, like Trinidad and Tobago, support the FTAA, while others, especially smaller countries, have reservations. Caribbean nations in FTAA negotiations seek special treatment for small economies. CARICOM has proposed a Regional Integration Fund to assist smaller economies. To prepare for hemispheric integration, CARICOM established the Caribbean Court of Justice in April 2005. The Caribbean Court of Justice was established in 2005 by CARICOM members to replace the Privy Council as the region's final court of appeal. It plays a key role in economic integration by ruling on trade disputes in the CARICOM Single Market and Economy (CSME), which allows for free movement of goods, services, and capital. By July 2006, 12 out of 14 CARICOM nations had joined the CSME, with the exception of the Bahamas and Haiti. Eastern Caribbean nations were encouraged to join with the promise of a regional Development Fund and Agency for poorer countries. Barbadian Prime Minister Owen Arthur stated in October 2006 that the CSME has boosted regional exports, job opportunities, and investments. U.S. and CARICOM officials discussed a possible free trade agreement in April 2006, with Caribbean ministers seeking extended transition periods. The Trade and Investment Council, established in the 1990s, will facilitate talks on an FTA and other trade issues. The Dominican Republic and the U.S. finalized negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement. The Dominican Republic and the United States completed negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement on March 15, 2004, which was integrated with a free trade agreement negotiated with Central American countries. Congress approved legislation in July 2005 implementing the U.S.-Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA), despite political uncertainty due to differing views on trade rules and labor provisions. The agreement is seen as a way to ensure U.S. preferential treatment for textiles, attract U.S. investment, create jobs, and advance good governance in the region. In the 109th Congress, bills were introduced to authorize funding for the Organization of American States to establish a Center for Caribbean Basin Trade and a skills-training program. The \"Third Border Initiative\" aimed to deepen cooperation in fighting HIV/AIDS, responding to natural disasters, and promoting globalization benefits in the Caribbean. The Third Border Initiative focused on enhancing cooperation in combating illegal activities in the Caribbean, including drug trafficking and migrant smuggling. It also aimed to improve security measures, such as modernizing airport safety regulations and supporting border security efforts. Additionally, increased funding was allocated to combat HIV/AIDS in the region. TBI funds have been used to support border security, Caribbean economies, and environmental management. Funding amounts have varied over the years, with a request for $3 million in FY2007. Enhancing border security is crucial for the Cricket World Cup in 2007, with a regional security plan being finalized. Officials are finalizing a regional security plan for the Cricket World Cup in 2007, with support from the United States to improve port security in the Caribbean region. The International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code aims to prevent terrorist incidents, but some Caribbean nations are concerned about the high cost of compliance. The U.S. Coast Guard conducts foreign port security assessments to evaluate compliance. The Coast Guard conducts foreign port security assessments to ensure compliance with ISPS standards. Trade sanctions may be imposed for non-compliance. Caribbean nations have reported compliance with ISPS Code. The U.S. supports Caribbean nations in meeting ISPS standards through various programs. USAID funded a project for Eastern Caribbean nations to assess port security requirements and plans. Several Caribbean ports are part of the Container Security Initiative (CSI) to identify and inspect high-risk containers before shipment to the US. CSI ports include Caucedo, Kingston, Freeport, Puerto Cortes, Buenos Aires, and Santos. In the 108th Congress, a legislative initiative called for additional foreign port security measures. In the 108th Congress, a legislative initiative aimed to improve foreign port security worldwide, with a focus on the Caribbean Basin. The Senate approved the Maritime Transportation Security Act, S. 2279, which would have provided foreign assistance programs to enhance port security antiterrorism measures in foreign countries. The act also called for a report on the security of ports in the Caribbean Basin and the resources needed to maximize security. In the 109th Congress, two bills aim to enhance port security in Caribbean Basin ports. S. 744 establishes a Caribbean Basin Port Assistance Program to implement security measures with foreign assistance. S. 1052 includes a provision for port security antiterrorism measures. The Secretary of Homeland Security must report to Congress on the status of port security in Caribbean Basin countries. In the 109th Congress, a bill was introduced to establish a program for port security antiterrorism measures in foreign countries, focusing on ports in the Caribbean Basin. Rising crime rates in the region, particularly in Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Haiti, have been a major security challenge. Jamaica had the highest murder rate in the world in 2005. Crime, including murder and kidnapping, has been a significant issue in Trinidad and Tobago, Haiti, and other Caribbean nations. Gangs involved in drug trafficking and violence are responsible for much of the crime. Some believe that deported criminals from the United States have contributed to the rise in violent crime in the region. Rising oil prices are also a major concern for Caribbean nations, impacting economic growth and social stability. Trinidad and Tobago, Cuba, and Barbados are the only Caribbean nations with significant oil and gas reserves. Trinidad and Tobago is the major producer, supplying 60% of oil reserves and 91% of natural gas reserves in the region. It is also the largest supplier of LNG to the United States. Cuba produces oil but imports most of its needs, while Barbados imports 90% of its oil consumption. Venezuela's PetroCaribe program offers oil to Caribbean nations on preferential terms, raising concerns about increased Venezuelan influence in the region. Since 1980, Caribbean nations have received preferential oil imports from Venezuela under various agreements. PetroCaribe aims to establish a regional supply network and development fund, with Venezuela supplying 190,000 barrels per day at discounted rates. 14 Caribbean nations are signatories, with Barbados declining to join due to existing agreements with Trinidad. The AIDS epidemic in the Caribbean has negative consequences for economic and social development. In 2005, an estimated 300,000 adults and children in the region were living with HIV, with 24,000 deaths reported. Haiti, the Bahamas, Guyana, and Trinidad and Tobago had the highest infection rates. In the Caribbean, countries like Haiti, the Bahamas, Guyana, and Trinidad and Tobago have high HIV infection rates, primarily through heterosexual contact. Haiti and the Dominican Republic have the majority of infected individuals. USAID attributes Haiti's rapid spread of AIDS to poverty, conflict, and unstable governance. Prevention efforts are showing signs of progress in these countries, with a decrease in life expectancy due to the epidemic. The HIV epidemic in the Caribbean has led to a significant decrease in life expectancy, with a high number of AIDS-related deaths among young adults. Health systems are struggling to cope with new cases of AIDS, resulting in a large population of AIDS orphans, particularly in Haiti. Sex tourism is contributing to the spread of HIV in some Caribbean countries, with concerns raised about child prostitution in resort areas. The World Bank warns of continued increases in HIV prevalence in the region. The World Bank warns that the HIV epidemic in the Caribbean will negatively impact economic growth, affecting sectors like agriculture, tourism, and finance due to lost productivity. The Prime Minister of St. Kitts and Nevis expresses concern about the epidemic's impact on the labor force and the region's competitiveness in global markets. The World Bank cautions that without early intervention, the Caribbean could face a similar crisis to Africa. USAID is leading efforts to combat the epidemic. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has been leading efforts to combat the HIV epidemic abroad since 1986. Funding for HIV/AIDS in Central America and the Caribbean region increased significantly from $11.2 million in FY2000 to an estimated $92.7 million in FY2006. The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) included Guyana and Haiti as focus countries, leading to increased U.S. assistance in the region. In FY2007, the Administration requested $88 million in funding for Guyana and Haiti, as well as $25 million for non-focus countries in Central America and the Caribbean. Some Members of Congress are advocating for expanding assistance to additional Caribbean countries beyond Guyana and Haiti. Members of Congress are pushing to expand HIV/AIDS assistance to more Caribbean countries beyond Guyana and Haiti. Legislation in the 108th and 109th Congress aimed to add 14 Caribbean countries to the list of focus countries for increased assistance, but no final action was taken. The Foreign Affairs Authorization Act, FY2006 and FY2007, includes a provision to add these countries. Other legislative initiatives in the 109th Congress also address this issue. In the 109th Congress, legislation was passed to provide assistance for orphans and vulnerable children in developing countries, establish pediatric centers for children with HIV/AIDS in certain countries like Guyana, combat infectious diseases in Haiti, and establish a comprehensive health infrastructure. Since 2004, the Caribbean Basin region has been devastated by numerous storms and floods, with several nations like Haiti, Grenada, Jamaica, and the Bahamas being hard hit during the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season. Hurricane Charley damaged over 70,000 homes in western Cuba, while Hurricane Frances caused widespread damage in the Bahamas. Hurricane Ivan devastated Grenada, Jamaica, and the Cayman Islands, causing severe damage to housing and infrastructure. The 2005 Atlantic hurricane season had an unprecedented 28 named storms, including 15 hurricanes, with six causing widespread damage and over 800 deaths in Central America and the Caribbean. Hurricane Dennis heavily damaged central Cuba and Haiti's southern peninsula with floods and landslides. In 2005, Hurricane Emily caused destruction in Grenada, Hurricane Stan led to severe floods in Mexico and Central America, Hurricane Wilma affected Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, Hurricane Beta caused flooding in Honduras and Nicaragua, and Tropical Storm Gamma caused extensive flooding in northern Honduras. NOAA predicted an active season with 13-16 named storms, 8-10 hurricanes, and 4-6 major hurricanes. In 2006, hurricane predictions were inaccurate with only nine named storms and five hurricanes, making it a relatively weak season. The United States provided humanitarian aid to Caribbean nations affected by hurricanes, including Grenada, Haiti, and Jamaica. In response to hurricanes in the Caribbean, USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) set up Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) in Dominican Republic, Cuba, and other islands. By October 2004, USAID had provided $23 million in emergency humanitarian assistance for Hurricane Ivan and Tropical Storm Jeanne. The 108th Congress allocated $100 million for longer-term reconstruction assistance, with $42 million for Grenada, $38 million for Haiti, $18 million for Jamaica, and $2 million for other affected countries. Grenada received assistance to restore rural communities, schools, and health centers. The reconstruction program in Haiti and Jamaica had two phases. The first phase focused on immediate recovery, repairing infrastructure, and revitalizing the agricultural sector. The second phase involved rebuilding infrastructure, revitalizing the business sector, and restoring economic management capacity. In Haiti, the program included community and rural revitalization components, such as road repair, disaster mitigation, and hillside stabilization. In Jamaica, assistance included repairing community infrastructure and revitalizing the agricultural sector. The second phase of the reconstruction program in Haiti and Jamaica focused on repairing and rebuilding homes, assisting with business recovery, and rehabilitating schools. Other hurricane assistance programs targeted affected communities in the Bahamas and Tobago, as well as providing aid to Eastern Caribbean nations for risk reduction efforts in low-income housing. In May 2006, GAO reviewed USAID's $100 million disaster assistance program for the Caribbean, noting completion of many activities within a planned timeframe but facing challenges due to severe weather and coordination issues. For the 2005 hurricane season, USAID provided about $12.5 million in disaster assistance to Central American and Caribbean nations, with Guatemala receiving the bulk of the assistance at $9.2 million. Other countries received lesser amounts of assistance. Many projects included components to strengthen disaster mitigation efforts. Disaster mitigation efforts were integral in the Hurricane Ivan and Tropical Storm Jeanne recovery programs in the Caribbean. Better building standards, civil protection committees, risk management plans, hillside stabilization, and early warning systems were implemented in Haiti. Grenada officials state that the country is better prepared for hurricanes. OFDA supports disaster preparedness and mitigation programs in Latin America and the Caribbean to reduce loss of life and economic impact. OFDA has supported the Caribbean Development Bank since 2000 to establish a disaster mitigation facility. OFDA has collaborated with NOAA to improve disaster mitigation efforts in the English-speaking Caribbean. They work with countries in the region to provide state-of-the-art hurricane warnings and enhance forecasters' capacity to give early warnings. NOAA deployed new hurricane buoys after the 2004 hurricane season to improve storm tracking in the Caribbean. NOAA's National Weather Service issues forecasts for the Caribbean Basin region, and most weather agencies in the region are in communication with them. NOAA collaborates with countries in the Caribbean to improve hurricane warnings and forecasters' capacity. The region's weather agencies are in communication with NOAA. Congress passed resolutions establishing Caribbean-American Heritage Month and acknowledging African descendants of the transatlantic slave trade in the Americas. The United States and the international community are urged to address injustices faced by Afro-descendant communities in Latin America and the Caribbean. Proposed bills aim to establish a fund for economic development in the Americas, cancel debts for poor countries like Guyana, Haiti, and Jamaica, and support educational exchange programs in the Caribbean. The USAID program aims to extend school initiatives in the Caribbean. P.L. 109-295 (H.R. 5441) amends the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 by extending the deadline for U.S. citizens traveling to certain countries to have passports or other identity documents. The Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act was signed into law in August 2005. Two bills, the Caribbean Basin Trade Enhancement Act of 2005, would authorize funding for the Organization of American States for trade and skills training programs in Caribbean Basin countries. The curr_chunk discusses legislation related to port security antiterrorism measures in foreign countries, with a focus on the Caribbean Basin. It includes provisions from various bills such as S. 1052, S. 2791, S. 744, and P.L. 109-95. The legislation discussed in the curr_chunk focuses on providing assistance for orphans and vulnerable children in developing countries, establishing pediatric centers for children with HIV/AIDS in certain countries like Guyana, combating infectious diseases in Haiti, and adding Caribbean countries to the list for increased HIV/AIDS assistance. The legislation in the curr_chunk focuses on funding for buoys in oceans and seas for observing ocean conditions at depth, as well as initiatives for a U.S. tsunami detection and warning system in the Caribbean region. H.Con.Res. 441 expresses Congress's concern over Caribbean countries' votes for commercial whaling. Numerous legislative initiatives in the 109th Congress address Cuba's human rights, economic sanctions, and broadcasting. H.Res. 792 (Meeks) approved by the House on June 12, 2006, recognizes Guyana's independence anniversary and wishes for peace and development. H.Con.Res. 74 (Meeks) urges aid for Guyana after severe flooding. Several bills in the 109th Congress focus on Haiti, including migration, reconstruction, health assistance, and investigating the 2004 coup. In the 109th Congress, several bills focused on Haiti, including migration, reconstruction, health assistance, and investigating the 2004 coup.
