    "content": "The federal courts of appeals, known as \"circuit courts,\" are the final avenue of appeal for most cases in the United States. There are eleven regional circuits covering 50 states and territories, each with 6 to 29 judgeships. The President nominates judges for these vacancies with Senate approval. State representation is customary in assigning judicial seats on the circuit courts. State representation in assigning judicial seats on circuit courts is customary, but not a formal requirement. A 1997 law mandates that each state within a circuit must be represented by a resident judge. Nominees for appeals courts must reside within the circuit at the time of appointment. The selection process involves consultation between the President and Senators from the relevant states. Some controversial nominations have led to disputes over changes in state representation on circuit courts since the mid-1990s. Since the mid-1990s, disputes have arisen over judicial nominations, including objections to nominees based on state representation. In 1995, James L. Dennis was confirmed to a Fifth Circuit seat, and Claude Allen's nomination to the Fourth Circuit was returned to the President without Senate approval. President Obama later nominated Judge Andre M. Davis to fill the vacant Fourth Circuit seat, and he was confirmed in 2009. In 2008, G. Steven Agee was confirmed to fill a Fourth Circuit seat, maintaining state representation. The nomination of Norman Randy Smith to the Ninth Circuit in 2005 sparked controversy, with objections from California Senators over a potential judgeship transfer to Idaho. Idaho Senators supported Smith's nomination. In the 110th Congress, President Bush renominated Norman Randy Smith to fill a vacancy on the Ninth Circuit, which was later confirmed by the Senate. In the 111th Congress, Albert Diaz's confirmation to the Fourth Circuit resulted in a seat moving from South Carolina to North Carolina. Diaz replaced William W. Wilkins. The report relies on data from various sources to analyze the nomination process for federal appeals court judges from 1891-2009. No pending nominations in the current Congress would change state representation in a circuit. The report analyzed the nomination process for federal appeals court judges from 1891-2009 using data from the Multi-User Database, Senate Executive Journal, Judiciary Committee questionnaires, and Executive Calendar. CRS manually checked for changes in state representation and found minimal errors. In cases of conflict, the President's nominating statement was used as the decisive record. The Multi-User Database was used to analyze the nomination process for federal appeals court judges from 1891-2009. The data showed that most seats were filled by judges from the same state as their predecessor. There has been a decline in changes in state representation over the past 40 years, with some circuits experiencing more changes than others. The data analyzed the nomination process for federal appeals court judges from 1891-2009, showing a decline in changes in state representation over the past 40 years. Some circuits had more changes in state representation than others, possibly due to rotating seats among smaller states before each state was required to be represented on its circuit court. Limited information is available on why changes in state representation occurred. Since 1891, there have been 455 opportunities for changes in state representation in federal appeals court judges nominations. Out of 104 confirmed nominations, 23% resulted in changes. Most vacancies have been filled by judges from the same states as their predecessors. The 23% figure does not account for net gains or losses by states on their respective circuit courts of appeals. Variations in changes in state representation exist for each President and circuit, caution should be taken when generalizing from isolated data points. Changes in state representation in federal appeals court judges nominations have occurred infrequently, with some circuit court seats stabilizing while others experienced frequent changes. Table 1 shows that changes were relatively common through the Kennedy Administration, with 40% of appointments marking changes compared to 13% from the Lyndon Johnson Administration onwards. Caution is advised when generalizing from isolated data points. Since the Kennedy Administration, changes in state representation in federal appeals court judges nominations have been infrequent. President Nixon's appointments saw the largest percentage change, with only 22% resulting in state representation changes. Recent appointments have resulted in substantially fewer changes, with President George W. Bush having the lowest percentage of changes since Benjamin Harrison. President Obama currently has the second-lowest percentage at 6%. Changes in state representation in federal appeals court judges nominations have been infrequent since the Kennedy Administration. President Nixon's appointments had the largest percentage change at 22%. Recent appointments have seen fewer changes, with President George W. Bush having the lowest percentage since Benjamin Harrison. Obama currently has the second-lowest percentage at 6%. State representation changes have varied by circuit, with the Eleventh Circuit experiencing no changes and the Second Circuit being very stable. Other circuits have seen around 30%-40% of appointments resulting in changes in state representation."
