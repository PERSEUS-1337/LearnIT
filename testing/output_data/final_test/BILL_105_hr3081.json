    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1997\". Congress recognizes that violence motivated by factors such as race, color, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender, or disability is a serious national problem that disrupts communities and is inadequately addressed by existing Federal law. This violence impacts interstate commerce by hindering the movement of targeted groups and affecting their ability to purchase goods, obtain employment, or participate in commercial activities. Violence motivated by bias can constitute badges and incidents of slavery, warranting Federal intervention to assist jurisdictions lacking laws addressing such violence based on race, color, national origin, religion. Some States have laws that protect against violence based on bias, such as race, color, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender, or disability, while others have limited protection. The Act defines \"hate crime\" in alignment with the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. It also prohibits certain acts of violence. Section 245 of title 18, United States Code, is amended to include harsh penalties for causing bodily injury based on race, color, religion, or national origin, including imprisonment up to 10 years or life if death results from the act. The amended Section 245 of title 18, United States Code, includes penalties for causing bodily injury based on religion, gender, sexual orientation, or disability, with imprisonment up to 10 years or life if death results from the act. The amended Section 245 of title 18, United States Code, includes penalties for acts such as kidnapping, aggravated sexual abuse, or attempted murder, if they involve interstate or foreign commerce.
