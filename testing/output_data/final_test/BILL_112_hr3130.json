    "content": "The \"Heartbeat Informed Consent Act\" is the short title of this Act. It includes findings related to the act. The Congress finds that the presence of a heartbeat in a woman's unborn child is a key consideration for women contemplating abortion, as it signifies the baby is already alive. The heartbeat can be detected as early as 4 to 4.5 weeks after fertilization using ultrasound technology. The presence of a fetal heartbeat is a crucial indicator for the viability of an unborn child, detectable around 7.5 to 8 weeks from the last menstrual period. It is a key component of informed consent for abortion, as it signifies the potential for live birth and should be considered due to the risks associated with abortion. The Supreme Court recognizes the serious and lasting consequences of abortion, emphasizing the importance of full knowledge and informed decision-making. Some women may regret their choice to abort, leading to severe depression and loss of esteem. The State has an interest in ensuring that such a grave choice is well informed. The Supreme Court acknowledges the profound grief and regret a mother may experience after an abortion, emphasizing the importance of informed decision-making. Requiring providers to offer the opportunity to view an unborn child's heartbeat through ultrasound is deemed constitutionally permissible, providing truthful and nonmisleading information to prevent later psychological consequences. Recent research shows that women who have had an abortion have an 81 percent increased risk for mental health problems, with 10 percent of these issues directly linked to abortion (Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 882 (1992)). The Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new section titled \"TITLE XXXIV--INFORMED CONSENT\" with definitions outlined in section 3401. The term 'abortion' is defined as the intentional termination of an unborn child or pregnancy, with exceptions for live birth, ectopic pregnancy, or removal of a deceased unborn child. An 'abortion provider' is someone legally qualified to perform abortions under Federal and State laws. The term 'certified technician' refers to a registered diagnostic medical sonographer certified in obstetrics and gynecology or a nurse midwife with certification in obstetrical ultrasonography. 'Embryonic or fetal heartbeat' means cardiac activity or rhythmic heart contractions. An 'unborn child' is defined as a member of the species homo sapiens at any stage of development prior to birth. The term 'woman' refers to a female human being, regardless of age. An 'unemancipated minor' is a minor under the control of parents or guardians. \"Requirement of informed consent for women, regardless of age or minor status under parental control.\" Requirement of compliance by abortion providers in interstate or foreign commerce to perform ultrasounds on pregnant women before obtaining informed consent for the procedure. The ultrasound images must be displayed for the woman to view, and a medical description provided. The ultrasound images displayed for pregnant women before obtaining informed consent for an abortion must be of quality consistent with medical practice, show dimensions of the unborn child, and accurately portray external members and internal organs. Pregnant women have the ability to avert their eyes from the images if they choose to. Prior to a woman giving informed consent for an abortion, the provider must make the embryonic or fetal heartbeat audible if the pregnancy is at least 8 weeks after fertilization. Abortion providers must attempt to make the embryonic or fetal heartbeat audible for the pregnant woman using a hand-held Doppler fetal monitor. If the attempt is unsuccessful, they must offer to try again at a later date. The pregnant woman has the right to choose not to listen to the heartbeat. \"Exception for medical emergencies under SEC. 3403.\" The provisions of section 3402 do not apply to an abortion provider if the abortion is necessary to save the life of a mother endangered by a physical disorder, illness, injury, or a life-threatening condition from the pregnancy itself. The abortion provider must certify the medical conditions supporting the need for the abortion and include it in the pregnant woman's medical file. Falsifying this certification is considered non-compliance. Failure to comply with this title for section 3404 purposes is deemed as knowingly or recklessly not following the regulations. \"Penalties for non-compliance with section 3404 regulations are deemed as knowingly or recklessly not following the rules.\" An abortion provider who fails to comply with regulations may face civil penalties in federal court. The Attorney General can initiate legal action. For a first offense, a court can impose a civil penalty of up to $100,000 for each violation. Repeat offenses result in notifying the State medical licensing authority. The Attorney General can impose civil penalties of up to $250,000 for violations of abortion regulations, with repeat offenses leading to notification of the State medical licensing authority. A woman or her guardian can also file a civil action for damages against the abortion provider for violations of the law. SEC. 4. PREEMPTION.\n\nThis Act does not override any State law that requires greater disclosure on abortion than what is outlined in this Act.\n\nSEC. 5. SEVERABILITY.\n\nIf any part of this Act is deemed unconstitutional, the rest of the Act remains unaffected."
