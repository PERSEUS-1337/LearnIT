    "content": "The 111th Congress passed the Affordable Care Act in 2010, expanding Medicaid eligibility and increasing access to health insurance. State attorneys general challenged various provisions of the ACA, including its Medicaid expansion, in cases like NFIB v. Sebelius. The Supreme Court addressed the issue of withholding Medicaid reimbursement to states for non-compliance with program expansion, ruling that withholding funds associated with expansion does not violate the Tenth Amendment. Medicaid is a jointly financed entitlement program for specific healthcare services, with all 50 states currently participating. States must follow federal rules to receive reimbursement for most Medicaid costs. Medicaid expansion under the ACA increases eligibility, adds benefits, raises federal matching payments, and introduces new requirements for states to improve care. Starting in 2014, states were required to cover adults under 65 with incomes up to 133% of the poverty level. The Medicaid expansion under the ACA requires states to cover adults under 65 with incomes up to 133% of the federal poverty level. Failure to comply could result in the withholding of Medicaid reimbursements. The federal government predicted a potential enrollment increase of 16 million if all states participate in the expansion, with increased federal and state spending to finance it. The Medicaid expansion under the ACA requires states to cover adults under 65 with incomes up to 133% of the federal poverty level. Failure to comply could result in the withholding of Medicaid reimbursements. The constitutional challenge to the Medicaid expansion in NFIB was that states would be coerced into paying for the increased Medicaid requirements, as the failure to comply might result in the federal government withholding all Medicaid funding. Medicaid represents a significant portion of federal funds received by states, and the withdrawal of this aid would impact the states' ability to provide healthcare to their populations. The Medicaid expansion under the ACA requires states to cover adults under 65 with incomes up to 133% of the federal poverty level. Congress can allocate money to states, private entities, or individuals, but then require those recipients to engage in or refrain from certain activities as a condition of receiving and spending that money. The authority of Congress to specify under what conditions the states will receive Medicaid funds is generally considered to be the Spending Clause. The question arises whether there are limitations on Congress' ability to apply such requirements to the states under precepts of federalism. The lines of authority between states and the federal government are defined by the United States Constitution and relevant case law regarding federalism. The Court has interpreted congressional power under the Spending Clause expansively, allowing federal laws like civil rights statutes to regulate states. Congress uses its spending power to achieve goals that cannot be directly legislated due to constitutional limitations on state sovereignty. The Tenth Amendment limits federal power, stating that powers not given to the US by the Constitution are reserved for the states or the people. The Supreme Court has varied in its interpretation of this amendment, ultimately ruling that states should seek relief from federal regulation through the political process, not the courts. Modern Tenth Amendment doctrine stems from the Court's 1992 decision in New York v. United States. In New York v. United States, Congress attempted to regulate low-level radioactive waste by requiring states to develop legislation for disposal or take ownership of the waste. The Supreme Court ruled that while Congress could regulate the waste directly, it could not force states to regulate it, as this would violate the Tenth Amendment by \"commandeering\" the states' legislative process. In Printz v. United States, the Court ruled that Congress cannot \"commandeer\" state executive branch officers to enforce federal laws, as it violates the Tenth Amendment. This decision was based on the principle that such commandeering is outside of Congress's power and infringes on state sovereignty. The Supreme Court ruled in Printz v. United States that Congress cannot \"commandeer\" state officers to enforce federal laws, violating the Tenth Amendment. In the case of Medicaid expansion, states are not directly required to fund or implement new responsibilities, as they have the choice to accept federal funds. This makes it challenging to argue that states are being commandeered, unlike in previous cases like New York and Printz. The Supreme Court addressed the issue of conditioning government benefits on the waiver of constitutional rights, known as the doctrine of \"unconstitutional conditions.\" The question in NFIB was whether states could be required to expand Medicaid to receive federal funds. The Court has recognized that constitutional rights can be voluntarily waived, even in cases of significant importance like challenging capital punishment under the Eighth Amendment. The Supreme Court has addressed the issue of waiving constitutional rights in exchange for inducements. In some cases, such waivers are considered voluntary, such as in plea bargaining where a defendant may waive their right to trial for a reduced penalty. However, in other situations, it may be challenging to determine if the waiver is coerced and infringes on the waived right. The Supreme Court has not established a universal doctrine for evaluating when a grant requirement may infringe on a waived constitutional right. The Court's approach varies based on the nature of the inducements and the importance of the right being waived. Despite the lack of a consistent approach, two themes emerge in evaluating required waivers. In evaluating the possibility of a required waiver of a constitutional right as an \"unconstitutional condition,\" courts consider relatedness and coercion. The weight of these factors may vary depending on the circumstances. The Court is more sensitive to grant conditions limiting private grant recipients' constitutional rights than states. The Supreme Court is more concerned with grant conditions limiting private grant recipients' constitutional rights than states. This is due to an imbalance in bargaining power, especially when the government holds a monopoly over the benefit offered. The doctrine of unconstitutional conditions is most robust when cases involve individuals' personal autonomy or property rights. Prior to NFIB, states had not successfully invoked this doctrine, as courts had not found grant conditions imposed on states to fail relatedness or coercion tests. The Supreme Court's decision in NFIB could impact federal authority to impose spending conditions on states, as states are seen as more able to withstand federal coercion due to their financial and political power. An example of a grant condition that does not violate the Tenth Amendment is seen in South Dakota v. Dole, where Congress withheld federal highway funds from states with a lower drinking age. The Supreme Court's decision in NFIB could affect federal authority to impose spending conditions on states. In South Dakota v. Dole, Congress withheld highway funds from states with a lower drinking age, which was found to be related to the national concern of safe interstate travel. The Court emphasized the importance of the condition being related to the specific national projects or programs to which the money was directed. The Court found that the grant condition in question was related to the overall regulatory goal of transportation safety, not directly tied to how the federal money was spent or specific projects. It also determined that the Tenth Amendment was not violated because the state had voluntarily agreed to comply with the condition. The Court suggested Tenth Amendment limits to Congress's power under the Spending Clause, noting that financial inducements could become coercive. In Dole, withholding highway funds for states with a drinking age below 21 was not coercive. In NFIB, the Eleventh Circuit rejected a challenge to the Medicaid expansion under the Spending Clause/Tenth Amendment coercion argument. The Eleventh Circuit analyzed whether the ACA Medicaid expansion was unduly coercive under the Spending Clause, finding that it was not. Factors considered included Congress's right to make changes to the Medicaid program, federal funding for the expansion until 2016, and states gradually becoming responsible for a portion of the costs. The Supreme Court reversed the Eleventh Circuit's decision on the ACA Medicaid expansion, ruling that withholding all Medicaid funding for non-compliance was coercive and violated the Tenth Amendment. The Court also stated that HHS could withhold only a portion of funding for non-compliance. The Supreme Court found that withholding all Medicaid funds for non-compliance with the ACA Medicaid expansion was unconstitutional. The Court limited withholding of funds to only the new funds, making state participation in the expansion voluntary. The decision focused on coercion and relatedness factors under the Tenth Amendment. The Supreme Court in NFIB considered whether states were adequately informed about the possibility of a significant expansion of the Medicaid program. The specific question was whether the ACA coerced states into accepting onerous conditions in violation of federalism principles. Justice Roberts' opinion in NFIB elaborated on the coercion theory, despite the Eleventh Circuit upholding the Medicaid expansion and no other circuit striking down similar provisions. In Dole, the Court discussed relatedness and coercion, treating them as separate factors. However, in NFIB, these concepts became intertwined, requiring consideration together. This approach aligns with concerns of coercive governmental behavior in unconstitutional conditions cases. For example, in Nollan v. California Coastal Commission, the fit of benefit conditions to governmental purpose raised concerns about coercion. The California property owners sought a permit to replace a bungalow with a three-bedroom house, granted on the condition of recording an easement for public beach access. The government argued the easement was necessary to prevent blockage of ocean views. The Court evaluated the necessity of the easement in relation to the property taking issue, emphasizing the importance of a close fit between the condition and its justification. The Court found that there must be a close fit between the purpose of a regulation and the burden imposed in takings cases. Justice Roberts' decision in NFIB suggests that the relationship between grant conditions and the underlying grant program must be evaluated. Certain categories of grant conditions are more vulnerable to a constitutional challenge under coercion doctrine. Justice Roberts discusses different types of grant conditions in this context. Justice Roberts discusses various types of grant conditions, including directly related conditions, indirectly related conditions, independent grant conditions, and unrelated grant conditions. These categories are not presented systematically, and it is unclear if they are exclusive or overlapping. For the purposes of this report, the type of grant condition before the court will determine if it is likely coercive or not. Grant conditions directly related to federal funds are usually constitutional under the Spending Clause. If the condition aligns with the policy goals of the grant, withdrawing program funds is typically constitutional. However, if the condition is for a new program, threatens existing program funding, and represents a significant portion of a state's budget, it may be considered coercive. If a grant condition threatens existing program funding and represents a significant portion of a state's budget, it may be considered coercive under the Tenth Amendment. Grant conditions unrelated to the general policy goals of the grant are likely unconstitutional under the Spending Clause. Concerns about coercion are reduced when there is a direct relationship between the subsidized activity and the imposed conditions, regardless of whether the recipient is a state or private entity. In Rust v. Sullivan, a First Amendment challenge was brought against regulations prohibiting abortion advocacy by health care providers receiving federal funds under Title X for family-planning services. The Court upheld the regulations, stating that the government was not denying a subsidy but requiring funds to be used for specified purposes. The Court found that the direct relationship between federal benefits and the activity justified First Amendment limitations. States receiving federal funds must comply with federal conditions on how the funds are spent, as seen in Oklahoma v. Civil Service Comm'n regarding the Hatch Act. The Supreme Court ruled that the federal government can withhold funds to states unless certain conditions are met, even though it cannot regulate local political activities of state officials. This power allows Congress to ensure funds are spent according to its view of the 'general Welfare.' The Supreme Court ruled that states cannot be relieved from federal grant conditions based on program size or fund withholding. Many federal grant conditions direct or limit behaviors in programs using federal funds, which may not be challenged under the Tenth Amendment. Case law does not distinguish between grant conditions imposed at program inception or later. Adding grant conditions to existing programs receiving federal funds is not unusual and may not face significant Tenth Amendment challenges. Courts tend to defer to Congress in analyzing the relationship between grant conditions and program goals. The Supreme Court's decision in Dole, which linked raising the drinking age to 21 with transportation safety, demonstrates this broad interpretation of relatedness. This suggests that grant conditions will likely be upheld as long as a reasonable connection to program goals can be established. In the NFIB case, the Court is expected to find grant conditions related to Medicaid's purpose of providing medical treatment to disadvantaged populations meet the standard set forth in Dole. Justice Ginsburg asserts the undeniable relatedness of Medicaid and its expansion, while Justice Roberts' opinion does not directly address the connection between the policy goals of the Medicaid expansion and the existing Medicaid program. Justice Roberts' opinion in the NFIB case focused on whether the Medicaid expansion was a \"new and independent\" program, suggesting that previous grant conditions added to Medicaid were constitutional and generally related to the program's policy goals. Congress has amended the Medicaid program over 50 times since 1965, with a significant expansion between 1988 and 1990. According to Justice Ginsburg, amendments to Medicaid expanded coverage to pregnant women and children with low family incomes. Justice Roberts argued that previous modifications to Medicaid did not raise concerns about coercion. He suggested that the 1988-1990 expansion was not a major change and that most changes to federal spending programs will not raise similar concerns. Roberts' opinion suggests that changes to federal spending programs, including Medicaid, may not raise significant constitutional concerns. The opinion indicates that even a significant loss of federal funds, such as the withdrawal of Medicaid funding, could be constitutional as long as the grant conditions are indirectly related. In NFIB, seven Justices found that the requirement for states to comply with Medicaid expansion under the ACA or lose all funding violated the Tenth Amendment. The opinion of Chief Justice Roberts, joined by Justices Breyer and Kagan, is narrower than the dissenting opinion by Justices Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito. Chief Justice Roberts' opinion on the ACA Medicaid expansion focuses on the creation of a new program with conditions for funding withdrawal. The opinion suggests that changes to federal spending programs, like Medicaid, may not pose significant constitutional concerns. The Supreme Court's decision on the ACA Medicaid expansion focused on the limits of Congress's power under the Spending Clause. Justice Roberts emphasized that conditions imposed on states must be explicit, and the case may have minimal impact on future funding grant conditions. The Supreme Court's decision on the ACA Medicaid expansion emphasized that conditions imposed on states must be explicit. Justice Roberts' opinion found that the changes imposed by the Medicaid expansion were not contemplated by the original statute, as it accomplished a shift in kind, not merely degree. The Medicaid expansion under the ACA changed the program by requiring states to provide healthcare to the entire nonelderly population with income below 133% of the poverty level. This shift was seen as part of a national plan for universal healthcare, different from the original Medicaid program. Congress created separate funding to cover the costs of providing services to the newly eligible population. The Medicaid expansion under the ACA required states to cover the nonelderly population with income below 133% of the poverty level. Congress will pay 90% of the costs for newly eligible individuals, but they will receive less comprehensive coverage. Justice Roberts found that states were not adequately informed about the possibility of including new populations in their Medicaid coverage. After the Dole case, lower courts have not closely scrutinized the relatedness requirement for grant conditions. Some courts have even avoided this inquiry, suggesting that states can seek relief through the political process. The impact of NFIB on this aspect of the Dole analysis is questioned, as lower courts may increase scrutiny on the relatedness requirement. Justice Roberts' emphasis on \"new and independent\" programs in the opinion may implicitly address the relatedness inquiry of Dole. Justice Roberts' opinion in NFIB implicitly addresses the \"relatedness\" inquiry of Dole, but does not explicitly discuss whether the \"new and independent\" grant condition analysis was meant to be separate from or replace the relatedness inquiry. There are significant differences between the two inquiries, with Dole focusing on the Spending Clause and NFIB emphasizing Tenth Amendment concerns. While Dole's \"relatedness\" and \"coercion\" inquiries are disjunctive, NFIB's emphasis on \"new and independent programs\" may lead to increased scrutiny on the relatedness requirement by lower courts. The NFIB analysis in Justice Roberts' opinion addresses the \"new and independent program\" and \"coercion\" inquiries conjunctively, potentially narrowing the Dole \"relatedness\" doctrine. Lower courts may need further clarification before applying this limiting rule to Dole challenges. Despite this, an unrelated grant condition can still be deemed unconstitutional under the Spending Clause without being coercive. No federal statute has been found to fail under this standard. No federal statute has ever been found to fail under the requirement of the Spending Clause. The Court recognizes four types of grant conditions: \"Directly Related Conditions,\" \"Indirectly Related Conditions,\" \"Independent Program Conditions,\" and \"Unrelated Program Conditions.\" A coercion analysis may not be crucial for three of these types. \"Directly Related Conditions\" are likely to be upheld, while \"Unrelated Program Conditions\" are likely to fail regardless of the withheld funds. The analysis for \"Indirectly Related Conditions\" still involves coercion, but past rulings suggest they are unlikely to be constitutionally invalid. Only when a court determines a grant condition to be unconstitutional will it be deemed so. Prior to NFIB, the Supreme Court had difficulty determining coercion in grant conditions. In Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, the Court rejected the argument that motive equals coercion, emphasizing the freedom of will in law. The Supreme Court has historically struggled to define coercion in grant conditions, with cases like Steward Machine Co. v. Davis emphasizing the freedom of will in law. Recent cases like NFIB and Steward have avoided setting clear standards for coercion, instead focusing on whether the level of persuasion crosses the line into compulsion. Justice Roberts characterized the threatened loss of over 10 percent of a state's overall budget as coercion in the context of federal Medicaid funds. This level of withdrawal represents a \"gun to the head\" and leaves the state with no real option but to agree to the Medicaid expansion. The comparison was made to the amount of federal transportation funds threatened to be withheld in a previous case, which was characterized as \"less than half of one percent\" of a state's budget. The issue of grant withdrawals between 10% and one-half of 1% remains unaddressed. Justice Roberts' failure to \"draw a line\" in NFIB regarding grant withdrawals between 10% and one-half of 1% could complicate future predictions on grant conditions. The withdrawal of all Medicaid funds for not meeting ACA requirements would disrupt state finances, but it is unclear how this compares to withdrawals from other federal programs. Prior to NFIB, coercion claims for grants in areas like state prisons, education, welfare, and transportation had been rejected by federal courts of appeals. The Court in NFIB considered whether a court should analyze the burden of compliance imposed by a federal grant condition as part of a coercion analysis, particularly in relation to the Medicaid expansion. The analysis under Dole has traditionally focused on the amount of federal funds withheld, but the states argued that the Court should also consider the additional expenses required to comply with ACA Medicaid requirements. The Court did not indicate that a coercion analysis varied based on the burden of compliance imposed on the states by a grant condition. Instead, the focus was on whether the grant condition threatened the state's sovereignty. The Court's decision in Dole suggests that any grant condition threatening a state's sovereignty would be unconstitutional, regardless of the financial burden. Justice Roberts confirmed this in NFIB, stating that the size of the financial burden is irrelevant in determining coercion. The Supreme Court's decision in NFIB addressed whether states are coerced into compliance with expanded requirements under the ACA through the threat of withholding Medicaid reimbursements. This coercion test, established in South Dakota v. Dole, had not been used to strike down a federal statute before NFIB. It remains unclear if NFIB has altered the analysis from Dole. The NFIB decision may not have significantly changed the Dole analysis regarding grant conditions related to federal funds. Justice Roberts' decision in NFIB distinguishes between different types of grant conditions, including those directly related to federal funds, policy goals, and new grant programs. The decision confirms that grant conditions directly tied to federal funds in state programs are subject to scrutiny. The constitutionality of grant conditions related to federal funds in state programs depends on their direct relation to the expenditure of funds, policy goals, and the impact on a state's budget. If a condition is directly related to federal funds or policy goals, it is likely constitutional under the Spending Clause. However, if the condition is unrelated or coercive, it may be deemed unconstitutional under the Tenth Amendment. After NFIB, coercion in grant conditions may be relevant when states risk losing existing funds by not adopting a new program. Justice Roberts found withholding 10% of a state's budget to be coercive, but did not establish a standard for grant withdrawals below that threshold. If a new program is coercively mandated, a court would need to assess the situation. In response to the issue of coercive mandates for new programs, Justice Roberts determined that the remedy under the Tenth Amendment was not to strike down the program but to disallow the threat of withholding existing funds. The Court held that Congress intended to preserve the authority to withhold funds for non-compliance with conditions, allowing the ACA Medicaid expansion to proceed while making state participation voluntary."
