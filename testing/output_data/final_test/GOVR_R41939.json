    "content": "President Barack Obama submitted his request for military construction appropriations for FY2012 to Congress. The House Committee on Appropriations introduced the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for 2012 (H.R. 2055) on May 31. The House passed the bill on June 14, 2011, after debates on provisions affecting military construction projects, including Section 415 which was removed by a close vote. The House passed H.R. 2055 on June 14, 2011, which included provisions on construction projects and labor agreements. One amendment proposed to bar Davis-Bacon prevailing wage standards on military projects, but was defeated. The bill was then referred to the Senate Committee on Appropriations, where it was reported as an amendment in the form of a substitute. Cloture was invoked on July 13, and the bill was laid before the Senate on July 14. H.R. 2055 was passed by the Senate with amendments and appointed conferees. Temporary funding bills were enacted to continue funding for military construction projects at FY2011 levels. Five continuing resolutions have been passed so far. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012, H.R. 2112, P.L. 112-55, funded various departments through December 16, 2011. The Fourth Continuing Resolution (H.J.Res. 94, P.L. 112-67) and the Fifth Continuing Resolution (H.J.Res. 95) extended funding through December 23, 2011. The \"Minibus\" act funded Agriculture, Commerce, Justice, Science, and Transportation/HUD for the fiscal year. Sections 102 and 110 of P.L. 112-33 restricted the use of funds for new projects in the Department of Defense. The language in the Act continued through subsequent temporary funding acts, preventing new military construction projects. On December 7, 2011, Representative Hal Rogers asked for House disagreement with the Senate amendment to H.R. 2055. Conferees Senator Daniel K. Inouye and Representative Harold Rogers aimed to combine nine FY2012 appropriations bills into an amended H.R. 2055 for passage. The conferees combined nine FY2012 appropriations bills into an amended H.R. 2055, which was reported to both chambers for passage. The resulting appropriations bill was referred to as \"Megabus\" in press coverage. The House and Senate agreed to the conference report on December 16 and 17, 2011, respectively. The Senate passed the bill on December 17 with a Yea-Nay vote (67-32) and sent it to the House the same day. The President signed it into law on December 23, making it P.L. 112-74. Section 114 of Title 10, United States Code, requires Congress to authorize funding for the Department of Defense, including military construction, through the annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The NDAA for FY2012 (H.R. 1540) was introduced in the House on April 14, 2011. The NDAA for FY2012 (H.R. 1540) was introduced in the House on April 14, 2011, passed by the House on May 26, and received by the Senate on June 6, 2011. The Senate introduced its version (S. 1253) on June 22, 2011, and a second version (S. 1867) was introduced on November 15, debated, and passed on December 1 with a vote of 93-7. The NDAA for FY2012 (H.R. 1540) was passed by the Senate after incorporating S. 1867 as an amendment and appointing conferees for a conference. The House disagreed with the Senate amendment but eventually agreed to a conference. The conferees filed their report, which was approved by both the House and Senate, leading to the bill being signed into law as P.L. 112-81 on December 31, 2011. The military construction appropriations account under P.L. 112-81 includes various subaccounts for Military Construction, NATO Security Investment Program, Family Housing, and DOD Housing Improvement Fund. These accounts provide funds for construction, planning, design, and maintenance to support military forces and DOD agencies. The DOD Housing Improvement Fund provides seed money for public-private arrangements to privatize military housing. The Homeowners Assistance Fund aids federal personnel unable to sell their homes near installations scheduled for closure. The ARRA expanded eligibility for wounded DOD and Coast Guard personnel. The Chemical Demilitarization Construction account funds disposal facilities for chemical weapons destruction. The Base Realignment and Closure Account funds environmental remediation for base closures and disposal of unexploded ordnance. The 2005 BRAC Account covers military construction and relocation. Funding details are listed in the Appendix. The 2005 BRAC Commission recommendations must be implemented by September 15, 2011. The 2005 BRAC Commission recommendations, approved by President George W. Bush, involved a complex program of construction and movement by defense agencies and military departments. Congress has concerns about the full implementation of some recommendations by the deadline, leading to a proposal in H.R. 1540 to allow the Secretary of Defense to extend completion of up to seven recommendations by a year. The Department of Defense requested an extension to complete up to seven BRAC recommendations, with estimated implementation costs totaling $34.5 billion. Initial estimates for the 2005 BRAC round included $17.9 billion for military construction and troop redeployment. The Department of Defense estimated one-time implementation costs for BRAC recommendations to rise from $17.9 billion in FY2007 to $34.2 billion in FY2010. Additional BRAC-related provisions were included in the FY2012 appropriations and authorization bills to address issues raised during the 2005 round of base closures and realignments. Section 2706 proposes adding evaluation criteria for future closures to consider the infrastructure of existing and receiving communities, including transportation infrastructure costs. The recommendation includes the closure of Umatilla Chemical Depot in Oregon, which has been demilitarizing chemical munitions in compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention Treaty. The Secretary of Defense estimated completion of work at Umatilla by the end of FY2011 and recommended its closure during the 2005 BRAC round. The Umatilla Chemical Depot in Oregon, which has been demilitarizing chemical munitions in compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention Treaty, was recommended for closure during the 2005 BRAC round. The Department of the Army now plans to remove Umatilla from the BRAC closure process and transfer responsibility for disposal of the property to the General Services Administration. Legislation may allow the Secretary of the Army to continue Umatilla's closure under BRAC authority. The Umatilla Chemical Depot in Oregon, recommended for closure during the 2005 BRAC round, is now planned to be removed from the closure process and transferred to the General Services Administration. Japan is constructing a new air facility in Okinawa for U.S. Marine Corps aviation units, with plans formalized at a joint U.S.-Japan ministerial meeting in 2011. The Senate Committee on Armed Services expressed concern about the delay in completing the Futenma Replacement Facility (FRF) in Okinawa, estimating it would take 7 to 10 years and cost $5.0\u201310.0 billion. They suggested relocating Marine aviation assets to Kadena Air Base instead. The Senate's version of the NDAA includes a provision for an independent panel to assess U.S. force posture in East Asia and the Pacific Region, focusing on force realignments in Okinawa and Guam. Japan has agreed to move 8,000 Marines from Okinawa to Guam, with Japan providing $6 billion of the $10 billion needed for the relocation. Congress has criticized the pace of DOD planning for the move, leading to a recommendation to defer construction funding for overseas projects pending a DOD review of its global posture. The DOD is waiting for progress on the FRF project in Japan before starting construction for Marines relocating from Okinawa to Guam. The House Committee on Appropriations supports the realignment but has concerns about funding and construction timelines. The Senate Committee on Appropriations also expressed concerns about the lack of cost estimates for the project. The Committee deferred funding for fiscal year 2012 military construction projects related to the relocation of United States Marines to Guam due to concerns over cost estimates, lack of a comprehensive master plan, and uncertainty about Japan's commitment to relocate troops from Okinawa. This included Navy projects for water utility services and utility services at Andersen Air Force Base. The Senate version of the NDAA also removed funding for these projects. The House authorized full funding for construction projects, but the Senate's version of the NDAA included a provision to halt funding for the Marine relocation to Guam until certain conditions were met. This provision was carried into subsequent amendments. The Department of State announced in 2011 that the completion of the FRF and Marine relocation projects in Japan would be delayed past 2014. U.S. ground forces have been stationed in South Korea since the Korean Armistice in 1954, with a major headquarters complex in Yongsan near Seoul. The headquarters of U.S. Forces, Korea and U.S. Army and Air Force units are being concentrated into two large military communities centered on Osan Air Base and Camp Humphreys, south of Seoul. Tours of duty for military personnel are being lengthened, allowing servicemembers to bring their families with them, significantly increasing the size of these communities. The GAO reported that DOD cost estimates total $17.6 billion through 2020 for initiatives in South Korea, including extending tour lengths and moving dependents, which could cost $5 billion by 2020 and $22 billion or more through 2050. The Department of Defense's initiative for tour normalization in South Korea lacks a business case analysis to determine cost-effectiveness. Concerns arise over the $13 billion construction program at Camp Humphreys. The House Committee on Appropriations criticizes the costly task of normalizing deployments, including establishing two-year tours for single servicemembers and three-year tours for married servicemembers with families. The Committee directs the Secretary of Defense to report on the total cost and plan for Tour Normalization in Korea within 60 days. Concerns have been raised about the lack of a business case analysis for the $13 billion construction program at Camp Humphreys to accommodate the relocation of U.S. troops and tour normalization. The Committee expects detailed cost information and a completed business case analysis for the strategic objectives driving the decision to implement tour normalization in Korea. This analysis should evaluate alternative courses of action and recommend the most cost-effective approach. The Senate Committee on Armed Services included Section 2113 into S. 1253, its version of the NDAA for FY2012, which would bar funds from being used for tour normalization until a cost analysis is conducted by DOD's Director of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation. This section was carried over into subsequent legislation. Army and Air Force personnel in Germany are being consolidated into two military communities centered at Kaiserslautern. The military construction supporting the relocation of Army and Air Force personnel in Germany is concentrated in Kaiserslautern and Grafenw\u00f6hr-Vilseck. The Secretary of Defense agreed to reconsider moving two brigade combat teams from Germany to the United States after the Quadrennial Defense Review. The President's FY2012 request includes $563 million for construction in Germany, including $249 million for the relocated European Army and Air Force Exchange Central Distribution Facility. The DOD Education Agency is requesting $207 million for school construction projects, Tricare Management Agency plans to replace a military medical center at Rhine Ordnance Barracks for $1.2 billion, and various other military construction projects are being requested by different agencies. The Senate Committee on Appropriations is considering efficiency initiatives announced by the Secretary of Defense in 2010. The Secretary of Defense announced the restructuring of headquarters commands in Europe to reduce overhead. The Army will reduce Army Brigade Combat Teams in Europe from four to three after 2015. The Army is facing challenges in articulating its long-term plans and justification for forces and installations in Europe. The Committee directs the Army and European Command to provide a report on installations and properties in Germany to be returned to the host nation. The Senate adopted an amendment preventing military construction funding at Army garrisons in Germany until a report on installations to be returned is submitted. The NDAA includes a provision extending the Secretary of Defense's authority to use funds for construction in USCENTCOM areas and Africa. The Secretary of Defense has the authority to use funds for construction in USCENTCOM areas and Africa, with an additional $300 million available for construction in Afghanistan. The Department of Veterans Affairs provides benefits and services to veterans through three primary organizations. The Department of Veterans Affairs offers benefits such as rehabilitation, medical care, insurance, home loan guarantees, burial benefits, and educational/training assistance for veterans. VA appropriations for benefits and services have increased from $65.84 billion in FY2005 to $120.64 billion in FY2011, with a proposed budget of $128.27 billion for FY2012. Additionally, $52.54 billion in advance funding for VA medical care was requested for FY2013. The VA appropriations for FY2012 in H.R. 2055 totaled $128.09 billion, with $50.61 billion in advance funding. The Conference Agreement for H.R. 2055 allocated $122.23 billion for FY2012, including $50.61 billion in advance funding. Mandatory funding exceeds discretionary funding for the VA, with mandatory funding at 53.3% in FY2011. The American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC) is responsible for maintaining U.S. monuments and memorials honoring the achievements of the Armed Forces since World War I. They oversee 24 cemeteries and 25 memorials abroad and in the U.S. The U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, established in 1988, has exclusive jurisdiction to review decisions of the Board of Veterans' Appeals and can compel action by the VA. It can hold decisions by the VA or the Board as unconstitutional or unlawful. The Secretary of the Army oversees Arlington National Cemetery and the Soldiers' and Airmen's Home National. The Arlington National Cemetery serves as a national cemetery with numerous non-funeral ceremonies and millions of visitors annually. The executive director must provide a plan for modernizing the information technology system within 90 days of enactment. The Armed Forces Retirement Home Trust Fund supports facilities in Washington, DC, and Gulfport, MS, providing housing and medical care for needy veterans. The Gulfport and Washington, DC facilities provide long-term housing and medical care for needy veterans. The Gulfport campus was damaged by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, with residents temporarily relocated to the DC location. The rebuilding of the Gulfport facility was completed in 2010. Funding for repairs to the DC campus was included in the FY2012 appropriations. Funding for FY2012 appropriations for related agencies, including the FY2011 enacted appropriations, Administration request, and H.R. 2055 funding."
