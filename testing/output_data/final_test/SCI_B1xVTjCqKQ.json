The first challenge is the difficulty in describing real-world signals as perfectly sparse vectors and the suboptimal nature of traditional random measurement schemes. The second challenge is the lack of speed in existing signal recovery algorithms for real-time applications. A novel framework based on deep learning is presented to tackle these challenges. The approach involves using a maximum likelihood formulation to find informative measurements and implementing a data-driven dimensionality reduction protocol using convolutional architectures. Additionally, a novel parallelization scheme is discussed to significantly speed up the signal recovery process. The text discusses the signal recovery process and the improvement achieved through experiments. It focuses on high-dimensional inverse problems and low-dimensional embeddings in machine learning and signal processing, particularly in compressive sensing. The goal is to recover a signal from measurements using a linear or non-linear sensing operator. Sparse signal representation and recovery have had a significant impact in various fields over the past decade. While sparse signal representation and recovery have had a significant impact in various fields over the past decade, challenges remain in fully realizing their promise. Two major obstacles include the sub-optimal measurement operators due to approximately sparse real-world signals and slow convergence of existing recovery algorithms. A new framework is proposed in this paper to address both challenges by formulating the learning of dimensionality reduction as a likelihood maximization problem, related to the Infomax principle, to optimize the objective functions in learning the dimensionality reduction. The framework proposed in this paper addresses challenges in sparse signal representation and recovery by optimizing objective functions for dimensionality reduction. It can learn reductions preserving geometric properties and outperform competing algorithms like NuMax. Additionally, a parallelization scheme speeds up signal sensing and recovery, outperforming state-of-the-art methods like DAMP and LDAMP. The framework proposed in this paper optimizes objective functions for dimensionality reduction in sparse signal representation and recovery. It outperforms competing algorithms like NuMax and includes a parallelization scheme for faster signal sensing and recovery, surpassing methods like DAMP and LDAMP. Additionally, the framework shows outstanding performance in low-dimensional embedding with real datasets, offering a more efficient and effective approach compared to existing methods. Our framework for sensing and recovering sparse signals is a variant of a convolutional autoencoder with a linear encoder and a nonlinear decoder specifically designed for compressive sensing (CS) applications. It includes rearrangement layers to speed up the signal recovery process. Unlike image compression, our focus is on CS where measurements are abstract and linear. Our framework for compressive sensing (CS) uses a data-driven approach for upscaling measurements, unlike traditional bicubic interpolation methods. Previous works focused on block-based recovery in CS using convolutional networks, but our method senses and recovers images without subdivision, making it more suitable for applications like medical imaging. Our method for compressive sensing in medical imaging outperforms state-of-the-art results without using extra denoisers like BM3D or DCN. Unlike other approaches, our framework does not require subdivision and utilizes a convolutional structure for the encoder, making it more efficient for large-scale problems. Additionally, our decoder consists of several convolutional layers and a rearranging layer, different from the T-step projected subgradient used in other methods like SRA. The DeepSSRR framework for sparse signal representation and recovery utilizes convolutional layers for optimization over convolution weights and biases. It aims to learn optimal projections and accelerate signal recovery through parallelization. DeepSSRR utilizes deep convolutional networks for learning optimal projections and accelerating signal recovery. The framework imposes a convolutional network architecture on both \u03a6 and f \u039b (.) to exploit sparse connectivity and shared weights for faster learning. It can easily be extended to nonlinear measurements by adding nonlinear units to convolutional layers. Multiple layers are used for learning \u03a6 to reduce computational cost and improve performance. The DeepSSRR framework utilizes deep convolutional networks for learning optimal projections and accelerating signal recovery. It incorporates separate and smaller kernels for computational efficiency and nonlinearities. A parallelization scheme is added for learning \u03a6 and f \u039b (.) to speed up the sensing and recovery process. The sensing model involves a convolution operation with specific parameters for input signal X and output Y. The DeepSSRR framework uses deep convolutional networks for efficient signal recovery. It involves vector-matrix multiplication with specific parameters for input and output sizes. Parallelization is used for faster learning of \u03a6 and f \u039b (.), reducing computational complexity compared to traditional algorithms. The DeepSSRR framework utilizes deep convolutional networks for signal recovery by dividing the input signal into sub-signals and running parallel convolutions. This process constructs an embedding \u03a6 through several convolutional layers, reducing computational complexity compared to traditional algorithms. The DeepSSRR framework uses deep convolutional networks to convert vector Y into a tensor of length M and depth r. Channels are unstacked similar to the sub-pixel layer architecture BID33 to derive the final reconstruction X. The framework utilizes MSE as a loss function and ADAM BID21 for learning convolution kernels and biases. The design of \u03a6 is crucial, as random projections are not optimal for structured signals. Learning optimal measurement matrices from large-scale datasets of similar signals is essential for successful signal recovery. The optimal measurement operator \u03a6 maximizes the probability of training data given undersampled projections. It follows the infomax principle and maximizes mutual information between input signals and measurements. The framework reconstructs input signals using a function f(.) and defines the measurement matrix for successful signal recovery. The function f(.) reconstructs input signals as the best reconstruction to generate training data with the highest probability. In practice, a parametric distribution q(X| X) is maximized instead of the true underlying probability distribution. Maximizing this distribution is equivalent to maximizing a lower-bound of true conditional entropy and mutual information between input signal X and undersampled measurements Y. DeepSSRR is designed for jointly sensing and recovering sparse signals for CS applications. The sensing part of DeepSSRR can be trained for dimensionality reduction tasks, creating a linear low-dimensional embedding for applications like nearest neighbor search and CS sensing matrices design. Algorithm 1 showcases the use of DeepSSRR's low-dimensional embedding matrix \u03a6 to create a near-isometric embedding by penalizing deviation from isometry. The performance of DeepSSRR is compared against other methods in various problems, including linear embeddings and nonlinear algorithms. The study compares DeepSSRR's nonlinear version and a DCN using Gaussian projections on a grayscale CIFAR-10 dataset. DeepSSRR outperforms other methods in achieving a given isometry constant with fewer measurements, except in cases where a good isometry is not required. The DCN outperforms the nonlinear version of DeepSSRR when isometry is not demanded, despite having more parameters. A convolutional layer is represented by a circulant matrix multiplied by the input vector. The number of nonzero elements in the circulant matrix depends on the filter size, increasing with more layers. There are lower bounds on nonzero elements to ensure near-isometry. The isometry constant decreases as the final embedding matrix has more nonzero elements. Approximate Nearest Neighbors face challenges in high-dimensional datasets when finding the closest k points to a query datapoint. The challenge of finding the closest k points to a query datapoint in high-dimensional datasets can be addressed by creating a near-isometric embedding. Comparing different methods in the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN) problem, DeepSSRR's low-dimensional embedding outperforms others by retaining a higher fraction of k-nearest neighbors. This is shown in FIG2, where DeepSSRR's embedding with smaller sizes in both settings proves to be more effective. In the second part, DeepSSRR's performance is evaluated for compressive image recovery by comparing it with DAMP and LDAMP algorithms. DAMP uses random Gaussian \u03a6 while DeepSSRR learns a \u03a6. LDAMP is run for 10 layers with a 20-layer DCN. DeepSSRR uses a BM3D denoiser at every iteration and has 7 convolutional layers for image recovery, trained with batches of 128 images from ImageNet BID31. The computational complexity is O(M N) due to matrix vector multiplication in each layer. The computational complexity of DeepSSRR is O(M) in each convolutional layer, with the number of layers not necessarily improving signal recovery. Adding skip connections can help mitigate non-convexity issues. DeepSSRR introduces a framework for learning optimal sensing schemes and fast signal recovery procedures. The study compares DeepSSRR to DeepInverse and LASSO for sparse signal recovery. Future research directions include exploring adversarial training and quantifying model generalizability. Training and test sets consist of wavelet-sparsified 1D signals from CIFAR-10 images. DeepSSRR and DeepInverse are compared for sparse signal recovery using undersampled measurements of data. DeepSSRR has 3 layers for learning \u03a6 and 3 layers for learning f \u039b (.) with filter size 25 \u00d7 1, while DeepInverse has five layers for learning the inverse mapping with filter size 125 \u00d7 1. The phase transition plot in Figure 5(a) shows the probability of signal recovery success based on undersampling ratio and normalized sparsity level. DeepSSRR outperforms DeepInverse and LASSO in sparse signal recovery, with fewer parameters and better performance on test signals. The problem instances studied are on the \"failure\" side of the phase transition curve. DeepSSRR has fewer parameters (less than 70,000 vs. approximately 200,000 parameters) and learns adaptive measurements, leading to faster convergence compared to DeepInverse. It outperforms LASSO after only 4 training epochs, showcasing its efficiency in sparse signal recovery. DeepSSRR significantly outperforms LASSO in sparse signal recovery, especially above or on the 1 phase transition. Below the 1 phase transition, LASSO slightly outperforms. DeepSSRR learns a transformation for recovering original signals from measurements. In this section, the use of DeepSSRR for compressive image recovery is compared to 1-minimization. The reconstruction of the mandrill image is shown, with our method outperforming LDAMP in recovering the texture of the nose and cheeks. Our method also has better visual quality and fewer artifacts. Additionally, the running time of different algorithms is compared. In this section, the running time of different algorithms for image reconstruction is compared. The authors in BID25 used coded diffraction pattern in DAMP and LDAMP, simplifying computational complexity. LDAMP uses 3x3 filters while our method uses 5x5 filters. Our method is almost 4 times faster than LDAMP according to Table 3."
