    "content": "PROTECTION OF HEALTH AND SAFETY DURING DISASTERS. Definitions in this section include a certified monitoring program for medical monitoring of participating responders, a disaster area declared by the President, and a high exposure level to a substance of concern. An individual is defined as a worker or volunteer who responds to a disaster involving transportation in the United States, such as a police officer, firefighter, or emergency medical technician. An individual responding to a disaster involving transportation in the United States may include a police officer, firefighter, emergency medical technician, urban search and rescue team member, or other relief worker determined appropriate by the President. This also encompasses workers assisting in cleanup or restoration of critical infrastructure in a disaster area, as well as residents affected by the disaster. The term \"participating responder\" refers to an individual involved in responding to a disaster in the United States, including emergency personnel and relief workers determined appropriate by the President. This also includes individuals assisting in cleanup or restoration efforts in a disaster area. The term \"responder\" refers to an individual involved in responding to a disaster in the United States. The term \"program\" refers to a program carried out for a disaster area. The term \"substance of concern\" refers to a chemical or substance associated with potential human health effects, with exposure risk potentially increased by a disaster. If a disaster area is declared and substances of concern disrupt the transportation system, the President can implement a program for coordinating, protecting, assessing, monitoring, and studying the health and safety of individuals with high exposure levels. This ensures that individuals are informed, protected, monitored, and studied for potential health impacts in a timely manner. The program includes monitoring individuals over time for health impacts of substances, providing healthcare referrals, and using data to prevent future health impacts. Activities may involve collecting environmental data and disseminating educational materials. The program involves monitoring individuals for health impacts, providing healthcare referrals, establishing an exposure registry, studying human health impacts through health studies, and assisting individuals with health coverage eligibility. Activities should be timely for effective public health protection. Participation in registries and studies under the program is voluntary, with privacy protection measures in place. Priority is given to participants in any registry or study to ensure effective monitoring and protection. The President, through the Secretary of Health and Human Services, can modify the priority of registries or studies for individuals with high exposure to harmful substances. Cooperative agreements can be carried out for health and safety monitoring. The President, through the Secretary of Health and Human Services, can select a medical institution or consortium near a disaster area to carry out a program under a cooperative agreement. Selection criteria prioritize proximity to the disaster area. The President can select a medical institution near a disaster area to carry out a program under a cooperative agreement. The selected institution must have appropriate experience in environmental or occupational health, toxicology, safety, clinical protocols, health monitoring, epidemiological studies, and mental health assessments. The President can select a medical institution near a disaster area to conduct long-term mental health studies, establish medical surveillance programs, and involve interested parties such as government agencies and response workers. The President can involve various groups in response to a disaster, including local residents, businesses, schools, healthcare providers, faith-based organizations, and other entities through advisory committees. Privacy regulations from the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act will be followed in carrying out programs. The President, through the Secretary of Health and Human Services, can include baseline clinical health examinations of participating responders in certified monitoring programs and may substitute them for baseline clinical health examinations under certain circumstances. Reports must be submitted annually after establishing a program and every five years thereafter. The President, through the Secretary of Health and Human Services, may submit a report to relevant authorities and Congress describing programs and studies carried out under a cooperative agreement. Additionally, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will contract the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study on disaster area health and environmental protection. The report on disaster area health and environmental protection will involve experts in various fields such as environmental health, safety, medicine, toxicology, epidemiology, mental health, and emergency planning. It will also include individuals from state and local health departments and environmental protection agencies. The report will provide advice on protecting and monitoring the health of individuals exposed to chemicals or substances during disasters. It will involve experts from various fields and agencies, including state and local environmental protection departments, first responders, public health, and family services. The report will provide guidance on responding to chemical or substance releases in disaster areas to protect public health and safety, including sample collection, analysis methods, threshold levels, and response actions. The curr_chunk outlines procedures for monitoring and reporting chemical releases, including responsibilities of government agencies and capabilities within the system. The curr_chunk discusses the capabilities and capacity of the Federal Government for environmental monitoring and response in disasters, including terrorist attacks. Authorization of appropriations is also mentioned."
