LIMITATION ON USE OF GENERIC INFORMATION IN EMPLOYMENT. It is unlawful for any covered entity to discriminate against an employee based on genetic information, including hiring, firing, compensation, or privileges of employment. This includes limiting or segregating employees based on genetic information. It is unlawful for a covered entity to request genetic information from an employee or their family, except in specific circumstances such as inadvertent requests or when health services are offered with the employee's authorization. The employee or family member must provide voluntary, written authorization for genetic services. Only the individual and the healthcare professional involved receive identifiable information. Any genetic information disclosed is for service purposes only and must be kept confidential. (3) Covered entities can request family medical history from employees for compliance with FMLA certification provisions or state laws. (4) Entities can purchase publicly available documents that include family medical history.

Any employee or family member affected by a covered entity's violation of specific sections can seek compensatory and punitive damages in Federal court. Punitive damages are limited to 30 percent of compensatory damages. In this Act, a covered entity includes Federal agencies, State or local entities receiving Federal funds, or Federal contractors. A family member is defined as a spouse, dependent child, or blood relative. Genetic information refers to an individual's genetic tests or those of their family members.
