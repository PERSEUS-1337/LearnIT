    "content": "The Act titled \"Community Recreation and Conservation Endowment Act of 1997\" is established for the purpose of promoting community recreation and conservation. Congress recognizes the visionary concept of the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965, which aimed to create public places for recreation and benefit from natural resources. States and local governments were intended to play a crucial role in achieving the Act's goals by receiving funds. A new vision is needed for a national network of parks, recreation areas, and open spaces to meet the high demand from citizens. National parks alone are not sufficient, and federal funding alone cannot achieve this goal. State, local, and private sector involvement is necessary, along with realistic national funding support. The United States Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Alaska that the U.S. retains title to lands under Alaska's North Slope tidal waters, resulting in $1.6 billion in oil and gas lease sale revenues to be received. Placing these funds in an interest-bearing account will provide a permanent source of money for state and local needs. The Act aims to establish a Community Recreation and Conservation Endowment using oil and gas lease sale revenues from United States v. Alaska to fund state, local, and urban recreation and conservation needs. The Act establishes a Community Recreation and Conservation Endowment funded by oil and gas lease sale revenues from United States v. Alaska to support recreation and conservation needs at state, local, and urban levels. Section 6 of the Land and Water Conservation Act of 1965 is amended to create the Community Recreation and Conservation Endowment Account, funded by oil and gas revenues from United States v. Alaska for recreation and conservation purposes. The Community Recreation and Conservation Endowment Account is funded by oil and gas revenues from United States v. Alaska. Interest on the account is added to the principal and can be expended by the Secretary of the Interior for providing funds to states without further appropriation. SEC. 4. GENERAL AUTHORITY. Section 6 of the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 is amended to authorize the Secretary to provide financial assistance to states from interest earned on the Community Recreation and Conservation Endowment. Each state is required to make at least half of the average annual state apportionment available as grants to local governments and other qualified recipients, unless there is a compelling reason acceptable to the Secretary. The Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 is amended to allow the Secretary to provide financial assistance to states from interest earned on the Community Recreation and Conservation Endowment. States must allocate half of the average annual state apportionment as grants to local governments and qualified recipients. SEC. 5. APPORTIONMENT. Section 6(c) of the Land and Water Conservation Fund is amended to apportion interest earned on the Community Recreation and Conservation Endowment among states annually based on a formula. Sixty percent is divided equally among states, twenty percent based on population, and twenty percent based on urban population. The Land and Water Conservation Fund allocates interest earned on the Community Recreation and Conservation Endowment among states annually based on a formula. This includes dividing sixty percent equally among states, twenty percent based on population, and twenty percent based on urban population. The total allocation to a State under certain paragraphs should not exceed 10 percent of the total amount allocated to all States in a year. SEC. 6. FUNDS FOR INDIAN TRIBES. Section 6(c)(6) of the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 is amended to treat all federally recognized Indian tribes and Alaska Native Village Corporations collectively as one State for the purposes of receiving shares of the apportionment under paragraph (1) through a competitive grant program established by the Secretary. No single tribe or Village Corporation shall receive more than 10 percent of the total amount available to all tribes and Village Corporations. The total amount available to all tribes and Village Corporations under the apportionment shall be used for specified purposes. Receiving funds under this provision does not affect the eligibility for other grants. Section 5 of the Land and Water Conservation Act of 1965 is amended to remove the requirement that at least 40% of appropriations be available for Federal purposes."
