    "content": "Since the end of the Cold War, Russia has shifted its focus towards East Asia, especially after souring relations with the West due to aggression in Ukraine. Putin's 2012 promise to \"turn to the East\" has led to closer ties with countries in the region. In 2014, legislation was signed to offer incentives for businesses in the Russian Far East. Tax benefits and subsidies are being offered to businesses in the Russian Far East to expand trade with Asia, particularly with China, Japan, and South Korea. This move aims to capitalize on the region's energy needs and commercial opportunities, amidst economic sanctions imposed by the West. Russia's potential alignment with Tokyo could serve as a counterbalance to Beijing's influence, while its partnership with China challenges the U.S. \"rebalance\" to Asia strategy. Tensions between the U.S. and Russia have escalated since Russia's interventions in Ukraine and Syria, leading to multilateral sanctions and diplomatic isolation efforts by the U.S. and its Asian allies. Russia's economic power is declining, but it still maintains military capability, diplomatic capital, and nuclear status. Moscow views the world through an anti-U.S. lens and sees Asia as a potential area to challenge U.S. interests. Under President Putin, Russia's outreach to Asia has been inconsistent. Russia has accelerated military buildup on disputed northern islands claimed by Japan while pursuing warmer relations with Tokyo. Relations with North Korea soured after Kim Jong-un declined to attend a 2015 World War II commemorative ceremony in Moscow. Moscow alternates between summits with Beijing and shows of military might to counter China's moves in contested areas like the Arctic region. Despite some natural outlets for trade, the Russian economy remains poorly integrated with Asian countries. This report will examine Russia's engagement with Northeast Asian states since 2012 and evaluate the durability of these relationships. It will explore the potential for Russia to become a bigger geopolitical player in the region and its impact on U.S. interests. Russia's relations with countries in Northeast Asia are crucial for U.S. interests in the Asia-Pacific region. Congress may address this by holding hearings, expanding reporting requirements, and passing legislation focusing on Russia's engagement in Northeast Asia. A Chinese-Russian coalition poses a challenge to U.S. leadership in the region and globally. A united front by China and Russia could challenge U.S. leadership in the Asia-Pacific region and globally. The joint statement issued during Putin's visit to Beijing criticized U.S. military policies, potentially triggering a new arms race. Enhanced relations between China and Russia could diminish American and Western influence in international issues through the United Nations. A stronger partnership between Moscow and Beijing could limit U.S. ability to challenge China's assertiveness in the South China Sea and East China Sea. Russia has shown support for China's regional strategy, rebuffing U.S. positions on territorial claims. The U.S. government urges respect for international law and opposes coercion in addressing China's maritime claims. China and Russia have aligned in objecting to the deployment of a U.S. ballistic missile defense system on the Korean peninsula. This partnership could potentially shift the strategic balance of power in Asia, particularly in areas like the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait. Additionally, Russia's willingness to sell sophisticated military systems to China could further strengthen their relationship. The deployment of a U.S. ballistic missile defense system on the Korean peninsula has faced strong opposition from China and Russia, who view it as a direct threat to their security. This could potentially lead to a closer informal alliance between Beijing and Moscow, strengthening regional organizations like the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. The expansion of the SCO to include India and Pakistan may reduce U.S. economic leverage with its members. The closure of U.S. military bases in Central Asia has diminished its influence in the region. China and Russia are not fully aligned but share a desire to resist U.S. dominance in East Asia. South Korea and Japan's response to Russia could strain U.S. alliances and weaken international sanctions against Moscow. Tokyo's eagerness to engage with Russia, especially under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's leadership, could be seen as undermining U.S. efforts to isolate Putin diplomatically. The U.S.-Japan alliance has strengthened in recent years, with significant advances in their military cooperation. Implementation of Tokyo's 2015 security legislation is crucial for enhancing the alliance, dependent on strong relations at the leaders' level. Upgrades to the U.S.-Japan alliance may hinge on strong relations at the leaders' level. However, diverging diplomatic priorities on Russia could slow down the alliance's momentum. Some analysts suggest that a Japan-Russia partnership could benefit the U.S. in countering China's influence in the region, especially in the maritime domain. Russia's defense ties with Vietnam could potentially support Hanoi's claims in the South China Sea, while Japan seeks backing in its territorial dispute with China over the Senkaku Islands. Russia has not taken a stance on the East China Sea territorial disputes. South Korea's alliance with the United States has strengthened in response to North Korean provocations, including nuclear tests and missile launches. The deployment of the THAAD missile defense system has raised objections from Russia and China, potentially increasing domestic criticism in South Korea over its reliance on the U.S. Better ties with Russia could help Seoul gain more independence from Beijing. Korea's increased ties with Russia could provide another regional partner for pressuring North Korea. Russian support for North Korea may undermine U.S. and Chinese efforts for denuclearization talks. The Six-Party Talks, involving the U.S., China, Japan, South Korea, North Korea, and Russia, have not convened since 2008. Russia's renewed interest in the region could impact diplomatic efforts regarding North Korea's nuclear programs. Russia's renewed interest in the region could disrupt diplomatic efforts regarding North Korea's nuclear programs. Despite working with China to dilute UNSC resolutions, Russia ultimately signed on to a tough resolution in 2016 that could hurt its economic projects in North Korea. The resolution bans or limits North Korean exports, impacting Russian investments in the country. Russian companies may face disruptions in their investments and deliveries in North Korea, potentially resulting in significant economic losses for Moscow. It is uncertain how much economic assistance and trade Russia could offer North Korea, especially if Pyongyang is unwilling to pay market prices. Analysts suggest that if the US and its allies take more aggressive actions on the Korean Peninsula or if the regime in Pyongyang collapses, Moscow and Beijing may align in supporting North Korea to prevent a shift in regional balance. Both countries aim to counter US hegemony and are wary of the US military presence in Asia. Both Russia and China are critical of the U.S. military presence in Asia and often oppose U.S. efforts to enhance defense capabilities with Japan and South Korea. They hold vetoes on the UNSC and collaborate to adjust or oppose resolutions supported by Western countries. Both countries were unsettled by global \"color revolutions\" challenging authoritarian governments and are wary of U.S. involvement in such movements. Putin and Xi have shown mutual support in commemorating historical events, indicating a strong personal bond to strengthen bilateral relations. Putin and Xi have cultivated a strong friendship to strengthen bilateral relations, with both countries supporting each other in international disputes. Relations have been robust since Xi took power in 2012, marked by high-profile visits and agreements aimed at making a statement to Western countries. Notably, in 2014, China and Russia announced a $400 billion natural gas deal and over 40 economic cooperation agreements in response to Western sanctions on Russia. Russia's intervention in Ukraine strengthened cooperation with China but also created an imbalance in their relationship. The crisis led to closer ties and solidarity against Western sanctions, but also made Russia reliant on China's support. This dynamic allowed China to gain more concessions from Russia, including in energy deals, potentially creating an asymmetry in their partnership. Russia, still reeling from the loss of its superpower status, may be uncomfortable playing a subordinate role to China. Russia's economic and diplomatic strength has weakened, leading to closer ties with China. However, China, with more options, remains uneasy with Russia's invasion of Ukraine due to conflicting official statements. China's policy of \"benevolent neutrality\" towards the Ukraine crisis may shift if Russia engages in further military actions. Analysts are divided on the enduring Moscow-Beijing partnership, which is complex and dependent on external events. US behavior is a key variable, as China and Russia may strengthen relations if they feel challenged. Beijing may avoid an explicitly anti-Western alliance, focusing on trade. The Russia-China relationship is complex and characterized by strategic mistrust, with tensions arising from military advances and perceptions of Chinese migrants crossing the border. Beijing may not want an explicitly anti-Western alliance due to its trade volume with the United States and reluctance to confront the West directly. In the Russian Far East, there are suspicions about Chinese presence despite lower numbers. Russian popular opinion harbors concerns about Chinese influence in the resource-rich region. In Southeast Asia, Russia's strong historical relationship with Vietnam, including military access to Cam Rahn Bay, clashes with Chinese interests in the South China Sea. Russia aims to maintain its foothold in Southeast Asia without alienating other ASEAN powers by not fully supporting China's position. China's commercial interests are becoming wary of investing in Russian projects due to doubts about profitability. Investment efforts in Russia have fallen short of goals, with few large banks willing to take on risky ventures. Despite pledges to increase trade, Russia and China missed their interim goal by $35 billion in 2015. The relationship between the two countries is described as \"warm politics and cold economy,\" with trade plummeting in 2015. Trade between China and Russia saw a significant decline in 2015, mainly due to the drop in energy prices. China is Russia's largest trading partner, but Russia does not rank in China's top five partners. Security relations between the two countries have strengthened since 2012, with joint military exercises, including naval drills in the East China Sea and the Sea of Japan. Both countries aim to deepen military cooperation and send strong signals to the West. Russian arms sales to China have been a central aspect of the defense relationship, with sales running about $2-$3 billion annually in the early 2000s. Sales have recently seen an uptick, particularly since the Ukraine crisis, with Moscow agreeing to sell China sophisticated weaponry like Sukhoi Su-35 fighter jets and S-400 anti-aircraft missile systems. This increase in arms sales could lead to more technology transfers and cooperation on defense-related research and development. Competition and distrust arise in arms sales between Russia and China, with suspicions of design copying by China. Both countries target Asian and African middle-income countries in the international arms market. China's advantage lies in offering larger development packages with favorable loans and infrastructure investments. Despite common cause at the United Nations, Russia often defers to China in matters. In recent years, Russia has generally deferred to China on North Korea and China has followed Russia's lead on Syria negotiations. This pattern can build cooperation and trust between Moscow and Beijing, but tensions can arise. Russia was reportedly angered by China's failure to protect Russian interests in North Korean investments during UNSC debates on sanctions. Both countries often support each other's interests, especially in challenging U.S. global interests at the United Nations. China and Russia are advancing initiatives to strengthen trade and transportation networks between Europe, Asia, and Africa. China and Russia are advancing initiatives to strengthen trade and transportation networks between Europe, Asia, and Africa. China's \"One Belt, One Road\" initiative aims to develop energy infrastructure, roads, railways, ports, and industrial parks across three continents. Putin has proposed the Eurasian Economic Union concept to promote economic integration, with plans to expand membership to all former Soviet states. Tensions exist as Russia sees Central Asia as its traditional sphere of influence and is wary of China's infrastructure projects potentially redirecting economic activity towards China. In May 2015, China and Russia announced plans to link their trade and transportation initiatives, with China providing capital and Russia offering security assurances. However, little progress has been made in reconciling the projects. The declaration may have been more about avoiding hostility than actual action. In the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, Russia aims for security while China seeks economic dominance. The SCO highlights the shared need for cooperation. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) reinforces the need to counter Western efforts to contain China and Russia. It opposes intervention in other countries' internal affairs and supports national independence and sovereignty. In 2009, the SCO approved Russia's cyber-related proposal, identifying information threats as a security concern. China accused external forces of inciting color revolutions during the 2014 SCO meeting. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) was formed in 1996 by China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, with the initial purpose of managing border conflicts and maintaining stability in Central Asia. It has since expanded to focus on wider political, security, economic, and cultural issues, with China pushing for more economic roles within the organization. Military drills among members aim to combat \"terrorism, separatism, and extremism.\" India, Pakistan, and Iran are also involved in the SCO as observers. China is pushing the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) to take on more economic roles, including a potential free trade zone, SCO Development Bank, and Development Fund. Concrete steps have been slow due to concerns about Beijing's economic influence. Russia's efforts to improve relations with Japan have gained traction, despite sanctions imposed by Japan's G7 partners. Abe visited Putin in 2016 to discuss their territorial dispute. Abe visited Putin in Sochi, Russia to discuss the territorial dispute between Japan and Russia, pledging increased economic engagement. Plans were made to meet again at the Eastern Economic Summit in Vladivostok in September 2016, with a possible visit by Putin to Japan later in the year. Abe aimed to resolve the territorial dispute over four islands in the Kuril Chain during his first year in office. Relations between Moscow and Tokyo appeared vibrant in mid-2016. Relations between Russia and Japan were improving, with bilateral trade reaching a record high in 2013. Abe attended the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, despite Western powers distancing themselves from Russia due to Putin's policies. Japan, under Abe, faced skepticism from neighbors and a need for energy imports after shutting down nuclear power plants. A partnership between Russia and Japan made sense, with potential for energy cooperation and economic engagement. The Russian Far East offers abundant fossil fuels, and Japan sees Russian military moves in Eastern Europe as not directly threatening. Russia seeks customers for its resources and aims to be more engaged in the Pacific. Putin, facing international isolation, is challenged by falling energy prices and sanctions. Both countries are concerned about China's economic and geopolitical influence. Japan hopes to address territorial vulnerabilities to focus on China's intrusions in the Senkaku Islands. Russia and Japan are both concerned about China's increasing maritime presence in the Pacific. Efforts to upgrade the Russia-Japan relationship may falter due to Moscow's unpredictable foreign policy under Putin. Abe and Putin could potentially tilt the balance of regional relations in their favor if they cooperate strategically, potentially at the expense of China. Russia's unpredictable foreign policy under Putin has led to concerns about potential aggression towards rivals. Japan, reliant on Russian energy supplies, may view attempts to manipulate energy for political leverage as a warning. Development of Far East energy resources by Russian firms is problematic due to fluctuating geopolitical concerns. Both countries face pressure to not make concessions amid territorial disputes, especially after Russia's actions in Ukraine. Japan complied with Western pressure to isolate Moscow diplomatically and financially by imposing financial sanctions and freezing diplomatic initiatives. Despite restarting efforts to engage Russia, Tokyo faces challenges due to Western nations' efforts to punish Putin. The U.S.-Japan alliance influences Japan's strategic decisions, with Washington pressuring Tokyo to support U.S. foreign policy priorities. The two countries share a commitment to upholding international rules and norms. Japan and the United States prioritize upholding international rules and norms in their foreign policies, while Russia, under Putin's leadership, follows a more anti-American realpolitik approach. Despite efforts to improve relations, reconciling these differing views may prove challenging. Putin has highlighted the potential benefits of expanding trade with Japan, although current economic ties are not very strong. Foreign investment in Russia has been low compared to Japan's investments in India and Brazil. The dispute over the ownership of the Northern Territories has been a focal point in Japan's policy towards Russia. Efforts to resolve the dispute have been unsuccessful, with Japan insisting on the return of all four islands. Since Abe's return to office, his government has restarted efforts to resolve the territorial issue with Russia, but progress has been limited. Russia has consolidated its claims over the islands through military exercises and high-level emissaries, showing little willingness to cede territory. In August 2015, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev visited Etorofu, prompting Tokyo to lodge an official protest. After a 2016 meeting with Putin, Abe declared the need for a new approach without indicating a compromise. Putin suggested a willingness to transfer Shikotan and Habomai to Japan after a peace treaty. Japan continues to demand the return of all four islands, but some analysts see potential for compromise. Without resolving the territorial issue and signing a peace treaty, doubts remain about Japan and Russia's relationship. Many analysts doubt that Japan and Russia can advance bilateral relations due to deeply entrenched national identity issues associated with the territorial dispute. The question is if Putin and Abe, both strong nationalist figures, can reach a deal that serves their needs. Russia's interest in the divided Korean peninsula has not occupied a central role in its foreign policy, but as Moscow refocuses on East Asia, its relations with the Koreas have developed more fully. One Russian analyst suggests that Russia's desire to develop its natural resources and sell them to the Asian market could be strengthened by land access through the Koreas. Russian involvement in the Korean Peninsula is seen as crucial for Moscow, with a focus on stability and peace between North and South Korea. Russia's ties to North Korea provide leverage in the region, and analysts suggest that reunification may not threaten Russian interests. Moscow's \"look east\" strategy prioritizes maintaining the status quo to avoid a reduction in Russian influence. Russian analysts prioritize economic and infrastructure projects for inter-Korean cooperation. Russia opposes joint defensive exercises between the US and South Korea and shares concerns with China about US troop presence on its borders. Moscow is increasing its role in dealing with North Korean provocations and has joined UNSC resolutions condemning Pyongyang's nuclear tests. China and Russia have both diluted some of the toughest sanctions. After the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, North Korea lost economic support from its former patron and turned to China as its main economic partner. As relations between Pyongyang and Moscow weakened, Russia forgave a large portion of North Korea's debt and increased investment in the country for projects like a gas pipeline and rail. Russia forgave 90% of North Korea's debt and boosted investment in the country for projects like a gas pipeline and rail links. Despite initial improvements in defense relations, a rift emerged after Kim Jong-un rejected Putin's invitation to a World War II commemoration. This, combined with Pyongyang's provocations in 2016, halted any sustained upgrade in relations. Some analysts believe Moscow-Pyongyang cooperation could expand in the future as Putin seeks more influence in the region. Russia imposes the fewest demands on North Korea among the Six-Party Talks participants, promoting negotiations and economic development without conditions. If North Korea decides to end its isolation, it may seek closer coordination with Russia, which supports its political goals of reunification with independence from China and the United States. Foreign-funded infrastructure projects in North Korea have faced challenges, with plans for gas pipelines, electric transmission lines, and a railway through the Koreas encountering obstacles. The Special Economic Zone in Rason, North Korea, has attracted significant investment, particularly from China. Russia has also invested in the area, including constructing a railway connecting Rason to the Russian border city of Khasan. However, the railway is mainly used for coal deliveries to be sold in Asian markets. The SEZ could be a promising area for economic development but may also lead to competition with Chinese investors. President Park Geun-hye of South Korea sees Russia as a potential partner for economic integration and friendly political ties, especially in preparation for reunification. However, tensions have arisen as Moscow takes a more assertive role in dealing with North Korea. Both countries aim to diversify regional partnerships and reduce dependence on China. President Park Geun-hye of South Korea promoted her \"trustpolitik\" approach with North Korea and welcomed Russian plans for new rail and pipeline links through the country. The \"Eurasian Initiative\" aimed to strengthen European-Asian trade ties, but North Korea's missile and nuclear tests have hindered progress on cooperative projects. Since President Park Geun-hye's \"trustpolitik\" approach with North Korea, joint Russia-South Korea projects have faced setbacks due to missile and nuclear tests. South Korea halted coal transshipments from Russia after UN sanctions. Despite growing trade ties emphasized in presidential summits, Russia is South Korea's 15th largest trade partner, with energy dominating exports. Strategic differences have emerged, with Moscow viewing the U.S.-South Korea alliance differently than the U.S.-Japan alliance. Russian analysts view the U.S.-South Korean alliance as focused on stability in the Korean peninsula, but have skepticism towards some initiatives. Russia, along with China, criticized the deployment of the THAAD missile defense system, citing security concerns. Relations between South Korea and Russia have been strained by various factors, including Park's absence at a ceremony in 2015. South Korea has taken a harder line on sanctions against North Korea, while Russia prefers direct talks with Pyongyang. Some analysts believe Seoul is dismissive of Russia's role in the Peninsula's security issues, which displeases Moscow. The Arctic region is now a new arena of strategic competition due to climate change, with the Northern Sea Route becoming passable year-round, cutting travel time between Europe and Asia by 12 days. The Northern Sea Route can reduce travel time between Europe and Asia by 12 days, offering an alternative route for Japan's energy imports. Russia plans to increase the route's capacity by 20-fold in 15 years, leading to concerns about militarization in the Arctic as countries protect their interests. Russia and China have shown military competition in the region, with both countries increasing their presence. China is building a new icebreaker in the Arctic, sparking military tensions with Russia. Russian military exercises were conducted in response to Chinese naval warships appearing in the Sea of Okhotsk. Russia also held large-scale military exercises in 2015, including developing a new army brigade on the Yamal peninsula. The Arctic Council monitors issues in the region, with the United States, Russia, Canada, and Scandinavian countries as permanent members. Russia, along with the United States, Canada, and Scandinavian countries, are permanent members of the Arctic Council. Japan, China, and South Korea are observer nations. Russia supported Japan's application for observer status in 2009 but not China's. Japan's interest in Russia's Yamal LNG project may lead to cooperation in the Arctic for energy trade. However, tensions could arise due to the disputed Northern Territories and Russia's military presence. Russia's energy reserves attract Asian nations for closer diplomatic relations. Russia aims to strengthen energy trade with Japan, China, and South Korea to provide a stable source of energy imports. These nations heavily rely on fossil fuel imports from the Middle East, but Russia's increased focus on developing these markets could offer an alternative energy source. In February 2014, Russia raised its targets for exports to the Asia-Pacific region to 34% in its updated energy strategy. The Asia-Pacific region's energy trade has increased to 34% in Russia's updated strategy, with a focus on natural gas exports. However, the push for energy partnerships with Russia has waned due to various factors such as competition from the United States, declining energy prices, reluctance of private firms to invest, and sanctions limiting access to capital and technology for infrastructure development. Russia's energy deals with China have become crucial amid strained relations with the West. China, the world's largest energy consumer, is diversifying its energy sources due to slower economic growth. Moscow's strategy of playing countries against each other in bidding for projects adds political risk. Pipeline projects offer stability to buyers but give suppliers leverage. China aims to reduce dependence on Middle East energy. China aims to reduce its dependence on Middle East energy suppliers by signing large oil-for-loan deals with Russia. Russia supplies over 10% of China's crude oil imports, but China does not import significant amounts of LNG from Russia. The \"Power of Siberia\" and \"Altai\" gas pipelines agreements with Russia have been postponed until at least the 2020s, casting doubts on their profitability. China has diversified its energy suppliers, including developing deals with Central Asia. China's energy deals with Central Asia have caused tension with Russia, as Moscow sees these countries as part of its sphere of influence. Central Asia's gas fields now compete with Russia's reserves on the international market, benefiting China's energy security. Japan has limited success in energy relationships with Russia, with Japanese firms holding minority stakes in Sakhalin projects. Japan's energy portfolio has shifted to fossil fuels post-Fukushima disaster, leading to an interest in importing more LNG from the US. Despite territorial issues, Japan aims to develop a stable energy supplier in Russia, as seen in Abe's meeting with Putin in 2016. South Korea heavily relies on energy imports, with 97% coming from abroad. After reducing oil imports from Iran under US pressure in 2012, South Korea turned to Russia to make up the difference, importing 4%-5% of its LNG and oil from there. Despite not imposing sanctions on Russia after the Ukraine crisis, South Korea continues to pursue joint projects with Russia, particularly in the energy sector. South Korea's reliance on energy imports led to a shift towards importing LNG and oil from Russia. Plans for energy projects with Russia have been hindered by challenges in North Korea. Congress may monitor Russia's efforts to strengthen ties with Northeast Asia for global geopolitical implications. The executive branch keeps relevant committees informed of Tokyo, Beijing, Seoul, and Pyongyang's responses to Moscow's overtures. Congress may consider Russian involvement in issues like North Korean nuclear problem, Pacific maritime challenges, global energy policy, and U.S. rebalance to Asia. Russian \"Turn to the East\" could impact U.S. interests, including sanctions policy, Arctic policy, and military assets. Measures Congress could consider include additional hearings to assess Russia's efforts to upgrade relations with China, formal requirements for Defense and State Departments to report on Russia's relations with China, Japan, and the Korean Peninsula, and references in the NDAA to Russian activities in the Asia Pacific. Assessment of how existing sanctions on Russia are affected by U.S. allies' compliance. After Russia annexed Crimea in March 2014, international condemnation was swift and widespread. Russia was suspended from the G8, and in April 2014 the remaining G7 members imposed sanctions on Russia. Congress may examine whether Japan and South Korea should strengthen restrictions on trade with Russia and how the U.S. State Department prioritizes this issue in relations with Seoul and Tokyo. Hearings, reporting requirements, and possible legislation on the U.S. position in the Arctic region and how changing security relations among Northeast Asia countries affect the U.S. presence and resources in the Arctic. Japan and South Korea, along with Western countries, imposed sanctions on Russia after a U.N. resolution. Japan's sanctions were relatively weak, with no energy-sector-related sanctions. Tokyo links talks on Northern Territories to Ukraine situation. South Korea voted for the resolution but did not impose sanctions, likely seeking Moscow's cooperation on North Korea. China abstained from the U.N. vote on Ukraine's territorial integrity and did not impose sanctions on Russia. Beijing expressed discomfort with Crimea's annexation but sees it as an exception, possibly due to parallels with its own claims over Taiwan. China opposes independence through referendums but noted Crimea's importance to Russia. This stance may be a bid to seek more international partners and avoid isolation. North Korea supported Russia's position on Crimea's annexation, voting \"no\" on the U.N. resolution. This move was seen as an attempt to seek international partners and avoid isolation."
