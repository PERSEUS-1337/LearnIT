NIST conducts research in seven laboratories in Gaithersburg, MD, and Boulder, CO, employing around 3,000 scientists. NIST employs around 3,000 scientists, engineers, technicians, and support personnel in facilities in Gaithersburg, MD, and Boulder, CO. They collaborate with guest researchers from academia, industry, and government agencies on research focused on measurement, standards, test methods, and infrastructural technologies that enable advanced technology development and assist industry in material characterization and production quality assurance. NIST also conducts cooperative research with industry to overcome technical barriers to commercializing emerging technologies and manages programs like the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) and the Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NMI). NIST, also known as Manufacturing USA, has a specific mission outlined by statute and is led by a Senate-confirmed presidential appointee. Originally established as the National Bureau of Standards in 1901, NIST focuses on solving problems related to standards and determining physical constants and material properties. Several extramural programs previously conducted by NIST have been eliminated or integrated into other activities. NIST's mission focuses on standards, physical constants, and material properties. In 1987, the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Improvement Act established the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award for companies benefiting the U.S. economy through quality management practices. The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 expanded NIST's role as the lead national laboratory for providing measurements and quality assurance techniques to enhance U.S. industry competitiveness. It also changed the agency's name to the National Institute of Standards and Technology to reflect its expanded mission of supporting the private sector in developing generic technologies and diffusing government-developed innovation. The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 expanded NIST's role in providing measurements and quality assurance techniques to enhance U.S. industry competitiveness. It established the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) and the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership program to assist smaller manufacturing companies in adopting new technologies. The ATP was created to facilitate cooperation between the public and private sectors in industrial technology development. The Advanced Technology Program (ATP) provided seed funding for development of precompetitive technologies with high market potential. It was replaced by a new program under the America COMPETES Act in 2007. The America COMPETES Act replaced the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) with the Technology Innovation Program (TIP) in 2007. TIP focused on promoting R&D for small and medium-sized companies, while also involving universities in the innovation cycle. Appropriations for TIP were provided from FY2008 to FY2011, but no funding has been allocated since then. Since FY2011, appropriations have been provided for TIP. The America COMPETES Act and its reauthorization authorized funding for NIST accounts, aiming to double funding for selected accounts supporting physical sciences and engineering research. However, Congress's appropriations fell short of the authorizations, and subsequent budget requests did not mention the doubling goal. Additionally, a share of spectrum auction proceeds is designated for NIST under the Public Safety Trust Fund. The Wireless Innovation Fund (WIN) was established under P.L. 112-96 to provide NIST with $285.0 million from spectrum auction proceeds for developing advanced wireless technologies for public safety users. This initiative aims to support the creation of an interoperable nationwide broadband network for first responders. Additionally, President Obama proposed the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI) in FY2013 to invest in manufacturing technologies with broad applications. The National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI) was proposed by President Obama in FY2013 to invest in manufacturing technologies with broad applications. Congress did not act on this request initially, but in December 2014, the Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act of 2014 (RAMI Act) was enacted, establishing a Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NMI) to improve U.S. manufacturing competitiveness and leadership in advanced manufacturing research and technology. The Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act of 2014 established the Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NMI) to enhance U.S. leadership in advanced manufacturing research, technology, and workforce development. NIST was authorized to allocate up to $5.0 million annually from FY2015 to FY2024 for the program. The Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act of 2014 authorized funds for the Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NMI) from FY2015 to FY2024. The act also allowed existing manufacturing centers to be classified as centers for manufacturing innovation. In December 2015, specific funding was provided for the establishment and coordination of institutes under the provisions of the RAMI Act. NIST received $25.0 million for FY2016 for the NNMI. The RAMI Act provides NIST with $25.0 million for FY2016 for the NNMI, including funding for institutes and coordination activities. NIST launched a competition in February 2016 to establish institutes with up to $70 million in federal funding over five to seven years. Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker announced \"Manufacturing USA\" as the new brand name for the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation. NIST awarded the National Institute for Innovation in Manufacturing Biopharmaceuticals (NIIMBL) up to $70 million over five to seven years, with federal funding matched by private sources. The Consolidated Appropriations Acts of 2017 and 2018 provided funding for NNMI, with President Trump requesting $15.1 million for Manufacturing USA in FY2019. NIST also launched the Advanced Manufacturing Technology Consortia (AMTech) in July 2013. In July 2013, NIST introduced the AMTech and M-TAC programs to support long-term industrial research needs. AMTech aims to establish industry-led consortia to prioritize research projects, with initial funding of $14.5 million. The M-TAC program, a pilot effort under MEP, sought to address manufacturing challenges. The M-TAC program was a pilot effort under MEP to address technical and business challenges faced by small and mid-sized U.S. manufacturers in adopting advanced technologies. The funded projects have been completed, with final presentations made in May 2016. NIST receives discretionary funding through three appropriations accounts: STRS for in-house research, CRF for construction and maintenance of facilities. The CRF provided funding for construction and repair of NIST facilities in Gaithersburg, MD, and Boulder, CO. The ITS account supports NIST's extramural programs, including the MEP and NNMI programs. President Trump requested $629.1 million for NIST in FY2019, a decrease from the FY2018 enacted level. The House Appropriations Committee-reported level for FY2019 is $985 million. The House Appropriations Committee-reported level for FY2019 is $985 million, $213.5 million below FY2018 and $355.9 million above the request. The Senate Appropriations Committee-reported level is $1,037.5 million, $161.0 million below FY2018, $408.4 million above the request, and $52.5 million above the House committee-reported level. The President requested $15.1 million for the ITS account for FY2019, down $139.9 million from FY2018. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees have reported different levels of funding for the National Institute for Innovation in Manufacturing Biopharmaceuticals (NIIMBL) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for FY2019. The House committee would provide $140.0 million for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) program, while the Senate would provide $15.0 million for the NNMI. The President's requested funding for the NIST CRF account is significantly lower than the FY2018 enacted level. The CRF account for FY2019 is significantly lower than the FY2018 enacted level, with the House Appropriations Committee reporting $120.0 million and the Senate Appropriations Committee reporting $158.0 million. NIST has been funded under two continuing resolutions since December 2018, and the House passed a bill to provide funding at the Senate committee's levels. Total appropriations for NIST have increased from $707.5 million in FY2003 to $1,198.5 million in FY2018, with a compound annual growth rate of 3.6%. Requests exceeded appropriations from FY2010 to FY2017. Appendices provide detailed funding levels for NIST and its programs. Total appropriations for NIST increased from $707.5 million in FY2003 to $1,198.5 million in FY2018, with a compound annual growth rate of 3.6%. President Trump is requesting $629.1 million for NIST in FY2019, a $569.4 million reduction from FY2018. Appropriations for the NIST STRS account grew steadily until FY2016, but requests declined in FY2017, FY2018, and FY2019. President Trump is requesting $573.4 million for STRS in FY2019, a $151.1 million reduction from FY2018. Total appropriations for the STRS account increased from $357.1 million in FY2003 to $724.5 million in FY2018. The NIST CRF account has seen fluctuations in funding levels from FY2006 to FY2018. Funding jumped from $72.5 million in FY2006 to $532.0 million in FY2009, with fluctuations in subsequent years. In FY2016, CRF appropriations increased to $119.0 million, with a portion designated for renovation of NIST's radiation physics infrastructure. In FY2017, CRF appropriations were $109.0 million, with $60.0 million designated for the design and renovation of NIST's radiation physics infrastructure. The FY2018 CRF appropriations increased to $319 million, a $210.0 million (192.7%) jump from the previous year. President Trump is requesting $40.5 million for CRF in FY2019, a significant reduction from the FY2018 level. Funding for the NIST CRF account has historically supported construction grants for research facilities and congressionally designated projects. Total appropriations for the NIST ITS account have fluctuated over the years, falling from $284.8 million in FY2003 to $128.4 million in FY2012, then increasing to $155.0 million in FY2016. Funding levels have since remained flat, with President Trump requesting $15.1 million for ITS in FY2018, a significant reduction from the previous year. The MEP, NNMI, AMTech, ATP, TIP, and Baldrige programs have been included in the requests and appropriations. Total appropriations for the NIST MEP program have varied over the years, with funding levels fluctuating between $38.6 million in FY2004 to $140.0 million in FY2018. Requests have been lower than appropriations in some years, with President Trump proposing to wind down funding in FY2018 but Congress ultimately appropriating $140.0 million. In FY2019, President Trump is seeking no funding for MEP, a significant decrease from the previous year. In FY2019, President Trump is requesting no funding for MEP, which is $140.0 million below the FY2018 appropriation level. The Advanced Technology Program and the Technology Innovation Program have seen fluctuations in funding over the years, with requests and appropriations varying. The Technology Innovation Program received no funding since FY2012. NBS was renamed NIST in 1988, with additional missions and supporting programs introduced. The Advanced Technology Program and Manufacturing Extension Partnership program were introduced to enhance U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness, facing criticism for various reasons. NIST's traditional mission of laboratory research for standards and metrics continued to have strong support. The NIST STRS account had broad support but faced funding constraints despite being targeted for doubling efforts by former Presidents Bush and Obama. Concerns were raised in the early 2000s about the slow growth of federal investments in physical sciences and engineering research. In 2006, President Bush introduced the American Competitiveness Initiative to double funding for physical sciences and engineering research over 10 years. The America COMPETES Act set appropriations authorizations for targeted accounts, aiming for a compound annual growth rate of 10.1%. President Obama also aimed to double funding for basic research over 10 years, but actual appropriations did not meet the authorized levels. President Obama's budget requests aimed to double funding for targeted accounts over an extended period, but appropriations did not keep pace with authorization levels. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 set appropriations authorizations for FY2011-FY2013 at a level that effectively established an 11-year doubling pace. However, subsequent budget requests did not specify a timeline for doubling funding, with President Obama's FY2014 budget expressing a commitment to increasing funding without a specific doubling goal. President Obama's budget did not commit to doubling funding for NIST. Funding for NIST accounts grew by 42.3% from FY2006 to FY2016, with a compound annual growth rate of 3.6%. President Trump's budgets did not mention doubling efforts. The doubling effort is no longer a priority for Congress or the President, and the future support for internal R&D at NIST is uncertain. The shift in Congress led to significant funding reductions for NIST's external programs, including the proposed elimination of the Advanced Technology Program and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership. Despite past Senate support, funding for ATP remained controversial, leading to its elimination in the America COMPETES Act. The TIP initiative replaced ATP but has not received appropriations since FY2011. President Bush also proposed abolishing ATP in his FY2003 budget. Since FY2011, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) program has seen fluctuations in funding. President Bush recommended suspending support for MEP centers operating for over six years in FY2003, leading to reduced funding the following year. However, the FY2005 Omnibus Appropriations Act restored funding to fully support existing centers. Funding for MEP has increased from $107.5 million in FY2005 to $130.0 million in FY2016. President Obama requested $142.0 million for FY2017, but Congress maintained funding at $130 million. President Trump sought to end the MEP program in FY2018, allocating $6.0 million for its wind-down, with no funding proposed for FY2019. President Trump's FY2019 budget request includes no funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) program. In previous years, President Obama requested funding for the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI) and coordination of manufacturing innovation institutes. Congress did not act on these requests, and funding for MEP has fluctuated over the years. The Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act of 2014 established a Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NMI) without specific funding, authorizing NIST to spend up to $5.0 million annually from FY2015 to FY2024. DOE can transfer up to $250.0 million to NIST for the program, but no funding has been transferred yet. Seven NNMI institutes sponsored by DOD and DOE were awarded by the end of 2015. In December 2015, Congress appropriated $25.0 million for NIST for the NNMI, with $5.0 million for coordination activities. NIST announced its intention to establish two institutes, and on December 16, 2016, awarded the National Institute for Innovation in Manufacturing Biopharmaceuticals (NIIMBL) to the University of Delaware. The National Institute for Innovation in Manufacturing Biopharmaceuticals (NIIMBL) was established by NIST to advance U.S. leadership in biopharmaceutical manufacturing. NIST did not award a second institute due to funding constraints. As of the report date, 14 NNMI institutes have been established by various government agencies. The FY2018 budget allocated $15.0 million for NIST NNMI efforts, with $5.0 million for coordination activities. The overarching issue for FY2019 appropriations will be how to respond to the Trump Administration's NIST budget request and allocate funding among core standards and institutes. The curr_chunk discusses how to allocate NIST appropriations among core standards and measurement functions, including programs like MEP, AMTech, and the NMI. It also references a CRS report on the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation."
