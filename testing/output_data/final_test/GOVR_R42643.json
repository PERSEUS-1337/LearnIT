    "content": "During the recession from 2007 to 2009, Congress enacted temporary laws to extend Unemployment Insurance benefits, including the Emergency Unemployment Compensation program. Various proposals have been made to reduce federal budget deficits and reform the UI system to alleviate state financing stress and improve trust fund solvency. In the context of increased spending on UI benefits and concerns about federal budget deficits, proposals emerged to restrict unemployment benefits for high-income individuals. The House-passed version of H.R. 3630 included a provision to tax unemployment benefits for high-income earners based on their Adjusted Gross Income. The tax percentage would increase with income, reaching 100% for individuals with AGI of $1 million or more. The final version of H.R. 3630 extended UI benefits without restricting benefits based on income. Various proposals suggested different income thresholds for restricting unemployment benefits, such as AGI of $750,000 for single filers or $1.5 million for married couples. Another proposal suggested AGI of $500,000 for single filers or $1 million for married couples. The report addresses proposals to restrict unemployment benefits for high-income individuals, with income thresholds ranging from $500,000 to $1.5 million. It discusses the potential impact on affected individuals and the savings to federal and state governments. IRS data on household income and unemployment benefits for 2010 and 2014 is presented to provide context on the group potentially affected by these proposals. The report discusses proposals to limit unemployment benefits for high-income individuals, with income thresholds between $500,000 and $1.5 million. It highlights the potential impact on federal expenditures and summarizes recent legislation related to unemployment compensation programs. These programs provide income support to involuntarily unemployed workers, including the Unemployment Compensation (UC) program and the Extended Benefit (EB) program, which are funded by federal and state taxes. The UC program provides up to 26 weeks of benefits to eligible workers who are unemployed through no fault of their own. States have the authority to determine the level of payment, duration, and eligibility for their UC programs. Currently, states cannot restrict UI benefits based on income levels, except for income sources related to unemployment. This results in 53 different UC programs financed by states and territories. The U.S. Labor Secretary expanded restrictions on means-testing for UC eligibility, limiting states' factors for determining entitlement. States must pay compensation regardless of income level, as it does not impact unemployment causes. Data in Table 1 shows tax filers receiving unemployment benefits based on AGI categories for tax years 2010 and 2014. Unemployment benefits for tax purposes include more than regular UC. Unemployment benefits for tax purposes include various types of compensation such as state and federal benefits, but not workers' compensation. In 2010, 3,171 tax filers with AGI of $1 million or more reported receiving unemployment benefits, representing 0.02% of all recipients. However, in 2014, no tax filers in this income bracket reported receiving UI benefits. The number of tax filers, individuals, and households receiving unemployment compensation may vary based on filing status. Married couples filing jointly may count as one tax filer, while filing separately would count as two. The data may understate the total beneficiaries as those below the filing threshold are not required to file tax returns. The data on unemployment benefit income received by tax filers for tax years 2010 and 2014 shows that those with AGI of $1 million or more received a relatively small amount. In 2010, tax filers in this category reported $40 million in unemployment benefits, representing 0.03% of total reported income. However, in 2014, there were no tax filers with AGI of $1 million or more who received unemployment benefits. This section discusses policy considerations related to proposals to restrict UI benefits for high-income individuals. Proposals to restrict UI benefits for high-income individuals may impact federal expenditures and administrative costs. Most UI benefit outlays are state-funded, with savings mostly benefiting states. The UC program is primarily funded by states through employer taxes, while the EB program is funded 50% by the federal government and 50% by states. Temporary laws previously provided 100% federal funding for expired EUC08 and EB benefits. Proposals to restrict UI benefits for high-income individuals may impact federal expenditures. Savings from limiting UI benefits to millionaires would be minimal. The expired EUC08 program was 100% federally funded until December 28, 2013. The House-passed bill proposed taxing unemployment benefits at different rates based on income levels, with potential savings estimated at $20 million over 10 years by the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Congressional Budget Office. Lowering the proposed income threshold for the restriction on UI benefits could increase savings but may be seen as unfair. The administrative costs may outweigh the potential savings, and different ways to administer the provision should be considered. One cost-effective way to recoup UI benefits is through the tax system, as proposed in H.R. 3630, S. 1931, and S. 1944 of the 112th Congress. These bills suggest imposing an income tax rate on high-income individuals receiving unemployment benefits, allowing the government to recover the benefits through tax returns. This approach utilizes the existing tax system, making it more efficient than other methods. One cost-effective way to recoup UI benefits is through the tax system, as proposed in H.R. 3630, S. 1931, and S. 1944 of the 112th Congress. Administering the provision through the tax system may have disadvantages, such as complicating tax forms. One alternative is to restrict UI benefits for individuals with at least $1 million in earnings, using data collected by states to identify such individuals. However, this approach may not capture those with total income of at least $1 million from other sources. Proposals to restrict UI benefits based on income, particularly targeting individuals with at least $1 million in earnings, may face administrative challenges for states. State UI administrators lack the infrastructure to collect comprehensive income information beyond earnings, such as capital gains or interest. This could complicate the implementation of such a provision, potentially requiring modifications to the UI system. State UI administrators may face challenges in collecting income information beyond earnings, such as capital gains or interest, for purposes of UC and other UI programs. Implementing restrictions based on household income would require costly setup of new administrative procedures, software programs, databases, and income validation automation. These one-time setup costs may eventually be offset by savings from restricting UI benefit payments to certain individuals over time. Restricting UI benefit receipt based on income may deter eligible individuals from applying due to high administrative costs relative to benefit savings. High-income individuals may opt out of applying if tax recoupment is implemented, leading to potential loss of benefits. Other reasons for not applying include mistaken income expectations or perceived costs outweighing additional funds. Restricting UI benefits based on income could deter eligible individuals from applying due to high administrative costs. Adding complexity to the application process may discourage some from applying, such as new immigrants with language barriers. In the 112th and 113th Congresses, several proposals were considered. In the 112th and 113th Congresses, proposals were introduced to restrict or tax unemployment benefits based on income. H.R. 3630, introduced in 2011, aimed to tax unemployment benefit income at 100% for single tax filers with AGI of $1 million. In the 112th and 113th Congresses, proposals were introduced to tax unemployment benefit income based on income levels. Senator Casey introduced S. 1944, which would tax unemployment benefit income for single tax filers with AGI of at least $500,000 at a rate of 55% in tax years 2011 and 2012, and 50% for tax years after 2012. Senator Heller introduced S. 1931, which also aimed to tax certain unemployment benefit income. S. 1931 and H.R. 235 proposed taxing unemployment benefits for high-income individuals with resources over $1 million. The provision in S. 1931 mirrored that of H.R. 3630. Senator Coburn introduced S. 310, the Ending Unemployment Payments to Jobless Millionaires Act of 2011, which aimed to prohibit EUC08 or EB benefit payments to individuals with resources of at least $1 million. Senator Ayotte introduced S. 18, the Sequester Replacement and Spending Reduction Act of 2013. Senator Ayotte introduced S. 18, the Sequester Replacement and Spending Reduction Act of 2013, which aimed to prohibit individuals reporting more than $1 million in AGI from receiving federal unemployment compensation. The CBO estimated no measurable savings from this proposal. Representative Lankford introduced H.R. 2448, the Ending Unemployment Payment to Millionaires Act of 2013, which also aimed to prohibit EUC08 or EB benefit payments to individuals with resources of at least $1 million. H.R. 3979 and S.Amdt. 2714 aimed to prohibit individuals with over $1 million in AGI from receiving federal unemployment compensation, including EUC08 payments. The provision would have been effective for weeks of unemployment after enactment. The Responsible Unemployment Compensation Extension Act of 2014 introduced by Senator Heller aimed to prohibit individuals with over $1 million in AGI from receiving federal unemployment compensation. This provision would have been effective for weeks of unemployment after enactment. Senator Reed also introduced the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Extension Act of 2014, which included a similar provision. Senator Reed introduced S. 2532, the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Extension Act of 2014, which aimed to prohibit individuals with over $1 million in AGI from receiving EUC08 payments. This provision would be effective for weeks of unemployment after enactment. Representative Kildee also introduced H.R. 4415 with a similar provision. H.R. 4550, introduced by Representative Fitzpatrick, aimed to prohibit individuals with over $1 million in AGI from receiving EUC08 payments, effective for weeks of unemployment after enactment. Similarly, H.R. 4970, introduced by Representative LoBiondo, had a provision to restrict high-income individuals from receiving EUC08 payments. No bills introduced in the 114th Congress to restrict UI receipt based on income."
