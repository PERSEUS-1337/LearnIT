    "content": "Representation learning is essential for transfer and few-shot learning. Inspired by language theories, the concept is framed as learning to communicate. Traditional autoencoders are seen as a single encoder with a fixed decoder, while community-based autoencoders involve multiple encoders and decoders paired randomly for representation learning. Larger community sizes lead to more regular and reusable representations. Representation learning is crucial for neural models to perform well on tasks, facilitating knowledge transfer and few-shot learning. Good representations are reusable, capture the right invariances, and allow for quick generalization to new tasks. Efforts include learning disentangled representations and using general regularization methods. In this work, a different approach to representation learning is taken, inspired by successful abstraction mechanisms in human language and communication. The size of linguistic communities affects language complexity, with smaller communities developing more complex languages. Speakers adapt their conceptualizations to maximize communication effectiveness based on the needs of their partners. In dialogue research, speakers form conceptual pacts with their listeners, leading to partner-specific linguistic situations. These pacts can be so ad-hoc and idiosyncratic that overhearers struggle to follow the discussion. Representation learning is related to these linguistic situations, with an analogy drawn between language and representations induced by autonencoders. Encoders and decoders co-adapt, yielding idiosyncratic representations that model various data information for successful reconstruction. The curr_chunk discusses the negative impact of co-adaptation between encoders and decoders on representation learning, affecting the reusability of representations. The study aims to test if removing this co-adaptation can improve generalization, similar to how dropout enhances generalization in neural networks. The curr_chunk introduces community-based autoencoders (CbAEs) as a framework to improve generalization in neural networks by simplifying representations through communication with multiple partners. By randomly sampling encoders and decoders during training, the induced representations are designed to be invariant to diverse partners, reducing idiosyncrasy and enhancing reusability. Community-based autoencoders (CbAEs) aim to create representations that are invariant to diverse partners, improving generalization in neural networks. These representations encode abstract information that is easily re-used for different tasks, provide an interface that is user-friendly, and have a topology aligned with human perceptual data. The CbAE framework uses parameters \u03b8 and \u03c6 to encode input data into a latent vector z, which can be used for various tasks like supervised learning. However, the current loss function does not incentivize the formation of good representations. Research efforts are focused on finding a better loss function. The CbAE framework involves a community of encoders and decoders to improve language structural properties. Unlike traditional autoencoders, it utilizes multiple encoders and decoders without weight-sharing. Training involves optimizing network architectures for better loss function. The CbAE framework uses multiple encoders and decoders without weight-sharing to improve language structural properties. Training involves forming an autoencoder at each step by randomly sampling an encoder and decoder, then minimizing the mean-squared loss between input and decoding. This approach aims to produce latent representations decodable by different decoders, potentially enhancing representation quality. The CbAE framework utilizes multiple encoders and decoders without weight-sharing to enhance language structural properties. Training involves creating an autoencoder by randomly selecting an encoder and decoder, aiming to produce latent representations decodable by different decoders. This approach reduces idiosyncrasies between specific encoder-decoder pairs and is related to dropout in a correlated weight selection manner. The goal of the method is to prevent co-adaptation between the encoder and decoder in the CbAE framework, which uses multiple encoders and decoders without weight-sharing. This allows for diversity in the community members and reduces idiosyncrasies between specific encoder-decoder pairs. The encoders can avoid convergence and still produce latents that the decoders can successfully reconstruct the input from. The encoder in the CbAE framework assigns unique IDs to latents, tested by a linear classifier. Results show encoder classifiers perform better than chance, indicating pairwise co-adaptation occurs. Larger communities make encoder identification harder but slow representation shift, aiding the classifier. In order to counteract the all-to-all pairwise co-adaptation effect in the CbAE framework, a simple adversarial loss is added to make the encoders indistinguishable for the encoder classifier. This extra loss term is the negative entropy of the classifier. The experiments use MNIST and CIFAR-100 datasets with different community sizes and fixed batch size. The encoders are convolutional neural networks of VGG-flavour. The encoders in the CbAE framework are convolutional neural networks of VGG-flavour with depths of 6 (MNIST) and 10 (CIFAR-100) layers. Increasing the community size leads to a penalty in reconstruction error, even when correcting for training data. Pixel-loss is a self-supervision signal, but not the true goal of representation learning. The experiments in Section 3 of the CbAE framework aim to determine if there is a trade-off between reconstruction performance and other properties like reusability or structure. The focus is on obtaining good representations for generalization, knowledge transfer, and reusability, rather than just minimizing reconstruction loss. Various evaluation methods are used to assess the representations for these properties. Training new encoders and decoders in the CbAE setup aims to determine if the latent interface is easier for new users to learn. By training newly initialized encoders and decoders, the hypothesis is that systematic encoding by CbAE-trained models results in better sample complexity for new users. This evaluation is illustrated in FIG3. Additionally, the transfer capabilities of the representations to a new task are investigated by freezing the CbAE encoders and performing supervised learning. The CbAE framework induces abstract representations of input data for better sample complexity in image classification. New encoders, decoders, and linear classifiers are trained separately in probe tasks, with frozen CbAE encoders and decoders. Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 10^-4 is used for training. In the CbAE framework, linear classifiers are trained on latent representations using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 10^-3. A sample complexity gain metric is calculated to compare training durations for different community sizes. The inverse learning curve is used to calculate sample complexity gain in training image classifiers on latent representations. Larger communities result in faster learning, as shown in the MNIST plot. The introduction of larger communities in training image classifiers on latent representations leads to faster learning, as demonstrated in the MNIST plot. In the case of CIFAR-100, there are similar sample complexity gains, but the effect of community size is reversed due to the complexity of the data set. This requires more iterations for the communities to learn to represent the data effectively. Training new decoders on MNIST and CIFAR-100 with encoders trained in larger communities results in faster learning. While there are sample complexity gains, they are smaller compared to previous transfer tasks. CbAEs excel in abstract representations, making them more suitable for image classification tasks. Abstraction is crucial in representation learning, with new encoders learning faster when trained with decoders from larger communities. There is an asymmetry between encoders and decoders, with decoders able to decode a large hypervolume in latent space into the same image. This makes it easier for new encoders to learn to encode images. Comparing to other regularization mechanisms, new decoders face a more challenging task of adapting to residual idiosyncrasies. The study compares the effectiveness of dropout regularization in traditional AE setups and found no significant improvement. Future work will explore variations of dropout. The models are trained with batch normalization, indicating orthogonal gains. The study also investigates how the CbAE framework induces abstract representations similar to human perceptual data. The Visual Attributes for Concepts Dataset (VisA) is used as a proxy for human perceptual data, containing attribute annotations for concrete concepts. The representations in VisA are structured and disentangled, indicating high similarity would encode similar conceptual abstract information. Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) is performed to measure similarities between human perceptual data and CbAE-induced representations. This independent task requires no additional training of parameters. In the context of comparing human perceptual data with CbAE-induced representations, Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) is conducted using two topologies. Images are encoded with all encoders, and concept-based late fusion is applied to create 68 concept-based representations. Pairwise similarities of the concepts are computed using CbAE-induced latent representations and VisA attribute representations. The RSA between the two topologies is measured as the Spearman correlation of these similarities, focusing on the similarity of their topology rather than their cosine similarity. The study compares human perceptual data with CbAE-induced representations using Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA). Results show that the mean similarity increases with the population size, indicating that CbAE produces abstract representations reflecting the topology of human data. Training an encoder within a diverse community leads to even higher gains in RSA performance. Training an encoder within a diverse community of partners in a CbAE leads to more abstract and structured representations, resulting in higher RSA performance. The largest CbAE with a community size of 16 shows the smallest gains, attributed to fewer iterations per member. This framework allows multiple encoders and decoders to collectively learn representations. Training multiple encoders and decoders in a diverse community leads to abstract and structured representations, improving performance. The latent representations induced in this scheme are easier to use and more structured, similar to the simplicity found in languages with many speakers. Computational requirements increase linearly with community size, but the resulting representations can be reused across multiple applications. The community-based training procedure allows for parallelizable training of encoders and decoders, with amortization of computational costs over multiple applications."
