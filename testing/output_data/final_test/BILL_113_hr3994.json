    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Federal Lands Invasive Species Control, Prevention, and Management Act\" and includes sections on definitions, federal efforts to control invasive species on federal lands, program funding allocations, prudent use of funds, and the use of partnerships. The Act defines key terms such as \"alien species,\" \"control,\" \"ecosystem,\" and \"eligible State.\" It also includes definitions for \"invasive species.\" Invasive species are alien species that cause harm to the environment, economy, or human health. Managing invasive species involves actively implementing activities to reduce their spread and prevent further infestations. Prevention includes hindering the introduction or spread of invasive species through inspection, interception, or confiscation. The term \"Secretary concerned\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture, depending on the federal lands being administered. The term \"species\" refers to a group of organisms with a high degree of physical similarity. Organisms with a high degree of physical and genetic similarity generally interbreed only among themselves and show persistent differences from allied groups. The Secretary concerned is required to control and manage invasive species on federal lands, aiming for a five percent net reduction annually. Additionally, a strategic plan must be developed for the implementation of the invasive species program. The Secretary concerned must allocate at least 75 percent of the funds for on-the-ground control and management of invasive species, including purchasing necessary products and equipment, using integrated pest management options, biological control agents, and re-vegetation or cultural restoration. The Secretary concerned must allocate funds for on-the-ground control and management of invasive species, including purchasing products and equipment, using integrated pest management options, biological control agents, re-vegetation, and other effective control methods. Additionally, a portion of the funds can be used for investigations, outreach, public awareness efforts, and administrative costs. The Secretary must allocate funds for on-the-ground control and management of invasive species, including purchasing products and equipment, using integrated pest management options, biological control agents, re-vegetation, and other effective control methods. A portion of the funds may be used for administrative costs related to oversight, management, recordkeeping, and implementation of the strategic plan. Reporting requirements mandate a report to Congress within 60 days after the end of the second fiscal year, detailing fund usage for programs addressing invasive species management and specifying the percentage of funds expended for each purpose. SEC. 5. PRUDENT USE OF FUNDS. The Secretary must choose cost-effective methods for controlling invasive species based on scientific data. A comparative economic assessment is required for control methods. Projects in high-risk areas near water bodies must undergo a categorical exclusion process. Projects located within 1,000 feet of various valuable infrastructures are categorically excluded from environmental assessment requirements under the National Environmental Policy Act, as long as they comply with agency procedures. The Act does not prevent authorities from controlling invasive species through other laws. It also does not allow the suspension of water supplies to manage invasive species. SEC. 6. USE OF PARTNERSHIPS. The Secretary may partner with other entities to control invasive species through contracts or agreements. A memorandum of understanding must be created outlining the partnership and management activities. The prioritized listing of invasive species to be controlled, assessment of infested areas, expected infested areas after management, specific pest management options, and necessary maps or GPS coordinates are required for control and management activities. The memorandum of understanding for contracts or cooperative agreements with eligible partners must include compliance with the Federal Noxious Weed Act, coordination of control and management efforts, and goals for public outreach and awareness. Public awareness efforts will efficiently inform audiences about invasive species control and management. Investigations aim to develop solutions and recommendations for faster implementation of control methods."
