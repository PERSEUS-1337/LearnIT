The \"A PLUS Act\" focuses on holding States and communities accountable for improving academic achievement, particularly for disadvantaged students. It includes definitions based on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The Secretary shall enter into performance agreements with States under this Act, lasting 5 years, allowing States to consolidate and use funds as per section 3 program requirements. The performance agreement will list programs included, outline a 5-year plan for fund usage to improve student achievement, detail an accountability system, and set achievement goals. The performance agreement will require the State to maintain challenging academic standards and assessments, report disaggregated data, and demonstrate academic achievement goals over the duration of the agreement. Each State seeking a performance agreement under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 must submit an application to the Secretary with specified information, including a proposed agreement, accountability system description, fiscal control assurances, and commitment to maintain academic standards. The State must submit a proposed performance agreement for approval within 60 days, including assurances to improve educational opportunities for the disadvantaged and approval from at least 2 specified entities. Each performance agreement not acted upon by the Secretary within the specified time frame is automatically approved. The Secretary must enter into approved performance agreements. If a State's agreement is disapproved, they have 30 days to resubmit a revised version for approval. The revised performance agreement must comply with Federal civil rights laws. The Secretary can amend a performance agreement if there is a reduction in scope. The Secretary can approve or reject a proposed performance agreement amendment within 60 days. The amendment may include additional programs or accountability measures described in section 3. Each proposed performance agreement amendment must be approved or rejected by the Secretary within 60 days. Failure to act within this timeframe will result in automatic approval. Any program removed from the agreement will have its requirements apply to the State's use of funds. A State can include any program funded by Congress for educational purposes in its performance agreement. Funds under the agreement can be used for educational purposes allowed by State law. Maintenance of academic standards and an accountability system is required. Each State using funds under this Act must demonstrate an accountability system for academic performance standards. The system can utilize the State's yearly progress determination or another measure of student progress over the 5-year agreement period.

The Secretary can waive this requirement in case of exceptional circumstances. SEC. 6 addresses administrative expenses. SEC. 6 of the Act specifies that States consolidating funds under Part A of Title I can use up to 1% for administrative expenses, while States not consolidating funds can use up to 3%. Private school children and teachers must participate in activities funded under the performance agreement, similar to the provisions in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965.

The Secretary must submit these reports to Congress within 60 days of receiving them. SEC. 9.
