    "content": "Congress created nonimmigrant and immigrant visa categories to boost investment and job creation in the US. The E-1 and E-2 visas are for treaty traders and investors, while the EB-5 visa is for immigrant investors. The EB-5 visa aims to attract foreign capital investment and create jobs by granting lawful permanent residence to investors and their derivatives who invest a specified amount in a new enterprise creating at least 10 jobs. The EB-5 visa grants conditional residence status to foreign investors who must apply to remove the conditionality after two years. If requirements are met, full LPR status is granted; otherwise, the conditional status is terminated, leading to potential removal from the US. Congressional debates centered on concerns about immigrants \"buying their way in\" versus the program's job creation and integrity goals. The Regional Center Program was created in 1992 as an additional pathway for foreign investors to obtain an EB-5 visa. It is temporary and set to expire on September 30, 2016. Foreign investors investing through a regional center have different job creation requirements and are not involved in the enterprise's management. Approximately 10,000 visas are available each year for EB-5 investors, with 3,000 reserved for entrepreneurs in targeted employment areas. The upcoming expiration of the Regional Center Program has sparked congressional interest in the EB-5 visa category. Questions arise about extending or modifying the program, adjusting capital requirements, and addressing fraud concerns. Congress may evaluate oversight and fraud detection mechanisms for the EB-5 category. The report discusses oversight of the EB-5 visa category, fraud detection mechanisms, USCIS capacity, data collection, economic impacts, and policy issues surrounding the Regional Center Program. The EB-5 visa classification for foreign investors is based on investment of capital, a new commercial enterprise, and job creation. There are two pathways for lawful permanent resident status: the standard visa and the Regional Center Program, with the majority of investors choosing the latter. Both pathways have the same requirements for capital investment and job creation, but differ in the measure of job creation and the investor's role in the enterprise. To qualify for the EB-5 visa, a foreign national must invest at least $1,000,000 in a new commercial enterprise, or $500,000 in a targeted employment area. The investment must be lawful, at risk, and the investor must prove ownership of the capital. The enterprise can take various forms and must be established after November 29, 1990. The EB-5 visa requires a minimum investment in a new commercial enterprise, established after November 29, 1990. The investor must be engaged in management and create at least 10 jobs. Job creation can also be shown by preserving jobs in troubled businesses for at least two years. The EB-5 visa program requires a minimum investment in a new commercial enterprise, with the investor creating at least 10 jobs. Job creation can also be demonstrated by preserving jobs in troubled businesses for two years. The Regional Center Program, established in 1992, encourages immigrants to invest in commercial enterprises within regional centers to achieve economic growth and job creation goals. The Regional Center Program, designated by USCIS, pools investments from foreign nationals for EB-5 status. It allows for indirect job creation, limits investor involvement in management, and differs from the standard EB-5 visa. The EB-5 visa category is permanent, while the Regional Center Program is temporary and set to expire on September 30, 2016. Foreign nationals can invest in approved regional centers to qualify for conditional LPR status, which may be within a regional center and a TEA. Regional centers promote economic growth and job creation. A regional center is an entity where investments from multiple foreign nationals are pooled to fund various projects within a specific geographic area. These centers can be privately owned, publicly owned, or a public-private partnership. Different models, such as the lending and equity models, are used to fund projects like hotels, ski resorts, and convention centers. Since 1992, the number of USCIS-approved regional centers in the US has significantly increased, reaching 790 as of January 4, 2016. However, not all centers have received investments from foreign nationals seeking EB-5 visas. USCIS terminated the participation of 39 regional centers as of January 5, 2016. The use of regional centers among immigrant investors has grown in the last decade. The use of regional centers among immigrant investors has grown substantially, with investments in regional centers in a TEA increasing significantly since FY2007. By FY2014, investments in regional centers in a TEA represented 97% of the visas used. The EB-5 petition/application process, largely administered by USCIS, grants conditional resident status to individuals admitted to the US on EB-5 visas. After approximately two years, they can apply to remove the conditionality by meeting visa requirements. Foreign national investors must file USCIS Form I-526 to prove they meet EB-5 requirements, including legitimate capital source and a valid business plan. Once approved, they need a visa from the Department of State or adjust status with USCIS. Individuals not in the US file Form DS-260 with DOS, while those within file Form I-485 with USCIS. In the United States, individuals file Form I-485 to adjust status and receive conditional residence upon approval. The number of EB-5 visas granted to new arrivals has surpassed those granted to status adjusters, with new arrivals accounting for 86% of admissions by FY2014. Investors can petition to remove conditional status after two years. Investors can petition to remove conditional status after approximately two years by filing Form I-829. If approved, the conditionality on residency is removed. USCIS may issue a notice-to-appear to those who do not apply for removal or are denied adjustment. Denial rates for I-526 and I-829 petitions have significantly decreased since the early 2000s. The denial rate for I-829 petitions decreased from 52% in FY2000 to 1% in FY2015, attributed to changes in EB-5 requirements by the former INS in late 1997 and 1998. These changes included restrictions on investment mechanisms, increased documentation for lawful funds, and revised rules for TEA investments, applied retroactively. The 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Act (P.L. 107-273) allowed investors affected by INS' 1998 decisions to re-establish eligibility for an EB-5 visa. As of January 31, 2016, processing times were 16.3 months for I-526 and 16.9 months for I-829 petitions. Approximately 10,000 EB-5 visas are available each year, with low utilization in earlier years due to altered interpretations of qualifying requirements in 1998. After the 1998 INS decisions, P.L. 107-273 clarified EB-5 visa requirements, leading to a significant increase in visa admissions from FY2003 to FY2013. The number of EB-5 visas issued grew substantially, with individual immigrant investors accounting for approximately one-third of all visas granted. In FY2015, China accounted for 84% of all EB-5 visas granted, with Vietnam and Taiwan following with 3% and 1% respectively. China saw significant growth in EB-5 visas issued from FY2009 to FY2014, reaching a peak in FY2014 before decreasing in FY2015. The EB-5 visa program saw a peak in visas granted to Chinese applicants in August 2014, leading to a backlog in processing. A study commissioned by USCIS found that EB-5 investments added $700 million to the U.S. GDP, with the real estate industry benefiting the most. The EB-5 visa program has had a significant economic impact in the United States, creating an estimated 12,000 annual jobs and generating over $11.2 billion in investments from FY1990 to FY2014. Additionally, as of October 1, 2012, $8.7 billion was invested in the U.S. economy, leading to the creation of 35,140 jobs through EB-5 visa investments. Several organizations have conducted economic analyses of the EB-5 visa program. The Brookings Institution estimated that the visa created 85,500 full-time jobs and contributed $5 billion in direct investment to the United States. Another report commissioned by the EB-5 Investment Coalition found that from 2005 to 2013, the visa generated at least $5.2 billion in investment and created 31,000 jobs in 2013 alone. Invest in the USA commissioned a study that estimated the impacts of the EB-5 visa. The study estimated that EB-5 regional center spending contributed $3.58 billion to the U.S. GDP and created over 41,000 jobs in FY2013. Efforts have been made to promote foreign investment in the U.S. economy and address issues like processing times, fraud, and security concerns within the EB-5 program. The processing times for EB-5 applications have been a concern for stakeholders, with delays of 13.6 months for Form I-526, 16.9 months for Form I-829, and 9 months for Form I-924. Stakeholders have raised issues about the lengthy time period from applying for a regional center designation to receiving investment, currently at approximately 22.6 months. They urge USCIS to adjudicate applications more predictably to compete with other countries' faster immigrant investor programs. The USCIS Ombudsman has recommended improvements to the EB-5 adjudication process for the immigrant investor program. Some question whether USCIS is the right agency to manage the EB-5 visa, suggesting collaboration with other agencies for expertise. Lawmakers recognized the complexity of the program and recommended partnering with agencies possessing the necessary skills. The USCIS Ombudsman recommended improvements to the EB-5 adjudication process, suggesting collaboration with other agencies for expertise. The Government Accountability Office reported improvements in USCIS's economic analysis of EB-5 applications, including hiring additional economists. As of February 2016, the Immigrant Investor Program Office was staffed with 110 employees, including adjudication officers and economists. USCIS's Immigrant Investor Program Office (IPO) had 110 employees, including adjudication officers, economists, and support staff. The agency updated its training curriculum to improve consistency in the adjudication process. USCIS previously estimated the impact of the EB-5 program based on job creation and investment requirements, but reports from DHS OIG and GAO noted that this method could lead to inaccuracies in economic benefits assessment. The USCIS lacks comprehensive studies on the economic impact of regional centers, potentially overestimating the benefits of the investor visa program. A 2013 DHS OIG report highlighted USCIS's inability to demonstrate the benefits of foreign investment in the U.S. economy. The USCIS's limited authority hinders accurate measurement of the impact of the EB-5 visa program, particularly in regional center contexts where job creation credit is given to EB-5 investors regardless of their actual contribution. This makes it challenging for USCIS to determine the true job creation impact of EB-5 investors. Since FY2013, USCIS has used RIMS II data to estimate job creation for EB-5 investors. While RIMS II is considered a valid method, it cannot determine the location of jobs created, posing challenges in verifying job creation in Targeted Employment Areas (TEAs). GAO found that 95% of EB-5 petitioners used economic models, with 90% using RIMS II in their applications. This method faces risks compared to other immigration visas. The EB-5 visa program faces unique risks of fraud related to investment components. Immigrant investors must prove lawful source of funds, which can be challenging to verify due to counterfeit documentation and self-reporting. Regional center operators and intermediaries may exploit investors for financial gains. The SEC received numerous complaints about potential security fraud violations in EB-5 visas. The SEC received complaints about security fraud violations in EB-5 visas from January 2013 to January 2015, leading to further investigations. SEC filed 19 cases involving EB-5 offerings from February 2013 to December 2015, with almost half involving fraud allegations. The EB-5 visa classification is vulnerable to favoritism and special access, as highlighted in a DHS OIG report. USCIS lacked protocols to document inquiries and decision-making processes, prompting a new ethics and integrity protocol for EB-5 visas. USCIS issued a new ethics and integrity protocol for EB-5 visas, addressing application processing and stakeholder communication. USCIS lacks explicit statutory authority to deny or terminate regional centers based on national security or fraud risks. Participation in EB-5 can only be terminated if a regional center fails to submit required information or no longer promotes economic growth. USCIS officials lack the authority to deny or terminate a regional center solely based on fraud or national security concerns. USCIS faces challenges in linking fraud or national security concerns to statutory criteria for terminating regional centers. Risk assessments are conducted to address fraud issues, with collaboration between USCIS and enforcement agencies like the FBI, SEC, and ICE's HSI. DHS updated the EB-5 visa's risk assessment in 2015 in response to requests. EB-5 fraud risks are constantly evolving with increasing visa numbers granted. Regular risk assessments could help USCIS address fraud risks. A 2013 HSI memo highlighted vulnerabilities in the EB-5 visa program, including concerns about Iranian operatives exploiting it for entry into the US. The 2013 HSI memo identified various risks associated with the EB-5 visa program, including technology and economic espionage, use of force by foreign government agents, terrorism, and investment fraud. It highlighted the lack of safeguards to ensure program integrity but noted that USCIS has since taken steps to address these risks through restructuring and centralization. USCIS expanded background checks and databases for EB-5 visa applicants, established a fraud specialist unit, hired more specialists, provided fraud training, and improved collaboration with law enforcement agencies like SEC, ICE, HSI, and FBI. SEC educates EB-5 investors. GAO identified limitations. The USCIS has limitations in information collection, hindering fraud detection. They heavily rely on paper-based documentation, making it difficult to search for information. The Electronic Immigration System (USCIS ELIS) aims to improve data collection but is delayed. FDNS has limited capabilities. In 2019, FDNS conducts site visits to projects of concern. USCIS plans to expand site visits to the EB-5 program. Interviews with immigrant investors may be required to gather information on program integrity and fraud detection. USCIS aims to start conducting interviews at the I-829 stage soon. USCIS plans to begin conducting interviews with immigrant investors submitting the I-829 petition in the near future, focusing on projects in targeted employment areas (TEA) with high unemployment rates designated by state governments. The state's designation of TEAs with high unemployment has been criticized for being lenient and inconsistent across states. USCIS defers to states in determining boundaries, leading to variation in TEA designations. Some argue that linking wealthy tracts with high unemployment tracts to form a TEA accommodates commuting patterns, while others see it as allowing gerrymandering. The Regional Center Program was reauthorized in December 2015. The Regional Center Program was reauthorized in December 2015 through September 30, 2016. Legislation has been introduced in the 114th Congress related to the EB-5 visa category, including bills such as H.R. 616, H.R. 3370, H.R. 4530/S. 2415, and S. 1501. Some bills aim to modify the Regional Center Program and the EB-5 visa, while others propose creating a new visa category for foreign national entrepreneurs. The Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the Regional Center Program and S. 1501 in February 2016, but other bills have not received action yet. Several bills introduced in the 114th Congress aim to place more controls and requirements on regional centers for the EB-5 visa program. These bills include H.R. 4530/S. 2415, H.R. 3370, and S. 1501, which propose creating an EB-5 Integrity Fund in the Treasury to fund oversight of regional centers. Additionally, the bills would expand DHS's authority to terminate a regional center designation. Several bills in the 114th Congress aim to regulate regional centers for the EB-5 visa program. S. 1501 would establish channels for discussing case-specific information, set application fees for timely adjudication, and prioritize Regional Center Program petitions. H.R. 616 would set a 180-day processing time for regional center applications and immigrant investor petitions. H.R. 3370 would introduce premium processing for foreign national investors applying for EB-5 status. H.R. 4530/S. 2415 and S. 1501 would specify lawful source of investment capital and procedures for foreign national investors. Several bills in the 114th Congress aim to regulate regional centers for the EB-5 visa program. H.R. 616, H.R. 3370, H.R. 4560, and S. 2415 would permanently authorize the Regional Center Program, while S. 1501 would extend its authorization to September 30, 2020. H.R. 3370 and S. 1501 would increase capital investment minimums and tie the amounts to the Consumer Price Index. S. 1501 would allow foreign nationals to receive full LPR status after investing for 24 months. H.R. 616 and H.R. 3370 would delegate some authority for EB-5 administration to the Department of Commerce and remove derivatives from numerical limitations. H.R. 3370 aims to expand the definition of Targeted Employment Areas (TEAs) for the EB-5 visa program, including areas with population decreases, economic development zones, and closed military installations. It also proposes creating a new visa category (EB-6) and removing per-country quotas. S. 1501 would change the definition of TEAs and increase visas for these areas. H.R. 616 would increase visas for TEAs and grant deference to state designations. H.R. 3370 and H.R. 3987 propose creating a new visa category (EB-6) for foreign nationals starting or managing commercial enterprises with investment. They would initially receive conditional LPR status and need to create jobs to convert to full LPR status. EB-5 visa would be exempt from numerical limits under H.R. 3370."
