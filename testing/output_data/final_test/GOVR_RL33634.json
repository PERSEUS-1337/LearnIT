    "content": "In the World Trade Organization (WTO) Doha Round, talks on Non-Agricultural Market Access (NAMA) focus on reducing tariff and non-tariff barriers on industrial and primary products, which make up the majority of world trade. Industrial and primary products accounted for 78.9% of world trade activity in 2009, with the United States heavily involved in this trade. The outcome of these negotiations could significantly impact the U.S. trade and economy. The Doha Round of WTO negotiations focused on reducing tariff and non-tariff barriers on industrial and primary products, which account for a large portion of world trade. Developed countries saw reductions in average tariffs from 40% post-World War II to 6% today, but higher tariffs persist for labor-intensive goods. Developing countries maintain higher average industrial tariffs around 13%, with concerns about market access concessions. Prospective gains for developed countries in the NAMA talks include reducing high tariffs in developing countries like Brazil, India, and China. Developed countries demand more access for industrial products in exchange for opening up agricultural sectors, leading to a deadlock in negotiations. Congress would need to pass legislation for any agreement from the Doha Round, focusing on opening foreign markets to the U.S. The current round of trade negotiations, launched at the 4th Ministerial of the WTO in Doha, Qatar in November 2001, aims to reduce tariff and non-tariff barriers to open foreign markets for U.S. exporters. Congress may examine the impact on the U.S. manufacturing sector and employment. The current round of trade negotiations at the WTO aims to reduce tariff and non-tariff barriers on products of export interest to developing countries. The negotiations will consider the special needs of developing and least-developed countries, with capacity-building measures included. The NAMA paragraph lacked specifics, reflecting member reluctance to commit fully. The declaration provides clues on the direction of the negotiations. The declaration from the WTO negotiations showed a commitment to address concerns of developing countries by reducing tariff peaks, focusing on export products, and providing special treatment. There was ambiguity in the initial discussions, leading to slow progress in 2002 and 2003. Negotiations in 2002 and 2003 were slow, with missed deadlines for agreement on negotiating modalities in agriculture and industrial market access talks. The United States proposed complete elimination of tariffs by 2015, favoring an aggressive tariff-cutting strategy. The United States proposed complete elimination of sector tariffs by 2010, with a gradual removal of remaining tariffs by 2015. The proposal applied to all countries without special treatment language. The EU initially suggested a compression formula for tariff reduction, while a joint submission by the US, Canada, and EU proposed a Swiss-style harmonization formula. Industrial market access negotiations did not reach a resolution. The Canc\u00fan Ministerial broke up over agriculture and the \"Singapore issues,\" with the Derbez text becoming the basis for the July 2004 Framework Agreement. This agreement reaffirmed the use of a non-linear formula for tariff reduction with flexibilities for developing countries. Developing countries resisted the wholesale inclusion of the Derbez text and insisted on additional negotiations. Negotiations on NAMA at the Hong Kong Ministerial were based on the July Framework Agreement, aiming for modalities but settling for incremental progress. The agreement included elements like the tariff reduction formula and flexibilities for developing countries, but specifics still required further negotiations. After failing to settle on coefficients for the Swiss formula for tariff reduction, WTO members set new deadlines in 2006. The Doha Round was suspended by Director-General Pascal Lamy in July 2006 after missing these deadlines. Despite efforts by groups like the G-20 and Cairns Group, negotiations did not progress until January 2007 when talks resumed in \"full negotiating mode.\" Key players like the G-4 engaged in meetings to overcome the impasse. In early 2007, key players like the G-4 (Brazil, India) held meetings to break the impasse in WTO negotiations. Despite some progress, negotiations continued without reaching a final agreement. The United States rejected using previous drafts as a basis for further discussions. Several studies estimate potential gains from reducing tariffs on industrial products through successful Doha negotiations using computable general equilibrium models. These models simulate the world economy's relationship between economic variables. The economic impact of trade flows on tariff revenues, production, prices, and welfare is estimated using models that utilize the Global Trade Action Project (GTAP) database. The results of these studies are influenced by assumptions made in modeling the world economy and the version of the GTAP data used. Models using the most recent data (GTAP version 6) have found smaller welfare gains from trade liberalization. Factors such as ongoing trade liberalization, static or dynamic assumptions, and the inclusion of unemployment or technology transfer in the model also affect the results. The Michigan Model analyzes the impact of multilateral trade liberalization by reducing tariffs and subsidies on agriculture and manufacturing. A 33% reduction in manufacturing tariffs could result in a $163.4 billion net welfare benefit to the world economy. The Michigan Model predicts that manufacturing tariffs reduction would lead to a $163.4 billion net welfare benefit globally. The United States would gain $23.6 billion, while Japan and the EU would see larger gains. Developed countries would gain $113.4 billion, with developing countries, led by China, receiving $50 billion. The US could benefit from services liberalization but might suffer a loss from agricultural liberalization. The model's use of older data is a limitation, but dynamic assumptions like increasing returns to scale and monopolistic competition strengthen its findings. The World Bank study using GTAP-6 data from 2001 found that full trade liberalization could lead to a $287 billion increase in real income by 2015. Developed countries could receive a larger share of benefits in dollar terms, but developing countries may benefit more proportionally to their economies. Textile and apparel liberalization alone could result in a $38 billion increase in real income. The World Bank study found that textile and apparel liberalization could lead to a $38 billion increase in real income. A Carnegie Endowment for International Peace study also modeled possible outcomes of trade liberalization, estimating a total welfare gain of $96.1 billion, with $21.6 billion from industrial tariff liberalization. The model predicts potential manufacturing outcomes of the Doha Round with different tariff reduction scenarios. Global real income gains from manufacturing were $53.1 billion for an ambitious scenario and $38.1 billion for a more modest scenario. The gains were mainly from liberalizing manufacturing tariffs, with developing countries benefiting more in the ambitious scenario. In two scenarios, global real income gains from manufacturing were $53.1 billion for an ambitious scenario and $38.1 billion for a more modest scenario. Developing countries received $30.2 billion (56.8%) and $21 billion in the respective scenarios, with China being the largest recipient of welfare gains. Sub-Saharan Africa may be a net loser in manufactured goods liberalization. China would gain the most in world export market share for developing country manufacturing exports, while other countries like Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, and Sub-Saharan Africa may lose industrial market share. Under the modest scenario, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, and Sub-Saharan Africa would lose industrial market share. The United States could gain nearly $6.5 billion in real income from manufacturing liberalization in the ambitious Doha scenario and $4.5 billion in the more modest outcome. The UNCTAD model predicts welfare gains under free trade, with a net welfare benefit of $200.8 billion globally, with developing countries receiving $135.3 billion of that, and China benefiting significantly. The UNCTAD study predicts global net welfare gains of $200.8 billion under free trade, with developing countries receiving $135.3 billion. China would gain the most at $48.6 billion, followed by the EU at $28.5 billion and the United States at $11.2 billion. Developing countries would gain between $65.2 billion and $86.9 billion, with China gaining around half of the total world welfare gains. The model shows U.S. gains of $5.8 billion to $7.0 billion. The 2006 OECD study found that global net welfare gains from full tariff liberalization in manufactured goods could be $23.4 billion, with 73% going to developing countries. Developing countries gained relatively more with gains equaling 0.33% of GDP, compared to 0.05% for developed countries. North America would suffer the largest welfare loss from manufacturing liberalization at $6.8 billion. The study found that global net welfare gains from full tariff liberalization in manufactured goods could be $23.4 billion, with developing countries gaining the most. Different models showed varying results, with most indicating that developing countries would benefit more from manufacturing liberalization. China would be the largest gainer in terms of net welfare benefit. The United States could achieve modest gains from manufacturing liberalization. The principal negotiating issue in the NAMA talks has been over the tariff. The NAMA talks focus on tariff liberalization, with the key issue being the tariff formula. The December 2005 Hong Kong Ministerial declaration endorsed a non-linear tariff reduction formula. Previous negotiations, starting with the Doha Ministerial Declaration in 2001, committed member nations to negotiate tariff reduction or elimination based on agreed modalities. Negotiating modalities for NAMA talks included formula cuts, request-offer approach, or harmonization/elimination of tariffs in specific sectors. The Doha Declaration aimed to reduce or eliminate tariff peaks and escalation. Tariff peaks are maximum tariffs used to protect sensitive products. The United States imposes peak tariffs on textile products, footwear, and watches to protect sensitive industries. Tariff escalation involves increasing tariffs as value is added to a commodity, often to protect import-competing industries. Developing countries face higher tariffs, increasing consumer goods costs in developed countries. The July 2004 Framework Agreement endorsed a non-linear tariff reduction formula for negotiations. A non-linear formula is used for tariff reduction negotiations to harmonize tariff levels among participants. This formula results in a greater percentage reduction of higher tariffs than lower ones, equalizing tariffs at a lower level. Negotiations are done on a line-by-line basis, applying the formula to individual product tariff lines. The goal is to reduce tariff peaks and escalations, unlike a linear formula that reduces tariffs across the board without changing relative tariff rates among members. The Swiss formula, favored by countries with high tariffs, was adopted in the 2005 Hong Kong Ministerial for non-linear industrial tariff cuts. It is based on T= at/(a+t), where the coefficient (a) determines the final tariff rate. The Swiss formula for non-linear industrial tariff cuts uses a coefficient to determine the final tariff rate. Negotiations in Geneva were focused on determining coefficients for developed and developing countries, with proposals ranging from 6 to 30 for developed countries and 10 to 15 for developing countries and least developed countries. Developing countries propose higher coefficients based on Doha Ministerial Declaration for tariff cuts. ABI proposal by Argentina, Brazil, and India suggests using tariff averages for coefficients, allowing for harmonization within countries' tariff schedules. Just before the 2006 mini-ministerial in Geneva, Pascal Lamy proposed the 20-20-20 compromise, which included a $20 billion cap on U.S. agriculture support and the G-20 market access proposal for developed countries. The NAMA element of the proposal was criticized for lacking ambition by U.S. and EU officials, while U.S. manufacturing groups felt it didn't offer enough market access. Brazil opposed the proposal as too ambitious and called for a coefficient of 30 for developing countries. The NAMA chairman's draft in 2007 suggested a Swiss formula coefficient of [8-9] for developed countries. The chairman proposed a Swiss formula coefficient of [8-9] for developed countries and [19-23] for developing countries, resulting in average tariffs of 3% and 12% respectively. Developing countries like LDCs would have exemptions, while recently acceded members would receive higher coefficients. The July 2007 NAMA draft aimed for a middle ground between the proposed coefficients. Chile proposed a middle ground for the coefficient range in the NAMA-11 proposal, with support from several countries. The reaction to the July 2007 draft was cool, with the NAMA-11 group criticizing the asymmetry and lack of reciprocity in the proposal. Argentina, Bolivia, and Venezuela indicated that the draft could not be the basis for further negotiations. The July 2008 draft, as modified by the Lamy proposal at the July 2008 Ministerial and reaffirmed in the December 2008 draft, suggests an 8 coefficient value for developed countries and a sliding scale approach for the value of the coefficient for developing countries, tied to the use of \"Paragraph 7\" flexibilities introduced in the July 2004 framework agreement. The tariff lines should not exceed 10% of the value of a member's non-agricultural imports, with flexibility for developing countries to choose coefficients of 20, 22, or 25. This change was made to increase flexibility and encourage developing countries to accept the overall tariff reduction formula. A developing country can choose coefficients of 20, 22, or 25 for tariff line flexibility. For coefficient x=20, they can apply less than formula cuts for up to 14% of tariff lines or keep tariff lines unbound for 6.5%. For coefficient y=22, they can apply less than formula cuts for up to 10% of tariff lines or keep tariff lines unbound for 5%. Developing countries can choose coefficients of 20, 22, or 25 for tariff line flexibility. A coefficient of 25 means no flexibilities are used, while coefficients of 20 or 22 allow for less than formula cuts on certain tariff lines. The \"anti-concentration clause\" restricts the use of flexibilities to exclude full chapters of the harmonized tariff schedule. The US and EU oppose excluding whole industrial sectors from formula cuts, while developing countries resist expanding the clause beyond full HS chapters. The December 2008 text reaffirmed full formula tariff reductions as a minimum of 20% of national tariff lines or 9% of the value of imports of the member in each HS chapter. Flexibilities are provided for countries in customs unions like SACU and Mercosur to maintain a common external tariff. Recently acceded members to the WTO have additional flexibilities in proposed modalities for tariff reductions and bindings. Some countries have flexibilities in tariff reductions in the proposed modalities. Certain countries have extended periods to phase-in their tariff commitments. Small and vulnerable economies (SVEs) can have flexibility in tariff reductions but must increase tariff bindings. Venezuela's request to be considered an SVE was not favored by the US. Tariff binding process and bound usage are also key negotiation issues. The negotiations involve the process of tariff binding and the use of bound tariffs in the reduction formula. Tariffs are bound at specific levels of customs duty to maintain stability and predictability in the trading system. The Uruguay Round successfully bound tariffs in both developing and developed countries. The Uruguay Round successfully bound tariffs in developing and developed countries, increasing the percentage of imports under bound rates. Tariff binding sets a maximum tariff that cannot be exceeded without penalty, although many countries apply lower tariffs. The decision to implement tariff cuts based on bound rates was made in the 2004 July Framework and subsequent Hong Kong Ministerial document. The 2004 decision to implement tariff cuts based on bound rates had implications for the tariff formula, aiming for actual market access. Higher coefficients could exclude some tariff lines from cuts, especially in developing countries. The Doha negotiations also focused on binding tariffs by developing countries as a first step in tariff reduction. Under the 2004 Framework Agreement, reductions in unbound tariff lines would be calculated from twice the currently applied rate. The Hong Kong Ministerial Declaration adopted a \"constant non-linear mark-up approach\" for tariff reductions, with a proposed mark-up of applied rate plus 25 percentage points. Developing countries with binding coverage below 15% of tariff lines may need to bind 75% of currently unbound lines. The Hong Kong Ministerial Declaration introduced a tariff reduction approach with a proposed mark-up. Developing countries with low binding coverage may need to bind a percentage of currently unbound tariffs. Non-ad valorem tariffs are to be converted and bound. Special treatment is provided for least developed countries in the negotiations. The Hong Kong Ministerial Declaration agreed that LDCs would increase bound tariffs, receive duty-free access to 97% of tariff lines, and have extended implementation periods for tariff reductions to address preference erosion. The industrial market access talks include negotiations on reducing non-tariff barriers (NTBs) like import licensing, quotas, and technical barriers to trade. The 2004 July Framework required members to submit NTB notifications by October 31, 2004, but substantive negotiations on identified NTBs were limited. NAMA drafts have proposed horizontal and vertical agreements subject to text-based negotiations. Vertical proposals include a mechanism to address specific NTBs apart from the dispute settlement system. WTO members have agreed to consider sectoral tariff elimination as a supplementary modality for NAMA negotiations. Sectoral initiatives involve eliminating tariffs in specific goods with the participation of major trading countries. The 1996 Information Technology Agreement is an example of a completed sectoral tariff elimination agreement involving 41 countries. The Hong Kong Ministerial Declaration instructed negotiators to identify sectors for tariff elimination agreements. Sectors include automotive, chemicals, electronics, fish products, gems, machinery, healthcare, raw materials, and textiles. Countries willing to participate include Canada, EU, Japan, US, and others. Developing countries are resistant to these negotiations. The current NAMA draft reaffirms the voluntary aspects of sectoral negotiations, allowing developing countries to increase their coefficient in the tariff reduction formula. Special treatment is proposed for developing countries participating in sectorals, including \"0 for x\" tariff reductions and longer implementation times. Some developing countries have engaged in these discussions, while others question participation in sectoral negotiations. The switch from \"critical mass\" to \"viable\" in sectoral negotiations has raised concerns among developing countries. The United States has been pushing for developing countries to commit to at least two sectorals and determine cuts before formula cuts. U.S. industry groups are disappointed with the progress of sectoral negotiations. Industry groups, including the National Association of Manufacturers, are critical of the sectoral negotiations in the Doha Round. They believe that strong sectoral agreements are necessary for trade liberalization in industrial goods, as the proposed tariff-cutting formulas are deemed insufficient. With the expiration of U.S. trade promotion authority in 2007, the future of the Round and the potential consequences for industrial tariffs remain uncertain. The potential consequences of the Doha Round's suspension include the acceleration of bilateral and regional free trade agreements by countries like the United States, the EU, Brazil, and India. While these agreements can eliminate tariffs between participating countries, the proliferation of such agreements may complicate international trade with competing tariff schedules and non-tariff barriers, leading to trade diversion. This could also impact the willingness of countries to negotiate multilaterally. The potential consequences of the Doha Round's suspension include the acceleration of bilateral and regional free trade agreements, which may erode the willingness of countries to negotiate multilaterally. The NAMA talks are at risk of losing agreements already made if prolonged disagreements persist, especially without progress in the agriculture talks. Developing countries view agriculture as crucial and use NAMA negotiations as leverage for better agriculture offers. Developing countries use NAMA negotiations as leverage for better agriculture offers, seeking expanded agricultural access in protected developed country markets. Developed countries aim for market openings in industrial products to offset agriculture concessions. Separate agreements in discrete negotiating areas are unlikely due to the single undertaking principle."
