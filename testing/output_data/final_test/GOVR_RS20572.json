GAM's political objectives, including a referendum on independence from Indonesia, have garnered significant public support. However, their tactics such as forced taxation, kidnapping, and criminal activities have faced criticism. GAM aims to establish Aceh as an Islamic kingdom without being a fundamentalist state. The group receives most of its arms from Southeast Asian sources through supply routes in southern Thailand, and its leader Hasan de Tiro is in exile. Aceh Merdeka (Free Aceh or GAM) was established in the 1970s and declared independence in 1976. Its leader, Hasan de Tiro, is exiled in Sweden and is U.S.-educated. GAM condemned the September 11 terrorist attack on the United States but attacked the Arun natural gas facilities of Exxon-Mobil, claiming collaboration with the Indonesian military. The causes of separatism in Aceh stem from its history as an independent kingdom and diplomatic relations with other countries. In 1873, the Dutch invaded Aceh and conquered it after a war that lasted until 1904. There has been a progressive alienation of the population in reaction to the policies of successive Indonesian governments since Indonesia won independence from the Netherlands in 1949. Aceh experienced increased centralization of power in Jakarta under President Suharto from the 1960s. Revolts for independence occurred in the 1970s and late 1980s, with extensive human rights abuses documented. The TNI in Aceh has been involved in extensive human rights abuses since the 1970s. Abusive tactics include murder, torture, and arbitrary arrests of politically active Acehnese, NGO members, and human rights workers. Retaliation for GAM attacks often leads to military units summarily executing male residents in nearby villages. The TNI also extorts money from local businesses for \"protection,\" while Aceh's wealth has mostly gone to Java, causing discontent over the unequal distribution of natural resources. Since the fall of the Suharto government in May 1998, Indonesian policies towards Aceh have been influenced by weak governments, resentment over the loss of East Timor, and the relationship between civilian leaders and the military. Civilian leaders have tried to control the military with minimal success. The TNI retains authority in Indonesia's outer islands, resisting central government control, particularly in Aceh. TNI leadership aims to crush rebellion militarily and opposes negotiations with GAM. The government offers autonomy to Aceh, including 70% of natural resource revenue, the right to impose sharia law (unpopular among Acehnese), and local elections. However, the special autonomy law has not been fully implemented. The provincial government in Aceh has not implemented the special autonomy law, leading to central government control over policies and revenue. The government is accused of corruption and siphoning off aid funds. Negotiations with GAM have produced cease-fires but little progress on key political issues. GAM insists on a referendum alongside special autonomy acceptance. GAM insists on a referendum for independence alongside special autonomy acceptance, while the Indonesian government opposes international involvement in Aceh's settlement. Cease-fires have been signed but broke down due to accusations of GAM rearming and propagandizing for independence. The Indonesian government, under pressure from the TNI, demanded that GAM renounce independence and accept special autonomy within Indonesia. TNI arrested GAM negotiators and held a meeting to pressure the government to end the cease-fire. President Megawati declared martial law in Aceh, giving the TNI full authority. Security forces deployed 45,000 troops, gaining control over major towns and roads. By December 2003, 580 GAM members and 470 civilians were killed, with martial law extended for another six months. Preconditions for negotiations included GAM disbanding and accepting special autonomy. The TNI imposed martial law in Aceh, restricting access to the province and expelling foreign aid workers. Foreign journalists and human rights groups were denied access, with reports of human rights abuses including killings, beatings, torture, and arbitrary arrests. The State Department's 2003 human rights report highlighted abuses in Aceh province attributed to the TNI. The TNI in Aceh faced allegations of human rights abuses including killings, beatings, torture, rapes, and arbitrary arrests. Indonesian human rights groups and international organizations reported similar abuses. Former President Abdurrahman Wahid criticized the TNI for disregarding the basic rights of Acehnese people. GAM was also criticized for abuses such as burning schools, kidnappings, extortion, and civilian killings. U.S. policy towards Indonesia aimed to support political evolution towards democracy following East Timor's separation and the fall of the Suharto government. The U.S. policy towards Indonesia aimed to support political evolution towards democracy and Indonesia's territorial integrity. The Pentagon and U.S. Pacific Command advocated restoring links between the U.S. and Indonesian militaries, while the U.S. also prioritized securing Indonesian cooperation against terrorism. The Bush Administration worked to restore military links and implement counter-terrorism training programs in Indonesia. Colin Powell announced a $50 million package of programs to influence the Aceh situation without worsening U.S.-Indonesian relations. The United States supported cease-fires and urged GAM to accept special autonomy within Indonesia. Various diplomatic efforts were made to prevent martial law in Aceh and work towards a political solution, including mediation by retired Major General Anthony Zinni and involvement of National Security Council official Karen Brooks. The Bush Administration resisted declaring GAM a terrorist organization under U.S. law and criticized TNI human rights abuses in Indonesia. President Bush focused on cooperation against terrorism during his visit to Indonesia in October 2003. The Administration also opposed a human rights lawsuit against Exxon-Mobil for complicity in human rights abuses in Aceh. Congressional-imposed prohibitions on U.S. arms sales were in place. The U.S. faces limitations in its role in Aceh due to Congressional restrictions on arms sales to Indonesia and low U.S. influence in the country. The \"Leahy amendment\" prohibits arms sales in response to TNI abuses in East Timor, and demands action against human rights abuses by TNI members. Indonesians are critical of the U.S. due to the invasion of Iraq, impacting U.S. policy on Aceh. The U.S. war on terrorism and attack on Iraq led to less U.S. criticism of martial law in Aceh. General Ryamizard Ryacudu of the TNI stated that future U.S. training of TNI personnel would be unnecessary. Anti-U.S. sentiment is strong within the TNI."
