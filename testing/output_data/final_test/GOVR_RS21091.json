    "content": "The court handling an interstate child custody dispute must determine jurisdiction based on the PKPA, UCJEA, and UCCJA laws. The PKPA prioritizes the child's home state, where they lived for six months before the custody petition. If a parent moves with the child, the original state remains the home state for an additional six months. Custody orders can be modified in all states. In all states, custody orders can be modified by a court to further the best interests of the child. The court that issued the initial custody decree has \"continuing jurisdiction\" over custody matters under the PKPA, provided certain conditions are met. If a parent living in another state wants to modify the initial custody arrangement, they must file the modification petition in the first state. The PKPA allows for modification of custody orders if the second state has jurisdiction and the first state no longer has jurisdiction. The federal Parent Locator Service can assist in locating abductors in cases of parental kidnapping. States treating parental kidnapping as a felony can enlist the PKPA for assistance. The PKPA allows states to enlist the F.B.I.'s help in locating abducting parents if parental kidnapping is treated as a felony. Parental kidnapping is considered a felony in many states, especially if the child is taken out of state or violates an existing custody order. Some states extend criminal sanctions to pre-custody decree kidnappings and allow courts to assess expenses against convicted individuals. International parental kidnapping is a federal crime punishable by a fine and/or imprisonment for up to three years. The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction provides a possible solution for locating abducted children, with approximately 40 countries, including the United States, Mexico, Canada, and most of Europe, agreeing to promptly return abducted children to their habitual residence country. The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction provides a solution for locating abducted children, with certain conditions such as the child's age and the country's signature on the Convention. The left-behind parent must prove exercising custody rights and lack of permission for the child's removal. The goal is the child's swift return to resolve custody disputes in the original country's courts. The Family Support Act of 1988 requires child support payments to be automatically withheld from the obligated parent's paycheck, even if payments are not late. Parents are obligated to support all their children, regardless of marital status or other obligations. Noncustodial parents must continue to support children from previous relationships, even if they are married to someone else or supporting other children. If a parent falls behind in support payments, withholding is enforced, with exceptions only if good cause is found or both parents agree to an alternative arrangement. The Family Support Act of 1988 requires child support payments to be automatically withheld from the obligated parent's paycheck, even if payments are not late. Withholding may be used to collect current support payments as well as arrearages. States have the option to apply withholding to income other than wages and to order withholding from various sources. Child support orders can be modified based on financial circumstances or the child's needs, but modifications can only be made prospectively. The 1986 Bradley amendment effectively bars retroactive modifications to child support orders. The 1986 Bradley amendment to federal child support laws prohibits retroactive modification of past-due support obligations. Non-compliance with child support orders can result in contempt of court, fines, or jail time. Failure to pay child support across state lines became a federal crime in October 1992, with penalties including fines and prison sentences. A custodial parent can seek help from a child support enforcement agency if they are unable to locate the noncustodial parent to obtain or enforce a child support order. This assistance is provided by state or local IV-D agencies and is available to all custodial parents, regardless of receiving public assistance."
