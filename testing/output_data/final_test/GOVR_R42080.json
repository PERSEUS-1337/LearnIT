    "content": "The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) establishes public access to government information, including regulations on fees, appointment of liaisons and officers, request tracking systems, and annual reporting. The FOIA requires requesters to check on the status of their requests, mandates the creation of an annual report with specific data on FOIA processing, and requires the establishment of a public access mechanism for the report. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are government-sponsored enterprises that receive special treatment for purchasing mortgages and promoting affordable housing goals. The implicit federal guarantee backing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac has allowed them to borrow money at lower interest rates. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 temporarily authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to purchase securities from the GSEs. In 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac entered conservatorship under the FHFA to improve financial health. The government provided over $150 billion in support through preferred stock purchases. They have been major players in the mortgage market since the financial crisis. Representative Jason Chaffetz introduced a bill to make them subject to FOIA. The Transparency Act of 2011 (H.R. 463) would subject Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to FOIA, holding them accountable for statutory requirements like recordkeeping, records access, and regulations in the Federal Register. This includes clarifying fees for record requests and training staff to process FOIA requests within 20 days. The Transparency Act of 2011 (H.R. 463) would require Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to comply with FOIA, allowing requesters to challenge withheld records through administrative or legal means. Attorney General Holder's memorandum stated that DOJ would defend denials only if disclosure harms protected interests or is prohibited by law, potentially requiring modifications for the GSEs. The Transparency Act of 2011 (H.R. 463) would require Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to comply with FOIA, citing precedents like Amtrak. The bill was forwarded to the House Committee on Financial Services but no further action has been taken. This raises questions about the types of records currently unavailable from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The Transparency Act of 2011 (H.R. 463) raises questions about the types of records not available from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, including concerns about FOIA compliance, recordkeeping laws, and the protection of confidential records. The report examines the policy option of subjecting Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to FOIA, analyzing the costs and benefits of administration and application. It also identifies alternative policy options for Congress regarding oversight of the conservatorship. FOIA was enacted in 1966 to provide public access to federal records and a formal procedure for challenging denials. FOIA was amended multiple times, with the latest in 2010. Making Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac subject to FOIA would grant public access to their records, with the companies needing to justify any withheld information. It is uncertain if DOJ would have different criteria for defending the companies' decisions. Some records may be accessible through other avenues like the Federal Elections Commission or FHFA. If H.R. 463 were adopted, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may be subject to FOIA requests due to their conservatorship under FHFA. Questions may arise regarding ownership and control of requested records, as it is unclear if conservatorship affects their status as federal government property. FOIA requests for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may be subject to limitations and exemptions. Key areas of public interest could include contract information, financial agreements, and detailed financial product information. In 1970, Congress enacted the Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970, creating the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (now Amtrak). The law allowed public access to the corporation's records, regardless of stock ownership. The Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970 created Amtrak and allowed public access to its records. A bill in 1972 placed Amtrak under FOIA provisions, ensuring transparency due to federal funding. In 1997, Amtrak's FOIA application was limited to subsidy-receiving years by the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act. FOIA requirements aim to enhance transparency and effectiveness in administration. Amtrak promulgated regulations clarifying its FOIA policy, including fees and protection of business information. Requesters can anticipate fees for record requests, and submitters can designate information for protection under FOIA exemption b(4). If business information is requested, Amtrak must notify the submitter. Amtrak must notify the submitter if a record designated for protection under b(4) is requested. The submitter can object to the release and submit a written statement to Amtrak. Amtrak may consider the submitter's statement before making a final decision on releasing the record. Congress has subjected private companies receiving substantial taxpayer funds to FOIA, but Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not explicitly covered. FOIA applies only to agencies in the executive branch of the federal government, not private companies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Courts determine if an entity is an \"agency\" for FOIA purposes by comparing its powers and characteristics with other agencies. Factors considered include the performance of governmental functions and government control over the entity. FHFA, as an independent regulatory agency, must comply with FOIA. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, regulated by FHFA and under conservatorship since 2008, are not directly subject to FOIA. Judicial Watch, Inc. filed a FOIA request for campaign contribution records from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which FHFA declined to provide. In 2009, Judicial Watch filed a FOIA request with FHFA for documents from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. FHFA declined, stating the GSEs were private companies and their records were not FHFA's. The court upheld this, determining the requested documents were not \"agency records\" based on control and acquisition criteria. The appellate court upheld the district court's decision that FHFA did not have control of the records as required by FOIA. Both courts applied a four-part test to determine control, derived from a previous case involving the National Cancer Institute. The crucial requirement was that agencies must use or rely on the documents to perform agency business before deeming them 'agency records'. The appellate court found that the FHFA did not have control of the records as required by FOIA because the records were not used or relied upon for agency business, and therefore, access to them would not further the objectives of the FOIA. The appellate court ruled that the FHFA did not have control of the records, and disclosing them would not serve the purpose of the FOIA. The analogy was drawn to cases involving failed banks under FDIC receivership. The FDIC, as conservator or receiver of a failed bank, succeeds to the title of its records. FOIA cases involving FDIC conservatorship or receivership did not involve claims that requested records were not \"agency\" records. Most cases involved records prepared by the failed institution for the FDIC or records created by the FDIC in handling claims against the failed institution. One case involved a request for information on a real estate project of a bank subsidiary operated by the FDIC as its receiver. The FDIC, as conservator or receiver of a failed bank, claims exemption from disclosing documents under FOIA's Exemption 4, citing them as \"trade secrets and commercial or financial information.\" Questions arise regarding recordkeeping requirements for entities under FHFA conservatorship like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. FOIA currently applies to executive branch agencies and a few other government entities, with only Amtrak being a private company subject to FOIA. If H.R. 463 were enacted, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would face start-up and operational costs related to implementing FOIA requirements, including staff training, record indexing, processing, and potential litigation. The entities, as part of the government, would need to balance these new constraints with existing laws and regulations that govern recordkeeping and public access. One method to estimate potential FOIA costs for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is to analyze the costs incurred by FHFA, the GSEs' conservator. In FY2010, FHFA received 116 FOIA requests, processed 109, had 1.6 full-time FOIA staff, and incurred $200,000 in processing costs and $20,000 in litigation costs. In FY2009, FHFA received 118 requests, processed 116, had one full-time FOIA staff, and processing cost $150,000 with no litigation costs. The impact of H.R. 463 on information disclosure is uncertain, as companies often consider certain business information as confidential. Companies often view certain business information as confidential for competitive advantage. FOIA exemptions, like Exemption 4 for \"trade secrets and commercial information,\" would likely apply to requests to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. FHFA's annual FOIA reports can offer insight into exemptions applied to requests. In FY2010, FHFA processed 109 requests and applied 36 exemptions, including nine under Exemption 4 and fourteen under Exemption 5. These exemptions protect trade secrets, business information, and inter-agency memoranda. In FY2009, FHFA processed 116 FOIA requests and applied 80 exemptions, including claims under exemptions two, six, and eight. The agency is required to establish procedures for receiving and processing FOIA requests, including hiring staff to review and locate records. It is unclear if Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's new FOIA staff would be hired under civil service laws. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's new FOIA staff hiring process and their status as federal employees are unclear. FOIA mandates agencies to post request procedures on their website and submit annual reports to DOJ. FHFA employed 1.6 full-time FOIA staff in FY2010, indicating similar resources would be needed for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac if H.R. 463 is enacted. Training for staff on FOIA implementation may increase startup time and costs. The implementation of FOIA for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under conservatorship may lead to increased startup time and costs. Uncertainty surrounds the duration of the GSEs' conservatorship and the coverage of records under FOIA. The legislation is vague on which records would be eligible for release, potentially risking disclosure of confidential information. The disclosure of confidential information by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could hinder stockholder control. The applicability of FOIA after the GSEs leave conservatorship is uncertain, raising questions about recordkeeping and transparency requirements. The Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Transparency Act of 2011 aims to enforce FOIA's requirements on the GSEs. Representative Chaffetz highlighted the federal government's involvement in managing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The federal government has invested over $145 billion in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with potential liabilities in the hundreds of billions. H.R. 463 was referred to the House Committee on Financial Services, Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government Sponsored Enterprises. A hearing on \"Transparency, Transition and Taxpayer Protection\" discussed the bill, with the FHFA acting director stating that FOIA was not meant for private companies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Applying FOIA to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, private companies in conservatorship, may undermine FHFA's mandates to preserve assets and minimize losses. This could lead to significant operational and compliance costs, legal burdens, and potential litigation expenses. Subjecting Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to FOIA could result in significant litigation expenses and raise collateral issues for other private companies under conservatorship. Stakeholders have alternative avenues to obtain information with appropriate safeguards in place. David C. John from the Heritage Foundation testified that applying FOIA to these entities could benefit other financial institutions. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could benefit from FOIA to prevent future financial mistakes. Representative Chaffetz's bill aims to increase transparency and accountability for these entities. Other bills in Congress focus on transparency in corporate campaign contributions, potentially impacting private-sector autonomy. The Corporate Politics Transparency Act, H.R. 2728, would require shareholder approval for corporate campaign contributions over $10,000. FOIA exempts certain records from disclosure, including information classified for national defense, agency internal rules, data exempted by statute, and trade secrets. Certain information is exempt from disclosure under FOIA, including trade secrets, privileged or confidential information, inter-agency memoranda, personnel files, investigatory records, and geological data.
