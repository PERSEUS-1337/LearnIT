    "content": "Check cashers are nonbank businesses that cash checks for a fee and offer additional fee-based services like money orders, bill payments, and funds transfers. They operate in underserved neighborhoods, providing financial services to individuals without bank accounts. Check cashers must establish a relationship with a bank to clear checks, transfer funds, and open lines of credit. They are classified as money services businesses (MSBs) under the Bank Secrecy Act regulations and must comply with anti-money laundering requirements, including registering with FinCEN and filing reports. Check cashers must register with FinCEN, and banks serving them must manage associated risks. The OCC considers check cashers high-risk businesses, with varying risk profiles based on services offered. FinCEN's BSA enforcement was strengthened post-9/11, impacting banker's compliance costs. Substantial fines were imposed by regulators. The risks associated with a check cashing business include substantial fines for BSA non-compliance, leading to banks discontinuing services for check cashers. In response, bank regulators issued guidance to prevent the loss of access to financial services and products for this market segment. The guidance emphasized the need for caution when dealing with check cashers and other MSBs to maintain transparency and safeguard the U.S. financial system. The Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit held an oversight hearing on the impact of BSA obligations on check cashers and other MSBs. The nonbank check cashing industry dates back to the 1930s when workers without bank accounts used check cashers to convert paychecks into cash. Today, check cashing businesses offer fee-based products and services. Check cashing businesses may offer fee-based products and services such as money orders, utility bill payments, prepaid phone cards, and funds transfers. They also provide credit products like payday loans. Cashers primarily handle payroll checks, government checks, personal checks, cashier's checks, money orders, and traveler's checks, with fees ranging from 1% to 12% of the check's value. The main financial risk is a returned unpaid check. The check cashing industry has grown significantly since the early 1990s, with an estimated 11,000 enterprises cashing around 180 million checks worth $55 billion in 2002. Customers are attracted to check cashers for their convenient hours of service. Some states regulate fees and require licenses for check cashing businesses. Check cashing businesses provide a convenient alternative to traditional banking institutions, without encountering barriers like minimum balances, credit checks, and fees. Customers' funds are immediately available, unlike banks that may impose check clearing holds. These businesses cater to low and moderate-income consumers, including the significant number of unbanked families in the United States. Studies estimate that about 10 million U.S. households do not have a bank account due to costs, dislike of banks, and the convenience offered by nonbank financial services. In 1970, the Bank Secrecy Act was enacted to create a federal anti-money laundering program, later amended by the USA PATRIOT ACT in 2001. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network administers regulations for money service businesses, including check cashing enterprises. Banks providing services to check cashers must manage associated risks and comply with BSA reporting requirements. Both banks and MSBs must adhere to BSA reporting and record-keeping requirements, establish anti-money laundering programs based on their size and activities, file CTRs for transactions over $10,000, maintain logs for financial product sales, and report suspicious activities. The IRS examines check cashers for BSA compliance, and interagency guidelines clarify supervisory expectations for banks servicing MSBs. The 2005 guidance was issued to assist banks in developing BSA risk assessments for check cashers and other MSBs, ensuring reasonable access to banking services. An advisory was also issued to address BSA obligations and documentation requirements for MSBs when establishing account relationships at banks. FinCEN recognized the need for outreach to MSBs, especially smaller businesses, to inform them of their BSA requirements. The guidance directed banks to apply BSA requirements on a risk-assessed basis when opening and maintaining accounts for MSBs, with five minimum due diligence expectations outlined. The guidance outlines due diligence expectations for banks when establishing account relationships with money service businesses, including confirming FinCEN registration, compliance with licensing requirements, agent status, and conducting a risk assessment. Check cashers require specific banking services like depository accounts, check collection, funds transfer, and access to lines of credit. Banks earn fee income from providing these services. The decision of banks to discontinue services to check cashers could have a significant impact due to the specialized services provided. BSA compliance requirements are seen as burdensome, leading banks to re-evaluate the costs and benefits of serving check cashers. Banking representatives find the level of BSA risk assessment and monitoring required by regulatory agencies to be costly and burdensome. Despite the 2005 guidance, the burden and cost of BSA compliance for financial institutions remain high. There are concerns about defining risk profiles and due diligence expectations, as well as clarifying that banks are not responsible for monitoring the activities of check cashers' customers. FinCEN acknowledged ongoing industry concerns in March 2006, highlighting the need to minimize costs for financial institutions while ensuring compliance with BSA regulations. The news release addressed concerns about minimizing costs for financial institutions in administering anti-terrorism financing and anti-money laundering programs. It sought input on additional guidance for check cashers and MSBs' access to banking services to prevent driving these businesses underground. Comments are under review, and potential next steps are being considered. A hearing was held on the Bank Secrecy Act's impact on money services businesses. Banks re-evaluating strategies due to BSA costs, some institutions no longer servicing MSBs. Suggestions for regulatory adjustments and stronger state oversight. FiSCA calls for legislation to remove check cashers from \"high risk\" category and limit enforcement actions against banks. Joint industry/government training on BSA obligations proposed."
