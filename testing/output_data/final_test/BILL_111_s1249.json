    "content": "The Act titled \"Medicare Payment Improvement Act of 2009\" includes a section on the Value Index under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule. The Medicare Payment Improvement Act of 2009 includes a section on the Value Index under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule, which amends Section 1848(e)(5) of the Social Security Act to determine a value index for each hospital referral area based on quality and cost components. The Secretary will establish measures reflecting health outcomes, patient safety, and satisfaction for the Medicare population using the best available data. An advisory group of experts and stakeholders will make consensus recommendations under the Medicare Payment Improvement Act of 2009. The advisory group, consisting of providers, purchasers, health plans, researchers, federal agencies, and technical experts, will make recommendations to the Secretary on developing the quality component. They will consider various areas in their recommendations. The advisory group will consider areas such as high variation and cost per capita utilization of resources, health outcomes, functional status of patients, and continuity of care in their recommendations to the Secretary for developing the quality component. The curr_chunk focuses on the management and coordination of health care and care transitions for patients across different providers, settings, and plans. It also emphasizes the importance of patient, caregiver, and authorized representative experience, quality of information provided, and its relevance. The curr_chunk emphasizes the safety, effectiveness, and timeliness of care, appropriate use of healthcare resources, and other relevant items determined by the Secretary. The Secretary must consider recommendations from a group and ensure transparency in developing the quality component for each hospital referral area. The quality component for a hospital referral area is determined by comparing its quality score to the national average. If the area's score is not in the top 25th percentile and reimbursement exceeds what would have been under previous legislation, adjustments may be made. The Improvement Act of 2009, if not enacted, shall be applied as if the amendments had not been enacted. For hospital referral areas smaller than a state, if quality data is insufficient at the sub-State level, the quality component will be based on the entire State. The cost component is determined by total annual Medicare expenditures per beneficiary under part A and this part. The Secretary may use total per beneficiary expenditures under parts A and this part in the last two years of life as an alternative measure if it better accounts for severity differences among hospital referral areas. The cost component for a hospital referral area shall be the ratio of the cost per beneficiary for that area to the national average cost per beneficiary. Section 1848 of the Social Security Act is amended accordingly. The amendment to (42 U.S.C. 1395w-4) includes adding \"value\" to subsection (b)(1)(C) and subsection (e) to incorporate a value index for physician work. The amendment includes adding \"value\" to subsection (b)(1)(C) and subsection (e) to incorporate a value index for physician work, and adjusting factors for physicians' services in hospital referral areas. The amendment adds a physician work value adjustment factor for services in hospital referral areas, based on relative value units and a value index score. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must make the quality component available before implementation. The amendment to the Social Security Act adds a physician work value adjustment factor for services in hospital referral areas. The amendments apply to the Medicare physician fee schedule from 2012 onwards, with a transition period for payment adjustments. In 2013, 50 percent of payment is based on pre-amendment rates and 50 percent on post-amendment rates. In 2014 and beyond, payment is based on post-amendment rates."
