    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Sexual Harassment Prevention Act of 1994\". The Congress finds that sexual harassment in employment persists widely in the workplace, violating title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and affecting employees. Prevention is the most effective tool for eliminating sexual harassment, as highlighted by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Surveys show that a significant percentage of female and male employees have experienced harassment, with the American Psychological Association estimating that at least 50% of working women have been sexually harassed during their careers. The vast majority of sexual harassment episodes go unreported, with only 5 percent of employees filing formal complaints. Sexual harassment has significant costs for both employees and employers, with a study showing it costs a typical Fortune 500 employer $6,000,000 annually. Ignoring the issue is 34 times more expensive than addressing it through effective programs and policies. The purposes of this Act are to establish workplace requirements to reduce sexual harassment, provide a low-cost system for employers to prevent it, raise employee awareness, and enhance the authority of enforcement agencies in preventing sexual harassment in employment. The Act aims to establish workplace requirements to reduce sexual harassment, provide a low-cost prevention system for employers, raise employee awareness, and enhance enforcement agencies' authority in preventing sexual harassment in employment. Employer requirements are outlined in Section 3. Each employer must post a notice in the workplace outlining the definition of sexual harassment, stating it is a violation of Federal law, and providing information on how to file a complaint with the primary enforcement agency. Each employer must provide an annual written notice to individual employees containing information on how to file a charge with the primary enforcement agency for sexual harassment complaints, along with details on the employer's procedures for resolving such allegations. Employers must provide annual written notice to employees on filing sexual harassment complaints and resolution procedures. Supervisory employees must receive information on addressing harassment within 60 days of promotion. Willful violation of these requirements may result in a civil penalty of up to $1,000 per violation. SEC. 4. DUTIES OF THE ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. Each primary enforcement agency must provide employers with model notices and guidelines for addressing discrimination and harassment in employment within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The agency must also review and update these materials periodically. The primary enforcement agency must periodically review and update the notices and guidelines for compliance with the Act. Within 180 days of the Act's enactment, a toll-free telephone number will be provided for employees and employers to obtain information and model notices. SEC. 5. ENFORCEMENT. If an employee covered under specific sections alleges a violation of section 3, the Commission or the Office of Fair Employment Practices of the House of Representatives will enforce it according to established procedures. The Office or entity must allow complaints to be filed within 180 days of an alleged violation without requiring counseling or mediation. Review of final decisions can be sought, and proceedings must adhere to the rules and procedures in place. Following a proceeding under paragraph (1) or (2), if an employer is found to be non-compliant with section 3, the Office or entity may order a civil penalty. For Senate employees alleging a violation of section 3, the Office of Senate Fair Employment Practices will consider the allegation according to specified hearing procedures. The Employee Rights Act of 1991 allows employees to file a complaint within 180 days of an alleged violation without requiring counseling or mediation procedures. A final decision from a proceeding can be reviewed by the Select Committee on Ethics. Judicial review is also available for parties involved in the proceeding. Judicial review of final decisions from proceedings can be sought by any party involved, with the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit conducting the review. Procedures for conducting proceedings must adhere to relevant requirements, including those related to agreements, costs, closed hearings, and requests for witnesses and information. Remedies may be provided after a proceeding, as determined by the appropriate Office, Committee, or entity. The Office, Committee, entity, or court may order a civil penalty if an employer is found not in compliance with section 3. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is referred to as the Commission in this Act. An employee is defined as individuals in various employment positions, including those in the House of Representatives, Senate, and Congress-related instrumentalities. The term \"employer\" in the context of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Act includes various entities such as employers defined in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Federal entities, employing authorities of the House of Representatives and Senate, and elected officials. The term \"instrumentality of the Congress\" includes various offices of the legislative branch of the Federal Government. The term \"primary enforcement agency\" refers to the Commission for certain allegations of sexual harassment. The Office of Fair Employment Practices of the House of Representatives and the Office of Senate Fair Employment Practices handle allegations of sexual harassment. The term \"sexual harassment\" has the same meaning as in title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Act will take effect on the date of its enactment, with employer requirements coming into effect one year later."
