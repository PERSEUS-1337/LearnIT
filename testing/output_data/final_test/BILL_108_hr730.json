The Housing Affordability Assurance Act requires agencies to certify that proposed and final rules will not significantly impact housing affordability, with certifications published in the Federal Register. The Housing Affordability Assurance Act mandates agencies to certify that rules will not harm housing affordability, with certifications published in the Federal Register. Any agency making a certification must provide a copy to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Exceptions apply to certain banking rules. The curr_chunk discusses entities such as credit unions, Federal home loan banks, Farm Credit System institutions, and foreign banks operating in the United States or their affiliates, as defined by specific acts. It also mentions the payments system and deposit protection. The curr_chunk discusses the requirements for agencies when publishing proposed rules, including stating the text of the rule with specificity, requesting input from interested parties, and providing an opportunity for feedback before finalizing the rule. The final rule must include an initial housing impact analysis for public comment, describing the impact on housing affordability. This analysis is to be published in the Federal Register simultaneously with the proposed rule and sent to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. The final rule must include an initial housing impact analysis for public comment, describing the impact on housing affordability. It should contain a description of the reasons for agency action, objectives, legal basis, cost implications, and identification of relevant federal rules. The agency must prepare a final housing impact analysis for rulemaking if the certification under subsection (a) has not been made. The analysis should include a statement of the rule's need and objectives, a summary of issues raised during the public comment period, and an assessment of the rule's impact on housing affordability. The agency must provide a final housing impact analysis for rulemaking if the certification under subsection (a) is not made. The analysis includes a statement of the rule's need and objectives, issues raised during the public comment period, and an assessment of the rule's impact on housing affordability. Federal agencies can avoid duplicative analyses by performing them in conjunction with other required analyses or considering closely related rules as one for analysis purposes. The agency must make copies of the final housing impact analysis available to the public and publish it in the Federal Register. The agency may provide a quantifiable or numerical description of the effects of a proposed rule or alternatives, or more general descriptive statements if quantification is not feasible. The requirements of subsections (d) and (e) do not change standards applicable by law to agency action. An agency head can waive or delay some or all of the requirements by publishing a written finding in the Federal Register. The final rule may be promulgated in response to an emergency, making compliance with certain provisions impracticable. The agency head can delay the completion of requirements for up to 180 days with a written finding published in the Federal Register. The final rule may lapse if a housing impact analysis is not completed within 180 days. Housing affordability is defined as housing that is affordable to families with incomes not exceeding 150% of the median income in the area. The term \"agency\" refers to any authority of the US government, excluding Congress, courts, territories, and certain other entities. The term \"agency\" excludes Congress, courts, territories, and certain entities. The term \"families\" is defined in the United States Housing Act of 1937. The term \"rule\" refers to any rule specified in various sections of the United States Code. The term \"rule\" is defined as any rule for which an agency publishes a notice of proposed rulemaking, excluding rules related to specific financial matters. The term \"significant\" is defined as increasing. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development must develop model housing impact analyses within a year of this Act's enactment. These analyses will define the primary elements of a housing impact analysis for other agencies to follow. Any agency determination on the Act's applicability to its actions is generally not subject to judicial review. The agency's actions, including housing impact analyses, are not typically subject to judicial review. However, judicial review may still be available for other impact statements required by law."
