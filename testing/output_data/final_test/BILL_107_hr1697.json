    "content": "The Act titled \"Broadband Competition and Incentives Act of 2001\" includes an amendment to the Clayton Act to address market power entry in broadband telecommunications services. The \"Broadband Competition and Incentives Act of 2001\" prohibits Bell operating companies from providing interLATA services in their in-region States unless the Attorney General determines they do not have market power in providing wireline telephone exchange service. Market power is defined as serving over 85% of business or residential subscribers in the State. The \"Broadband Competition and Incentives Act of 2001\" restricts Bell operating companies from offering interLATA services in their in-region States unless the Attorney General confirms they lack market power in providing wireline telephone exchange service, defined as serving over 85% of subscribers in the State. Definitions for terms like 'affiliate' and 'Bell operating company' are provided in the Act. SEC. 201 of the \"Broadband Deployment Incentives Act\" prohibits discriminatory taxes on broadband services by States or political subdivisions. It also limits taxes or fees on telecommunications carriers for public rights-of-way use. Liabilities for accrued taxes before the Act's enactment are not affected. SEC. 202 of the \"Broadband Deployment Incentives Act\" establishes a loan program for eligible rural and underserved communities. The Attorney General of the United States may provide direct loans or loan guarantees to eligible broadband service providers for deploying broadband services in rural communities and underserved areas. Providers must meet eligibility requirements and submit an application demonstrating their capability to deliver broadband services. Direct loans and loan guarantees under this section must comply with the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, have an interest rate not exceeding 2% per year, and have a repayment term of 30 years or the useful life of the assets funded. The Attorney General may not consider the technology used in direct loans or guarantees. A security interest can be taken in assets or revenue streams to cover the financed amount. $3 billion is authorized for fiscal years 2002-2006. SEC. 203. DEFINITIONS. In this title, \"affiliate\" refers to a person with ownership or control over another person, \"assessment\" is a property tax valuation, \"assessment jurisdiction\" is a geographical area for property value assessment, and \"broadband service\" is high-speed internet. High-speed broadband telecommunications provide users with high-quality voice, data, graphics, and video capabilities. Commercial business refers to non-broadband service provider businesses for commercial use, while commercial property is non-provider property for commercial use. Discriminatory tax is any tax imposed on broadband service providers by a State or its subdivisions. The assessment of property owned by broadband service providers should not be unfairly valued compared to other commercial properties. It should consider intangible assets and not be based solely on tangible assets. The term \"eligible rural community\" refers to a census tract that is not within 10 miles of a populated area with over 25,000 people and not within a county with a population density exceeding 500 people per square mile. The term \"telecommunications carrier\" is defined in the Communications Act of 1934, and the term \"tax\" is defined in the Internet Tax Freedom Act. The term \"underserved area\" is defined as any census tract located in specific designated zones or communities under various sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Secretary of the Treasury must designate and publish census tracts meeting specific criteria within 90 days of the enactment of the Act."
