    "content": "Human trafficking, or trafficking in persons (TIP), is a global and domestic crime linked to labor, public health, and human rights violations. The U.S. and international community are committed to combating human trafficking, with efforts increasing since the enactment of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA) and the U.N. Protocol in 2000. Congress has passed anti-TIP laws, appropriated funds, and evaluated programs, reauthorizing the TVPA four times since 2000. This report focuses on international and domestic human trafficking and U.S. policy responses, emphasizing the TVPA. The report discusses international and domestic human trafficking, U.S. policy responses, and the TVPA. It covers key TIP-related definitions, foreign policy responses, immigration relief for victims, law enforcement efforts, and the most recent TVPA reauthorization. Various international and domestic definitions are relevant for measuring progress in combating human trafficking. The U.N. Protocol defines \"trafficking in persons\" as the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, or receipt of persons through coercion for the purpose of exploitation, including sexual exploitation, forced labor, slavery, servitude, or organ removal. The U.N. Protocol defines trafficking in persons as specific acts and methods for exploitation, emphasizing human exploitation and vulnerability. Victim consent is irrelevant when exploitation occurs through force, fraud, or coercion. Human trafficking is defined as exploitation through force, fraud, or coercion, including sex trafficking involving minors or labor trafficking for involuntary servitude. This definition is used in U.S. law, specifically the TVPA. The U.S. anti-trafficking policies and programs, including the State Department's annual Trafficking in Persons Report (TIP Report), measure and rank countries' progress in eliminating severe forms of trafficking. Failure to meet minimum standards may result in restrictions on U.S. foreign assistance. The TVPA defines key terms related to severe forms of trafficking, such as coercion, commercial sex acts, debt bondage, involuntary servitude, and sex trafficking. The TVPA defines key terms related to severe forms of trafficking, including coercion, commercial sex acts, debt bondage, and involuntary servitude. Sex trafficking involves recruiting, harboring, transporting, or obtaining a person for commercial sex acts. The U.S. and U.N. definitions of human trafficking both prohibit force, fraud, and coercion, but differ in the concept of exploitation. The U.N. includes organ removal as exploitation, which is not in the U.S. definition. Human trafficking is distinct from human smuggling. Human smuggling involves providing a service for illegal entry into a foreign country, while human trafficking involves force, fraud, or coercion. Forced or compulsory labor is defined by the International Labor Organization as work under threat of penalty without voluntary consent. Forced labor is recognized as a fundamental worker right by the ILO and is described in the TVPA of 2008 as occurring through force, threats, harm, abuse, or coercion. The TVPA of 2008 defines \"involuntary servitude\" as forced labor that can result in serious harm or physical restraint. Forced labor is a key form of human trafficking according to the State Department and is considered in country assessments in the annual TIP Report. The CSPA of 2008 defines a \"child soldier\" as a person under 18 who takes part in hostilities or is recruited into armed forces involuntarily. The CSPA of 2008 defines a \"child soldier\" as a person under 18 who has been recruited or used in hostilities by armed forces distinct from the armed forces of a state. This includes children in support roles such as cooks, porters, messengers, medics, guards, and sex slaves. The U.N. Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child in Armed Conflict addresses the recruitment and use of child soldiers, stating that children under 18 are included and that using children under 15 in hostilities is a war crime. International human trafficking is also a significant concern in this context. International human trafficking is a major law enforcement challenge and violation of human rights, impacting economic development and public health. Organized criminal groups are involved in this phenomenon, varying in leadership structure, organizational sophistication, reach, size, composition, profit source, violence use, and cooperation with other criminal groups. Operations involve recruiters, employment agency managers, and corruption. Human trafficking involves unscrupulous recruiters, corrupt officials, and is integrated into legal businesses like tourism, agriculture, and entertainment. Related crimes include fraud, extortion, money laundering, and drug trafficking. Women play a significant role in trafficking, with traffickers using various tactics to recruit and maintain victims. Balkan-based groups are commonly involved in these operations. According to the UNODC, Balkan-based groups recruit human trafficking victims through deceptive promises of employment, beauty contests, modeling opportunities, vacations, study abroad programs, and marriage services. Traffickers in Latin America use similar methods. Forced labor trafficking involves contract fraud and switching, where migrants may accept jobs with false agreements and face different working conditions upon arrival. Nigerian traffickers are particularly involved in these activities. Traffickers, including Nigerian and Chinese groups, use debt bondage schemes on individuals who want to be smuggled across borders, making them victims of human trafficking. They manipulate victims through deception, isolation, addiction, threats of violence, and fear of authorities to maintain control. Human trafficking instills fear in victims of arrest or deportation. Estimates vary, but reports suggest millions are victimized annually, contributing to a multi-billion dollar criminal industry. U.S. government estimates range from 600,000 to 800,000 people trafficked across global borders each year, with 2 million to 4 million if trafficking within countries is included. International organizations like the ILO and United Nations have also researched the global scope of human trafficking. The ILO and United Nations have estimated that millions of individuals worldwide are in forced labor due to human trafficking. In 2012, the ILO revised their estimate to 20.9 million victims of forced labor, including labor, sex trafficking, and state-imposed forced labor. A UNODC report in 2012 identified TIP victims from 136 countries exploited in 118 countries. Other studies suggest that around 27 million people may be enslaved globally. Analysts highlight limitations in human trafficking data. Analysts emphasize limitations in human trafficking data, including differences in national definitions, political emphasis, and varying criminal justice systems. Some forms of trafficking may go untracked if laws are not in place, making data comparison challenging. National structures for victim assistance and repatriation vary, with some countries lacking centralized databases. Domestic agencies may provide conflicting figures for anti-trafficking measures. Trafficking for forced labor and sexual exploitation are common forms of human trafficking. Between 2007 and 2010, 58% of cases involved sex trafficking, while 36% involved labor trafficking. Reporting bias may skew these figures. The ILO estimated that 22% of forced labor trafficking cases globally in 2012 involved trafficking for commercial sexual exploitation. Female victims were more common than male victims for both labor and sex trafficking. Children are particularly vulnerable, with 27% of all trafficking victims detected globally between 2007 and 2010 being children. Examples of trafficking involving children include exploitation in the commercial sex industry, forced child begging, domestic servitude, and the use of children in armed conflicts as soldiers. Traffickers exploit children for various purposes such as forced labor, sexual exploitation, and involvement in armed conflicts. They use deception, coercion, and violence to control their victims. Estimates of trafficked children vary, with outdated figures suggesting millions are affected. In 2012, the ILO estimated 5.5 million children were victims of forced labor. The UN reported 1.2 million trafficked children in 2003, while UNICEF and ECPAT estimated 2 million children exploited for commercial sex in 2001. The U.N. Secretary-General noted in 2013 that numerous entities recruit or use children for illicit purposes. Efforts to combat human trafficking have been reinvigorated internationally since the late 1990s and early 2000s. Many countries have laws in place to address human trafficking, but challenges remain in eradicating the practice. Structural vulnerabilities such as poverty and political instability contribute to the persistence of human trafficking. Reports indicate that as many as 50 state and non-state entities recruit or use children in armed conflicts across various countries. Globalization has increased movement across borders, aiding human traffickers. Vulnerable groups, socially isolated and marginalized, are at high risk. Implementation and enforcement limitations hinder anti-trafficking efforts, allowing traffickers to operate with low detection risk. Human traffickers operate with low detection risk and face minimal punishment globally. The discrepancy between the scale of human trafficking and prosecution rates is concerning. Demand for cheap labor and commercial sex fuels domestic and international trafficking markets. The U.S. government has implemented strategies and laws to combat human trafficking, with Congress actively involved in shaping foreign policy and funding anti-trafficking programs. The U.S. government has established key anti-trafficking programs and policies, including the National Security Presidential Directive 22 and the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. Interagency coordination is facilitated through the Senior Policy Operating Group and the President's Interagency Task Force. The Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons at the State Department oversees international anti-trafficking efforts. The U.S. government established key anti-trafficking programs and policies, including the National Security Presidential Directive 22 and the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. The Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons at the State Department coordinates international anti-trafficking efforts, produces the annual TIP Report, and administers anti-TIP grants. Congress mandates periodic reports on TIP-related issues, with the State Department's TIP Report assessing countries' progress in combating trafficking. The annual TIP Report ranks countries based on their compliance with anti-trafficking standards. Tier 1 countries are fully compliant, while the rest vary in their efforts to improve. The report also includes a list of countries involved in using child soldiers. Other U.S. government reports cover related issues such as human rights practices and child labor. Departments are required to maintain lists of products produced by forced labor. The United States bans import of goods produced with forced, indentured, or convict labor. Federal contractors are prohibited from using goods likely made with forced or indentured child labor. Congress allocates funds to combat human trafficking through the TPVA, aiming to prevent trafficking, protect victims, and prosecute traffickers. The TVPRA of 2008 authorized $63.8 million in foreign assistance for combating trafficking in persons from FY2008 to FY2011. However, for FY2014 to FY2017, Congress allocated $46 million for the same purpose. The State Department budgeted varying amounts for anti-human trafficking aid in different fiscal years. Congress has enacted provisions to deny certain types of foreign aid to countries not progressing in eliminating severe forms of TIP. The U.S. government has provisions to deny aid to countries with Tier 3 ranking in the TIP Report or known to recruit child soldiers. The President can waive sanctions if aid promotes national interests. Trade preference programs have been used to boost exports in developing countries. Trade preference programs are designed to promote exports among selected developing countries by providing duty-free entry for specified products into the United States. Beneficiary countries may be designated based on eligibility criteria related to worker rights and child labor. Conditioning preferential trade status on anti-trafficking goals may encourage country compliance with international efforts to combat human trafficking. Several laws, regulations, awareness trainings, and contracts enforcement mechanisms exist to combat human trafficking related to U.S. government activities overseas. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 amended the TVPA to authorize federal agencies to terminate grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements if trafficking is identified. The TVPA authorizes federal agencies to terminate grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements if trafficking is identified, in line with an Executive Order issued by President Obama. Enforcement actions are reported annually to Congress by the Attorney General. The United States is a source, transit, and destination country for human trafficking, affecting both citizens and noncitizens in every state. In 2004, an estimated 17,500 people were trafficked into the U.S. annually, with domestic trafficking occurring primarily for labor in various industries. Labor trafficking is more prevalent among noncitizens, with foreign victims more commonly found in labor trafficking than in sex trafficking. On the other hand, sex trafficking victims in the United States are mostly women and children, with U.S. citizens comprising a significant portion. Domestic sex trafficking of children involves commercial sex acts with victims under 18 years old, often occurring in migrant labor camps. Prostitution by minors is considered a severe form of human trafficking under the TVPA. It is challenging to estimate the total number of trafficking victims in the United States, with government estimates focusing on foreign victims trafficked into the country. The DOJ estimated between 14,500 and 17,500 victims trafficked into the U.S. each year in FY2005, with this estimate remaining the most recent as of January 2014. The estimate of 14,500 to 17,500 trafficking victims in the United States was first reported in 2004. The Attorney General's Report in 2006 suggested this number may be overstated and further research is needed for a more accurate figure. Previous reports by the CIA and DOJ had higher estimates, with a 1999 report estimating 45,000 to 50,000 women and children trafficked annually to the U.S. The estimated number of women and children trafficked annually to the United States ranges from 45,000 to 50,000. Some researchers argue that government estimates lack transparency in methodology, hindering assessment and improvement. Limited research exists on child sex trafficking in the U.S., with a study in Ohio estimating 1,078 victims in 2009. In 2009, a study in Ohio estimated 1,078 victims of sex trafficking. The response in the United States includes assistance to victims, public awareness efforts, and law enforcement actions. Some trafficking victims are noncitizen aliens who are illegally present. Noncitizen trafficking victims in the United States may face challenges due to their immigration status, including having their documents confiscated by traffickers. The Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 created the T visa for victims of severe forms of trafficking, allowing them to stay in the US for four years and apply for permanent residence after three years. This protection helps victims seek help and testify in criminal trials. To qualify for the \"T\" visa in the United States, a victim of severe trafficking must be physically present in the country due to trafficking, comply with law enforcement requests, be under 18, likely to suffer extreme hardship upon removal, and be admissible to the US or obtain a waiver of inadmissibility. A waiver is available for health, public charge, or criminal grounds. Waivers are crucial for T visa eligibility, especially for victims of sexual trafficking. Inadmissibility waivers are necessary for aliens present in the US without admission or parole. T status is limited to 5,000 principal aliens annually, with derivative status available for family members under 21 to avoid extreme hardship. Aliens under age 21 or their parents may be granted derivative T status to avoid extreme hardship, not counted against the numerical limit. T status allows work authorization for four years, extendable if needed for human trafficking investigations. T applicants can receive public benefits like refugees, and family members of trafficking victims are also eligible. Federal officials must provide trafficking victims with information on their rights and services. Between FY2002 and FY2013, there were 6,001 applications for T-1 status (trafficking victims) and 4,117 were approved. Additionally, there were 5,222 applications for derivative T status (family members of trafficking victims) with 4,277 approved. 73% of adjudicated T-1 status applications were approved during this period. Between FY2007 and FY2013, there was an increase in applications for T-1 status, with a peak in FY2011 at 967 applicants. Despite a decrease in applications after FY2011, the approval rate for T-1 status applications increased each year. T status is generally valid for four years and can lead to lawful permanent residence status after three years. The regulations for adjusting to lawful permanent resident (LPR) status from T status were released on December 12, 2008, and became effective on January 12, 2009. To qualify for LPR status, individuals must meet certain criteria, including having been physically present in the US for a continuous period of at least three years since being granted T status, demonstrating good moral character, and showing compliance with requests for assistance in trafficking investigations. The regulations for adjusting to lawful permanent resident (LPR) status from T status were released on December 12, 2008, and became effective on January 12, 2009. Under statute, 5,000 aliens in T-1 status can adjust to LPR status in a fiscal year. The cap does not apply to family members. Federal law enforcement officials encountering trafficking victims may request continued presence in the US, historically granted by the Attorney General. The TVPA gave the Secretary of Homeland Security authority to grant continued presence to trafficking victims, often eligible for work authorization. Requests are handled by the Law Enforcement Parole Branch of DHS's Immigration and Customs. In some cases, law enforcement prefers giving trafficking victims continued presence rather than T status to prevent the appearance that the victim's testimony was \"bought.\" Continued presence was granted to 199 trafficking victims in FY2012, a decrease from FY2011. Victims of trafficking may also be eligible for U nonimmigrant status, known as the U-visa, created for victims of physical or mental abuse under the Violence Against Women Act of 2000. To qualify for U status, the victim must establish suffering substantial abuse as a result of certain criminal activities. The U nonimmigrant status, or U-visa, is granted to individuals who have been victims of criminal activities and have information about the crime. They must be helpful in the investigation and prosecution of the crime, which must have violated US laws. The U category is limited to 10,000 principal aliens per fiscal year, and after three years, they may apply for LPR status. Unlike T status, U status does not provide access to assistance through the Office of Refugee Resettlement or federal public benefits. The U nonimmigrant status, or U-visa, is granted to victims of criminal activities with information about the crime. From FY2009 to FY2013, there were 84,545 applications for U-1 status, with 46,138 approved, and 53,942 applications for derivative U status, with 35,374 approved. Approximately 83% of adjudicated U status applications were approved. The statutory cap of 10,000 principal aliens per fiscal year has been reached every year since FY2010. Despite reaching the cap, USCIS continues to accept and process new petitions, issuing Notice of Conditional Approval to eligible petitioners. The U status allows access to programs for crime victims through the Department of Justice's Office for Victims of Crime. The TVPA and various government departments have programs to assist trafficking victims, including legal services. There is confusion over eligibility for services under anti-trafficking grant programs. The FY2009 report stated funds are for non-U.S. citizens, but the FY2012 report mentioned a policy change allowing assistance for U.S. citizens. The FY2012 Trafficking in Persons report mentions a policy change allowing federal funding for victim services to support U.S. citizen victims of human trafficking. There is disagreement over the eligibility of U.S. citizen and noncitizen victims for certain programs. Certification by HHS is necessary to receive services from HHS, DOL, and Legal. Certification is a necessary condition for noncitizen trafficking victims to receive services from HHS, DOL, and Legal Services Corporation. U.S. citizen and LPR trafficking victims do not need certification. A 2007 report by SPOG states that there are not many differences in trafficking victims' eligibility for services, but U.S. citizen victims may receive less intensive case management services. The TVPA requires HHS to expand benefits and services to victims of severe forms of trafficking in the United States, regardless of immigration status. Victims must be certified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services to receive these benefits and services, and must be willing to assist in the investigation and prosecution of trafficking. Only noncitizen trafficking victims who receive T status are eligible for refugee-specific programs. In the United States, victims of trafficking under 18 do not need certification to receive benefits, but HHS issues eligibility letters to them. U.S. citizen trafficking victims also do not require certification for services. ORR provided certification to 366 adult victims and eligibility letters to 103 children in FY2012. 45% of victims in FY2011 were male, 55% were female, with 75% victims of labor trafficking, 19% of sex trafficking, and 6% of both. The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) provides funds and programs to assist refugees in achieving economic and social self-sufficiency in the United States. Noncitizen victims of trafficking are eligible for these programs, including cash and medical assistance, social services, and targeted assistance. Special refugee cash assistance (RCA) and refugee medical assistance (RMA) are key components of the refugee program, administered by states to help needy refugees ineligible for mainstream federal assistance. Additionally, minor noncitizen victims can participate in DHS's Unaccompanied Refugee Minor Program, with funds authorized by the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA) to provide similar assistance to trafficking victims. The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) provides funds and programs to assist refugees and noncitizen trafficking victims with cash and medical assistance, social services, and targeted assistance. ORR also offers grants to organizations for specific needs like temporary housing, education, and legal assistance. They provide intensive case management, mental health counseling, and foster care programs for children. ORR conducts outreach to inform victims of services and educate the public about trafficking. The HHS conducts outreach to inform victims of services and educate the public about trafficking through the Rescue and Restore campaign, which includes public awareness efforts, anti-trafficking coalitions, and a toll-free National Human Trafficking Resource Center. The TVPA created a grant program administered by the Attorney General through DOJ's Office for Victims of Crime to provide emergency services and grants for trafficking victims, including temporary housing, medical care, crisis counseling, and legal assistance. Grantees can now provide ongoing case management and legal assistance for certified victims, as well as build community capacity to address the needs of trafficking victims. The DOJ's Office for Victims of Crime awards grants to non-governmental organizations to provide comprehensive services to trafficking victims. The DOL's Employment and Training Administration offers job search assistance and training to trafficking victims through One-Stop Career Centers. Job Corps may also be available to eligible victims aged 16-24. Job Corps offers services to eligible trafficking victims, including job search assistance and training. Domestic anti-trafficking efforts involve investigation and prosecution of trafficking offenses, complicated by language barriers and logistical challenges. Controlled delivery operations are not always feasible, and prosecution relies on evidence beyond contraband. The successful prosecution of trafficking cases relies on witnesses who may fear testifying. DOJ and DHS investigate and prosecute traffickers in the United States, primarily through FBI and ICE agents. FBI's CRU investigates trafficking, and FBI field offices participate in anti-trafficking efforts. In FY2011, DOJ charged 263 individuals and obtained 151 convictions in 125 human trafficking prosecutions. DOJ funds anti-trafficking task forces nationwide, with approximately 16 task forces as of the end of FY2012. Thirteen of these task forces are Enhanced Collaborative Model Task Forces, aiming to improve cooperation among law enforcement agencies and victim service organizations. These task forces coordinate cases and provide training on identifying, investigating, and prosecuting human trafficking cases. ICE, DOJ, DOS, and DOL are actively involved in investigating and prosecuting human trafficking cases. Task forces play a crucial role in identifying and prosecuting trafficking cases, with 753 investigations reported in FY2012. U.S. Attorneys are required to establish or participate in task forces on human trafficking. ICE uses a global enforcement strategy to combat human trafficking, investigating 722 cases in FY2011. DOS handles cases involving foreign diplomats, while DOL enforces labor standards laws in trafficking cases. ICE, DOJ, DOS, and DOL are actively involved in investigating and prosecuting human trafficking cases. In July 2011, DHS, DOJ, and DOL started a pilot program creating Anti-trafficking Coordination Teams (ACTeams) in six districts around the United States to develop federal human trafficking investigations and prosecutions. The Human Smuggling and Trafficking Center (HSTC) was established in July 2004 to coordinate efforts in combating trafficking. The Human Smuggling and Trafficking Center (HSTC) was established in 2004 as the federal government's information clearinghouse and intelligence fusion center for addressing human smuggling, human trafficking, and potential terrorist use of smuggling routes. It serves as the focal point for interagency efforts to prevent clandestine terrorist travel, migrant smuggling, and trafficking of persons by coordinating information from all federal agencies. The Human Smuggling and Trafficking Center (HSTC) was established in 2004 to combat human smuggling, trafficking, and potential terrorist use of smuggling routes. The center aims to provide intelligence for combating illegal activities and submits an annual strategic assessment to Congress. However, issues with cooperation, funding, staffing, and information sharing have been identified. Congress has attempted to address these issues, but questions remain about the definition of human trafficking and the effectiveness of anti-trafficking programs. The curr_chunk discusses long-standing policy challenges in human trafficking responses domestically and internationally. It highlights the importance of human trafficking as a foreign policy concern for the United States and references specific reports for more detailed analysis. The text also mentions executive and legislative branch policy guidance on anti-trafficking efforts. The State Department's Office of Inspector General found in a June 2012 report that human trafficking issues and the requirements of the TVPA are poorly understood among U.S. foreign service diplomats, raising questions about the policy priority of human trafficking within the State Department. Outdated guidance and lack of training on TIP issues may contribute to this lack of awareness. Many analysts suggest elevating the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons within the State Department to increase the impact of the TIP report as a diplomatic tool. The report ranks countries into Tier 1 (best), Tier 2, Tier 2 Watch List, and Tier 3 (worst), influencing international action against human trafficking and sometimes causing diplomatic tensions. The TIP report has gained credibility over the years, but some criticize its inconsistent application of minimum standards and lack of clarity in tier rankings. Tier 2 and Tier 2 Watch List are seen as catch-all categories that may include countries deserving of Tier 3 status. The GAO criticizes the TIP report for incomplete narratives, while the State Department emphasizes the need for conciseness. International cooperation, aid restrictions, and sanctions are seen as necessary tools to combat trafficking, but some argue that U.S. aid restrictions lack clarity and consistency. Some argue that U.S. trafficking aid restrictions are not meeting expectations, with concerns that sanctions may hinder cooperation. Congress added a new requirement in 2008 for Tier 2 Watch List countries, potentially leading to more Tier 3 designations and aid restrictions. President Obama took action on September 30, 2013. President Obama issued waivers in FY2014 against 5 of 10 countries listed as Tier 3 for using child soldiers. Chad, South Sudan, and Yemen received full waivers, while the Democratic Republic of Congo and Somalia received partial waivers. Other countries like Burma, Central African Republic, Rwanda, Sudan, and Syria did not receive waivers, leading to criticism from human rights groups. Some argue that waivers granted by President Obama under the Child Soldiers Prevention Act limit US influence on countries using child soldiers. The UN recommended removing presidential waivers, while countries like Rwanda criticized being denied military aid due to the Act. The absence of U.S. support to Rwanda under CSPA aid restrictions criticized for benefiting armed opposition groups. The U.N. defines TIP as coercion or deception in prostitution, not free choice. Sex trafficking is only severe TIP if induced by force, fraud, coercion, or involves minors. Some groups in the U.S. want to redefine TIP to include all prostitution, but many countries oppose this broader definition. Proponents argue that prostitution is violence against women and reject a broader definition of TIP. Countries with legal prostitution oppose the definitional change, while the U.S. State Department links prostitution to TIP in the 2008 report to Congress. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003 restricts anti-trafficking funds to groups that oppose prostitution, excluding prostitutes who could report abuses. The concept of TIP is often confused with human smuggling, addressed by the Palermo Protocols. People trafficked are considered \"victims\" under the U.N. Trafficking Protocol. The U.N. Trafficking Protocol considers trafficked individuals as \"victims\" entitled to government protection, while the U.N. Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants views smuggled individuals as willing participants in criminal activity. There are debates on whether there are clear distinctions between trafficking and smuggling, with some arguing that many smuggled individuals should be seen as trafficking victims. As immigration and border restrictions tighten, smuggling costs increase, making migration routes more dangerous. This puts migrants at high risk of trafficking, with some being sold into forced labor or prostitution by smugglers. Many countries conflate trafficking and smuggling despite U.N. protocols. TIP policies can shape migration in both origin and destination countries. Evaluating the impact of U.S. anti-trafficking efforts is challenging due to few reliable indicators. Current estimates of trafficking victims in the U.S. are lower than previous figures. The United States has lower trafficking victim estimates, but the success of anti-trafficking policies is unclear. International campaign results are lacking, with anecdotal information. Worldwide victim estimates have not changed much. Proposed rules aim to strengthen protections against trafficking in federal supply chains. The proposed updates to federal acquisition regulations aim to strengthen efforts to prevent trafficking in persons in federal supply chains. Stakeholders have raised concerns about the specifics of the updates, including the timeline for adoption, compliance policy updates for companies, and the need for additional guidance on compliance obligations and liabilities. The revised FAR provisions on human trafficking are being debated, with some groups wanting a narrower interpretation and others suggesting broader coverage. Supply chain transparency in the federal government has been in the spotlight following incidents in the Bangladesh garment industry. While these disasters were not linked to human trafficking, they raised concerns about retailers' awareness of their products' origins. Order forms for apparel with U.S. Marine Corps logos were found at Tazreen factory after a fire, raising concerns about U.S. government procurement practices. There are debates about the T status, with some supporting it while others raise concerns about the application process impeding victims. DHS approved 3,269 applications for T-1 status between FY2002 and FY2012, but there are concerns that more aliens are trafficked into the United States. The number of T visas issued in the United States is significantly lower than the estimated number of aliens trafficked into the country annually, leading to questions about the accuracy of the estimates and the government's ability to locate and identify victims. Some argue that the extreme hardship threshold for T status makes it challenging for victims to receive protection. Law enforcement officials have raised concerns about advocacy organizations influencing ICE headquarters without input from other stakeholders. Some advocacy organizations can request ICE headquarters to certify an alien as a trafficking victim without local ICE agents' input. The T classification allows victims to stay in the US to assist in investigations and prosecutions. Concerns exist that the focus on aiding law enforcement may overshadow helping victims, with federal agents potentially overriding a victim's desire to leave the country if it's deemed against US interests. Some victims of trafficking face challenges in receiving protection from law enforcement, with reports of officers pressuring victims to cooperate or risk losing benefits. Service providers express concerns about the lack of safe housing options for trafficking victims, as shelters are often full or ill-equipped to meet their safety needs. Advocacy groups emphasize the importance of victim cooperation in prosecution and investigation efforts to end trafficking. The Collation to Abolish Slavery and Trafficking (CAST) argues that forcing trafficking victims to assist in investigations may endanger their families in their home country. Dianne Post from the Arizona Coalition Against Domestic Violence highlights issues with the TVPA, such as victims needing T status to access services and benefits. The concern is also raised about providing services to U.S. citizen and LPR trafficking victims. The 2007 report by the SPOG and the AG's FY2009 report highlight differences in services for U.S. citizen and noncitizen trafficking victims. ORR does not provide services to U.S. citizen trafficking victims, but HHS may have the authority to provide some services according to appropriation acts. The HHS may have the authority to provide services to U.S. citizen trafficking victims based on appropriation acts since FY2008. OVC funded a grant for Services for Domestic Minor Victims of Human Trafficking between FY2009 and FY2012, which includes both U.S. citizen and LPR victims. The grant program does not differentiate between U.S. citizen and noncitizen victims according to the authorizing language. The DOJ provided grant funding to NGO service providers to assist U.S. citizen and lawful permanent resident victims of trafficking. There was confusion over whether funds appropriated under TVPA could only be used for noncitizen victims, but a policy change in 2012 allowed federal funding for victim services to be used for U.S. citizen victims as well. There is confusion over the authority and funding available under TVPA for services to U.S. citizen trafficking victims. Congress appropriated approximately $28 million in FY2014 for victims services, with a consistent $20 million each year between FY2002 and FY2013. HHS used all its funding for trafficking victims services between FY2009 and FY2013. The DOS TIP report recommends increasing funding for relevant agencies, and there is a lack of targeted federal funding to support state child welfare agencies' anti-trafficking efforts. NGOs report a critical need for more funding. NGOs report a critical need for increased funding to support state child welfare agencies' anti-trafficking efforts. The last U.S. government estimate stated that approximately 14,500 noncitizens are trafficked into the United States annually, with potentially hundreds of thousands of minor sex trafficking victims. Questions arise about the adequacy of resources for trafficking victims, both citizen and noncitizen, and whether allocating funds based on estimated populations could impact service accessibility. The extent to which the needs of U.S. citizen and noncitizen victims are similar or different is also a concern, including factors like victim self-identification and access to public benefit entitlement programs. In the current economic situation, Congress questions the management of grants under TVPA. The Senior Policy Operating Group (SPOG) coordinates efforts to avoid duplication. A 2008 DOJ Inspector General report found weaknesses in grant implementation, noting a lack of effectiveness in identifying and serving trafficking victims. The 2011 IG report highlighted improvements in grant management by DOJ since 2007. Congress passed the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013, which reauthorized the TVPA through FY2017 and made changes to the act, including defining \"sex trafficking\" for VAWA grants.

GAO will study CBP screening effectiveness for child trafficking. The United States has a system to combat human trafficking through prosecution, protection, and prevention. However, it is challenging to determine the extent of the problem and evaluate the effectiveness of policies. The number of trafficking victims is difficult to ascertain, making it hard to assess the success of strategies. Limited resources create tensions in giving equal attention to all types of trafficking and victims. The effectiveness of the TIP report and sanctions in combating human trafficking is debated internationally. U.S. contractors overseas are a focus for trafficking, while domestically, investigations face challenges in locating victims and allocating resources. Policies aim to provide necessary services for all victims, including shelters for minors. Congress is actively working to reduce the prevalence of human trafficking worldwide. The human trafficking problem has gained increased attention in the United States and worldwide since the late 1990s. Congress, along with the Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama Administrations, has prioritized addressing this issue. President Clinton established a government-wide anti-trafficking strategy focusing on prevention, victim support, and prosecution of traffickers. The U.S. government established various task forces and initiatives to combat human trafficking, both domestically and internationally. This included the creation of a Workers' Exploitation Task Force, review of criminal laws, formation of an Interagency Council on Women, and the issuance of National Security Presidential Directive 22 by President George W. Bush in 2002. These efforts aimed to investigate, prosecute, and prevent trafficking, as well as support non-governmental organizations working in this area. President George W. Bush issued National Security Presidential Directive 22 (NSPD-22) in 2002 to vigorously combat human trafficking worldwide. The directive required federal departments to be fully trained, established a \"zero tolerance\" policy for government employees engaging in trafficking, and promoted cooperation with state and local law enforcement, as well as international organizations. President Barack Obama issued Executive Order (EO) 13657 on September 25, 2012, to strengthen protections against human trafficking in federal contracts. The order mandated revisions to contractor guidelines to prevent practices like fraudulent recruitment, charging recruitment fees, and confiscating employee identity documents. Contractors performing services abroad were required to establish compliance plans to prevent trafficking-related activities. Additionally, several bills were introduced in the 106th Congress on human trafficking, which were later combined with the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000. The Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 was signed into law by President Clinton on October 28, 2000. Key provisions included the establishment of an annual report on countries' compliance with anti-trafficking standards and the creation of an Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking. The Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, signed into law by President Clinton, established an Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking within the Department of State. It called for measures to enhance economic opportunities for potential victims, increase public awareness of trafficking dangers, and work with NGOs to combat trafficking. The Act also established programs to assist victims in foreign countries and within the United States, providing protection and assistance without regard to immigration status. The Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 provided protection and assistance for victims of severe forms of trafficking in the United States. It allowed for funds derived from seized assets to be used for victims assistance programs and granted nonimmigrant visas (T visas) to certain trafficking victims facing harm if removed from the US. Additionally, it allowed T visa holders to adjust to lawful permanent resident status under specific conditions. The Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 established minimum standards to combat human trafficking, provided assistance to foreign countries to meet these standards, and called for withholding non-humanitarian assistance from countries not meeting the standards. The Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 set minimum standards to combat human trafficking and provided assistance to foreign countries. It encouraged the President to compile a list of significant traffickers and imposed sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The Act also increased penalties for peonage, enticement into slavery, and sale into involuntary servitude. The George W. Bush Administration and Congress continued the anti-trafficking efforts. The George W. Bush Administration and Congress prioritized anti-trafficking efforts, with Attorney General John Ashcroft announcing upgraded cooperation among law enforcement agencies to combat trafficking. New guidelines for federal prosecutors were issued, and a special \"T\" visa was implemented for trafficking victims in the United States who cooperate with officials. The \"T\" visa allows trafficking victims in the US to stay if they cooperate with law enforcement. After three years, they can apply for permanent residency. President George W. Bush established a Task Force to combat trafficking. The Interagency Task Force, established by President George W. Bush, aims to strengthen coordination among key agencies to protect trafficking victims, punish traffickers, and prevent future trafficking. The State Department's G-TIP assists in implementing initiatives. Congress amended the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act to provide support for local NGOs operating hotlines and shelters, and regional networks on trafficking. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003 authorized support for NGOs providing services to trafficked individuals, education for women and girls, safe integration into communities, and assistance for families of victims. It also increased appropriations for FY2003. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003 (P.L. 108-193) increased funding for anti-trafficking programs in FY2004 and FY2005, refined minimum standards for governments to meet, and created a \"special watch list\" for countries needing scrutiny. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Protection Act of 2004 established a Human Smuggling and Trafficking Center to combat terrorist travel, migrant smuggling, and human trafficking. The Act required the Center to serve as a clearinghouse for Federal agency information. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2005 was introduced to combat human trafficking and provide assistance to victims, including legal counsel and access to programs. It also addressed the needs of child victims and Americans trafficked within the United States. The Act aimed to close loopholes in previous legislation and increase U.S. assistance to foreign trafficking victims. The Implementing the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act of 2007 aimed to extend U.S. criminal jurisdiction over government personnel involved in trafficking abroad. It directed the Secretary of Homeland Security to strengthen the HSTC with specified funding and staff requirements. The William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 mandates the hiring of 40 full-time staff for the HSTC from specified agencies and departments. It also directs the Secretary of DHS to provide administrative support and funding for the HSTC. The William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 establishes an integrated database for U.S. government departments to collect data on TIP and creates a presidential award for combating TIP. It also increases technical assistance to foreign governments to address forced labor, registers vulnerable populations, and protects migrant workers. Specific actions are required against Tier 2 Watch-List countries, and the TIP report must be translated into various languages. The act prohibits military assistance to governments that recruit child soldiers. The Preventing Trafficking to the United States TVPRA 2008 requires pamphlets on employee rights to be given to nonimmigrant visa applicants, with consular officers ensuring understanding of legal rights. The act also aims to protect A-3 and G-5 visa holders by denying visas to those working at diplomatic missions where trafficking or exploitation has occurred. P.L. 110-457 amends T visa requirements for trafficking victims, allowing eligibility if unable to assist due to trauma. It also considers extreme hardship and the country's ability to address security and health needs. Additionally, eligibility is extended to those aiding in prosecution after entry to the US. The TVPRA 2008 broadens requirements for trafficking victims to receive continued presence in the US, allows waiver of good moral character requirement for T to LPR status adjustment, provides stay of removal for aliens with pending T applications, grants public benefits eligibility for T visa holders, and requires prompt determination of assistance eligibility for child trafficking victims. The TVPRA 2008 includes provisions to enhance protections for child victims of trafficking, such as agreements with contiguous countries for the return of unaccompanied minors, screening procedures for suspected trafficking victims, and providing legal counsel and child advocates. It also creates new grant programs for U.S. citizen victims of trafficking and authorizes appropriations for these programs. Additionally, the act requires a report to Congress on any gaps in services provided to U.S. trafficking victims.

It also increases federal monitoring and investigation by inspectors general agencies and expands criminal penalties for fraud in foreign labor contracting. Anti-trafficking activities in the U.S. are primarily authorized by the TVPA, with funding allocated to various departments and agencies for domestic and international programs. The TVPA authorizes funding for trafficking programs and operations, with appropriations tracked by the Office of Management and Budget. Funding for TVPA programs comes from appropriations to various U.S. departments and agencies. Between FY2001 and FY2011, U.S. agencies have obligated an estimated $853.5 million for domestic and international anti-trafficking assistance programs.
