    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National MS and Parkinson's Disease Registries Act\". The Act, known as the \"National MS and Parkinson's Disease Registries Act,\" highlights the findings related to multiple sclerosis (MS) and Parkinson's disease. MS is a progressive disease affecting the brain and spinal cord, while Parkinson's is a chronic neurological disease involving dopamine-producing brain cell degeneration. Both diseases have significant impacts on individuals in the United States. Parkinson's disease and MS affect over 1,000,000 Americans with 60,000 new cases yearly. The causes and cures for these diseases are not well understood. Studies suggest genetic and environmental factors play a role. Better data is needed to understand the economic impact. Several drugs are approved by the FDA. Currently, FDA-approved drugs for MS show modest success in reducing relapses and slowing disability progression. Parkinson's disease treatment relies on a 40-year-old therapy that only addresses some motor symptoms. Deep brain stimulation surgery can help certain Parkinson's patients with symptom management, but there are no therapies to halt disease progression. Effective, lasting therapy for all Parkinson's features is lacking. MS, Parkinson's disease, and other neurological diseases have the slowest drug development pipeline, taking around 15 years for new therapies to reach the market. Multiple small registries and databases exist globally, but a national system to collect data on these diseases in the US is lacking. The ATSDR has initiated pilot studies since 2006 to explore creating a national MS surveillance system. The national surveillance system methodology from MS pilot studies should be expanded for Parkinson's disease. Separate national surveillance systems for Parkinson's disease and MS will help identify incidence, collect demographic data, and produce epidemiologically sound data for comparison with other information. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of collecting environmental exposure data, understanding disease causes, and promoting research into genetic and environmental risk factors for MS and Parkinson's disease. It aims to enhance biomedical research, develop better diagnosis biomarkers, and find treatments and a cure for these diseases. SEC. 3. SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS. Part P of title III of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include surveillance of neurological diseases. The Secretary will develop a national surveillance system for collecting data on Multiple Sclerosis (MS), including information on disease incidence and prevalence in the United States. The registry established aims to gather data on Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in the United States, including incidence and prevalence. It also assists in developing a national surveillance system for Parkinson's disease and other neurological disorders. The Secretary will develop a system to collect data on Parkinson's disease, including information on individuals diagnosed with the disease and other relevant details recommended by the Advisory Committee. The purpose of establishing a national surveillance system for Parkinson's disease in the United States is to collect and store data on the incidence and prevalence of the disease, create a population-based registry of cases, and analyze the potential expansion of national disease surveillance systems for other neurological diseases. The Advisory Committee on Neurological Disease Registries will focus on Parkinson's disease data in the United States, including demographics and family history of patients, as well as other relevant recommendations. The Advisory Committee, appointed by the Secretary, will include representatives from national health associations focusing on MS and Parkinson's disease, as well as the National Institutes of Health. The Advisory Committee, appointed by the Secretary, will include representatives from national health associations focusing on MS and Parkinson's disease, as well as the National Institutes of Health, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense, Food and Drug Administration, and Centers for Disease Control. The Advisory Committee appointed by the Secretary will include representatives from national health associations focusing on MS and Parkinson's disease, as well as experts in various fields such as clinicians, research scientists, epidemiologists, geneticists, statisticians, and bioethicists. The Advisory Committee includes representatives from national health associations, clinicians, research scientists, epidemiologists, geneticists, statisticians, bioethicists, attorneys, and other relevant individuals or organizations interested in developing and maintaining national surveillance systems for MS and Parkinson's disease. Their duties involve reviewing information and making recommendations to the Secretary on the development and coordination of these surveillance systems. The curr_chunk discusses the use of existing databases for collecting information on neurological diseases, specifying the type of data to be stored, how it is collected, guidelines for data use, and applying registry methodologies for MS and Parkinson's disease to other neurological disorders. The Advisory Committee will submit a report to Congress within a year of establishment, containing recommendations on surveillance systems. The Secretary may award grants for data collection on MS and Parkinson's disease, regardless of Advisory Committee recommendations. Coordination with state, local, and federal registries is emphasized. The Secretary will establish national surveillance systems for MS and Parkinson's disease, building upon existing data systems and coordinating with federal health and environmental infrastructure. This includes pilot studies initiated in 2006 by CDC and ATSDR for MS surveillance and Parkinson's disease. The Secretary will establish national surveillance systems for Parkinson's disease and MS by utilizing existing databases such as those from the Department of Veterans Affairs, Nebraska, California, New York State, and NARCOMS. Additionally, any other relevant databases recommended by the Advisory Committee will be included. The Secretary will establish national surveillance systems for Parkinson's disease and MS by utilizing existing databases recommended by the Advisory Committee. Coordination with other federal agencies will ensure information obtained is made available while protecting personal privacy. The information obtained under subsections (a) and (b) is shared with agencies like the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Department of Defense. The term 'national voluntary health association' refers to a national nonprofit organization with chapters across the United States. $5,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2010 to 2014 for this section."
