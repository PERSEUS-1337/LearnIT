    "title": "SB 358",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. In 2014, the gender wage gap in California was 16 cents on the dollar, with women earning 84 cents for every dollar a man earned. This gap is prevalent across all occupations in the state and is even wider for women of color, with Latina women earning only 44 cents for every dollar a white male makes. The gender wage gap in California is slightly lower than the national average, but still has a significant impact on women's economic security. Women in California lose approximately $33.6 billion each year due to the wage gap, leading to a higher poverty rate among women compared to men. Women of color and single mothers are disproportionately affected by this disparity. California has prohibited gender-based wage discrimination since 1949, but the state provisions are rarely utilized due to difficulty in establishing successful claims. Pay secrecy also contributes to the gender wage gap, as women may not challenge discrimination they are unaware of. Despite laws against wage disclosure bans and retaliation, many employees are uninformed or fear repercussions for exercising their rights. To address the gender wage gap in California, improvements to the state's equal pay provisions and wage disclosure laws are necessary. An employer is prohibited from paying employees of the opposite sex less for similar work, unless justified by factors like seniority or merit systems. The California equal pay provisions prohibit paying employees of the opposite sex less for similar work, unless justified by factors like seniority, merit systems, or a bona fide factor other than sex. This factor must be job-related, consistent with business necessity, and not based on a sex-based differential in compensation. The defense does not apply if an alternative business practice could achieve the same purpose without a wage differential. The California equal pay provisions prohibit paying employees of the opposite sex less for similar work, unless justified by factors like seniority, merit systems, or a bona fide factor other than sex. The one or more factors relied upon must account for the entire wage differential. Employers who violate these provisions are liable to affected employees for the deprived wages, interest, and liquidated damages. The Division of Labor Standards Enforcement administers and enforces this section, supervising payment of wages found to be due. Acceptance of approved payment constitutes a waiver of the employee's cause of action. Every employer must maintain records of wages, job classifications, and terms of employment for employees, to be kept on file for three years. Employees can file complaints with the division if they believe they are not receiving proper wages or if the employer is violating labor laws. The division will investigate the complaint confidentially and take necessary actions to ensure unpaid wages are paid. The department or division can file a civil action on behalf of employees to recover unpaid wages and damages, with the employee's consent waiving their cause of action unless the suit is dismissed within 180 days. Any employee who is underpaid can recover the balance of wages, interest, liquidated damages, and attorney's fees in a civil action, regardless of any agreement to work for less. The time limit to file a civil action for unpaid wages is two years, or three years for willful violations. If an employee recovers amounts due under subdivision (b) and files a complaint or brings an action under federal law, they must return the lesser amount recovered. Employers are prohibited from retaliating against employees for enforcing this section or discussing wages. Any employee who faces adverse actions for engaging in conduct outlined in this section can seek reinstatement, lost wages, benefits, and equitable relief through a civil action within one year of the incident. The act does not require reimbursement as it pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions, as defined by the Government Code and California Constitution."
