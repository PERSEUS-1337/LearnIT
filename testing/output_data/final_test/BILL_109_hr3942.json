    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Professional Sports Responsibility Act of 2005\". Congress has created legal benefits for professional sports leagues, including antitrust exemptions, labor exemptions for collective bargaining, special visas for foreign athletes, and tax benefits. These benefits are not guaranteed and can be revoked by Congress. The illegal use of anabolic steroids, performance enhancing substances, and Schedule I controlled substances by professional athletes poses a significant public health and safety concern for both players and the general public. Athletes using these products to gain a competitive edge may influence amateur athletes to do the same, leading to increased use among children and teenagers. Experts estimate that over 500,000 teenagers have used performance-enhancing substances, which can have serious consequences. The detrimental health effects of using performance-enhancing substances include stunted growth, scarring acne, hair loss, hormonal and metabolic imbalances, liver damage, a higher risk of heart attack and stroke, mood swings, and violent tendencies. The tolerance of professional athletes using these substances sends the wrong message to youth. Leagues must adopt strong policies to eliminate their use to maintain public trust. As of the date of enactment of this Act, Congress is not satisfied with the testing and penalty policies of professional sports leagues regarding the illegal use of performance-enhancing substances. Minimum standards and penalties should be established to address this issue. The list of these substances must be regularly monitored and updated by the Department of Justice. The Department of Justice is responsible for establishing, monitoring, and updating standards for testing and penalties related to illegal use of performance-enhancing and controlled substances. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions include terms like \"accreditation body\" for auditing professional leagues, \"major professional league\" referring to specific sports organizations, \"off-season\" as the period outside of play season, \"professional athlete\" for players in major leagues, and \"season of play.\" The term \"season of play\" in a major professional league refers to the period from when athletes report to their teams to prepare for play until the end of the regular season, including post-season play for active teams. Standards for testing for performance-enhancing and other controlled substances are outlined in Section 4. The Attorney General must issue rules within 180 days of the Act's enactment for testing professional athletes in major leagues for steroids, performance-enhancing substances, and Schedule I substances. Rules will specify the frequency of testing, random intervals, and prohibited substances to be tested. Professional athletes must be tested using an independent method to ensure fairness. Exemptions are allowed for substances with medical use, but penalties are in place for those who test positive for prohibited substances. The Attorney General has the authority to modify and update standards for testing professional athletes for prohibited substances, including penalties for refusal or failure to submit to a test, an appeals process, and procedures for publicly disclosing positive test results. Any modifications to the standards will take effect on January 1 of the following year. SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF INDEPENDENT ACCREDITATION BODY AND CERTIFICATION. The Attorney General authorizes a nonprofit organization as an accreditation body for certifying major professional leagues. The accreditation body audits testing protocols, inspects athlete testing, and certifies leagues that enforce policies for testing illegal performance-enhancing substances. The Attorney General authorizes a nonprofit organization to certify major professional leagues for testing illegal performance-enhancing substances. Leagues must submit an application describing their testing protocols to be certified. The curr_chunk discusses the required information for reporting on prohibited substances testing in professional sports, including the number of athletes tested, testing methodologies, qualifications of lab personnel, and adjudication policies. The certification of a major professional league may be suspended or revoked if the accreditation body finds non-compliance with standards set by the Attorney General. Inspections, record availability, and reporting to the accreditation body are required for compliance. The accreditation body may suspend or revoke certification of a major professional league if there is misrepresentation, failure to comply with standards, refusal to provide necessary information, or refusal to allow inspections. Reporting to Congress is required if certification is not received. If a major professional league fails to receive certification or has its certification revoked or suspended, a report must be submitted to Congress detailing the reasons for the league's status. SEC. 6. CIVIL PENALTIES. The Attorney General may fine major professional leagues for noncompliance with testing policies, up to $5,000,000 with daily increases possible. Fines can be reduced if deemed burdensome. SEC. 7. FURTHER CONGRESSIONAL ACTION. SEC. 7. FURTHER CONGRESSIONAL ACTION. The Attorney General must report to Congress on major professional leagues not following anti-doping rules and recommend actions. Congress should review and potentially legislate against leagues not complying. SEC. 8. INCREASED PENALTIES FOR ANABOLIC STEROID OFFENSES NEAR SPORTS FACILITIES OR INVOLVING ATHLETES. Increased penalties for anabolic steroid offenses near sports facilities or involving athletes are added to Part D of the Controlled Substances Act. Increased penalties for anabolic steroid offenses near sports facilities or involving athletes include doubling the maximum term of imprisonment, fine, and supervised release for violations of manufacturing, distributing, or possessing anabolic steroids in proximity to a sports facility or providing them to professional, college, or high school athletes. The term \"sports facility\" refers to property where athletic sports or training occurs, privately owned for commercial use or publicly owned within 1000 feet of such activities. The term 'near or at' means within 1000 feet of; 'college or high school athlete' refers to a student at a higher education institution or secondary school; 'athlete' is someone participating in athletic activities organized by various associations; 'athletic activity' involves officially designated coaches. The text chunk discusses the criteria for an organization to be considered as conducting athletic activities, including having designated coaches, supervised practices, and established competitive schedules. Additionally, it defines 'possessing with intent to distribute' near sports facilities. SEC. 9. STUDIES AND REPORTS. The Attorney General must report on the effectiveness of regulations related to professional sports associations every 2 years. Additionally, the Comptroller General will conduct a study on the illegal use of performance-enhancing substances by college athletes, focusing on testing procedures and policies. The Comptroller General will transmit a report assessing testing policies for detecting illegal substance use in college athletics to Congress within a year of this Act's enactment. Recommendations for expanding regulations to intercollegiate and interscholastic athletic associations will be included. The Attorney General has the authority to add professional sports leagues or NCAA Division I or II entities as major leagues to prevent the use of performance-enhancing substances by athletes at all levels."
