    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Hepatitis C Epidemic Control and Prevention Act of 2007\". Congress finds that approximately 5,000,000 Americans are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), with over 3,000,000 chronically infected. The CDC recognizes HCV as the most common chronic blood-borne virus in the nation, affecting nearly 2 percent of the US population. Around 30,000 Americans are newly infected with HCV each year, with numbers increasing since 2001. HCV infection is the leading cause of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, liver cancer, and liver transplants in the US. The majority of individuals infected with HCV are unaware of their infection, serving as a source of transmission to others. Methamphetamine abuse is linked to HCV, and there may be connections between HCV and diseases like type 2 diabetes, lymphoma, thyroid disorders, and autoimmune disease. The CDC developed Recommendations for Prevention and Control of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Infection and HCV-Related Chronic Disease in 1998 to combat the HCV epidemic in the United States. Treatments can eradicate the disease in approximately 50 percent of those treated, and behavioral changes can slow disease progression. The costs of direct medical expenses for HCV are estimated to be over $1 billion annually in the United States. The Department of Veterans Affairs is a leader in HCV screening, testing, and treatment, with a policy to screen all veterans for HCV risk factors since 1998. Over 98 percent of VA patients were tested in fiscal year 2004. The VA has a comprehensive program for HCV screening, testing, and treatment, with over 98 percent of patients screened in fiscal year 2004. They offer medications, education programs, and have Hepatitis C Resource Centers. Federal support is needed to increase knowledge and awareness of HCV. Title III of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new section on the federal plan for the prevention, control, and medical management of Hepatitis C. The Secretary is required to develop a plan for the prevention, control, and medical management of Hepatitis C, including education, training, surveillance, early detection, and research. The plan must consider recommendations from the CDC and NIH, as well as consult with their directors. The Secretary is required to develop a plan for the prevention, control, and medical management of Hepatitis C, consulting with various stakeholders including the Director of the National Institutes of Health, the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, other federal agencies, medical advisory bodies, and the public. A biennial assessment of the plan will be conducted by the Secretary. The Secretary conducts biennial assessments of the plan for Hepatitis C prevention and management, incorporating new knowledge and addressing gaps in coverage or effectiveness. Results are published in the Federal Register every even-numbered year. The Secretary conducts biennial assessments of the plan for Hepatitis C prevention and management, with details on revisions made, explanations for changes, and reasons for no revisions if applicable. The Federal Plan for the Prevention, Control, and Medical Management of Hepatitis C is outlined in SEC. 399JJ. The Secretary conducts biennial assessments of the plan, detailing revisions and reasons for changes. The Secretary, through the Director of the CDC, implements programs to increase awareness and knowledge of HCV. This includes health education, public awareness campaigns, community outreach, training of healthcare professionals on prevention, detection, and management of HBV and HCV, and importance of vaccinating HCV-infected individuals and those at risk. The Secretary, through the Director of the CDC, implements programs to increase awareness and knowledge of HCV, including early detection, surveillance, and distribution of curricula for individuals providing hepatitis counseling. The Secretary supports the development of voluntary HCV testing programs at the state, local, and tribal levels to identify infected individuals early. Test results are considered protected health information. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 prohibits the use of protected health information for issues related to health insurance, employment screening, or employment termination. The Secretary supports counseling programs for viral hepatitis in various healthcare settings. The Secretary supports counseling programs for viral hepatitis, including providing education and counseling to individuals at risk for HCV infection to change risky behaviors and reduce harm. Vaccination against hepatitis A virus, HBV, and other viruses is also provided for individuals infected or at risk for HCV infection. The Secretary supports medical referral for individuals infected or at risk for HCV, including drug or alcohol abuse treatment and medical evaluation for antiviral suitability. The Secretary supports medical referral for individuals infected or at risk for HCV, including drug or alcohol abuse treatment, evaluation for antiviral treatment suitability, ongoing medical management, and coordination with a Hepatitis C Coordinator provided by the CDC to enhance HCV prevention and control activities at the state level. Surveillance databases are promoted to identify risk factors for HCV infection. Surveillance databases are used to identify risk factors, trends in HCV incidence and prevalence among high-risk groups, and to assess and improve HCV infection prevention programs. Information in the databases must be de-identified for confidentiality. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 mandates the establishment of a Research Network to conduct epidemiologic research on HCV prevention, support a Hepatitis C Clinical Research Network for treatment research, and conduct basic research on prevention and treatment approaches. Additionally, the Secretary is required to support programs for referral of HCV-positive individuals for medical evaluation and management, including antiviral therapy when appropriate. The Secretary is mandated to provide expanded support for underserved populations affected by HCV, develop benchmarks for program evaluation, and determine their effectiveness. The Secretary is authorized to award grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements to entities with expertise in HCV for activities under this part. To be eligible, entities must submit an application as required by the Secretary. Additionally, $90,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2008, and $72,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2009 to 2012 for this purpose."
