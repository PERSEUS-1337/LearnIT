The allocation of small agri-biodiesel credit to patrons of cooperative organizations is also addressed. The organization may elect to apportion the credit among patrons based on business done with them. The election is irrevocable once made on a timely filed return. Any unapportioned credit is included in the organization's total. The organization can choose to distribute the credit among patrons based on business transactions. The apportioned credit for patrons is included in their first taxable year ending after the payment period or after receiving notice from the cooperative. The organization can distribute the credit among patrons based on business transactions. If the credit amount is less than shown on the return, the excess is treated as an increase in tax on the organization. The organization can distribute the credit among patrons based on business transactions. Excess credit is treated as an increase in tax, not for determining credits or under section 55. Amendments include changes to small Agri-Biodiesel credits and producer credits. The biodiesel mixture credit and biodiesel credit for taxpayers are determined under specific sections. Conforming amendments are made to small Agri-Biodiesel producer credits in the tax code. The amendments impose a tax on individuals who do not use agri-biodiesel for specified purposes, at a rate of 10 cents per gallon. These changes apply to taxable years starting after the enactment of the Act. The Small Ethanol Producer Credit and Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer Credit are being improved by increasing the threshold for small ethanol producers from 30,000,000 to 60,000,000 gallons. Additionally, the Small Ethanol Producer Credit is clarified as not being a passive activity credit and not added back to income under Section 87 of the Internal Revenue Code. The amendment to Section 87 of the Internal Revenue Code includes the alcohol fuel credit, biodiesel fuels credit, and their effective date for taxable years after the enactment of the Act."
