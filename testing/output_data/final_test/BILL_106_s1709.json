    "content": "The Act is titled \"State Criminal Alien Assistance Program II and Local Medical Emergency Reimbursement Act\". It includes the \"State Criminal Alien Assistance Program II Act of 1999\" and outlines findings and purposes. Congress finds that federal policies along the southwest border impact illegal immigration, states and local governments were partially reimbursed for incarcerating criminal aliens in fiscal year 1996, with an increase in jurisdictions applying for reimbursement in subsequent years. The University of Arizona study in January 1998 found that counties on Arizona's border with Mexico, such as Santa Cruz and Cochise, bear a disproportionate burden from criminal illegal aliens. For example, Santa Cruz County had 12.7% of the border population but accounted for 50% of alien crossings and 32.5% of illegal alien apprehensions in 1998. Santa Cruz County spent $1.9 million out of its $5 million criminal justice budget in fiscal year 1998 on dealing with this issue. In Santa Cruz County, $1.9 million was spent to process criminal illegal aliens, with over half not reimbursed by Federal monies. Despite appeals to Federal and State officials, relief from this burden has not been obtained. Border counties in Texas bore unreimbursed costs for apprehension, prosecution, and other services for criminal aliens serving time in county jails. Nonborder counties in Texas also faced similar unreimbursed costs for criminal aliens in county jails. The State of Texas incurred substantial unreimbursed costs for law enforcement efforts due to criminal illegal aliens. The Federal Government should reimburse States for the related costs of imprisoning illegal aliens. The purpose of this title is to provide financial assistance to States and local communities for expenditures related to illegal juvenile aliens and to ensure equitable treatment for affected States.
