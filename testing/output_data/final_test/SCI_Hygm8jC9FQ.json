The focus is on obtaining interpretable and transferable representations from sequential data like video, speech, and stock price data, which consist of dynamic and static factors. Previous works have successfully disentangled static and dynamic factors by modeling the priors of latent variables, but struggle to disentangle representations between dynamic factors. The paper introduces a new model, FAVAE, that can disentangle multiple dynamic factors without requiring modeling priors. It aims to extract disentangled dynamic factors in representation learning, which is crucial in machine learning. Generative models like VAE and GAN can learn low-dimensional manifold representations as latent variables, representing fundamental components in images such as position, color, and facial expressions. In representation learning, disentangled representation involves single latent variables representing specific factors like position, color, and facial expressions in images. Shifting one latent variable while keeping others fixed demonstrates latent traversals. Disentangled representation offers interpretability and robustness against adversarial attacks. The focus is on learning disentangled representation from sequential data, distinguishing between dynamic and static factors. The concept of disentangled representation learning for sequential data involves extracting dynamic factors that cannot be captured by models for non-sequential data. For example, a model for sequential data can extract the trajectory shape of a submarine's movement, while a model for non-sequential data only extracts x and y positions. This difference is illustrated in Fig. 1, showing how FAVAE differs from \u03b2-VAE in considering sequences of data points. FAVAE considers sequential data points, such as trajectories of a submarine, while \u03b2-VAE only considers non-sequential data points. FAVAE learns factors controlling the trajectory, while \u03b2-VAE learns only coordinates. Disentangled representation learning can be applied to speech, video, and stock market data to extract fundamental trends. Extracting dynamic factors from stock price data can help generate macro-actions in reinforcement learning. Recent work has focused on separating dynamic and static factors in sequential data using factorized hierarchical variational autoencoders (FHVAE) and VAE architectures. This disentangled representation learning opens up new research opportunities. The FHVAE and VAE models aim to disentangle dynamic and static factors in sequential data. However, they struggle with variables sharing the same time dependencies. To address this, an information bottleneck principle is applied to separate multiple dynamic factors in sequential data. This approach enables the compression of information while maintaining data reconstruction, facilitating the learning of disentangled representations. The factorized action variational autoencoder (FAVAE) was created to learn a disentangled representation of sequential data by implementing information capacity and a ladder network. It can separate dependency factors occurring simultaneously and into dynamic and static factors. The \u03b2-VAE is a commonly used method for learning disentangled representations based on the VAE framework. The VAE maximizes the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of log p (x) where z is a latent variable, D KL is the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and q (z|x) is an approximated distribution of p (z|x). The ELBO consists of a reconstruction term and a regularization term. \u03b2-VAE, with \u03b2 > 1, promotes disentangled representation learning through the Kullback-Leibler divergence term. The regularization term in \u03b2-VAE promotes disentangled representation learning by reducing the total correlation among latent variables, leading to a closer approximation to the independent standard normal distribution. The shift C scheme in \u03b2-VAE aims to balance disentanglement and reconstruction by linearly increasing the information capacity during training. This approach is derived from the information bottleneck theory and alters the objective function of \u03b2-VAE. The FAVAE model utilizes the information bottleneck principle to learn disentangled representations from sequential data without supervision. The objective function of the FAVAE model involves a latent variable model and a variational recurrent neural network. The FAVAE model extends the VAE model to a recurrent framework with time-dependent priors, improving the ELBO. It focuses on disentangled representation learning rather than density estimation, following the information bottleneck principle. The model aims to make the representation of latent variables compact while reconstructing sequential data. The FAVAE model extends the VAE to a recurrent framework with time-dependent priors for disentangled representation learning. It focuses on compact latent variable representation while reconstructing sequential data using a hierarchical scheme within a ladder network. The proposed model, FAVAE, utilizes a ladder network with different levels of convolution networks to disentangle representations at various levels of abstraction in sequential data. This hierarchical structure contrasts with mainstream neural network models like LSTM, GRU, and QRNN designed for sequential data processing. The FAVAE model incorporates a hierarchical structure with time convolution similar to VAE and a loss function akin to \u03b2-VAE. It utilizes batch normalization and ReLU activation functions, with 1d convolutional neural networks using specific parameters. Latent traversals assess disentanglement success, but quantification is necessary. Various methods for quantifying disentanglement have been reported, but there is no standard method. The mutual information gap (MIG) is used as a metric for disentanglement, measuring the mutual information between latent variables and ground truth factors. Our model evaluates disentanglement using MIG, while other models graphically disentangle factors in sequential data. Our model performs disentanglement using a loss function. The advantage of graphical models is their ability to control interpretable factors through priors and time dependency. However, these models struggle to disentangle dynamic factors. In contrast, a loss function model can disentangle sets of dynamic factors and static factors. Experimental evaluation was done on three datasets using a batch size of 128 and the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 10^-3. A bi-dimensional space reaching dataset was used to compare FAVAE and \u03b2-VAE, with ten possible trajectories to each goal with varying degrees of curvature. The trajectories in the study had varying degrees of curvature, with 20 factor combinations and a trajectory length of 1000. The comparison was made between \u03b2-VAE and FAVAE on the 2D Reaching dataset, showing that FAVAE can effectively encode disentangled representations for generating feasible trajectories. The study confirmed the effect of disentanglement through an information bottleneck by evaluating the model under more complex factors. The study evaluated the validity of a model on the 2D Reaching dataset by adding more factors to generate data. The modified dataset had five factors, with four affecting only part of the trajectory. Various models were compared based on MIG, showing that FAVAE with the ladder network and information capacity C had the highest MIG score. FAVAE with ladder network and information capacity C had the highest MIG scores for 2D Reaching and 2D Wavy Reaching, indicating the model learned a disentangled representation well. The use of C improved MIG scores with higher \u03b2 values, suppressing reconstruction loss. Latent traversal results for 2D Wavy Reaching are visualized in FIG2, showing learned generation factors from latent variables. The use of a ladder network in the FAVAE model improved disentangled representation learning and minimized reconstruction loss. Testing the model with \u03b2 = 300 showed that using all three ladders resulted in the highest MIG score, except for \"Higher Ladder One\" which had a large reconstruction error. The model was also trained with the Sprites dataset to evaluate its effectiveness, consisting of static and dynamic factors in RGB video data. The FAVAE model utilizes a ladder network to enhance disentangled representation learning and reduce reconstruction loss. Testing with different parameters showed that using all three ladders resulted in the highest MIG score. The model was trained on the Sprites dataset, which includes static and dynamic factors in RGB video data. The dataset consists of discrete factors, and latent traversal results in extracting various expressions and colors related to the characters' motion and appearance. The FAVAE model uses a ladder network to improve disentangled representation learning and reduce reconstruction loss. It aims to extract interpretable representations from sequential data through an information bottleneck. Future work includes extending the model to sequence-to-sequence models and applying it to reinforcement learning actions. The FAVAE model utilizes a ladder network to enhance disentangled representation learning from sequential data by maximizing mutual information while constraining empirical data distribution. Monte Carlo approximation is used for optimization, with x i sampled from mini-batch data for reconstruction and regularization terms. The ladder network in the FAVAE model aims to disentangle representations at different abstraction levels. Factors extracted in each ladder are checked using 2D Reaching and 2D Wavy datasets. The most frequently extracted latent variables are shown in TAB1, with the 3rd ladder having the least frequent factors. Long-term and short-term factors are clear in the 2D Wavy Reaching dataset. In the 2D Wavy Reaching dataset, factors of long and short time dependency are distinct. The \"goal position\" affects the entire trajectory, while other factors affect half the trajectory. Factor 1 represents goal positions, while others represent trajectory shapes. The FHVAE model uses label information for disentanglement, unlike our FAVAE model. Comparisons with FHVAE show differences in MIG and reconstruction. The comparison between MIG and reconstruction using FHVAE as the baseline showed limitations in disentangling in 2D Reaching and 2D Wavy tasks due to LSTM constraints. Experimentation with different sequence lengths revealed that FHVAE performed best in 2D Reaching, while FAVAE with ladders and C performed best in 2D Wavy Reaching. Evaluation for robotic tasks was done in a simulated environment with an end-effector, balls, and baskets in a bi-dimensional space. The end-effector in a bi-dimensional space places balls into baskets based on color. Factors like movement habits affect the process, with different lengths per datum. Input is gripper position data, not images. FAVAE learned disentangled factors of the Gripper. FAVAE learned disentangled factors of the Gripper dataset, showing visualized latent traversals determining factors like initial ball position, target ball, movement plan, and placement plan. The model can learn generative factors for robotic tasks with varying data lengths. Sprits dataset was used to confirm disentangled representation between static and dynamic factors in a video game setting. The dataset consists of sequences with T = 8 frames of dimension 3 \u00d7 64 \u00d7 64, representing factors and motion of Sprites. The end-effector is implemented for the picking task, using a 12-dimensional Gripper dataset. Eight factors are represented, including color of ball, initial ball locations, and movement plans. The end effector is used to move to the ball and pick it up by following a specific plan."
