    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Sierra Leone Peace Support Act of 2000\". The Congress finds and expresses its sense. The Congress finds that the civil war in Sierra Leone has led to a humanitarian crisis with over 50,000 dead and 1,000,000 displaced. The Revolutionary United Front (RUF) and the former Sierra Leonean army (AFRC) are primarily responsible for atrocities including abduction, rape, mutilation, and child soldier recruitment. The RUF still holds many prisoners, including child soldiers. The RUF leadership at Lome agreed to release all children, but thousands of prisoners, including child soldiers, are still held. Civil defense forces and ECOMOG forces committed human rights violations, while neighboring countries aided and armed the RUF. International humanitarian efforts in Sierra Leone have fallen short, leading to poor conditions in refugee camps. The refugee camps and displaced persons camps in Sierra Leone are facing deplorable conditions with inadequate food and medicine. The population on the Sierra Leonean border is being targeted by RUF insurgents, leading to rape, mutilation, and killings. Demobilization, demilitarization, and reintegration efforts are delayed, and there are plans to deploy 11,000 peacekeeping forces. Approximately 45,000 combatants, including child soldiers, need to be demobilized and reintegrated into society. The Government of Sierra Leone and the RUF/AFRC agreed to uphold human rights in the Lome Convention of July 7, 1999. The Congress urges increased assistance for demobilization, demilitarization, and reintegration efforts in Sierra Leone.

Authorization of $5,000,000 for judicial assistance and $13,000,000 for demobilization, demilitarization, and reintegration assistance in Sierra Leone.

Additional requirements for appropriated amounts under the authorization of appropriations include remaining available until expended. SEC. 5. ACCOUNTABILITY. The Congress calls for a nonpartisan initiative to collect information on human rights abuses in Sierra Leone to vet abusers from the armed forces and police and deter future abuses. They urge the administration to support independent data collection for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and international accountability efforts.
