    "content": "The Act titled \"Thorium Energy Independence and Security Act of 2008\" is cited as the short title. Congress acknowledges the increasing global energy demand over the next 20 years and recognizes nuclear power as a low greenhouse gas emission energy source. Concerns about nuclear proliferation and spent fuel disposal have hindered nuclear power development. Advanced thorium fuel cycle in nuclear plants could reduce weapons-useable materials compared to uranium-fueled plants. Thorium fuel cycle technology is more abundant and produces less long-term waste than uranium-fueled plants. The United States has significant domestic quantities of thorium for energy independence. Research on thorium fuel cycle technology is ongoing in the US. It is in the national interest to provide access to advanced thorium fuel cycle technology to foreign countries seeking to establish nuclear power. Access to advanced thorium fuel cycle technology and incentives to reduce nuclear proliferation are important factors in promoting the use of nuclear power. SEC. 251. THORIUM FUEL CYCLE NUCLEAR POWER GENERATION is added to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to promote the use of nuclear power. The section defines key terms related to thorium fuel cycle nuclear power generation, including Chairman, Office, and Secretary. It mandates the establishment of offices for regulating thorium fuel cycle nuclear power generation by the Secretary of Energy in consultation with the Chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The regulations for these offices must be in place by December 31, 2012. Regulations for thorium fuel cycle nuclear power generation must be promulgated by the Chairman and heads of the Offices by December 31, 2012. Demonstration projects will be carried out at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory. Recommendations on international partnerships for nuclear nonproliferation through thorium fuel cycle nuclear power generation will be provided to the Secretary. The Thorium Energy Independence and Security Act of 2008 aims to promote the deployment of thorium fuel cycle nuclear power generation and provide incentives for using proliferation-resistant, low-waste thorium fuels. The Secretary is required to submit an annual report to Congress on the progress of implementing the act. $250,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2009 through 2013 to carry out the provisions of the act."
