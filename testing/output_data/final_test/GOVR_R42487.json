The caucus quickly grew to 166 members by 1983, making it one of the largest on Capitol Hill. Richmond served as the first chairman, with Jim Jeffords as the first vice-chairman. In 1981, Richmond proposed a program for high school students to showcase their artistic creativity nationwide. In 1981, Speaker O'Neill supported a program for high school students to display art in the Capitol tunnels at no cost to the government. The Arts Caucus had to work with the House Office Building Commission and the Architect of the Capitol for approval. A detailed proposal for the artwork display was requested. In 1982, the AOC submitted the National Art Competition program proposal to the House Office Building Commission. In 1982, Speaker O'Neill and the Arts Caucus announced the first annual Congressional Art Competition for high school students. The winning art would be displayed in the Capitol. No legislation has been introduced to make the competition permanent. The Congressional Art Competition was established in 1982 by Speaker O'Neill and the Arts Caucus. In 1991, a resolution was passed to recognize the 10th anniversary of the competition. Another resolution in 2010 celebrated the 29th anniversary but did not progress further. Some artworks have been removed due to controversy. In 2012, a Chicago high school student's entry caused a controversy before being selected as the district winner. Days before printing 1.2 million new city vehicle stickers, allegations surfaced that the design displayed gang signs. The city decided not to use the artwork, which later won the IL-04 congressional district competition and hung in the Cannon Tunnel for a year. Only one other piece of art had been removed from the Congressional Art Competition before the 2016-2017 event. During the 2016-2017 Congressional Art Competition, two artworks raised suitability concerns - one depicting a young man with bullet holes in his back and another showing marijuana use by Bob Marley. Despite concerns, both works were displayed after Members of Congress supported their display. In December 2016, requests were made to remove the winning entry from Missouri's 1st Congressional District. The artwork from Missouri's 1st Congressional District depicting law enforcement officers as animals abusing protesters was repeatedly removed and re-hung in the Capitol's Cannon Tunnel. An injunction was filed in U.S. District Court, claiming violation of First Amendment rights. The court ruled that Members of Congress had the right to remove the artwork as it was considered government speech. The artwork depicting law enforcement officers as animals abusing protesters was banned from display until May 2017. The House Ethics Manual addresses congressional involvement in the Art Competition, prohibiting the use of private resources for congressional operations. The House Ethics Manual prohibits congressional involvement in the Congressional Art Competition using private resources for operations. Members can support the competition publicly but cannot solicit on its behalf without approval from the Standards Committee. The Congressional Art Competition guidelines state that Members cannot solicit donations without permission from the Committee on Ethics unless the organization is qualified under the Internal Revenue Code. The competition was initially supported by a $300 contribution from caucus members' allowances, used for staff salaries and operational costs. From 1982 to 1994, caucus staff managed administrative duties for the competition. After 1995, administrative tasks for the Congressional Art Competition were handled by the offices of the co-chairs of the Arts Caucus. The AOC curator and House superintendent assisted with moving, arranging, labeling, and hanging artwork, as well as returning it to Members' offices. The curator also organized the winning artwork alphabetically by state, maintained a tracking system, and worked with House carpenters to display the art in the Cannon House Office Building tunnel. In 2005, General Motors asked the Public Governance Institute for logistical support for the Congressional Art Competition. In 2009, the Congressional Institute took over, providing advice and support. Each House Member solicits entries from high school students, with no entry fee. Previous entrants can re-enter as long as they are high school students. The Congressional Art Competition allows high school students to submit artwork, with previous entrants eligible to re-enter.
