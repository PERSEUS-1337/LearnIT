    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Chesapeake Bay Restoration Act of 1997\". Congress finds that the Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure and its productivity and water quality have been diminished by pollution, sedimentation, and other factors. Various government entities have committed to a comprehensive Chesapeake Bay Agreement. The Chesapeake Bay Agreement signatories aim to improve water quality and productivity of living resources in the Bay, serving as a model for estuary management. Federal support is needed to expand monitoring, management, and restoration activities in the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries to meet program goals. The Act's purposes are to strengthen cooperative efforts to restore and protect the Bay and achieve the goals set in the Agreement. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to focus on the Chesapeake Bay. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to focus on the Chesapeake Bay, defining key terms related to the Chesapeake Bay Agreement and Program, the Chesapeake Bay watershed, the Chesapeake Executive Council, and signatory jurisdictions. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to focus on the Chesapeake Bay, defining key terms related to the Chesapeake Bay Agreement and Program, the Chesapeake Bay watershed, the Chesapeake Executive Council, and signatory jurisdictions. The term 'signatory jurisdiction' refers to a jurisdiction of a signatory to the Chesapeake Bay Agreement. The Administrator will continue the Chesapeake Bay Program in cooperation with the Chesapeake Executive Council and maintain a Chesapeake Bay Program Office within the Environmental Protection Agency to support the Council with various activities. The Chesapeake Bay Program involves developing and providing information on environmental quality and resources, assisting in creating action plans, and coordinating efforts with various authorities to develop strategies. The Administrator may enter into interagency agreements with Federal agencies to improve water quality and living resources of the Chesapeake Bay, obtain support from appropriate officials, and implement outreach programs for public education and participation. Additionally, technical assistance and assistance grants may be provided in consultation with the Chesapeake Executive Council. The Administrator can provide technical assistance and grants to various entities to carry out activities related to improving water quality in the Chesapeake Bay. The Federal share of assistance grants will be determined by the Administrator according to EPA guidance. The Administrator can provide technical assistance and grants for activities to improve water quality in the Chesapeake Bay. Assistance grants will cover up to 75% of eligible project costs, with non-federal sources required to cover the remainder. Administrative costs for projects should not exceed 10% of the grant amount. Implementation Grants are provided to signatory jurisdictions committed to implementing the Chesapeake Bay Agreement. The Administrator can grant funds for management mechanisms under the Agreement, based on proposals submitted by the jurisdictions. The Chesapeake Bay Agreement requires jurisdictions to propose management mechanisms to reduce pollution and meet water quality standards. The Administrator can approve proposals that align with the Agreement and national goals, with a federal share not exceeding 50% of implementation costs. An implementation grant under this subsection requires non-Federal sources to cover the majority of costs. Administrative costs for projects should not exceed 10% of the grant. Federal facilities must comply with subwatershed planning and restoration. Federal agencies within the Chesapeake Bay watershed must participate in planning and restoration programs. They must also comply with the Chesapeake Bay Agreement. The Administrator, in consultation with the Chesapeake Executive Council, will implement nutrient and water quality management strategies within a year. The Chesapeake Executive Council ensures signatories implement management plans to achieve nutrient goals, water quality requirements, and toxics reduction in the Chesapeake Bay tributaries. The Chesapeake Executive Council oversees the implementation of management plans to achieve environmental goals in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, including reducing toxic and bioaccumulative impacts on living resources and human health, as well as habitat restoration and protection efforts. The Administrator may provide technical assistance and grants to local governments and organizations for watershed conservation projects. The Chesapeake Bay watershed implements cooperative tributary basin strategies or locally based protection and restoration programs to address water quality and living resource needs. The Administrator conducts a study every three years to assess the management strategies' commitments and goals under the Chesapeake Bay Agreement. The Administrator conducts a study every three years to assess the management strategies' commitments and goals under the Chesapeake Bay Agreement, including assessing priority needs, effects of air pollution on water quality, state of the Chesapeake Bay, making recommendations for improved management, and providing reports in a transferable format. Authorization of $30,000,000 is provided for fiscal years 1998 through 2003."
