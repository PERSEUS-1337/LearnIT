A study on convolutional neural network-based acoustic models for automatic speech recognition shows transferability between German and English in different layers. The first two layers are entirely transferable, layers 2-8 show some language specificity, and fully connected layers are more language specific but can be finetuned. Follow-up experiments on weight freezing support these findings. The acoustic properties of speech vary across languages, with monolingual acoustic models being the standard in automatic speech recognition. Multi-lingual models are actively developed to overcome the barrier of requiring large amounts of training data for every language. Ideally, models should leverage off-task data strategically. Automatic speech recognition models often take the form of deep networks mapping acoustic features to context-dependent phones. The transformation process and representation in intermediate layers are not fully understood. Better characterization of the intermediate representations of automatic speech recognition models may guide data-efficient training procedures. Adaptive transfer learning procedures, inspired by visual tasks, could be useful for building models for data-poor languages. The transition from task-general to task-specific representations in deep network-based automatic speech recognition models is not well understood. Previous studies have focused on visual tasks, while few have looked at networks trained on acoustic tasks. This study examines convolutional neural networks used for acoustic modeling in ASR systems. The study examines the language-specificity of intermediate layers in CNN-based acoustic models by implanting subsets of one language into another network. The analysis method was adapted to study networks in an underfitting regime on a phone classification task using German and American English speech datasets. The study focused on the language-specificity of CNN-based acoustic models using German and American English speech datasets. Logarithmic Mel filter bank features were used to create a 45-dimensional feature vector for audio, with a CNN architecture consisting of nine convolutional layers and three fully connected layers to recognize context-dependent phones. The model had approximately 7.2 million parameters. The CNN-based acoustic models for German and American English speech datasets had approximately 7.2 million parameters. The networks were trained using the ADAM optimizer in Tensorflow with a minibatch size of 256 and rectified linear units. Training lasted for 100 epochs over two weeks, with 98% of the data used for training and 2% for testing. Model parameters were replicated on four GPUs, with different minibatches given to each GPU. A 'network surgery' technique involved implanting layers from one network into another with random initialization for further training. The study involved training CNN-based acoustic models for German and American English speech datasets with 7.2 million parameters. A 'network surgery' technique implanted layers from one network into another for further training in different ways for both languages. Representations were found to be highly transferable between English and German, with top-1 test phone classification accuracy plotted against the layer at which the surgery was performed. The study involved training CNN-based acoustic models for German and American English speech datasets with 7.2 million parameters. Phone classification accuracy was measured with respect to per frame phone-labels established in a forced alignment. Transfer networks with finetuning at fully connected layers performed worse than the monolingual baseline models. Transfer networks cut at convolutional layers performed as well as the baseline model. Selfer networks without finetuning performed best among the chimera networks. The selfer networks without finetuning performed best overall among the chimera networks, showing an improvement of 3+ pp. Random, untrained weights can perform well in certain scenarios, with a gradual drop in performance observed as a function of depth. Using random weights for all but the last layer resulted in near-chance performance, verifying the success of transfer networks without finetuning. The success of selfer networks without finetuning is partly attributed to weight freezing, similar to the freeze training procedure. Freeze training involved gradually freezing layers during training, leading to better overall performance. The freeze training procedure involved gradually freezing layers during training, resulting in improved overall performance, especially among transfer networks. Naive approaches to transfer, such as initializing with parameters from another language, were found to be inefficient. Freeze trained transfer networks outperformed networks trained solely on the target language, showcasing the benefits of incorporating data from multiple sources for improved generalization. The transfer networks in BID0 showed a gradual drop in performance, starting at the 4th convolutional layer and dropping nearly 8 pp by the penultimate layer. In contrast, our transfer networks exhibited a sharp drop in performance starting at the first fully connected layer. Selfer networks without finetuning outperformed all other models, with accuracy increasing monotonically with the depth at which the network was chopped. Our networks with random weights declined gradually with depth, approaching near-chance performance only when all but the last layer were random. The selfer networks without finetuning outperform all other models, with freezing all but the last layer(s) leading to an improvement over baseline. This suggests important language-specific information in certain layers, with layers 10 and 11 showing worse performance for the transfer network without finetuning. Our freeze training results support the success of selfer networks without finetuning. Freeze-trained transfer networks show improved generalization by recovering language-specific information. Freezing weights can enhance performance by allowing layers to stabilize and pass on target-related information effectively. Freezing weights of a layer can improve performance if the layer already conveys target-related information effectively. In transfer chimera networks, language-specific information was not being conveyed, but a progressive freeze training regime allowed this information to be learned, leading to significant performance gains. Smaller networks train faster, and generic fine-tuning may eventually achieve the same accuracy but after many more iterations."
