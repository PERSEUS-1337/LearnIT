    "content": "Legislative branch revolving funds support the \"business-type activities\" of the House, Senate, and legislative branch agencies, accounting for services provided to other governmental entities and the public. Despite being a small portion of the total budget, these funds have allowed for proper accounting. Congress has periodically reviewed their use, structure, and solvency through oversight and legislation amendments. Revolving funds must be established by statute for various reasons. Revolving funds are established statutorily for various reasons, such as separate accounting, simplifying activities, and increasing operational efficiency.

Authority to spend funds is provided by law, and the availability period for amounts in revolving funds varies. The legislative branch has 27 revolving funds, with different availability periods depending on the budget authority provided in annual appropriations bills. These funds have grown in number and size over time, undergoing reorganizations and legislative amendments, and are subject to oversight by congressional committees and audits by the Government Accountability Office.
