One-third of the world's population is infected with the tuberculosis bacterium, leading to 9 million new cases each year. Tuberculosis is a significant cause of death for HIV-positive individuals and women of reproductive age. 22 countries, including China and India, account for 80% of the world's tuberculosis burden. The incidence rates of tuberculosis in Africa have more than doubled since 1990 due to the HIV/AIDS pandemic, making it the only region where rates are not declining. Drug resistance, including multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, is a critical challenge globally, especially in Eastern Europe. The global spread of drug-resistant tuberculosis poses a threat to Americans, with over 50% of cases in the US linked to foreign-born individuals. Investing in tuberculosis control abroad, where costs are lower, could be a cost-effective strategy to reduce morbidity and mortality domestically. The emergence and spread of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis is a major concern due to its increased lethality and difficulty in treatment. The Stop TB Strategy, developed by the World Health Organization, aims to address these challenges by expanding DOTS coverage and implementing collaborative activities to control the spread of the disease. The Global Plan to Stop TB 2006-2015, developed by the Stop TB Partnership, focuses on preventing and controlling multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, strengthening health systems, engaging all healthcare providers, empowering individuals and communities, and promoting research for new diagnostics, drugs, and vaccines. The Global Plan to Stop TB 2006-2015 aims to cut tuberculosis deaths in half by 2015 and eliminate it as a global health problem by 2050. Despite innovations like the Global Tuberculosis Drug Facility, millions still lack access to effective treatment. Increased global resource investment requires corresponding technical and program assistance to ensure effective tuberculosis treatments are provided. The Global Fund and CDC are actively involved in providing effective tuberculosis treatments globally, with a focus on integrated efforts to combat HIV and tuberculosis. Congress has urged the CDC to increase its involvement in international tuberculosis control efforts due to the direct impact of the global tuberculosis epidemic on the United States. The CDC is assisting countries with a high burden of tuberculosis by implementing WHO-recommended control strategies, improving diagnosis and treatment for HIV-infected individuals, and conducting operational research for new diagnostics and interventions. The CDC is providing assistance to combat tuberculosis by implementing WHO-recommended control strategies, improving diagnosis and treatment for HIV-infected individuals, and conducting operational research for new diagnostics and interventions. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended to prioritize controlling tuberculosis globally by setting specific goals to reduce death and disease burden, increase detection and cure rates by December 31, 2015. The amendment also changes the authorization language to emphasize the mandatory nature of the program. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended to prioritize controlling tuberculosis globally by setting specific goals to reduce death and disease burden, increase detection and cure rates by December 31, 2015. The amendment also changes the authorization language to emphasize the mandatory nature of the program, giving priority to activities described in the Stop TB Strategy. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended to prioritize controlling tuberculosis globally by setting specific goals to reduce death and disease burden, increase detection and cure rates by December 31, 2015. The amendment emphasizes the use of International Standards for Tuberculosis Care, empowering individuals with tuberculosis, promoting research for new diagnostics, drugs, and vaccines, and program-based operational research. Funding is also a key aspect of the amendment.

The amendment emphasizes the use of International Standards for Tuberculosis Care, empowering individuals with tuberculosis, promoting research for new diagnostics, drugs, and vaccines, and program-based operational research. Funding is also a key aspect of the amendment, including allocating a minimum of $15,000,000 for the Global Tuberculosis Drug Facility. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended to provide increased resources to the World Health Organization and the Stop Tuberculosis Partnership to improve the capacity of countries with high rates of tuberculosis to implement the Stop TB Strategy. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended to provide increased resources to the World Health Organization and the Stop Tuberculosis Partnership to implement the Stop TB Strategy, which aims to reduce tuberculosis deaths and disease burden by 2015. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended to allocate funds for the diagnosis and treatment of individuals with tuberculosis in countries with high rates of the disease. The President is authorized to appropriate $225,000,000 for fiscal year 2007 and $260,000,000 for fiscal year 2008 for this purpose. Authorization of $30,000,000 for global tuberculosis activities through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in fiscal year 2007, with additional funding as necessary for fiscal year 2008. Amounts appropriated will remain available until expended."
