    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Title VII Fairness Act\". Congress recognizes the importance of filing limitations periods in ensuring prompt resolution of claims, especially in employment situations. These periods also support voluntary resolution processes and ensure claims are adjudicated based on available evidence. Limitations periods should not prevent a claim from being filed by a person who exercises due diligence regarding their rights but did not have a reasonable suspicion of discrimination. Such individuals should have the full limitation period to file a claim once they have a reasonable suspicion of discrimination. SEC. 3. FILING PERIOD FOR CHARGES ALLEGING UNLAWFUL EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES. Section 706(e) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is amended to include provisions for charges alleging discrimination in violation of the Act. The filing period for such charges begins when the aggrieved person has enough information to support a reasonable suspicion of discrimination. The amendment clarifies that the provisions do not change subsection (g)(1) or apply to charges related to pension benefits. SEC. 4. FILING PERIOD FOR CHARGES ALLEGING UNLAWFUL PRACTICES BASED ON AGE. Section 7(d) of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 is amended to include new provisions for charges alleging discrimination based on age. The amendment outlines criteria for when this paragraph applies, including the demonstration of lack of information to support suspicion of discrimination. The amendment to Section 7(d) of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 specifies that the filing period for charges alleging age discrimination begins when the person aggrieved has enough information to support suspicion of discrimination.
