    "content": "The report provides an overview of farm safety net proposals for the next farm bill, as advocated by the Administration, Members of Congress, and interest groups. The Senate Agriculture Committee approved its version of the 2012 omnibus farm bill on April 26, 2012, and officially filed the measure, S. 3240, on May 24, 2012. Various proposals have been offered to revise the farm safety net for crop producers, with concerns arising during budget deliberations in fall 2011. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction raised concerns about the potential impact on the new farm bill, with proposals ranging from extending current programs to wholesale replacement. The House and Senate Agriculture Committees worked on developing new farm policy within proposed budgetary guidelines, but the joint committee failed to reach a bipartisan consensus on deficit reduction. The development of the farm bill is now following a traditional legislative process after the joint committee failed to reach a bipartisan consensus on deficit reduction. Both the House and Senate held hearings in early 2012 to gather input from producers. This report compares farm safety net proposals against current programs, addressing issues like program type, commodity coverage, and payment limits. The farm bill development process is now following a traditional legislative path after the joint committee's failure to agree on deficit reduction. Both the House and Senate conducted hearings in early 2012 to gather input from producers. The report compares farm safety net proposals to current programs, focusing on aspects such as program type, commodity coverage, and payment limits. The funding for the next farm bill will be based on the Congressional Budget Office's March 2012 baseline projection of mandatory farm bill program costs. Total budget authority for all mandatory farm bill programs under current law is $995 billion during FY2013-FY2022, with $153 billion allocated to farm safety net programs over the 10-year period. The budget authority for farm safety net programs is $153 billion over 10 years, with $63 billion for Title I and $90 billion for Title XII. Disaster programs do not have baseline funding. The CBO baseline projection is an estimate of federal spending on mandatory programs under current law. These amounts can be used for reauthorization, reallocation, savings, deficit reduction, or offsets for other provisions. The federal government supports farm income and helps manage risks for farmers. The federal government provides support for farm income and risk management through various programs, including farm commodity price and income support programs, federal crop insurance, and disaster assistance programs. The total cost of farm safety net programs for FY2011 is estimated at $13.8 billion, with an average projected budget authority of $15.3 billion per year over FY2013-FY2022. The 2008 farm bill provides support for various farm commodities through programs like direct payments, counter-cyclical payments, ACRE payments, and marketing assistance loans. Producers of loan commodities are eligible for nonrecourse marketing assistance loans. Dry peas, lentils, and chickpeas also receive expanded benefits under this bill. The 2008 farm bill expanded benefits for producers of dry peas, lentils, and chickpeas, but not fixed direct payments. Raw cane and refined beet sugar prices are supported through limits on domestic output and nonrecourse loans, backed by quotas. Dairy product prices are supported by government purchases of nonfat dry milk, cheese, and butter at set prices, along with quotas that limit imports. Producers of specialty crops and livestock generally receive little to no direct government support through commodity programs. The federal crop insurance program provides risk management tools for farmers, with revenue-based policies covering 75% of total policy premiums and yield-based policies covering 25%. Federally subsidized policies protect against losses during a season, with price guarantee levels set before planting. Federal crop insurance has become a crucial risk management tool since the 1990s, with substantial federal support covering about 60% of the farmer's costs. The federal crop insurance program provides risk management tools for farmers, with substantial federal support covering about 60% of the farmer's costs. Participation in crop insurance programs has increased, leading to a rise in federal premium subsidies. The program is projected to cost $9.0 billion per year through 2022, covering major crops like corn, soybeans, wheat, and cotton, as well as over 80 specialty crops. Specialty crop policies covered more than 7 million acres in 2009, with policies available for more than 100 crops. The 2008 farm bill included funding for five new disaster programs, such as the Supplemental Revenue Assistance Payments Program (SURE) to compensate producers for crop losses. These programs were authorized until September 30, 2011, not the end of the farm bill in 2012. CBO does not include program funding in future baseline estimates due to the early expiration. The 2008 farm bill introduced new disaster programs like SURE for compensating crop losses. The U.S. agricultural sector has been financially successful since the mid-2000s, with rising commodity prices and farm incomes surpassing average household incomes. In the past decade, farm household incomes have surpassed average U.S. household incomes. The next farm bill is influenced by the current federal budget situation, with deficit reduction likely to target agriculture spending. Supporters and critics of farm subsidies are interested in reallocating funding to improve the safety net and complement crop insurance. The current farm safety net programs, including marketing loan rates, target prices, ACRE, SURE disaster program, and Direct Payments, are facing criticism for their ineffectiveness in providing price and income support. Some producers are concerned about shallow losses and slow disaster response. Critics argue that government funding could be better spent on environmental goals or improving productivity, questioning the need for farm subsidies. Farm policy observers have noted overlap among farm safety net programs, with various types of payments in place. Some suggest a simplified approach would be more effective and less costly. The current farm program mix includes different types of payments like marketing loan benefits, traditional counter-cyclical payments, ACRE payments, and crop insurance. The number and types of commodities covered by farm programs have evolved over time, benefiting producers of staple commodities the most. Producers of staple commodities have shaped farm programs, limiting coverage for other commodities. Increasing commodity coverage could be achieved through a whole-farm program or revising whole farm insurance. Payment limits for farm commodity programs are controversial, setting maximum payment amounts or income thresholds for eligibility. The limits issue in farm programs is controversial as it raises questions about farm size support, payment proportions, and recipients. Some policymakers advocate for tighter limits to save money and address concerns over payments to large farms, while others argue against penalizing larger farms for their efficiencies. Crop insurance, without payment limits, is seen as beneficial for both small and large farms but is also a target for limit application. The US, as a WTO member, must operate its domestic support programs within established parameters. The United States is under pressure to modify its upland cotton programs due to a WTO ruling. Policy issues affecting farm safety net revisions include price protection, geographic benefits, and addressing shallow losses. Various proposals by Congress and interest groups can be analyzed based on these issues. Many proposals are being considered to protect producers against lower prices and revenue in the face of high agricultural market volatility. Crop insurance only covers intra-season price risk, and current farm programs do not provide adequate protection at current price levels. Producer groups are interested in safeguarding against multi-year price declines, but using recent high prices as fixed references without adjustments could increase program costs and raise concerns with the World Trade Organization. Fixed price guarantees can offer market protection for farmers but may lead to high costs for taxpayers and potential WTO disputes. Market-oriented program parameters can reduce overproduction and taxpayer costs but may provide less support to farmers during price declines. Price protection based on historical average prices may be more attractive after a high price period. The geographic trigger in a program determines the level of loss before producers receive benefits, with farm-level compensation being preferred by producers. Farm-level compensation is preferred by producers for its specificity to their loss, but it can be costly for taxpayers. Area-based programs may not always benefit individual farms, and national-level programs may not match local farm losses. Individual farm triggers would provide better farm-level support. Individual farm triggers provide better farm-level yield protection than area triggers, but may require lower payment rates for budgetary reasons. Area-wide plans offer less individual yield risk protection but potentially more price protection. Payment adjustment factors can be used to control costs and address shallow losses not covered by federally subsidized crop insurance. Some producers and policymakers are concerned about high insurance deductibles for shallow losses, while others believe these losses are part of the cost of doing business. Proposals for a new revenue program to address shallow losses have been suggested, but some argue that federal farm programs should focus on deep losses instead. Some argue against shallow loss programs, fearing they would reduce risk for producers and lead to overproduction. Others suggest offering inexpensive deep loss coverage could encourage production in risky areas. The choice of tying benefits to current or historical plantings is also debated, with the 1996 farm bill opting for decoupled payments to align planting decisions with market signals. Under the next farm bill, payments may shift to planted acres instead of historical base acres, known as \"recoupling.\" This change could lead to market-distorting behavior, overproduction, lower crop prices, and higher federal outlays. The surge in U.S. farm income questions the need for nearly $5 billion in direct payments. Policy discussions include eliminating direct payments and relying on crop insurance as the primary safety net. Multiple commodity programs raise fairness and equity issues for payment distribution. Using target/reference prices may affect producer behavior and planted area. Should restrictions on growing certain crops be removed for program benefits? Federal programs need to address losses from downward trending prices. Conservation compliance and payment limits are contentious issues. Sequestration may require cuts for mandatory farm programs. Sequestration may require cuts of approximately $15 billion for mandatory farm programs. The goal of a $23 billion reduction is in question. Various proposals have been put forward to reduce government expenditures on farm subsidies and revise farm programs, including modifying current policy, implementing new revenue programs, crop insurance proposals, and others. Most proposals aim to eliminate direct and counter-cyclical payments to generate savings and address farm revenue risk for producers. Several proposals aim to reduce government expenditures on farm subsidies by eliminating direct payments and other commodity payments. They suggest creating a new crop revenue program based on existing programs like ACRE or SURE, as well as implementing changes to crop insurance. Some proposals suggest extending farm programs with reduced funding levels. Program modifications include reducing budget costs and eliminating direct payments. Commodity coverage includes wheat, feed grains, rice, soybeans, upland cotton, and minor oilseeds. The proposal includes reauthorizing various farm programs like CCP, ACRE, and disaster programs, reducing crop insurance expenditures by cutting producer subsidies and company returns, with a projected net savings of $33 billion over 10 years. Eligible crops for coverage include feed grains, rice, soybeans, upland cotton, and minor oilseeds. The Administration's budget proposal aims to save $33 billion over 10 years by targeting conservation programs, reducing crop insurance expenditures, and reauthorizing disaster programs. Concerns are raised about the artificially inflated federal support and ROI in the crop insurance industry due to high market prices. The Administration proposes lower federal support for crop insurance to align ROI with industry average, by capping administrative expenses and adjusting premium pricing for catastrophic coverage policies. This will slightly reduce reimbursements to insurance companies, but farmers will not be affected as their portion of the premium remains fully subsidized. The Administration proposes cutting federal premium subsidy rates by two percentage points on policies subsidized in excess of 50%, as part of a plan to reduce government spending by eliminating most farm programs while maintaining crop insurance and guaranteed farm loans. Programs like DP, CCP, ACRE, and SURE would be eliminated, along with direct ownership and operating loans, and disaster programs that expired in 2011. Commodity coverage, loss coverage, price/revenue protection, geographic loss trigger, eligible acres, payment calculation, and payment limit would remain unchanged. Senator Coburn's proposal aims to reform the farm safety net by ending income support programs like direct payments, ACRE, and marketing assistance loans. The proposal suggests expanding the current CCP program to cover crops like wheat, corn, soybeans, and others, with no changes to loss coverage. Total safety net savings are estimated to exceed $80 billion over 10 years. CCP program modifications include payments on planted acreage based on market prices, with increased target prices for better price protection. Changes aim to align payments with price risk and are supported by producer groups. No cost to producers or budget estimate available. The CCP program modifications align payments with price risk and aim to speed up payment delivery by using partial-year data. The program covers shallow-loss crop revenue and includes crop-specific payments when farm revenue falls below the guarantee. Coverage includes various crops with losses from 10% to 25% of revenue guarantee. The CCP program covers shallow-loss crop revenue and includes crop-specific payments when two triggers are met: actual farm revenue < farm guarantee, and actual CRD revenue < CRD revenue guarantee. Payment calculation is based on 85% of planted acres with adjustment for farm yield relative to CRD yield. Payment rates are capped at 15% of CRD guarantee, subject to an AGI limitation of $500,000 non-farm average income. The ARRM program has an AGI limitation of $500,000 and a payment limit of $65,000. Conservation compliance rules apply with no cost to the producer. The budget cost estimate includes savings from eliminating existing programs and the cost of ARRM, estimated at $28 billion over 10 years. The CBO scored $20 billion in net savings over 10 years for ARRM, which was designed to address criticisms of the ACRE program in the 2008 farm bill. ACRE aimed to help farmers manage revenue risks and protect against losses from multi-year price declines. ARRM program addresses criticisms of ACRE by using a five-year Olympic average revenue trigger based on crop reporting districts instead of statewide yields. This shift aims to provide risk protection closer to the farm level. Additionally, ARRM uses harvest prices from crop insurance programs for payment calculations, resulting in more timely payments based on current market prices. The ARRM program replaces DP, ACRE, and SURE with a shallow-loss crop revenue program that uses current futures market prices for payment calculations. It covers revenue losses greater than 12% but not exceeding 25% on planted/prevented planted program crop acreage for various crops like wheat, corn, soybeans, and cotton. Payments are made when actual farm revenue falls below the historic revenue guarantee for each crop. The ARRM program replaces previous programs with a shallow-loss crop revenue program that covers revenue losses greater than 12% but not exceeding 25% on planted/prevented planted program crop acreage for crops like wheat, corn, soybeans, and cotton. Payments are made when actual farm revenue falls below the historic revenue guarantee for each crop, with target prices no longer reduced by direct payment rates. Price/revenue protection is multi-year, with a per-acre revenue guarantee of 88% times historic revenue for each crop. Losses below 75% of historic revenue are not covered, and a payment factor is used for planted and prevented planted acres. Eligible acres include planted or intended-to-be-planted acres, with total eligible acres not exceeding historical program crop base acres. The Revenue Loss Assistance Program and CCP provide payments for revenue losses on planted/prevented planted program crop acreage. Payment calculation is based on the difference between revenue guarantee and actual crop revenue per acre. Payment limit is $105,000, and eligibility is subject to conservation compliance rules. Average adjusted gross income exceeding $999,000 makes a person ineligible for benefits. Budget cost estimate is pending. The proposal aims to address shallow losses by combining ACRE and SURE programs into one, without needing a disaster designation for eligibility. It focuses on current program crops and uses national farm prices for quicker payment delivery. It includes net crop insurance indemnities in revenue calculations to avoid payment overlap. Additionally, it reauthorizes livestock and fruit tree disaster programs with reduced payment amounts for FY2012 to FY2021. SURE would be authorized for FY2012 only. The proposal combines ACRE and SURE programs into one for shallow-loss crop revenue protection for FY2012. It eliminates DP, CCP, ACRE, and SURE programs, focusing on current program crops with coverage for losses from 10% to 25% of farm revenue guarantee. Payments are triggered when actual farm revenue falls below the guarantee, with price/revenue protection based on multi-year averages. Eligible acres include planted or intended-to-be-planted acres, with payment rates calculated based on the difference between actual revenue and the guarantee. The American Soybean Association (ASA) has proposed a revenue-based program for shallow-loss crop revenue protection in FY2012. The program combines ACRE and SURE programs, eliminating DP, CCP, ACRE, and SURE as applied to cotton. Payment rates are calculated based on the difference between actual farm revenue and the guarantee, with a payment limit capped at 25% of the guarantee. Eligibility is subject to conservation compliance rules, with a payment calculation based on actual yield and national farm price for the first four months of the year. The marketing loan program for cotton producers has eliminated several programs and introduced STAX for commodity coverage. Loss coverage is expected to be around 10% to 20% of revenue guarantee, with a voluntary area-wide insurance product subsidized at 80%. Price/revenue protection includes a floor price guarantee of $0.65 per pound. The upland cotton marketing loan rate is determined in the fall prior to planting the crop and set within a range of $0.47 to $0.52 per pound. Area-wide insurance policies are determined at the county level. Payment calculation, limit, and eligible acres remain unchanged. Producer premiums for supplementary coverage would be offset by using available program spending authority. The annual cost is estimated at $400 to $500 million by the National Cotton Council. The National Cotton Council proposes a stacked shallow-loss coverage program with area-wide revenue protection for upland cotton producers. This program would complement existing crop insurance policies, offering protection against shallow losses at the county level. The estimated annual cost is $400 to $500 million. The National Cotton Council proposes a stacked shallow-loss coverage program with area-wide revenue protection for upland cotton producers. The program aims to make adjustments to the upland cotton marketing loan program to comply with WTO commitments and resolve the dispute with Brazil. It offers protection against shallow losses at the county level, potentially covering all crops with yield insurance. Payment is designed to supplement individual farm-level policies when area yield falls below 90% of the expected level. The proposed stacked shallow-loss coverage program by the National Cotton Council offers area-wide revenue protection for upland cotton producers. It provides payment to supplement individual farm-level policies when area yield falls below 90% of the expected level, with no payment limit and subsidized crop insurance premiums. The proposed Total Coverage Option (TCO) program offers deep-loss yield insurance for all crops, covering yield losses of more than 30%. It replaces current farm commodity programs and crop insurance subsidies with a free policy that triggers coverage when losses in the area exceed 10% of normal levels. The federal subsidy for TCO is not less than 60% of the premium, similar to the current crop insurance program subsidy level. Program types like DP, CCP, ACRE, Marketing Loan Program, and SURE are eliminated under TCO. The crop insurance policy covers yield losses of more than 30%, with price protection based on current prices. Geographic loss trigger is at the farm level, and payment is calculated on eligible acres. Conservation compliance is required, with a basic policy being free for producers. Additional coverage can be purchased at full market price. The budget cost estimate expects a total net savings of $80 billion over 10 years, advocating for assistance only in case of natural losses. The government should provide agricultural assistance for losses due to natural phenomena like bad weather. The program type is deep-loss revenue insurance, eliminating other programs. It covers deep losses exceeding 20% or 30% and makes payments based on county yields and historical prices. Producers can purchase additional individual policies for shallow losses or farm yield risk. Price protection is based on a three-year average. The proposed agricultural assistance program would provide price protection based on three-year or five-year average crop insurance harvest prices, with a geographic loss trigger at the county level. Eligible acres for payment calculation would be planted acreage, with no payment limit and minimal fees for producers. The program is expected to reduce crop insurance premiums by allowing producers to purchase individual policies for additional coverage. The proposed agricultural assistance program aims to provide price protection based on average crop insurance harvest prices, with a county-level loss trigger. It allows producers to manage shallow losses by purchasing subsidized insurance, with increased loan rates and acreage for major program crops. The program does not guarantee profits but minimizes the impact of farm programs on production decisions, and can be applied to a wider range of commodities. The new program establishes a Floor Price Option (FOR) for major program crops with increased loan rates and acreage set-asides. Programs like DP, CCP, and marketing loan benefits are eliminated. Covered crops include wheat, feed grains, rice, soybeans, cotton, oilseeds, peanuts, and pulse crops. Producers can place crops in a FOR when market prices fall below the loan rate, with a cap on quantities. Crops in the FOR receive an annual storage payment and are released when market prices exceed 160% of the loan rate. The new program establishes a Floor Price Option (FOR) for major program crops with increased loan rates and acreage set-asides. Crops in the FOR receive an annual storage payment of $0.40 per unit. When a crop's FOR reaches its cap and market prices fall below the loan rate, a voluntary paid set-aside is triggered. Participation in the set-aside is voluntary, with set-asides allocated at the county level. Price/revenue protection is provided through higher loan rates, and commodity payments are only made for quantities actually placed in the FOR. The proposed farmer-owned reserves program aims to address market self-correction issues by offering a storage payment of $0.40 per unit for crops placed in the Floor Price Option (FOR). This program could lead to lower government payments, with no payment limit or cost to producers. A study suggests that implementing the FOR program could have saved $56.4 billion over a 13-year period from 1998 to 2010, while increasing the value of production by $33 billion for affected crops. In the 112th Congress, legislation has been introduced for alternatives to current federal dairy programs, which expire in 2012. The Dairy Security Act of 2011 (H.R. 3062) was proposed as a new approach to dairy farm support, aiming to provide a better safety net for dairy producers. Other alternative proposals were also introduced, advocating for whole farm insurance. Several proposals in the 112th Congress advocate for the use of whole farm insurance to protect against declines in a farm's entire revenue. An expansion of whole-farm insurance is included in S. 1658 / H.R. 3111, the Rural Economic Farm and Ranch Sustainability and Hunger Act of 2011. Currently, USDA offers whole farm revenue insurance in selected states through the Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) and AGR-Lite policies, with coverage available for up to 80% of guaranteed income. The Chicago Council on Global Affairs recommends merging all farm commodity support programs and crop insurance subsidies into a single whole-farm revenue insurance program. The Chicago Council on Global Affairs recommends consolidating farm commodity support programs and crop insurance subsidies into a single whole-farm revenue insurance program to save $2.5 billion per year. The proposed legislation, the Local Farms, Food, and Jobs Act of 2011, aims to introduce a nationwide whole farm revenue risk plan for producers. The bill aims to provide insurance coverage for agricultural producers below 85% of average gross farm revenue, including on-farm activities. It also eliminates premium surcharges for organic crops and offers insurance at actual price levels. Representative Blumenauer introduced a proposal for farm policy reform, outlining changes in commodity programs, conservation, research, beginning farmer programs, crop insurance, and nutrition. The proposal for farm policy reform includes eliminating direct payments and placing limits on combined payments under commodity programs. It also links conservation compliance to crop insurance participation and increases funding for conservation, nutrition, and research. Measures to aid beginning farmers are recommended, but specific legislative language is pending. California agricultural interests submitted a proposal to the joint committee on October 14, 2011, requesting a more diversified farm bill with over 70 specific recommendations covering various areas such as plant and animal health, specialty crop promotion, and rural development. The proposal aims to better reflect the diversity of California's agricultural production. The California agricultural proposal submitted to the joint committee on October 14, 2011, includes over 70 specific recommendations for a more diversified farm bill. It covers areas such as plant and animal health, specialty crop promotion, and rural development. The proposal aims to better reflect the diversity of California's agricultural production. The current Farm Safety Net Programs evaluated include Direct Payments (DP) Program, which provides fixed, decoupled income support based on historic program acreage and yields for various crops. The Direct Payments (DP) Program provides income support based on historic base acres and yields for various crops. Payment limit is $40,000 per person or $80,000 with a spouse. Conservation compliance is required, with no cost to producers. The budget cost estimate for DP from FY2013-FY2022 is $49.6 billion. The program is classified as green box under WTO status and covers commodities like wheat, corn, rice, soybeans, cotton, oilseeds, peanuts, and pulse crops. Loss coverage is not provided at the individual farm level. The Direct Payments (DP) Program provides income support based on historic base acres and yields for various crops like wheat, corn, rice, soybeans, cotton, oilseeds, peanuts, and pulse crops. Loss coverage is not required at the individual farm level. Payments are triggered when the national season-average farm price falls below a national price trigger for a specific crop, providing revenue protection. Payments are made on historic base acreage and program yields, with no planting required to receive payment. Total CCP payment is calculated as CCP payment rate times 85% of the crop's target price adjusted downward by its DP rate. The Conservation Compliance Payment (CCP) program provides income support based on historic base acres and program yields for covered commodities. Payment calculation involves the CCP payment rate, target price, direct payment rate, national season-average farm price, and national loan rate. Payment limit is $65,000 per person or $130,000 with a spouse. Conservation compliance is required with no cost to the producer. The budget cost estimate for CCP during FY2013-FY2022 is $1 billion or $0.1 billion per year. The program is classified as a Marketing Loan Benefits (MLB) Program, with commodity-specific price support for covered commodities. The Price Loss Coverage (PLC) program provides support for various crops including oats, rice, soybeans, cotton, oilseeds, pulse crops, peanuts, and other commodities. Farmers receive benefits when market prices fall below loan rates, with no yield protection. The program is voluntary and offers price support based on commodity-specific loan rates, allowing producers to claim benefits when local prices drop below national loan rates. Price protection is provided by the statutorily fixed marketing loan rate for each crop. The Marketing Loan Program (MLP) acts as a revenue floor for producers, with the government covering the difference between the loan rate and market price. Payment is triggered at the county level when prices fall below the national loan rate. All harvested acres are eligible for MLP benefits, with payments calculated based on the difference between the loan rate and the county price. There is no payment limit, conservation compliance is required, and there is no cost to the producer. The projected cost of MLP from FY2013-FY2022 is $776 million. The ACRE program provides income support for specific commodities through revenue protection against price and yield losses. It covers a variety of crops and requires meeting revenue triggers for payments. Selection is permanent under the 2008 farm bill, and payments are based on historic revenue averages. ACRE program provides income support for eligible crops on a farm through revenue protection. Payments are calculated separately for each crop based on revenue triggers. Geographic loss triggers at farm and state levels must be met for payment, which is based on a state-level formula. Payment calculation involves state payment rate per acre, planted acres, and yield ratios. The ACRE program provides income support for eligible crops on a farm through revenue protection. Payments are calculated based on revenue triggers at farm and state levels. ACRE payments count towards the counter-cyclical program payment limit of $65,000 per person. Participants must forgo 100% of CCP and 20% of DP for all eligible crops on a farm. The projected cost of ACRE during FY2013-FY2022 is $5 billion or $0.5 billion per year. ACRE is classified as a product-specific AMS program. The SURE program is a whole-farm income support program that covers all crops and compensates producers for revenue losses due to natural disasters. It replaces ad hoc disaster assistance with a permanent program, providing payments if actual revenue falls below a guaranteed level. The revenue guarantee is based on crop insurance and NAP guarantees increased by 15%. The sum of a farm's crop insurance guarantees increased by 15%, and NAP guarantees increased by 20%. Guarantee calculation for insurable crops is based on APH or CCP yield, insurance coverage level, planted acreage, and price election. For non-insurable crops, the guarantee is based on adjusted NAP or CCP yield, planted acreage, and NAP price. Geographic loss trigger requires farms to be in a secretarial-disaster-declared county or have yield losses due to disaster-related conditions. Payment calculation is 60% of program guarantee minus total farm revenue. Payment limit is set to ensure payments do not exceed the guaranteed amount. SURE payments are limited to 90% of expected farm income, with a cap of $100,000 per person. Producers with a three-year average AGI of $500,000 are ineligible for SURE payments since 2009. Participants must purchase crop insurance or NAP for all crops in their farming operation. SURE has no baseline funding after September 30, 2011. It is classified as non-product-specific AMS but eligible for non-product-specific de minimis exemption. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction was tasked with reducing the federal deficit by $1.2 trillion over 10 years. The committee's recommendations could impact the development of the next farm bill. Legislation resulting from the committee's recommendations would proceed under special \"fast track\" procedures, preventing amendments and limiting debate. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction failed to approve a proposal by November 23, 2011, leading to an impasse. A simple majority of the 12 members was needed to move the bill for a vote. If a deficit-cutting proposal was not enacted by January 15, 2012, automatic spending cuts including sequestration would occur. Congressional committees could submit their own recommendations to the joint committee. The House and Senate Agriculture Committees recommended $23 billion in deficit reduction from mandatory programs within their jurisdiction. This included cutting $13 billion from commodity support, $6 billion from conservation, and $4 billion from nutrition programs. The joint committee was not obligated to incorporate these recommendations. The agriculture committee leadership failed to provide a legislative package for $23 billion deficit reduction by November 1, 2011. Regional differences over the \"farm safety net\" design hindered agreement among policymakers. Despite developing a savings package, the joint committee's failure to reach an agreement ended the effort. The agriculture committee leadership will continue reauthorizing the farm bill. Many in the U.S. agricultural community were concerned that the joint committee's budget recommendations could influence the next farm bill, potentially excluding certain interest groups. The House and Senate Agriculture Committee leadership's policy recommendations were criticized for their \"secret nature\" and fast-track process. On November 3, 2011, Congressman Kind and 26 other Members of Congress urged the joint committee to avoid creating new farm bill programs through expedited deficit reduction. A draft proposal of farm bill recommendations was reported on November 18, 2011, with some members considering it as a starting point for 2012 deliberations. The draft farm bill proposal in 2012 borrowed heavily from Members of Congress and others, containing multiple titles including a farm safety net. It aimed to replace current farm programs with the Ag Risk Coverage program, offering protection against yield and price declines at the farm level. The draft farm bill proposal in 2012 included a revenue option and a price option for producers. The revenue option would cover losses below 75% of farm revenue, while the price option would make payments when the national average price drops below a reference price. The price option is designed to be attractive to rice, peanut, and sorghum producers. The draft farm bill proposal in 2012 included a revenue option and a price option for producers, with the price option designed to be attractive to rice, peanut, and sorghum producers. The new cotton program would be a stand-alone revenue protection program, separate from other crops, to resolve a trade conflict with Brazil. Specialty crops would see expanded crop insurance coverage, while dairy programs would be replaced with a margin-based payment program to reduce farm output during margin declines."
