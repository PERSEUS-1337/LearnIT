    "content": "A principal issue in understanding how the federal government responds to a cyber incident is the definition of a \"cyber incident.\" Terms like cyber attack, cybercrime, cyber espionage, and cyber terrorism are used to describe malicious activities with a technological component. The motivation of the actor distinguishes these incidents, with criminals being profit-motivated and terrorists being politically motivated. The speed and anonymity of cyber attacks make it difficult to differentiate between the actions of terrorists, criminals, and nation states. \"Cyber incident\" is an umbrella term encompassing various malicious activities carried out by different actors exploiting cyberspace. The federal government defines a cyber incident as an event on a computer network that jeopardizes the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of information. Various malicious actors, from hacktivists to nation states, can be involved. Federal law enforcement investigates and attributes cyber incidents, but there are no official definitions for specific subsets like cybercrime. The 2016 Presidential Policy Directive/PPD-41 established federal cyber incident response, outlining threat response, asset response, and intelligence support. DOJ, FBI, and NCIJTF lead threat response, while other agencies lead asset response and intelligence support. Threat response involves law enforcement and investigative activities at the affected entity's site. The FBI leads cybercrime cases, including computer hacking, intellectual property violations, child exploitation, fraud, and identity theft. Their top priorities are combating intrusions and investigating ransomware. Multiple departments and agencies are involved in responding to cyber threats due to the nature of crime in the technology era. The FBI's Cyber Division focuses on combating computer and network intrusions, investigating ransomware, and preventing cyber attacks through the Next Generation Cyber initiative. This includes strengthening the NCIJTF, expanding Cyber Task Forces, increasing information sharing with the private sector, and bolstering the FBI's cyber workforce. The NCIJTF, established in 2008, coordinates over 20 U.S. agencies to combat cyber threats, including botnets. Operation Clean Slate aims to disrupt significant botnets, like GameOver Zeus. The FBI estimates that botnets infect millions of computers globally each year. The GameOver Zeus botnet, a variant of the Zeus botnet, was targeted by law enforcement to disrupt its operations. Efforts included severing communication between infected computers and criminal-controlled servers. An alleged administrator of GameOver Zeus was indicted on various charges. Concerns about the effectiveness of the NCIJTF were raised, including issues with information sharing and perception as an FBI extension. These issues have since improved according to the DOJ's Inspector General in 2015. The FBI collaborates with the NCIJTF to run a 24-hour cyber command center called CyWatch, connecting federal cyber centers, government agencies, FBI field offices, and the private sector in case of a cyber intrusion. The FBI leads law enforcement task forces and partnerships focused on cyber threat response, with Cyber Action Teams established in 2006 for rapid deployment. Local Cyber Task Forces at each field office focus on cybersecurity threats, incident response, and national cybercrime combat efforts. Cyber Action Teams (CATs) are specialized groups of agents and computer scientists deployed globally for computer-intrusion investigations. FBI also has cyber assistant legal attach\u00e9s (ALATs) in foreign countries to collaborate on investigations and dismantle cyber threat actors. The FBI works with the private sector to collect and share information on cyber incidents through initiatives like the Internet Crime Complaint Center. The FBI established the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) in 2000 to report potential criminal activity online and build partnerships with law enforcement and industry. Information is shared to enhance awareness and support investigative activities. InfraGard is a collaboration between the FBI and private sector partners to protect U.S. critical infrastructure through information sharing. InfraGard, a collaboration between the FBI and private sector partners, has 84 chapters nationwide with over 43,000 members. Originally focused on cyber threats, it now covers various threats to critical infrastructure. Members have access to iGuardian, a tool for reporting cyber incidents, which feeds information to CyWatch for analysis and victim notification. The National Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance (NCFTA) is a nonprofit organization that produces intelligence assessments and strategies to combat cybercrime. The FBI utilizes intelligence assessments to mitigate cyber threats and support law enforcement investigations. Barriers to effective information sharing with the private sector include concerns about unidirectional flow and outdated or lacking context in shared information. The FBI has developed unclassified products like the FBI Liaison Alert System Reports for sharing with private sector partners. Some private sector partners have raised concerns about the FBI's information sharing, noting that the information provided may be outdated or lacking substance. There are also concerns about sharing proprietary and personally identifiable information with the FBI. The FBI encourages private companies to engage federal investigators for cyber breaches, but many still turn to private firms for help. Congress is interested in cyber information sharing, including between the private sector and law enforcement. Some concerns have been raised about the FBI's information sharing practices. The FBI faces challenges in recruiting and retaining a cyber workforce. Former Director James Comey highlighted the difficulty in finding agents with integrity, fitness, intelligence, and specialized cyber knowledge. One solution could be to recruit agents specifically for cyber cases, some without the need to carry a firearm. Another option is to ease the requirement for retraining agents who wish to return after leaving the FBI for two years or more. The FBI may need to reevaluate its hiring structure to address challenges in recruiting and retaining cyber-focused agents. Policymakers should consider the budgetary impact of potential changes. In FY2018, the Administration requested additional funding and positions to bolster the FBI's cyber program. The DOJ's Inspector General recommended improvements in training courses, rotation policies for cyber agents, and the development of regional hubs with experts in investigating national security intrusion cases. The FBI has evolved its strategy on assigning computer-intrusion cases to field offices with expertise in investigating specific types of intrusions, fostering competition to enhance agents' knowledge and skills. The bureau has a multifaceted cyber training program, including High Technology Environment Training, SANS Institute courses, and opportunities for personnel to earn a Master of Science degree in information. The FBI has a multifaceted cyber training program, including opportunities for personnel to earn a Master of Science degree in information technology. FBI investigators aim to combat threats using their cyber investigative toolkit, but concerns arise about being outpaced by technological change, termed \"going dark.\" Factors contributing to this debate include encryption, data retention limits, and tools for online anonymity. Law enforcement supports strong encryption to protect networks and devices, but also acknowledges the challenges posed by encrypted communications exploited by malicious actors. Experts recommend enhancing investigative competencies rather than creating backdoors in technology products. Lawmakers are working to balance privacy protection with legitimate law enforcement access, as seen in the establishment of an Encryption Working Group in the 114th Congress. The Encryption Working Group was established by the Committee on Energy and Commerce to find solutions that maintain strong encryption while giving law enforcement necessary tools. The group's year-end report highlighted key points: weakening encryption harms national security, encryption is widely used globally, no one-size-fits-all solution exists for encryption challenges, and cooperation between law enforcement and technology sectors is crucial. Policymakers may question how the FBI prioritizes cyber threats, which is addressed through an annual Threat Review. The FBI conducts an annual Threat Review and Prioritization to identify and prioritize cyber threats using an algorithmic, data-driven methodology. The DOJ's Office of the Inspector General recommended implementing a record-keeping system to track agent time utilization by threat for better threat prioritization. The FBI is enhancing its Cyber Division's Threat Examination and Scoping tool to prioritize cyber threats using specific data and a weighted algorithm. Congress may oversee any adjustments made by the FBI in prioritizing cyber threats and how it impacts the nation's overall threat landscape. The FBI is enhancing its Cyber Division's Threat Examination and Scoping tool to prioritize cyber threats using specific data and a weighted algorithm, which could impact how Congress directs FBI funds."
