The Director of the National Science Foundation will conduct a pilot program to award innovation inducement cash prizes in various research areas. Topics for prize competitions will prioritize high-risk, high-reward challenges that can enhance the economic competitiveness of the United States and raise public awareness about federally sponsored research. Different categories of innovation inducement prizes will be considered. The Director of the National Science Foundation will conduct innovation inducement prizes, including contests with stated objectives and those closest to achieving an objective within a specified time. The Director will advertise prize competitions widely to encourage broad participation and announce each competition through a Federal Register notice. The Director of the National Science Foundation will announce prize competitions within 18 months of receiving funds. Prizes will be funded by Federal appropriations and donations, with announcements made after all funds are secured. To be eligible to win a prize under this section, an individual or entity must comply with all requirements, be incorporated in the U.S., and not be a Federal entity or employee. The Director may announce up to 5 prize competitions with awards ranging from $1,000,000 to $3,000,000. An expert panel may select winners, and public outreach resources will be used for award ceremonies. The Director may partner with a private entity to administer prize competitions. The Federal Government will not claim intellectual property rights from participants. Participants may be required to waive liability for injuries during the competition. The pilot program under this section involves prize competitions that are not a substitute for Federal research programs. The National Science Board must report to Congress after 5 years with results and recommendations on the program's success and potential changes. The program evaluates diversity of contestants, public awareness, public image enhancement, and use of private funds. The Director can end contests if unregistered entities produce qualifying innovations. Authorization of appropriations is required. Authorization of Appropriations for fiscal years 2011 through 2013 is set at $12,000,000 for carrying out this section. Up to 15 percent of the funds can be used for administrative costs. Funds for prize awards can be carried over and remain available for 7 fiscal years before being reprogrammed or expended for other purposes. The section prohibits the obligation or payment of funds in violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act."
