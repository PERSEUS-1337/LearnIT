    "content": "A rise in illicit drug trafficking in Africa has caught the attention of U.S. policy makers. The 110th Congress passed P.L. 110-417, requiring the Department of Defense to develop a counternarcotics strategy for the region. The issue has also been discussed in the 111th Congress, with hearings on drug trafficking in West Africa and U.S. counterterrorism activities in Africa's Sahel region. President Barack Obama has highlighted the threat posed by drug trafficking in Africa, particularly in West Africa. Sub-Saharan Africa has been involved in the global illicit drug trade for decades. Prior to the mid-2000s, sub-Saharan Africa had a peripheral role in global drug trafficking due to geographic distance from key drug centers. Limited amounts of heroin passed through the region in the 1980s and 1990s, with low demand and supply incentives. Africa's historically peripheral role in global drug trafficking is changing, with hotspots of illegal drug activity emerging in West Africa, East Africa, and Southern Africa. West Africa is becoming a key hub for large-scale cocaine smuggling to Europe, with a rise in record-sized seizures and criminal cases involving foreign and African individuals. According to government and multilateral agencies, Kenya and Ethiopia are significant transshipment hubs for heroin from Afghanistan and Pakistan. East Africa serves as the primary smuggling route for moving heroin from Southwest Asia to Africa for further distribution globally. South Africa has become a source and transit point for synthetic drugs like methamphetamine, destined for both domestic use and foreign markets in Europe and South Asia. Multiple African countries are reportedly used as hubs for the illicit diversion of chemical precursors used in the production of illegal drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Africa has emerged as a major area for the diversion of key methamphetamine precursor chemicals to the Americas and other regions. On December 18, 2009, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) announced the extradition from Ghana and arrest of three West Africans on narco-terrorism charges. The indictees allegedly agreed to transport cocaine for the Colombian drug trafficking and terrorist organization, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), from West Africa to Europe with the assistance and protection of regional affiliates of the Al Qaeda terrorist group. The U.N. Security Council held a special session on drug trafficking as a threat to international peace and security with a focus on Africa, highlighting the linkages between drug smuggling and criminal activities, including the financing of terrorism. In 2009, U.S. government agencies focused on Africa-specific counternarcotics programs and assistance plans, including interagency country assessments and a counternarcotics strategy for the region. Despite no explicit funds allocated for Africa-specific efforts in P.L. 111-117, global programs were likely to support counternarcotics efforts in Africa. Reported cocaine seizures in West Africa declined in the latter half of 2008 and 2009. Cocaine seizures in West Africa declined in the latter half of 2008 and 2009, leading to debates among analysts about the reasons behind the decrease. The discovery of a wrecked Boeing 727 in Mali in November 2009 and reports of increased air-based trafficking suggest that smuggling methods may have changed, but volumes of cocaine trafficked through the region may not be declining. Some reports in 2009 suggested that traffickers may be trying to turn Africa into a drug-processing hub, with a potential threat to U.S. and international interests as Africa's role in global trafficking expands. The rise in drug trafficking in Africa has expanded rapidly, posing new challenges to international counternarcotics efforts and threatening U.S. security, foreign policy, and economic interests in the region. Novel strategies may be needed to track drug flow patterns, dismantle criminal syndicates, and prevent future hotspots from emerging. Concerns have been raised about growing operational linkages in the region. The rise in drug trafficking in Africa has led to concerns about operational linkages between Latin American, West African, and Southwest Asian drug syndicates and European criminal elements. Latin American trafficking syndicates have expanded into the region, with individuals from countries like Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Mexico being arrested in West Africa for cocaine cases. DEA reports that top-tier South American and Mexican DTOs have established operations in Africa since 2007. Latin American persons with suspected drug links have also established residences and businesses in West Africa. The rise in drug trafficking in Africa involves Latin American drug trafficking organizations expanding into the region, particularly in West Africa. This expansion increases their global reach, profits, and organizational linkages, making them more difficult to track and halt. West African criminal groups are transitioning from heroin trafficking to collaborating with Latin American cocaine traffickers. This trend poses a direct threat to U.S. interests due to the potential for increased criminal activities targeting U.S. citizens and interests. Drug trafficking in Africa may facilitate collaboration between drug trafficking organizations and other adversarial entities, such as non-drug-related transnational organized crime networks and U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organizations like FARC and Hezbollah. These groups are involved in drug trafficking and money laundering in regions outside of Africa, with Hezbollah supporters common among West Africa's Lebanese commercial diaspora. Entities like AQIM could earn money directly from the African drug trade and derive indirect benefits, such as financing for non-drug operations and increased ties with other illicit actors. The FARC and Hezbollah have strong links to drug trafficking in West Africa, particularly with cocaine trafficking from Venezuela. Hezbollah also has ties to cocaine traffic in other countries, including the United States. Some analysts believe Hezbollah may be involved in trans-African cocaine traffic due to its reported involvement in other countries and links in Africa. Some analysts suspect Hezbollah's involvement in Africa-related cocaine trafficking, specifically in laundering earnings between Europe and Africa. Limited evidence suggests Hezbollah or AQIM's significant role in drug flows in the region, except possibly in hashish trafficking for AQIM. In late 2009, three West African individuals were extradited from Ghana on narco-terrorism charges, allegedly linked to Al Qaeda. Associates of Al Qaeda allegedly agreed to transport cocaine for representatives of the FARC from Mali through North Africa into Spain with the assistance of Al Qaeda. The indictment accuses them of providing pecuniary benefits to Al Qaeda and AQIM, designated as foreign terrorist organizations. This is the first known use of 21 U.S.C. 960a to prosecute drug trafficking in support of terrorism in sub-Saharan Africa and the first prosecution of Al Qaeda associates for narco-terrorism offenses. These arrests suggest collaboration between drug traffickers and terrorist organizations in the region. In Mali, a burnt Boeing 727 was discovered with possible links to Islamic militants or Tuareg rebels. Evidence of drug-terrorism connections in West Africa is not well-documented, but there are indications of drug trafficker-terrorist links. Cocaine is believed to be exchanged for arms in the region, and the drug-for-arms trade is one of several illicit economies growing in the area, including trafficking in persons. The rise in drug trafficking in Africa could lead to an increase in criminal violence in the region. African authorities have seized small arms from Latin American cocaine trafficking suspects in West Africa. While there have been some drug trade-related shoot-outs and murders in recent years, there has not been a widespread rise in drug-linked criminal violence in Africa. Analysts debate potential drug-related violence in Africa, citing experiences in countries like Mexico. Recent violent incidents in Guinea-Bissau, including the assassination of armed forces chief Na Wai and president Vieira, raise concerns. While no evidence directly links drug trafficking organizations to the assassinations, political factors may have played a role. The use of a remote-controlled bomb in Na Wai's assassination hints at a possible drug link. The assassination of Na Wai in Guinea-Bissau could be linked to drug trafficking, as remote-controlled bombs are commonly used by Mexican and Colombian drug organizations. There are suspicions that both Na Wai and president Vieira had ties to the drug trade. There are reports of a shift in drug trafficking tactics in West Africa, with efforts to turn the region into a drug processing hub. Synthetic drugs have been produced in South Africa and other countries in the region, with authorities dismantling around 30 drug labs annually. In July 2009, Guinean officials discovered precursor chemicals and equipment used in the processing of cocaine, heroin, and ecstasy, suggesting the presence of clandestine drug labs in West Africa. The discovery raised concerns about the region becoming further entrenched in the drug trade, with the International Narcotics Control Board calling for greater awareness of the risk. However, similar reports have been few, indicating that these developments are still in early stages. Growing transnational drug trafficking in Africa may directly jeopardize U.S. foreign and economic policy goals, such as promoting legitimate economic growth and state institution-building. It could also risk peacekeeping and post-conflict reconstruction assistance invested in the region, notably in West Africa. An increase in drug trafficking may lead to higher levels of corruption among law enforcement, judicial, and military officials, posing a significant threat to African states due to their institutional and economic weaknesses. The high volumes and value of drugs being trafficked through Africa pose significant challenges to the already-strained criminal justice systems in the region. Corruption at air and sea ports of entry, along with low official pay, facilitate drug trafficking. State officials in multiple African countries have been implicated in drug-related cases. Latin American drug syndicates have extensive logistical assets that surpass many law enforcement agencies in Africa. The illicit narcotics trade in West Africa is growing substantially, posing a challenge to governments' capacities to combat such activities. UNODC reports indicate that the wholesale value of cocaine transiting the region is starting to rival legal export commodities. Economic trends suggest drug-related effects on economies, such as increased remittances and foreign investments. Analysts fear a marked increase in drug-related criminality in the region. Analysts fear that a significant increase in drug-related criminality in West Africa could deter legal foreign investment in the region, potentially impacting U.S. interests, including energy security. However, it is uncertain how much this would add to existing foreign business reluctance to invest in Africa, as large energy firms are accustomed to operating in challenging environments with high levels of corruption and political instability. High levels of corruption and political instability in Africa could undermine counter-narcotics efforts and pose governance threats, including limitations on civil liberties and sovereignty of states. Analysts have raised concerns about the impact of drug trafficking networks on key institutions like the military in countries like Guinea-Bissau and Guinea. Africa's role in global illicit drug trade has grown in recent years, with a significant rise in multi-ton seizures of cocaine in West Africa between 2005 and 2008. At least 46 metric tons of cocaine bound for Europe via West Africa were seized during this period, marking a substantial increase compared to previous years. The rise of cocaine trafficking through West Africa has led to significant seizures in recent years, indicating changes in trafficking methods, criminal actors involved, and global cocaine movement. The region's susceptibility to trafficking is attributed to structural and institutional characteristics common in African countries. Most illegal cocaine transiting West Africa originates in South America, particularly Colombia and Peru. In 2007, Colombian authorities estimated that around 35% of cocaine from Latin America is trafficked through West Africa to Europe, with most moving by sea. UNODC reports show a significant increase in cocaine seizures in Africa, with at least 33 metric tons seized from 2005 to 2007. Additionally, there has been a rise in drug trafficking indicators, with a notable amount of cocaine seized at European airports originating from the Caribbean and Latin America. In 2007, European cocaine seizures at airports came from the Caribbean, Latin America, and Africa. African cocaine seizures increased significantly from 2000 to 2006, impacting European and African drug supply trends. The exact amount of cocaine trafficked through Africa to Europe is unknown, with varying estimates on total consumption and trafficking volumes. Estimates suggest that between 46 tons and 300 metric tons of cocaine are trafficked through Africa to Europe annually, with varying values and profits for traffickers. In 2006, about 40 tons of cocaine worth $1.8 billion passed through Africa, generating $450 million in wholesale profits. The total amount of cocaine entering Europe may be higher than the 146 tons estimated by UNODC. Estimates indicate that cocaine trafficking to Europe through Africa is higher than the 146 tons estimated by UNODC. There has been a shift in trafficking routes towards West Africa, with cocaine now being transported from Colombia to Brazil, Venezuela, and other destinations before reaching Africa. Cocaine trafficking to Europe through Africa has increased, with routes shifting towards West Africa. Large loads of cocaine are transported by boat and airplanes to countries along the West African coast, including Cape Verde, Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Ghana. Some shipments also reach Southern Africa, particularly South Africa. Cocaine trafficking to Europe through West Africa has increased, with major entry points including Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, France, and Italy. Southern trans-Atlantic routes through Africa are shorter and more secure for trafficking than direct routes to Europe. These routes have seen denser traffic and larger cocaine cargo sizes, with a growing number of large seizures reported. During the past decade, smuggling along Latitude 10\u030a North between northern South America and the West African coast became common, with major routes connecting Latin American countries to Gulf of Guinea countries. There is debate among analysts about the decline in reported seizures and whether it signifies a decrease in trafficking through the region. The decline in reported seizures in the region may be due to a decrease in volumes trafficked, increased counterdrug efforts, lack of data, or successful evasion tactics by drug traffickers. Analysts suggest a shift of smuggling operations to the Sahel and question the effectiveness of past law enforcement operations in the region. There are signs that the Sahel region may be becoming a new hub for drug trafficking, with traffickers using larger aircraft for transporting cocaine from South America to West Africa. At least 10 aircraft have been linked to smuggling activities in the region since 2006. Traffickers in the Sahel region have been using larger aircraft, such as Boeing 727s, to transport cocaine from South America to West Africa since at least the early 1990s. Evidence of this trend includes the discovery of a burnt-out wreckage of a Boeing 727 in Mali in 2009, which was used to carry cocaine. Another incident involved a Panamanian-flagged aircraft carrying drums of cocaine that landed in central Mali in 2010. The use of 727 aircraft may explain the decrease in reported West African cocaine seizures in 2008 and 2009. Traffickers in the Sahel region have been using larger aircraft, such as Boeing 727s, to transport cocaine from South America to West Africa since the early 1990s. The use of these aircraft allows for larger drug shipments to be transported longer distances, avoiding densely populated and policed areas. This strategy reduces the risk of surveillance and interdiction, leading to fewer drug seizure reports in the region. Limited data on cocaine trafficking in Africa suggests that most cocaine enters West Africa due to geographic factors and historical involvement of West Africans in the drug trade. Nigerian criminal syndicates have been dominant in transatlantic cocaine shipments to Africa and Europe since the 1970s. Recent large-scale cocaine trafficking from South America to West Africa has been dominated by Latin Americans, particularly Colombians, and some Europeans. There are uncertainties about the long-term shift in strategies by Latin American traffickers, as indicated by a sharp drop in cocaine seizures in early 2009. Suspected Latin American traffickers have been establishing a presence in Africa. Latin American traffickers have been establishing a long-term presence in West Africa, with some suspected to be involved in cocaine processing labs in Spain and Portugal. They are believed to organize cocaine transport to Europe and collaborate with West African traffickers. Wealthy Latin Americans have been seen investing in the local economy, purchasing elaborate properties and driving expensive vehicles in the region. West African traffickers collaborate with South American counterparts in cocaine redistribution to Europe, often via commercial air flights. They are paid in cocaine for logistics services and buy wholesale consignments from South Americans. Some may sell to freelancing traffickers moving cocaine from West Africa to Europe. Additionally, West Africans are involved in smuggling smaller amounts of cocaine from South America to Africa. The movement of cocaine from South America to Africa and then to Europe is challenging for law enforcement due to limited resources. Drug syndicates use various methods such as commercial air routes, parcel post, private flights, and boats for trafficking. Recent data shows two sub-regional trafficking patterns, with cocaine entering Guinea Bissau and then being transported to Europe through Senegal, Guinea, Gambia, and Mali. Cocaine trafficking from South America to Europe involves using human couriers, known as mules, who transport the drugs on passenger air flights. The trafficking route includes countries like Senegal, Guinea, Gambia, Mali, Ghana, Togo, Benin, and Nigeria. These couriers carry small amounts of cocaine to minimize losses if caught, with at least 1,357 couriers detected on Europe-bound flights between 2004 and 2008. Between 2004 and a portion of 2008, 1,357 couriers were detected on Europe-bound flights from West Africa, each attempting to smuggle up to 4 kilograms of cocaine. Africa is not a major source of illegal heroin production, with limited cultivation in Algeria and the Sinai Peninsula for regional consumption. Approximately 1.24 million Africans used heroin in 2008, accounting for 11% of global users, a 54% increase from 2004. This rise indicates a steady growth in heroin use in Africa, particularly in countries along key trafficking routes. West African crime networks have been involved in international heroin trafficking since the early 1980s, sourcing heroin from Southeast Asia and distributing it in the United States. Nigerian-controlled couriers accounted for 30% of all heroin seized by the U.S. Customs Service in 1994. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration reports that West Africans continue to play a primary role in transporting and distributing heroin in the United States. West African crime networks have been involved in international heroin trafficking since the early 1980s, sourcing heroin from Southeast Asia and distributing it in the United States. Nigerian-controlled couriers accounted for 30% of all heroin seized by the U.S. Customs Service in 1994. In recent years, West African heroin networks have become active in trafficking Southwest Asian heroin from Afghanistan and Pakistan. Nigerian and Ghanaian trafficking organizations are smuggling heroin to various parts of the United States. Today, heroin is smuggled from Southwest Asia through East and West Africa into Europe and North America. Approximately 30 to 35 tons of Afghan heroin are trafficked through Africa, with 25 tons consumed within Africa and 5 to 10 tons transiting through Africa to other final destinations. The primary route for smuggling heroin is from Afghanistan to Pakistan to Africa via air and sea routes. Other transit points for Afghan heroin include Iran, India, Persian Gulf states, and South and Southeast Asian states. Final destinations for heroin in transit through Africa include the United States, Europe, and China. East Africa has trading links with South Asia and the Middle East, making it a key transit zone for heroin trafficking. The transit zone in Africa serves as a key entry point for heroin shipments to the continent, with global flows of cocaine and heroin crossing through the region. Despite limited reported seizure volumes, cannabis production and trafficking are widespread in Africa, with analysts predicting long-term increases in production. The illegal cannabis drug market in Africa is the largest on the continent, with significant production and export to regions like Europe, Asia, and North America. Africa contributes between 22% and 26% of global cannabis production, with major producers including countries like Nigeria, South Africa, and Morocco. Africa is a major source of cannabis production and seizures, with varying acceptance of its use across countries and social groups. Cannabis is widely used for various purposes in some African countries, while in others it is primarily consumed by poor populations and shunned by elites. Detailed country-level data on cannabis production and use trends are often lacking in Africa. In Africa, cannabis production and trade are prevalent, with varying acceptance among different social groups. Law enforcement efforts to combat the cannabis trade are sporadic due to limited resources and focus on more serious crimes. The UNODC views cannabis as a public health concern rather than a national security threat compared to cocaine and heroin. Cannabis resin, used in hashish production, is the second most trafficked drug in Africa, mainly produced in North Africa, particularly in Morocco. Cannabis resin production, the world's largest, is declining globally due to reduced demand in Europe. Traffickers smuggle cannabis and resin from Morocco to Spain, then to other EU countries. Colombian and Moroccan criminal groups collaborate to smuggle cocaine and cannabis into Europe. Analysts predict a decline in smuggling along North African routes. North African routes used for cannabis smuggling may see a decline due to concerns about increased law enforcement attention from the merger of cocaine and cannabis trafficking. Despite this, drug seizures in Niger show smugglers are heavily armed and determined to protect their routes. The illegal synthetic drug market in Africa is relatively small, except for South Africa, which is a destination and source for various drugs like methaqualone, methamphetamine, and MDMA. Africa serves as a production source for various drugs like methaqualone, methamphetamine, and MDMA. The continent is also a transshipment point for precursor chemicals used in illicit drug manufacturing. Amphetamine users in Africa are estimated at 2.3 million, with an increasing demand for methamphetamine and crystal methamphetamine in South Africa. The production of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, key precursor chemicals for methamphetamine, in Africa has been declining since the mid-2000s. In 2006, over 120 metric tons of precursor chemicals were diverted to or through Africa, with countries like Botswana, Burundi, Egypt, and Nigeria being destinations. Seizures of precursor chemicals have decreased since 2006, with aggregate confiscations totaling 75 tons in 2007 and 22 tons in 2008. The INCB reported in February 2010 that Africa may have become a target area for drug traffickers seeking acetic anhydride, a chemical used in heroin production. Africa's low regulation and weak customs capacities make it an attractive transshipment hub for precursor chemicals. Traffickers can easily divert these chemicals from legal to illicit trade, leading to the emergence of new precursor routes in the region. In July 2009, Guinean authorities seized large quantities of solvents, precursor chemicals, and equipment used in the production of controlled drugs. UNODC and INTERPOL found evidence of widespread clandestine drug production in Guinea, indicating a growing drug trade in Africa. Regional consumption of heroin, cocaine, cannabis, and amphetamine-type drugs is on the rise, with South Africa being a key player in the global drug trade. The drug trade in Africa is growing, with South Africa being the largest consumer of illegal drugs on the continent. There is a well-established trade in various illicit drugs, including cannabis, mandrax, methamphetamine, and ecstasy. East Africa is a transit point for heroin from Southwest Asia to Europe, with heroin abuse becoming a problem in Kenya, Mauritius, South Africa, Zambia, and Egypt. The INCB has raised concerns about the lack of medical facilities for drug treatment and rehabilitation in Africa. Nigerian criminal organizations were key players in smuggling heroin internationally in the 1980s and 1990s. West Africa has become a major hub for international drug trafficking, especially for cocaine being trafficked to Europe. This shift is due to changes in push factors such as increased U.S. anti-drug efforts and interdiction targeting cocaine routes. Interdiction efforts targeting northern trans-Atlantic cocaine routes have shifted smuggling towards Africa's western coast, specifically to Cape Verde, the Canary Islands, and the Iberian peninsula. Push factors include counterdrug pressure in source countries, increased U.S. drug interdiction in transit zones, and expanded cocaine exports via Venezuela and Brazil. Mexican government pressure on trafficking organizations is also a factor. Mexican trafficking organizations control drug traffic through Mexico into the US, leading South American groups to seek new markets. Factors driving cocaine transit through West Africa include the declining US dollar, increased European cocaine use, and high Euro value. West Africa is attractive due to rising European demand and stable cocaine prices, making it a lucrative transit route. Traffickers are attracted to West Africa due to its proximity to South America and Europe, lack of effective drug interdiction in countries like Venezuela and Brazil, regional institutional weaknesses, and high levels of corruption, poverty, and unemployment in the sub-region. This makes it an appealing route for drug trafficking due to lower risks of apprehension by law enforcement. Large-scale traffickers in West Africa are well-positioned due to high poverty and unemployment rates, making it easier to recruit African accomplices. Latin American traffickers can leverage experienced West African drug traffickers for drug transit and connect with criminals for related illicit activities. This has led to a rise in trafficking in recent years in Guinea-Bissau. The rise in trafficking in Guinea-Bissau is attributed to geographic factors and involvement of state security personnel, particularly within the military. Reports indicate a lack of capacity to counter trafficking due to underfunded national police and drug control agency. The drug control agency and police in Guinea-Bissau lack resources, including vehicles, fuel, and basic equipment like phones and computers. Police officers have low salaries, few ships for patrolling, and inadequate training in shooting and swimming. The judiciary is under-resourced, leading to a lack of prison facilities. The new president has promised to address drug trafficking issues in the country. Guinea-Bissau and Guinea are key cocaine transshipment points in West Africa. Investigations reveal involvement of top officials in drug trafficking. Anti-drug police units in both countries lack resources and operational capabilities. West African crime groups operate internationally in over 80 countries. West African crime groups operate in over 80 countries, engaging in heroin and cocaine trafficking, financial fraud, and other criminal activities. They target the United States and the United Kingdom, with a reputation for aggressive international expansion. Financial crimes, including 419 fraud schemes, cost the US up to $2 billion annually. These groups have small cells in strategic locations worldwide for drug trafficking and money laundering. West African crime groups are known for drug trafficking through various Asian countries using low-level traffickers. They often use decoy couriers to distract law enforcement and increase the chances of successful smuggling. West African crime groups recruit \"low profile\" couriers like Caucasians, women with children, the elderly, or the disabled to smuggle contraband. Their organizational structure is described as highly fluid and adaptable, with small, compartmentalized cells ranging from 2 to 10 members. Members are limited in access to information and communicate mostly in African indigenous languages. West African crime groups operate on a project-by-project basis, communicate in African indigenous languages, and do not have a permanent leader. Loyalty to a single crime boss is not required, and members are motivated by profit. This contrasts with traditional organized crime groups like the Italian mafia and Chinese triads, which are hierarchically structured with senior leaders making decisions. Membership in West African groups is not based on kinship or ethnicity. West African crime groups operate on a task-based system, specializing in various criminal activities. They are more willing to cooperate with each other for mutual profit, unlike traditional organized crime groups. This networked structure makes them less vulnerable to law enforcement tactics used against other criminal organizations. U.S. policy responses to drug trafficking in Africa are still developing, with many African countries lacking effective law enforcement and judicial systems. U.S. and European assistance has helped African governments improve monitoring and detection of drug trafficking. The challenge for policymakers is to address both short-term interdiction efforts and long-term law enforcement capacity weaknesses in the region. Multiple U.S. government agencies are working on strategies to combat drug trafficking in Africa. Several U.S. government agencies are increasing resources for anti-drug efforts in Africa, including establishing new DEA offices in Ghana and potentially other countries in the region. State Department counternarcotics assistance in Africa has been gradually expanding, with funding rising from $0.5 million in FY2006 to $1.6 million in FY2009. The Obama Administration requested $7.5 million for Africa in FY2010, and the White House ONDCP requested $13.2 million for West Africa counternarcotics programs in FY2011. The State Department is working to enhance law enforcement skills and justice sector capabilities in Africa to prosecute drug traffickers. Funding for counternarcotics efforts in Africa is relatively small compared to other regions, but there is increasing policy attention and international cooperation in combating the illegal drug trade in West Africa. Despite the lack of a public interagency counternarcotics strategy specifically for Africa, internal U.S. government agency documents outline specific plans and missions. The State Department's International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs Bureau (INL) focuses on assisting African countries in targeting narcotics traffickers. INL discourages providing interdiction equipment for counternarcotics assistance and conducts country assessments in West Africa with other U.S. government agencies. The U.S. government is focusing on counternarcotics in Africa, with seven African countries included in the 2009 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report. West Africa is identified as a hub for cocaine trafficking, and new African country narratives have been added to the report. The U.S. government is focusing on counternarcotics in Africa, with a strategy developed for West Africa and the Maghreb region. The Department of Defense (DOD) is required to submit a comprehensive strategy to Congress by June 30, 2009, outlining U.S. counternarcotics policy in Africa, including DOD's roles and missions in support of AFRICOM. The strategy involves training, equipping, and supporting partner nation law enforcement and military units for counternarcotics efforts. The U.S. government is focusing on counternarcotics in Africa, with a strategy developed for West Africa and the Maghreb region. DOD's primary counternarcotics missions in the region include detecting and monitoring drug trafficking, sharing information with relevant enforcement officials, and building foreign counternarcotics capacity. INL bureau hosted an interagency meeting attended by representatives from State Department, DEA, DOD, Treasury, DHS, and NSC to discuss assistance in Africa and coordinate a comprehensive approach to counternarcotics. The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) oversees U.S. drug control policy, including international counternarcotics efforts in Africa. Key agencies involved in counternarcotics efforts in Africa are the U.S. Department of State, the Department of Defense (DOD), and the DEA. The State Department coordinates foreign assistance for combating illicit narcotics, DOD detects and monitors drug transit, and the DEA leads law enforcement investigations on international drug production and trafficking. The Department of Homeland Security and the Treasury Department are involved in combating drug-related maritime security and financial crimes. The United States has increased cooperation with European partners to counter drug trafficking in Africa through formal mechanisms like the U.S.-EU Drug Troika talks and sharing intelligence with the European Maritime Analysis and Operation Center\u2013Narcotics in Lisbon, Portugal. The United States and the European Union commit to counternarcotics cooperation in West Africa. The State Department and DOD provide foreign assistance for counternarcotics efforts in the region, including training African law enforcement officials at the International Law Enforcement Academy in Botswana. The Obama Administration's FY2010 budget request included $7.5 million in counterdrug foreign aid to seven African countries, up from the Bush Administration's FY2009 budget request. DOD provides counternarcotics training assistance under Section 1004 and Section 1033 authorities to improve capacities in foreign countries. In FY2009, DOD was authorized to provide counternarcotics assistance to Guinea-Bissau and Senegal under Section 1033 of the NDAA. Approximately $19.3 million was allocated for counternarcotics aid in Africa, with Nigeria being a leading recipient. In FY2009, DOD provided counternarcotics assistance to African countries, with Nigeria, Mauritania, Liberia, Cameroon, and Ghana being leading recipients. DOD's counternarcotics strategy in AFRICOM's area of responsibility prioritizes capacity building efforts in West Africa, North Africa, East Africa, South Africa, and Central Africa. Maritime security in Africa is a key focus, particularly in West Africa due to the lack of credible maritime security capacity. The lack of credible maritime security capacity in West Africa has allowed drug trafficking and criminal activities to thrive. To address this, various DOD elements, U.S. Coast Guard, and civilian agencies are involved in bilateral and multilateral maritime security cooperation activities in the region. The Africa Partnership Station (APS) initiative aims to increase the capacity of West and Central African coastal states in the Gulf of Guinea through joint exercises, trainings, and port visits. The U.S. Navy has increased its patrol presence off West Africa since 2008. Projects include maritime security assistance, infrastructure construction, and training for African navies. DOD is involved in constructing boat and refueling facilities, enhancing port and customs security, and detecting illicit drugs flow. AFRICOM includes counternarcotics efforts as part of its activities. DOD's Joint Interagency Task Force-South (JIATF-South) coordinates with AFRICOM and European agencies on drug interdiction operations. Cooperation with European Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre\u2014Narcotics (MAOC-N) in Portugal is a focus. DOD is helping establish an \"Information Fusion Center\" in Cape Verde for sharing drug-related intelligence. DEA, with DOD/AFRICOM funding, aims to establish U.S.-vetted African police units for counternarcotics operations in Africa. The DEA aims to establish vetted African police units for counternarcotics operations in Africa, starting in Ghana. Personnel will undergo extra training and background checks to improve coordination with host nations and minimize corruption risks. DEA also participates in drug interdiction and law enforcement operations in Africa. The DEA, in collaboration with European and African law enforcement agencies, has implemented a program to enhance understanding of narcotics trafficking in West Africa and promote intelligence sharing. Recent activities include the extradition of Colombians from Sierra Leone for drug smuggling in 2009. Another case involved the expulsion of a Colombian drug cell head from Togo to face U.S. drug charges in 2009. The DEA, in collaboration with international law enforcement agencies, uses legal tools like 21 U.S.C. 959 and 21 U.S.C. 960a to investigate and prosecute drug offenses with ties to the U.S. The Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act combats money laundering from drug proceeds. The Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act, passed in 1999, allows the President to target and block financial criminal proceeds of \"Specially Designated Narcotics Trafficker Kingpins.\" The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control implements the program. Since 2000, 70 SDNTKs have been identified, with only two being Nigerians. Multiple African and donor governments are involved in combating drug trafficking in Africa. While there is a consensus on the growing issue of drug trafficking in Africa, there is a lack of agreement on how to address the challenges it poses. Limited resources and political will hinder efforts to combat the illegal drug trade. Some African policymakers do not prioritize drug trafficking due to funding constraints. However, there is increasing support among African governments to address the issue at both national and international levels. Some West African countries have been commended for their efforts in combating drug trafficking. Several African countries, including Cape Verde, Senegal, Ghana, and Sierra Leone, have been praised by U.S. officials for their effective law enforcement responses to drug trafficking and their cooperation with international counternarcotics efforts. Forty-five out of 53 African countries have signed all three U.N. drug control conventions. The U.N. Security Council held a special session on drug trafficking in Africa in December 2009, highlighting the security risks posed by drug trafficking in the region. Key multilateral, European, and African country groupings are working to combat drug trafficking in Africa, with the UNODC playing a significant role. UNODC, established in 1997, assists Member States in fighting illegal drugs, transnational crime, and terrorism. It publishes the World Drug Report annually and collects data on drug-related activities in Africa through its field offices in Egypt, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal, and South Africa. These offices monitor drug trafficking trends and support regional efforts to combat criminal activities. The UNODC assists Member States in combating drug trafficking and other criminal activities in Africa by providing mentoring, training, and support for counternarcotics efforts. It also supports Data for Africa to improve data reliability on crime and drug trends. The UN Office for West Africa focuses on cross-border illicit activities and raises awareness of the challenges posed by drug trafficking in the region. The African Union and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) are regional multilateral groupings that address drug trafficking through various initiatives and cooperation with organizations like the UNODC. The AU has a Plan of Action on Drug Control and Crime Prevention, while ECOWAS promotes regional economic integration and security cooperation, playing a role in combating drug trafficking in West Africa. ECOWAS, in collaboration with UNODC and UNOWA, adopted a draft Political Declaration on combating drug trafficking in West Africa. They also established a regional action plan and launched the West Africa Coast Initiative with UN agencies and INTERPOL to establish transnational crime units in several countries. Additionally, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and FATF-Style Regional Bodies in Africa play a role in setting international standards for legislative measures. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) sets international standards to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. South Africa is the only African member of FATF, while two African FSRBs support its standards. The International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) monitors U.N. drug control treaties and conducted Operation Crystal Flow in Africa to prevent illicit trade in precursor chemicals. Africa serves as a transshipment point for such chemicals. INTERPOL, established in 1923, assists member states in counternarcotics efforts by identifying drug trafficking trends and criminal organizations. In Africa, Project COCAF was launched in 2006 to target emerging drug trafficking routes, particularly cocaine shipments. INTERPOL targets emerging drug trafficking routes, focusing on cocaine shipments from West Africa. They also lead Project PROTEUS to combat cocaine trafficking from South America through Africa to Europe, and Project DRUM to address precursor chemical diversion in Africa. INTERPOL is involved in capacity building in Africa through OASIS Africa and deploys Response Teams for investigative aid. The EU has committed to greater counternarcotics cooperation with Africa in the Joint EU-Africa Strategy. The European Commission and European countries provide counternarcotics assistance to African countries through various initiatives and institutions like the UNODC. Efforts include the Maritime Analysis and Operations Center\u2014Narcotics (MAOC-N) in Portugal and the Mediterranean Anti-Drug Coordination Center (CeCLAD-M) in France. These initiatives support maritime surveillance and intelligence coordination for drug trafficking interdiction operations between Africa and Europe. ECOWAS and the EU Ministerial Troika also collaborate on counternarcotics efforts. The EU and European countries provide counternarcotics assistance to African countries through various initiatives. The EU plans to allocate funds for drug interdiction and institutional development in law enforcement and judicial sectors. Congress plays a role in U.S. international drug control policy by appropriating funds, conducting oversight activities, and legislating changes to counterdrug policies. Recent activities include the passage of P.L. 110-417 requiring a DOD counternarcotics strategy for Africa and a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on drug trafficking in West Africa. During a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on drug trafficking in West Africa, concerns were raised about the need for further policy efforts to combat rising drug trafficking in Africa. The possible connection between cocaine trafficking and terrorism was also highlighted. Congress may address increasing executive branch prioritization of counternarcotics assistance efforts in Africa, with key issues including the lack of basic crime statistics and drug-related health indicators in formulating policy solutions. Data on drug-related statistics and law enforcement evaluations in Africa are often unreliable or non-existent. There is a lack of actionable intelligence data in the region, with many drug seizures being detected through foreign tips or accidental circumstances. This hinders accurate estimates of drug trafficking trends and patterns in Africa. Estimates of cocaine trafficking through Africa vary widely due to a lack of data on trends and patterns. Better intelligence and data collection are needed to accurately project future trafficking-related trends and allocate resources effectively. Efforts to increase law enforcement resources for detecting and monitoring drug flows in Africa may face challenges due to competing priorities in other regions. Without accurate information on the drug threat in Africa, policymakers may struggle to effectively address the problem, including the involvement of criminal organizations targeted by the United States. Many African countries lack effective law enforcement capabilities. Many African countries lack effective law enforcement agencies and resources to combat drug trafficking. Recommendations include scaling up counternarcotics capacity-building assistance programs in Africa, but there are differing opinions on the best approach. Some suggest immediate interdiction operations and training programs, while others argue for comprehensive capacity-building to address long-term trends. Efforts to curtail drug trafficking in Africa may be ineffective without the capacity for fair trials, prosecuting high-profile defendants, controlling seized drugs, enforcing prison sentences, and deterring police corruption. Capacity-building assistance would involve law enforcement, rule of law, and government infrastructure training, as well as facility upgrades and operational equipment provision. Policy makers must prioritize short-term interventions and long-term development efforts to address these challenges. In a budgetary context with limited federal resources, decision makers must consider the most effective mix of resources for short-term interventions and long-term capacity-building efforts in counternarcotics assistance for Africa. Some question the need for substantial U.S. aid, suggesting that European countries should provide more assistance. Debate also focuses on the adequacy of current European counterdrug efforts in Africa and whether they plan to increase their presence. The U.S. counterdrug presence in Africa is expanding with increased resources and personnel, focusing on short-term and long-term policy objectives. Cooperation with multilateral and U.N. agencies, European governments, and the EU is emphasized. Funding for counterdrug efforts has significantly increased from FY2006 to FY2009, with assistance now targeting six African recipient countries. The U.S. counterdrug presence in Africa is expanding with increased resources and personnel. DEA is scaling up its presence by opening new offices in Accra, Ghana, and plans to expand further in other parts of Africa. Despite recent and prospective increases, counternarcotics efforts in Africa remain relatively small compared to other regions. The State Department's counternarcotics aid budget to Africa is only 0.49% of its total global assistance, with limited personnel and resources dedicated to combating drug trafficking in the region. Roles and responsibilities of U.S. government agencies in Africa are not clearly defined, with the INL Bureau taking the lead on counterdrug efforts through country assessments. The INL Bureau leads counterdrug efforts in Africa through country assessments. As U.S. assistance grows, Congress may need to clarify agency roles and coordination, including balancing civilian and military participation. Questions about agency involvement and interagency coordination may arise, such as the need for a formal coordination body to ensure policy consistency and prevent program overlap. If policy makers decide on a coordinating body for counterdrug efforts in Africa, questions arise about agency participation, leadership, and meeting levels. The role of the U.S. military, specifically AFRICOM, and the allocation of counternarcotics assistance between DOD and the State Department are also key considerations. Some question the growing role of DOD in counternarcotics activities, including AFRICOM's potential involvement. Proponents argue that the military's resources and skills are vital for combating drug trafficking, while opponents believe counternarcotics assistance should be led by law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Some argue that counternarcotics foreign assistance should be led by law enforcement and intelligence agencies, not the military, to avoid legal and human rights issues."
