The Congress finds that tampons, used by millions of women in the US, contain dioxins, a probable carcinogen from chlorine-bleaching processes in paper product manufacturing. Most manufacturers currently use processes that produce dioxin, despite alternatives available. The Food and Drug Administration has not adequately investigated the danger of dioxin in tampons, which can accumulate in women's bodies over 60 years of use. The safety of feminine hygiene products relies on manufacturer-provided data. The FDA requires monitoring of dioxin levels in tampons, but this information is not easily accessible to the public. Conflicting studies exist on the link between dioxin exposure and endometriosis risks. High dioxin exposure may lead to noncancer effects like immune suppression, increased pelvic inflammatory disease risk, reduced fertility, and interference with fetal and childhood development. Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) has been linked to tampon use due to their absorbency. TSS is a rare bacterial illness that mainly affects menstruating women, causing fatalities and nonfatal cases. The FDA mandated tampons to be labeled with absorbency standards in response to a 1988 lawsuit. Independent research has shown that synthetic fiber additives in tampons amplify toxin production, associated with toxic shock syndrome. SEC. 102. National Institutes of Health to conduct research on dioxin in relation to women's health. New section added to the Public Health Service Act for projects focusing on women's health. The Director of NIH and the Office will conduct research on the risks of dioxin, synthetic fibers, and additives in feminine hygiene products on women's health, including cervical cancer, endometriosis, infertility, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, immune system deficiencies, pelvic inflammatory disease, toxic shock syndrome, and potential risks to children of women who used these products during or before pregnancies. The research conducted by the Director of NIH and the Office focuses on the risks of dioxin, synthetic fibers, and additives in feminine hygiene products on women's health, including various health issues. This research includes confirming data submitted by manufacturers of such products. Reports on the research results will be periodically submitted to relevant authorities and made available to the public. Reports on research results regarding the risks of dioxin, synthetic fibers, and additives in feminine hygiene products will be made available to the public through established data systems. TITLE II--COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS OF DATA ON TOXIC SHOCK SYNDROME\n\nSEC. 201. FINDINGS. The Congress finds that toxic shock syndrome is a significant concern, with approximately 50% of cases related to tampon use. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warns that women may be at increased risk due to a false sense of security. Each year, over 1,300 individuals are affected by the syndrome, with a higher risk among women aged 12-44 using tampons or barrier contraceptives. Epidemiological data on toxic shock syndrome cases in the United States are not systematically collected. The CDC and States should work together to collect and analyze data on toxic shock syndrome cases in the United States. This will increase awareness in the medical community and improve understanding of the syndrome's causes. SEC. 317T. COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS OF DATA ON TOXIC SHOCK SYNDROME. The Secretary will collect and analyze data on toxic shock syndrome, including its causes, to determine national incidence and prevalence. The program may involve cooperation with States and local health departments, with authorized appropriations for fiscal years 2006 through 2010."
