    "title": "SB 8",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature of California acknowledges the rising inequality in the state despite its progressive tax system. They propose a new governance philosophy focusing on modernizing the tax system and investing in infrastructure and education for upward mobility. Building and sustaining a middle class in California requires new jobs with good wages, particularly in small businesses like plumbing contractors, auto repair shops, and restaurants. These businesses account for over 90 percent of the state's businesses and well over a third of all jobs. California's economy has shifted to one based on information and services, which now make up 80 percent of all economic activities. To ensure a promising future, the tax system should be based on the real economy of the 21st century and invest in strengthening upward mobility for all residents. California of the 1950s and 1960s invested in infrastructure and education, leading to growth in agriculture, aerospace, and technology. This transformed the state into the fifth largest economy in the world, creating middle-class jobs and opportunities for its residents. The thriving businesses in California created middle-class jobs, allowing residents to improve their standard of living. California's economy thrived in the late 1970s, but its focus on the future wavered. State and local finances became intertwined, leading to a lack of investments in infrastructure. Today, 55% of local streets need repair, and Los Angeles' water infrastructure is mostly made up of aging cast-iron pipes. More funding is needed to meet the state's demands. California's financial commitment to education has decreased, with Average Daily Attendance growing minimally between 2007 and 2011. By 2011, the state ranked 43rd in per pupil spending, with a $2,580 gap from the national average, the largest in 40 years. California's higher education system is a vital economic engine, with the University of California contributing $33 billion annually and the California State University generating an additional $17 billion. Despite its value, accessibility has declined, with fees increasing significantly over the past 20 years. Community colleges also saw a rise in fees, leading to a decline in enrollment. The lack of investment in infrastructure and education has fueled income inequality in California, with the richest 20% seeing a 74.6% income increase since 1970. The Upward Mobility Act aims to boost funding by $10 billion for programs to support residents and businesses in the global economy. The Upward Mobility Act aims to boost funding by $5 billion for education in California. $3 billion would go to K-14 education, while $2 billion would be allocated to the University of California and the California State University. This investment is crucial for rebuilding the education system and promoting upward mobility for residents. Investing $3 billion in local governments to support realignment burdens and provide additional funding for public safety, parks, libraries, and local development. Allocating $2 billion for a new earned income tax credit for low-income families to offset the burden of the proposed sales and use tax on services. The measure aims to enhance the state's business climate, create jobs, and incentivize entrepreneurship by evaluating the corporate income tax and linking changes to a more reasonable minimum wage. This funding would benefit school districts, colleges, and local governments for essential long-term investments. The Upward Mobility Act aims to fund programs for residents' upward mobility and to modernize California's tax code to make businesses more competitive. California's tax system has not kept up with the shift from an agriculture and manufacturing to a services-based economy, leading to a decrease in Sales and Use Tax revenues and an increase in Personal Income Tax revenues over the past 60 years. California's General Fund tax collections heavily rely on top earners' earnings, causing significant revenue fluctuations. State revenues in California experienced significant fluctuations from the 1950s through the early 21st century, with a 20 percent increase in a single year followed by a sharp decline during the Great Recession. This led to cuts in essential services like healthcare and education, impacting low-income families. Relying on wealthy taxpayers for revenue is seen as outdated and risky, potentially driving high earners out of the state and deepening revenue shortfalls. The economy in California has shifted towards services, with sales of taxable goods decreasing significantly since 1966. Currently, services make up 80 percent of the economy. Expanding the Sales and Use Tax to cover services is seen as necessary to address inequities in the tax code. The Upward Mobility Act aims to make changes to the tax system to address these issues. The Upward Mobility Act proposes broad changes to the tax code, including imposing a sales tax on services to increase revenues. Local jurisdictions cannot raise sales tax on services, and funds collected by the state will be controlled by local government. Health care and education services are exempt, and small businesses with under $100,000 in sales are also exempt. The Act aims to enhance the state's business climate and promote entrepreneurship by evaluating the corporate income tax.

The Act aims to enhance the state's business climate and promote entrepreneurship by evaluating the corporate income tax. Additionally, the measure examines the impacts of lowering and simplifying the personal income tax rates, with a goal to reduce rates for low- and middle-class households while balancing fairness and competitiveness for top earners. The Upward Mobility Act aims to ensure fiscal responsibility by phasing in revenue reduction provisions only when new revenues can replace changes to personal and corporate taxes. It seeks to provide long-term ways to support California residents as Proposition 30 revenues expire, creating opportunities for businesses and residents while updating the state's tax code for the 21st-century economy. CHAPTER 3.8 of the Upward Mobility Act imposes taxes on retailers selling services at retail in California, with a specified rate on gross receipts. Additionally, an excise tax is imposed on the receipt of service benefits in the state at a specified rate on the sales price of services."
