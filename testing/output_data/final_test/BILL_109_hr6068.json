    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"North Bay Water Reuse Program Act of 2006\" and includes definitions for key terms. The Act defines key terms such as \"eligible entity,\" \"Secretary,\" \"State,\" and \"water reclamation and reuse project\" in the context of the North Bay Water Reuse Program in California. Eligible entities are member agencies of the North Bay Water Reuse Authority in specific counties within the North San Pablo Bay watershed. The Secretary refers to the Secretary of the Interior. The Act includes provisions for wastewater treatment, water reclamation, groundwater protection, surface water augmentation, and related improvements. The North Bay Water Reuse Program is established under Section 3 of the Act, focusing on water reclamation and related improvements. The Secretary may offer cooperative agreements for water reclamation projects with eligible entities. Coordination with other federal agencies is required, and agreements must specify responsibilities for cost-sharing. The Secretary offers cooperative agreements for water reclamation projects with eligible entities, ensuring cost-share requirements are met, completing needs assessments, planning, final design, environmental compliance, construction of facilities, and contract administration. The cooperative agreement for water reclamation projects requires two phases: the first phase involves planning, designing, and constructing the main treatment and conveyance system, while the second phase focuses on the sub-regional distribution systems. Financial assistance may be provided by the Secretary. The Secretary may provide financial and technical assistance to eligible entities for water reclamation and reuse projects. The Federal share of the total project cost should not exceed 25%, and the non-Federal share can be in the form of in-kind services. The eligible entity may receive in-kind services for water reclamation and reuse projects, including costs for planning, design, and construction, as well as the fair-market value of land used for project facilities. The entity is responsible for annual operation, maintenance, and replacement costs. The eligible entity, in consultation with the Secretary, must develop an operation, maintenance, and replacement plan for the water reclamation and reuse project. The Act does not affect State water law or interstate compacts related to water allocation, nor does it grant non-Federal entities the right to water resources. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the Federal share of the project's total cost. The Act authorizes appropriations for the Federal share of water reclamation and reuse projects, up to 25% of the total cost or $25,000,000, whichever is less, to remain available until expended."
