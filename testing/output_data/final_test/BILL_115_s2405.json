    "content": "The Act is titled \"Clarifying Commercial Real Estate Loans\" and amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to include new capital requirements for certain acquisition, development, or construction loans. The appropriate Federal banking agencies may subject a depository institution to higher capital standards for high volatility commercial real estate (HVCRE) exposures if they are HVCRE ADC loans, defined as credit facilities secured by land or improved real property primarily financing such projects. The HVCRE ADC loans are credit facilities that finance the acquisition, development, or construction of income-producing real property and rely on future income for repayment. They do not include financing for one- to four-family residential properties or properties that qualify as such. The curr_chunk discusses the types of investments that qualify for community development, including real property and agricultural land. It also mentions the acquisition or refinance of income-producing real property secured by a mortgage, as well as improvements to existing income-producing real property. The curr_chunk discusses commercial real property projects that qualify for financing, with specific criteria such as loan-to-value ratio and borrower's capital contribution. The borrower must contribute cash, assets, development expenses, or real property before receiving funds from the depository institution for a commercial real property project. The depository institution reclassified certain loans as Non-HVCRE ADC loans, excluding those made before January 1, 2015, and credit facilities reclassified under subsection (d). The value of real property contributed by a borrower is based on its appraised value. Reclassification as a Non-HVCRE ADC loan is determined by specific criteria. Upon completion of real property development or construction financed by a credit facility, and when cash flow from the property can support debt service and expenses to the satisfaction of the depository institution, the credit facility may be reclassified as a Non-HVCRE ADC loan."
