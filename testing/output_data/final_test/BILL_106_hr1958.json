Fort Presque Isle was a frontier outpost on Garrison Hill in Erie, Pennsylvania, with American installations in 1795 and 1796 and during the War of 1812. General Anthony Wayne, a Revolutionary War hero under General George Washington, arrived in the area in 1786. He was known as \"Mad\" for his leadership and bravery, not recklessness. The original blockhouse of Fort Presque Isle was built in 1795 by 200 Federal troops under Captain John Grubb. General Wayne died at the fort in 1796 and was buried there. The blockhouse burned in 1852, and a new structure was built in 1880 as a memorial. The reconstructed blockhouse at Fort Presque Isle was built in 1880 as a memorial to General Wayne.
