The \"Preserving Patient Access to Physicians Act of 2005\" reforms the Medicare physician payment update system by eliminating the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) system and implementing updates to the single conversion factor for 2006 and beyond. The update for 2006 must be at least 2.7 percent, and for years starting in 2007, the update is based on the percentage change in the input price index. The Secretary establishes an input price index reflecting weighted-average input prices for physicians' services, based on the mix of goods and services in the Medicare economic index. The Secretary establishes an input price index for physicians' services based on weighted-average input prices, excluding changes in costs from factors like productivity. An annual estimate of the index change is made, along with a productivity adjustment factor published before each year. The productivity adjustment factor is determined by the Secretary based on growth in multifactor productivity in the national economy, considering both labor and nonlabor factors. This adjustment is calculated using a multi-year moving average of productivity data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Amendments are made to Section 1848 of the Act to adjust payment updates for physicians' services before 2001.
