    "content": "The \"Personal Philanthropy Account Act of 2005\" is a new section added to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, allowing for personal philanthropy accounts for individuals. The \"Personal Philanthropy Account Act of 2005\" allows individuals to deduct cash contributions to a personal philanthropy account, which is a trust created for charitable purposes with specific requirements. The trustee of a personal philanthropy account must be a bank, community foundation, or qualified person. Trust assets cannot be invested in life insurance contracts and should not be commingled with other property except in a common trust fund. No account can be considered a personal philanthropy account unless there are qualified default charitable organization designations in effect. This designation allows the account holder to specify an organization to receive the remaining account assets as a philanthropy payment upon their death if no other distribution instructions are provided. The distribution of assets from a personal philanthropy account requires a qualified default charitable organization designation by the trustee. Minimum distribution requirements must be met for the account to be considered as such. The minimum distribution requirement for a taxable year is met if the aggregate distributions are at least 5 percent of the account balance from the previous year. An exception applies to accounts with a balance below $10,000. No deduction is allowed under this section for dependents. For tax purposes, a community foundation is a non-sectarian organization that aims to create permanent charitable funds for the benefit of a specific geographic area. It must be a 501(c)(3) organization, exempt from tax under 501(a), and not a private foundation. A personal philanthropy account must not be a private foundation and should not be controlled by disqualified persons. Distributions from the account are taxable under section 72, except for qualified philanthropy payments. For the purposes of this section, a qualified philanthropy payment is a distribution from a personal philanthropy account made within 30 days of receiving a certification for a specified purpose under section 170(c). Trustees failing to meet the 30-day requirement may face disqualification. The certification required is by an organization. The subparagraph certifies that an organization is tax-exempt under section 501(c)(3) and not a personal philanthropy account. No deductions are allowed for amounts excluded from gross income under this subparagraph. The deduction allowable under certain sections for the taxable year shall be reduced by the amount excluded from gross income. Section 170(d) does not apply to excluded amounts. Rollover contributions are exempt from certain rules if transferred within 60 days. The tax treatment of account distributions allows for rollover contributions within 60 days to another personal philanthropy account. This provision does not apply to payments or distributions made within a 12-month period or to amounts distributed to heirs within 60 days. The tax treatment of a personal philanthropy account exempts it from taxation but is subject to taxes on unrelated business income. Rules for account terminations apply, and trustees can be disqualified for disbursing over 10% to non-qualifying organizations. The trustee of a personal philanthropy account must report contributions, distributions, and other details to the Secretary and the account holder. A deduction is allowed for personal philanthropy accounts, regardless of itemizing other deductions. Employer contributions to these accounts are excluded from taxation. Accounts.-- Part III of subchapter B of chapter 1 of the Code is amended to include a new section after section 139A. \"SEC. 139B. CONTRIBUTIONS BY EMPLOYER TO PERSONAL PHILANTHROPY ACCOUNTS.\" The section discusses the exclusion of employer contributions to an employee's personal philanthropy account from gross income. The exclusion amount is limited to the employee's wages, salaries, tips, and other compensation. For self-employed individuals, the exclusion amount is limited to earned income. The limitations on exclusion of employer contributions to a personal philanthropy account do not apply to self-employed individuals' earned income.
