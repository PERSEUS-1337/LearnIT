The Bureau of the Census will publish survey methods, response rates, and completion extent. Tables and graphs will be produced by the Bureau of the Census.

The State administering agency must annually report household benefits to the Federal administering agency by social security number. The Bureau of the Census will compare income levels of survey respondents to Consumer Expenditure Survey data. The Comptroller General of the United States will submit a report to Congress comparing income measures in the Act to those used by the Bureau of the Census for the supplemental poverty measure."
