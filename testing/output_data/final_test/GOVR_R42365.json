    "content": "Since 1945, the ages of Members of Congress and the U.S. population have slowly increased. Data tables show median ages of Representatives and Senators in Congresses, with fluctuations in age between the 79th and 98th Congresses. The median age of Representatives in the 113th Congress was 57.5 years, while the Senate's median age reached a low of 51.7 years in the 97th Congress. In the 113th Congress, the median age of Senators was 61.7 years, slightly higher than the previous two Congresses. The significant age difference between the U.S. population and Representatives and Senators is due to the age restrictions for holding office in Congress. Census data includes all U.S. residents of any age, while Members of Congress must be at least 25 years old for the House and 30 years old for the Senate. Median ages of Members of Congress are higher than the U.S. population due to the age restrictions for office. The 113th Congress has the highest number of female Representatives and Senators ever, but still below the general population. The first female to serve in the House was Jeanette Rankin in the 65th Congress. Women have served in the House in every Congress since then. In the Senate, the first female to serve was Rebecca Latimer Felton of Georgia, appointed in 1922 for 24 hours. Hattie Caraway of Arkansas became the first elected female Senator in 1932. Since then, at least one female Senator has served in each Congress. The total population is 50.7% female and 49.3% male, with more females than males in the US since the 1950 census. Since the 1950 census, there have been more females than males in the United States. The percentage of female Representatives has varied over the years, with a significant increase in the 103rd Congress. Women in the Senate reached 20% representation in the 113th Congress. Since 1945, Representatives and Senators in Congress have had diverse occupational backgrounds, including law, public service, astronauts, entertainers, teachers, and various trades. The CQ Press data categorizes these occupations into 20 subcategories, such as acting/entertainer, business, journalism, law, public service/politics, and real estate. This data provides a simple way to summarize the professional experiences of Members in Congress. The CQ Press data categorizes the diverse occupational backgrounds of Representatives and Senators in Congress into 20 subcategories. However, the data may leave some questions unanswered regarding the specificity of the occupations listed and the details of the professional experiences of Members in Congress. The CQ Press data categorizes the diverse occupational backgrounds of Representatives and Senators in Congress into 20 subcategories, but the extent of public service backgrounds may be understated. The data provide an overview of Member occupations, but may not reflect all occupations pursued prior to congressional service. Representatives have varied occupational backgrounds, with some categories reflecting pre-determined titles and others customized by Members or their staffs. In Congress, the most commonly reported occupational categories include agriculture, business or banking, congressional aide, education, and law. Law was the predominant profession among House Members from the 79th to the 92nd Congresses, with approximately 40% of Representatives having a legal background. However, the proportion of House Members with legal experience declined after the 102nd Congress, although law remained the most common profession cited among Representatives. In the 79th to 113th Congresses, the proportion of House Members with legal experience declined while those in banking or business rose. Business and banking occupations slightly surpassed or equaled legal experience, each group comprising roughly 20% to 25% of Representatives. Congressional aides, agriculture, and education were less common professions compared to business, banking, and law. Senators had a narrower set of career backgrounds compared to House Members. Senators in the 79th \u2013 113th Congresses primarily had occupations in agriculture, business or banking, education, or law. Law and business were the most frequently cited professions, with lawyers dominating Senate seats. In the 93rd Congress, over half of Senators had a legal background, but this declined in subsequent Congresses. Business and banking were the second most common occupations among Senators since 1945. Since 1945, Senators have commonly had backgrounds in business, banking, education, and law. The diversity of race and ethnicity among Representatives and Senators has been less than that of the general public, with the House being over 95% white until the 93rd Congress. The diversity of race and ethnicity in the 113th Congress is as follows: 82.2% are white, 9.0% are African American, 6.7% are Hispanic, 1.8% are Asian American, and 0.2% are American Indian. In the Senate, 95% are white, 3% Hispanic, 1% Asian American, and 1% African American. Since 1945, the racial and ethnic composition of Senators has varied. African American and Native American representation has been consistently low, with some Congresses starting without any Senators from these groups. Asian American Senators ranged from 0% to 3%, while Hispanic Senators ranged from 0% to 3%. The 113th Congress had 82.2% white, 9.0% African American, 6.7% Hispanic, 1.8% Asian American, and 0.2% American Indian members. In the 2010 Census data, racial composition of Representatives and Senators varied with 16.3% Hispanic, 72.4% White, 6.2% Some other race, and 2.9% Two or more races. Educational attainment levels among Members of Congress have increased since the 79th Congress, with a majority completing high school, college, and some form of graduate school in the 113th Congress. In the 79th Congress, most Members of Congress had completed high school, with higher rates than the average American. The percentage of Americans with at least a high school diploma has since increased to 85.9%. The high school graduation rates among Members of Congress are higher than the national average, with almost all Representatives and Senators having completed high school. Additionally, a majority of Members of Congress have also obtained a college degree, with higher rates of college attendance and postgraduate education compared to the general American population aged 25 years or older. Since 1945, a higher proportion of Senators and Representatives in Congress have completed four or more years of college compared to the general American population. In the 113th Congress, 92.2% of Representatives and 97.0% of Senators held a bachelor's degree, showing a significant increase from previous Congresses. In the 113th Congress, a significant increase was seen in the number of Members holding graduate degrees, with 74.4% of Representatives and 74.0% of Senators having them. Professional degrees remain the most common advanced degree, with 41.6% of Representatives and 56.0% of Senators holding them. Master's degrees are also held by 28.9% of Representatives and 18.0% of Senators, while doctoral degrees are rare among Members. Additionally, Representatives and Senators have shown a higher likelihood of identifying with a religious faith in recent Congresses. In the 113th Congress, a majority of Representatives and Senators identified with a religious faith, with percentages declining slightly compared to previous Congresses. Data comparing religious affiliation among Members of Congress and the U.S. adult population in 2008 show a trend of high religious identification among lawmakers. In the 113th Congress, a majority of Representatives and Senators identified with a religious faith, with percentages declining slightly compared to previous Congresses. Data comparing religious affiliation among Members of Congress and the U.S. adult population in 2008 show a trend of high religious identification among lawmakers. CQ Press provided information for 32 Senators and 172 Representatives in the 79th Congress, and for 91 Senators and 407 Representatives in the 113th Congress. Representatives and Senators identify a religious affiliation in higher proportions than the general public, with Christian and Jewish affiliations being more common. Among Christian denominations, Catholic, Mormon, and Orthodox churches are more represented in Congress than in the U.S. population. In the Senate, the one Buddhist representative is overrepresented compared to the U.S. population. There are no Muslim or Hindu adherents in the Senate. Most Representatives in the 79th-113th Congresses identified as Christian, with Protestant denomination being the majority. In the 79th-113th Congresses, the percentage of Representatives identifying with Judaism ranged from 0.6% to 7.7%, with a current level of 5.2% in the 112th Congress. Among Senators, Christianity was the dominant affiliation, with Judaism ranging from 0% to 14% in different Congresses. In the 79th-113th Congresses, Senators predominantly identified as Christians, with Protestant denominations being the most common. The percentage of Protestant Senators decreased from 88.3% in the 82nd Congress to 51.65% in the 113th Congress. Military service among members peaked after World War II, with 75.2% in the House and 80% in the Senate in the 90th and 94th Congresses respectively. However, the number of veterans declined to 19.6% in the House and 18.1% in the Senate by the 113th Congress. In the 79th-113th Congresses, Senators were mostly Christians, with Protestant denominations being common. The percentage of Protestant Senators decreased from 88.3% in the 82nd Congress to 51.65% in the 113th Congress. Military service among members peaked after World War II, with 75.2% in the House and 80% in the Senate in the 90th and 94th Congresses respectively. However, the number of veterans declined to 19.6% in the House and 18.1% in the Senate by the 113th Congress. Congress has slightly higher military service rates compared to previous Congresses, while the number of Senators who served in the military declined. Members and the general public who have served in the military may fluctuate in tandem. In the 79th-113th Congresses, military service among members peaked after World War II, with 75.2% in the House and 80% in the Senate in the 90th and 94th Congresses respectively. However, the number of veterans declined to 19.6% in the House and 18.1% in the Senate by the 113th Congress. In the 113th Congress, 21.3% of Representatives and 28.9% of Senators had previously served in the armed forces, higher than the general population. The proportion of veteran Members in Congress fluctuated in tandem with the general population, peaking after World War II and declining in recent years. Members in 2013 are older, more religious, include more women and minority groups, and have high levels of education compared to Members in 1945. Since the 79th Congress, Members of Congress have had high levels of education and professional backgrounds. The number of Members with military experience has fluctuated over time. This data provides a comprehensive view of the composition of Representatives and Senators. Longitudinal analysis is enabled by consistent data sources, but caution should be taken when comparing to other studies. Vacancies may affect the reported proportions in the Senate during the 79th-85th Congresses. The Senate had 96 seats in the 79th-85th Congresses, increasing to 100 in the 86th Congress with Alaska and Hawaii's admission as states. The House has had 435 seats since 1911, temporarily increased to 437 in the 86th-87th Congresses for Alaska and Hawaii. House seats reverted to 435 after the 1960 Census. Delegates and the Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico are excluded from House calculations. Membership details of Senators and Representatives are provided, but additional information like race and education is not disclosed. The report provides data on Member characteristics based on sources like the CQ Press Electronic Library. It includes information on Members' Congress, political party, state, age, religion, race/ethnicity, previous occupation, sex, and military service. This data is drawn from Members serving since the 79th Congress, and the database also covers Presidents and Vice Presidents of the United States. The database includes data on Presidents and Vice Presidents of the United States, based on decennial censuses and official government sources. Data on religious affiliations are from a private source. Information on Representatives and Senators from the 79th \u2013 113th Congresses is from the CQ Press database. The CQ Press database contains Member biographical data sourced from various primary sources, including reporting, surveys, and official sources. Multiple sources are used to confirm information, such as obituaries and newspaper excerpts. Data collection methods over time are not specified by CQ Press. In the 79th \u2013 86th Congresses, the Senate had 96 seats representing 48 states. The number of Senate seats increased to 100 in the 87th Congress with the admission of Alaska and Hawaii. The House has had 435 seats since 1911, temporarily increasing to 436 and 437 in the 86th and 87th Congresses for Alaska and Hawaii. The number of House seats reverted to 435 after the 1960 Census. Vacancies in Congress may occur on the first day due to various reasons. On the first day of the 111th Congress, 98 Senators and 433 Representatives were present, with two vacant seats in each chamber. Data in tables show the numbers of Members present in Congress from the 79th to 113th Congresses. Comparing Members of Congress to the U.S. population poses challenges due to differences in scale and data collection methods. Challenges in comparing Members of Congress to the U.S. population arise from differences in scale and data collection methods. Conclusions drawn from the data should be done with care, as there may be no direct comparison between the types of data available for Representatives, Senators, and the broader American public. Key issues include education levels and how information is categorized over time. The Census Bureau provides data on educational attainment and median years of schooling for individuals aged 25 and older in the U.S. Comparing the occupations of Members of Congress to those of the general population raises questions about the proper comparison and changes in categorizing work over time. The dynamic nature of work activity may limit comparisons of occupations over time. The CQ Press data categorizes previous occupations of Members of Congress into broad categories such as \"Previous Occupation.\" These occupations may fall into subcategories like congressional aide, law enforcement, military, or public service/politics. The extent to which the public service/politics subcategory includes or excludes Members is a key consideration. The CQ Press data categorizes previous occupations of Members of Congress into broad categories such as \"Previous Occupation.\" The extent to which the public service/politics subcategory includes or excludes Members cannot be determined. Questions about identifying congressional work experience and changes in occupational data collection may affect data comparability over time. Comparisons between Members' occupations and the U.S. population are not provided in the report due to data diversity and challenges in comparison. Race and ethnicity data in the census and CQ Press are based on self-identification. The Census Bureau has expanded racial and ethnic categories over time, raising questions about data comparability. Comparing religious affiliation of Members of Congress to the U.S. population is challenging due to lack of consistent categorization since 1945. The Census Bureau faces challenges in collecting religious affiliation data due to restrictions, while private sources provide data on Members of Congress that are not easily comparable. CQ Press's data on Members' religious affiliations lack distinctions within denominations, making it difficult to categorize. Inconsistent information on American observers of certain religions further complicates efforts to identify adherents in the U.S. population. Based on CQ Press data, it is easier to track Christian adherents in the U.S. since 1945 than followers of other faiths. This is due to the majority of Americans identifying as Christians. Comparing religious adherents in Congress and the U.S. population is only possible for the 113th Congress and 2008. Military service of Members of Congress is also a topic of interest, with some having served in the military before entering Congress. Members of Congress may have served in the military before entering office, with data from CQ Press categorizing their military backgrounds. This includes service in various branches like the U.S. Air Force, Army, Marine Corps, or Navy, as well as in reserves, state guards, and specific conflicts like the Spanish-American War. The data also mention activities that may or may not constitute military service, such as work for government agencies like the U.S. Food Administration or Public Health Service. The report provides data on Members of Congress with military service, highlighting challenges in comparing their service with the general population. Data on veteran status is problematic due to exclusion of reserve and state guard units. The report relies on Census Bureau data for veteran information. The Census Bureau collected veteran information from 1960-2000 and continues through the American Community Survey. Data inconsistencies between Census Bureau and CQ Press data may hinder direct comparability."
