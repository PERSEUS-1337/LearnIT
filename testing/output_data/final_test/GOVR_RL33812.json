    "content": "Scientists have documented increases in global temperature and sea levels, decreases in Arctic sea ice, and melting of ice sheets and glaciers. Human activities, such as fossil fuel combustion and deforestation, have contributed to greenhouse gas emissions, leading to climate change. Efforts to reduce emissions were initiated with the ratification of the UNFCCC in 1992. In early 2001, President George W. Bush rejected the UNFCCC 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which called for legally binding commitments by developed countries to reduce their GHG emissions. The federal government has taken various voluntary and regulatory actions related to climate change. In the 110th Congress, multiple bills were introduced to address climate change, and some legislation contained climate change provisions. There has been congressional support for a mandatory reduction program, as seen in the Senate version of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The Senate Resolution calls for a national program of mandatory emissions limits on greenhouse gases to slow their growth without harming the economy. Legislation like the Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act of 2008 aimed to establish such a program, as federal government inaction led states to take their own actions on GHG emissions. States have taken action on GHG emissions, ranging from climate action plans to mandatory emission standards. Early actions were symbolic, but more states are now developing climate change strategies with mandatory reductions. Motivating factors vary, including projections of climatic changes like sea level rise or agricultural impacts. States are implementing GHG policies for economic opportunities and a \"less-carbonized\" future. Motivating factors include improved air quality, reduced traffic congestion, and catalyzing federal legislation. The report covers state actions addressing GHG emissions, including individual and cooperative efforts. The report examines state actions on GHG emissions from a federal policymaking perspective, focusing on mandatory programs for GHG reductions. These programs vary in scope and design, generating interest and controversy. Regional agreements involving 23 states aim to reduce GHG emissions, with more states as observers. The regional activities for GHG emission reductions are in developmental phases, with potential legal issues due to constitutional concerns about interstate agreements. The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) is a significant state-level development in addressing climate change. The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) is a state-level effort by 10 Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants through a cap-and-trade program. The initiative aims to stabilize emissions starting in 2009 and achieve a 10% reduction by 2019. RGGI aims to create a flexible program for potential inclusion of other emission sources/sectors or states. It is seen as a potential model for a federal cap-and-trade program, with its emission allocation scheme drawing both praise and criticism. States have agreed to allocate at least 25% of emission allowances for consumer benefit or strategic energy purposes, with many intending to allocate more for these objectives. This strategy requires power plants to purchase allowances through auctions instead of receiving them for free. On September 25, 2008, RGGI participants held the first emission allowance auction for the compliance period 2009-2011. The auction was successful with a clearing price of $3.07/ton, compliance entities receiving 80% of allowances, and states earning nearly $40 million in revenues. However, there are concerns that the RGGI cap of 188 million short tons of carbon dioxide may be higher than actual emissions when the program goes into effect in 2009. The RGGI cap was set slightly above average emission levels observed between 2000 and 2002. Emissions data from the first half of 2008 suggest that 2008 emissions may be 20% below the 2009 cap. If actual emissions are below the cap when it goes into effect, the effectiveness of the RGGI program may be impacted. The RGGI program allows unlimited banking of emission reductions for future use, spreading costs over time. Banking emissions would reduce compliance costs in the future and increase the value of current allowances. Recent auction sales data show a strong incentive for additional reductions. Concerns remain about electricity imports from non-RGGI states, known as the \"leakage\" problem, which can impact the effectiveness of emission reduction programs. The RGGI program allows banking of emission reductions for future use, reducing compliance costs and increasing allowance value. Concerns about emissions leakage from importing power from non-RGGI states impact emission reduction effectiveness. The Western Climate Initiative involves seven U.S. states and four Canadian provinces working to reduce GHG emissions in their region. The Western Climate Initiative involves seven U.S. states and four Canadian provinces working together to reduce GHG emissions. They set a target to reduce emissions by 15% below 2005 levels by 2020 and agreed to implement a market-based program like a cap-and-trade system. Design recommendations were issued in 2008, including covering emissions from various sectors and allowing for flexible elements like unlimited emission banking and offsets for up to 49% of reductions. The Western Climate Initiative aims to reduce GHG emissions by 15% below 2005 levels by 2020 through a cap-and-trade system. Design recommendations include allowing offsets for up to 49% of emission reductions. This differs from federal proposals that limit offsets based on allowance submissions. RGGI participants also allow offsets to cover up to 50% of reductions, with offsets satisfying up to 3.3% of compliance submissions. The WCI faces implementation challenges as it is an agreement between states' governors. The Western Climate Initiative aims to reduce GHG emissions by 15% below 2005 levels by 2020 through a cap-and-trade system. The WCI faces implementation challenges as it is an agreement between states' governors, requiring state legislatures to enact laws to carry out the initiative's objectives. On November 15, 2007, governors of six states and the Premier of Manitoba signed the Midwestern Regional Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord, which calls for participants to develop a cap-and-trade program and set their own GHG emission reduction targets. The participants in the Midwestern Regional Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord agreed to develop a cap-and-trade program with a draft model rule scheduled for September 2009. Full implementation of the Accord is set for May 2010. Governors of Indiana, Ohio, and South Dakota joined as observers. States are also working on individual efforts to reduce GHG emissions, including requiring power plants to make reductions, adopting California's motor vehicle standards, and developing economy-wide emission reduction programs. Three states\u2014California, Hawaii, and New Jersey\u2014have passed legislation for \"economy-wide\" GHG reduction programs. State statutes lack details, directing agencies to develop implementation elements. California's AB 32 is a landmark law for GHG reduction but lacks crucial details. California's AB 32 directs the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to develop a program to reduce the state's GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, granting CARB authority to determine key details. The law does not specify a market-based system like cap-and-trade but allows CARB to develop regulations for cost-effective emission reductions. It does not list regulated sources but instructs CARB to identify necessary sources to meet targets and sets deadlines for agency actions. The mandatory schedule for California's AB 32 includes key milestones such as identifying early reduction options by June 30, 2007, establishing the 1990 baseline as the 2020 emissions cap by January 1, 2008, and developing a mandatory reporting scheme for covered sources. CARB approved a baseline of 427 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent on December 7, 2007. California's AB 32 set milestones for emissions reductions, with regulations submitted in 2008 and emissions reports due in 2009. By January 1, 2011, regulations including market-based programs were to be finalized. Hawaii's Global Warming Solutions Act of 2007 aimed to reduce GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, with a task force offering policy recommendations by January 1, 2009. Regulations were to be adopted by December 31, 2011, for implementation on January 1, 2012. Hawaii's Global Warming Solutions Act of 2007, similar to California's AB 32, delegates responsibility to the Department of Health for implementing regulations by January 1, 2012. New Jersey's Global Warming Response Act sets targets for reducing GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and 80% below 2006 levels by 2050, with the Department of Environmental Protection tasked with developing an emissions inventory and monitoring system. The New Jersey Global Warming Response Act requires the Department of Environmental Protection to submit recommendations for reducing GHG emissions. Legislative action may be needed to implement the reduction program, with a focus on the electricity-generating sector for emission reductions. In Oregon and Washington, new power plants are required to reduce carbon dioxide emissions or purchase offsets. Oregon was the first state to regulate carbon dioxide emissions in 1997, with new plants needing to meet levels 17% below the best natural gas-fired plant. Washington followed suit in 2004. Plants can purchase offsets from the Oregon Climate Trust to help reduce or sequester greenhouse gas emissions. Massachusetts was the first state to take action on carbon dioxide emissions at operational power plants in 2001. The state's six largest power plants must reduce carbon dioxide levels to those produced in the late 1990s as part of a multi-pollutant strategy. They can achieve this by making reductions, demonstrating offsite reductions, or purchasing emissions credits. The program will be replaced by RGGI in 2009, which will require reductions from 32 power plants in the state. New Hampshire also enacted emission reduction requirements for power plants in 2002. In 2002, New Hampshire enacted legislation requiring its three fossil fuel power plants to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels by 2006. The law allowed sources to bank early reductions or buy credits. Florida also passed a law in 2008 authorizing a cap-and-trade system for the electric utility sector, set to begin in 2010. The U.S. transportation sector accounted for 26% of the nation's greenhouse gas emissions in 2006, with automobiles and light-duty trucks being the main contributors. In 2006, light-duty trucks fueled by gasoline or diesel generated 62% of the nation's transportation-related GHG emissions. California's transportation sector accounted for almost 41% of the state's annual greenhouse emissions and has unique authority to develop more stringent motor vehicle pollution standards. California enacted the first state law in 2002 requiring GHG limits from motor vehicles, with regulations issued by the California Air Resources Board (CARB). The California Air Resources Board (CARB) issued regulations in 2004 to limit GHG emissions from vehicles, with caps becoming more stringent annually. California requested an EPA waiver in 2005, which was denied in 2007, leading to a legal challenge by California and other states. California has developed requirements to influence investment in long-term power generation, impacting GHG levels by determining energy sources for electricity. Two states, California and Washington, have laws mandating a GHG emissions performance standard for applicable power plants. California's SB 1368 legislation restricts \"load-serving entities\" from new commitments with power plants unless emissions are low. California and Washington have laws mandating a GHG emissions performance standard for power plants. California's SB 1368 legislation restricts new commitments with power plants unless emissions are as low as those of a new natural gas facility. The California Public Utilities Commission and the California Energy Commission have issued interim performance standards for power plants. Washington passed similar legislation in May 2007, with regulations implemented in June 2008. These standards complement emissions reductions programs in both states. California and Washington have laws mandating GHG emissions performance standards for power plants. The implementation of California's emissions reduction program and the WCI is several years away. The new performance standards will effectively prohibit consumers from using electricity generated by conventional coal-fired power plants. Compared to a combined-cycle natural gas plant, a conventional coal-fired power plant emits more than twice the amount of carbon dioxide and would fail to meet the new emissions standards. The new emissions standards will impact California and Washington, as they will need to reduce energy or replace coal-generated electricity. California's electricity imports contribute significantly to GHG emissions due to coal generation, while most in-state electricity comes from other sources. Other states in the West will also be affected by the new standards. The new emissions standards in California will affect neighboring states that historically exported coal-generated electricity to California and Washington. Montana enacted a law in 2007 to prohibit advance approval of coal-fired electric generating. The Public Service Commission in Montana enacted a law in 2007 to restrict advance approval of coal-fired electric generating units unless at least 50% of CO2 emissions are captured and sequestered. This law primarily affects Northwestern Energy, the only utility in the state subject to this standard. Additionally, California implemented a low carbon fuel standard to reduce transportation fuel carbon intensity by 10%. The LCFS in California aims to reduce transportation fuel carbon intensity by 10% by 2020, replacing 20% of gasoline consumption with less carbon-intensive fuels. It applies to all fuel stakeholders and measures energy use and GHG emissions throughout the fuel's lifecycle. Corn-based ethanol is expected to help meet the LCFS requirements. The LCFS executive order in California enhances alternative fuel legislation and directs the California Energy Commission to develop a compliance schedule for meeting the 2020 LCFS target. The State Alternative Fuels Plan states that CEC will work with CARB to develop the schedule, which is still under development as of the report date. The adoption of a GHG adder in some states impacts electricity generation sources by requiring utilities to consider future costs of GHG emissions in energy investment decisions. California's Public Utilities Commission mandates a $8/ton carbon dioxide emissions value for long-term planning. Few other states have similar requirements, but California's adder may become less relevant due to a new emission performance standard. Despite their implementation, GHG adders have not yet influenced procurement decisions significantly. State emissions targets are established by the executive branch of state government and do not directly reduce GHG emissions. Twenty states have set statewide targets, with California, Hawaii, and New Jersey having mandatory targets. These state targets are less stringent compared to international GHG limits. The New England states have similar targets as they cooperate on this issue. The New England states have similar emissions targets as part of a cooperative plan developed in 2001. Table 1 compares GHG emissions in 1990 with recent data, showing reductions needed to meet targets. Some states are close to their 2010 goals, but many show stagnant or increasing emissions. More data is needed to assess progress, as targets were set after 2003 with some being mandatory. Reliable GHG emissions data are crucial for climate change programs, especially for market-oriented approaches like tradeable emissions credits or carbon taxes. The federal government has programs in place to track or estimate GHG emissions, but more data is needed for effective policymaking. GHG emissions from power plants are monitored and reported to the EPA under the Clean Air Act acid rain program. The Department of Energy runs a voluntary GHG reduction registry since 1994. States have their own tracking programs categorized as mandatory reporting, registries, and inventories. These programs aim to monitor GHG emissions and support reduction efforts. The purpose of mandatory reporting is to support emission reduction programs, but it can also incentivize companies to voluntarily reduce emissions. However, there is concern that emissions may increase under a mandatory reporting program if companies anticipate future reduction requirements. Some states already require GHG emissions reporting to complement reduction programs, while others are in the process of developing such programs. Some states have mandatory reporting programs for GHG emissions not covered by reduction programs, such as non-CO2 emissions in RGGI states. States like Wisconsin and New Jersey have established reporting requirements for facilities emitting over a certain threshold. New Jersey is also developing a mandatory reduction program alongside its reporting regime. Facilities in various states must report GHG emissions over specific thresholds, with requirements starting in different years. For example, Maine implemented reporting in 2004, Connecticut in 2006, California under AB 32, North Carolina in 2009, and New Mexico for certain industries starting in 2009. Initial reports may only include CO2 emissions, with other GHGs to be reported in later years. Oregon and Washington have established GHG emission reporting requirements for entities exceeding certain emission thresholds. Oregon's requirement, set in October 2008, applies to entities emitting over 2,500 metric tons of CO2 annually, with reporting deadlines staggered for different sources. Washington's requirement, enacted in March 2008, mandates reporting for entities emitting over 10,000 t CO2 annually and certain vehicle fleets starting in 2010. State GHG registries are voluntary programs incentivizing participation by allowing facilities to submit and officially record emissions data. The New Hampshire GHG Registry and California Climate Action Registry are examples of state GHG registries that incentivize participants to record emissions reductions for future mandatory reduction programs. These registries offer participants public recognition and the opportunity to establish their environmental stewardship profile. The California Climate Action Registry and Wisconsin Voluntary Emission Reduction Registry are examples of state GHG registries that aim to establish standard systems for reporting emissions. The Climate Registry, formed by 30 states in 2007, supports both voluntary and mandatory reporting schemes. At least 42 states have developed GHG inventories, providing estimates of emissions by economic sector, emissions source, and GHGs. States create inventories of greenhouse gas emissions (e.g. carbon dioxide, methane) following EPA guidelines. These inventories assess emissions levels and sources, monitor trends, and develop strategies. Most state inventories only cover 1990 emission levels. 38 states have climate change action plans, drafted by diverse task forces, to identify cost-effective policy options for controlling emissions. State climate change action plans vary in their approach to controlling emissions, with some focusing on indirect strategies like energy efficiency while others recommend direct efforts. These plans are tailored to each state's economic sectors, natural resources, and political structures. While they may suggest policy options, they do not always lead to immediate actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The number of completed state plans reflects the widespread interest among states in addressing climate change. The number of completed state plans reflects the interest of states in addressing climate change. Many states are significant emitters of greenhouse gases, with 18 states ranking in the top 50 for annual emissions of carbon dioxide. Texas, the Midwest Accord states, WCI states, RGGI states, and California are among the top emitters. (23) states have joined regional emission reduction programs like the Midwest Accord, WCI, and RGGI, accounting for 38% of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions. The remaining 27 states have less aggressive climate change policies. State-led actions serve as laboratories for testing different climate change solutions. For example, the effectiveness of a national cap-and-trade program can be determined through state-level experimentation. State and regional programs play a crucial role in ironing out logistical details for emissions trading systems. They inform federal policymakers on setting emissions caps, regulating sources, allocating allowances, using offsets for compliance, and implementing safety valves. State actions provide insights into the political process of creating climate change policy, helping federal policymakers understand stakeholder motivations and framing issues effectively. Emission reduction programs will have economic effects on consumers, businesses, and manufacturers, particularly in the automotive manufacturing and electricity generation sectors. California motor vehicle regulations may divide the market and require the manufacture of a different class of cars to meet new standards. This raises issues for automotive companies regarding technical means of meeting standards, marketing, compliance, and pricing. State governments will need resources to enforce emission standards, potentially leading to higher vehicle prices for consumers in regulated states. Mandatory reduction requirements in the electric power industry will promote low carbon-intensive fuel generation and limit high carbon-intensive fuel generation. GHG performance standards in California and Washington may impact neighboring states by restricting electricity imports from coal-fired power plants, potentially increasing electricity prices in regulated states and lowering prices in states without emission standards. If GHG limitations result in higher energy prices in regulated states, businesses may consider relocating to states without emission limits. Concerns include increased cost of living and doing business, potential inefficiencies due to varying state regulations, and the creation of a patchwork system of standards. This could drive some companies to support a federal climate change program. The prospect of varying state regulations on climate change is prompting some companies to back a federal program with consistent requirements across the United States. Climate change is a global issue that cannot be addressed solely by individual states or nations. Actions taken by states in the US may serve as examples for broader global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Actions taken by states in the United States may serve as examples for broader global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, the lack of a national or global approach to GHG emissions limits what individual states can achieve. Legal challenges may further hinder state actions on climate change, creating uncertainty for the future of more aggressive programs. The legal challenges surrounding state actions to regulate GHG emissions from motor vehicles, including uncertainties from the April 2007 Supreme Court decision (Massachusetts v. EPA) and potential constitutional issues with California's GHG performance standards, are creating uncertainty for the future of aggressive climate change programs. Courts will interpret and decide on legal issues regarding climate change.
