The Department of Labor proposed revisions to the regulations defining these terms in 2003. The Department of Labor proposed revisions to the FLSA exemption regulations in 2003, sparking intense public debate and congressional action. The final rule was issued in April 2004, leading to further discussions and implementation in August. Public debate continued, but the evolution of Section 13(a)(1) since 1938 and modifications to the regulations (29 CFR 541) can be traced through entries in the Federal Register. The Fair Labor Standards Act was approved by Congress in June 1938, providing for minimum wages and overtime pay for covered workers. Specific exemptions were written into the act, including for employees in executive, administrative, and professional capacities as defined by the Administrator's regulations. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 established the Wage and Hour Division, with an Administrator appointed by the President. The act became effective in October 1938, with Elmer F. Andrews selected as Administrator. Congress provided little guidance on exemptions for executive, administrative, and professional employees. Elmer F. Andrews, the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, had the freedom to structure exemptions for executive, administrative, and professional employees as he chose. Despite being asked about Section 13(a)(1) during a presentation in 1938, Andrews had not taken any action yet but mentioned it was on his agenda. Elmer F. Andrews, the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, discussed the difficulty in defining executive and administrative roles to prevent employers from circumventing the state law. He called a conference to gather industry and labor representatives' views on the terms' definition. The Department announced a determination five days before the act was to go into effect, stating that executive and administrative roles would have a single definition based on the \"primary duty\" of managing the establishment. The concept of a professional under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 was defined as work that was predominantly intellectual, varied, and required discretion and judgment. The education of a professional was based on specialized knowledge, not routine training, and they were not to perform work similar to non-exempt employees. This definition was central to the Executive, Administrative, and Professional (EAP) regulations. The concept of salaried professionals under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 was not clearly defined, with no specific earnings threshold set for professionals. Despite the opportunity for citizen input on flawed definitions, protests were minimal. Rufus Poole highlighted the difficulty in defining a professional in a \"bona fide professional capacity\" at a meeting in 1938. The concept of defining a professional in a \"bona fide professional capacity\" was challenging, with dictionaries providing various interpretations. Despite critics questioning the definition, the Department of Labor (DOL) had a statutory duty to promulgate a definition. Employers later expressed concerns about certain high-salaried employees under Section 13(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Andrews addressed concerns about high-salaried employees not falling under the executive, administrative, or professional categories in Section 13(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act. The potential impact on personnel policies and administrative practices was highlighted, with the need for careful consideration in defining a separate category for special treatment. Legislation was proposed to modify Section 13(a)(1) in this regard. Legislation was proposed to modify Section 13(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act, but it was not a high priority for the Department of Labor or Congress. Andrews supported clarifying amendments to the FLSA but opposed a bill that was seen as lowering wages and increasing work hours. In 1939, Andrews left the Department and was replaced by Colonel Philip B. Fleming as Administrator. Changes in personnel and administrative policy followed, including a hearing in 1940 on proposed changes to the EAP exemption regulation. In response to proposed changes to the regulation, a hearing was announced by Fleming. The hearing, focused on the EAP exemption, was projected to be a one-day affair on April 10. The Division clarified that the hearing was in response to the first petitions received for exemptions in the wholesale distributive trades. The power to define is crucial as it determines exemptions. Abraham Isserman urged caution regarding re-defining categories for wholesale distributive trades, as it could set a precedent affecting other industries. Abraham Isserman cautioned against re-defining categories for wholesale distributive trades, warning of potential far-reaching implications on other industries covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. He urged a broader agenda for the hearing to ensure all interested parties understand the possible consequences. Fleming, however, had already considered and dismissed such concerns before announcing the hearing due to the wide variation in work performed by executive, administrative, and professional employees. Fleming held separate industry hearings for administrative and professional classes, inviting Isserman and others to attend or submit comments. The comment period was extended, and approximately 180 briefs were received. The hearing lasted several months, with some proposals being sweeping in concept. The Division estimated around 1,500,000 clerical or 'white collar' workers were affected. The Division estimated that around 1,500,000 clerical or 'white collar' workers could be exempt from minimum wage and overtime pay protection under the act. Various issues were raised, including regional differentials, on-the-job training for overtime pay, and employee status improvement efforts. Stein distinguished between \"defined\" and \"delimited\" terms in Section 13(a)(1) during his review of the evidence. The Administrator is responsible for determining employee exemptions and setting limits on those exemptions. A new regulation for the EAP exemption was announced on October 14, 1940, to coincide with the FLSA's implementation anniversary. The Administrator has the authority to define and restrict exemptions under Section 13(a)(1). The 1938 regulation set by Administrator Andrews defined exemptions for executive, administrative, and professional employees. It became the standard for future regulations, based on limited precedents. Fleming reviewed 2,000 pages of testimony from the Stein hearings on employer and labor representative input. The Fleming regulation of 1940 modified the Andrews regulation of 1938, setting the stage for regulatory language leading to the proposed rule of March 31, 2003. It separated executive and administrative categories, defining an executive as one whose primary duty involves management and directing other employees. An exempt executive must be paid a salary of at least $30 per week, while an administrative employee must be compensated at a rate of not less than $200 per month. The regulation specifies that an administrative employee must assist another executive or administrative employee in nonmanual tasks requiring discretion and independent judgment. Administrative employees are defined as those whose work is directly related to management policies or general business operations, requiring special training, experience, discretion, and independent judgment. The new regulations also include those whose duties are functional rather than supervisory. Professionals are characterized by predominantly intellectual work that involves consistent exercise of discretion and judgment. The 1940 regulation established criteria for professional employees, requiring advanced knowledge, originality, and creativity in their work. They must be paid at least $200 per month. This regulation laid the foundation for the implementation of the EAP exemption. The new regulation clarified the individual character of the EAP exemption, requiring case-by-case determinations for employees. There was debate over the $30 earnings threshold for executive exemption, with Colonel Fleming stating that individuals paid less than $30 a week should not be classified as executives. The exemption criteria for hourly paid employees has changed, now no hourly paid employee can qualify for exemption. Various qualifying elements were established, such as non-manual work for administrative employees and limitations on non-EAP duties. Professionals must meet specific tests to be exempt. The regulatory language for exemption was created by Wage and Hour Administrators and became more precise over time. The regulatory language for exemption criteria evolved to become more precise and detailed over time. Proposals for modification of the EAP regulation emerged, but were overshadowed by World War II concerns. In 1947, new hearings were initiated on 29 CFR 541, leading to a study published in 1949 after 22 days of hearings with over 100 witnesses. Proposed regulatory revisions were published in 1949, culminating in a new final rule. The regulatory revisions published in 1949 under William R. McComb increased the earnings threshold for exempt executives, administrators, and professionals. Workers paid at least $100 per week and meeting specified duties requirements would qualify for exempt status. The Division published an interpretive bulletin in 1949 explaining the regulation on payment on a salary basis for executives, administrators, and professionals under the FLSA. The Weiss Report provided context for discussions on this topic, with proposals to eliminate the salary basis requirement and use average compensation instead. Some witnesses suggested defining \"salary basis\" as a fixed or guaranteed payment, as evidence showed executive, administrative, and professional employees are typically paid on a salary basis. Proposals to eliminate this requirement and use hourly rates or average earnings tests were deemed inconsistent with true executive, administrative, or professional status. In the 1950s, patterns emerged regarding salary tests for classification as an executive, administrator, or professional. There was discussion about indexation of thresholds, erosion of threshold values due to inflation, and opposition to FLSA overtime requirements in the motion picture industry. In the 1950s, there were debates about salary tests for classification as executives, administrators, or professionals in the motion picture industry. Harold Stein noted that high hourly pay alone did not qualify employees for exemption as 'administrative employees.' The Association of Motion Picture Producers protested that technical workers should be exempt under FLSA but were paid hourly, not on a salary basis. Administrator McComb proposed changes to the regulations to address this issue. McComb proposed a modification to the regulation for the motion picture producing industry, exempting employees earning a base rate of at least $200 a week from the \"on a salary basis\" requirement. The earnings threshold remained at $200 per week until 1975 when it was raised to $250 per week. Additionally, McComb proposed an amendment to the payment on a salary basis section in 1954. In 1955, Administrator Newell Brown proposed raising the earnings thresholds for Section 13(a)(1) exemption due to inflationary pressures. A final rule disallowed deductions from salary as a penalty for disciplinary infractions but allowed deductions for violations of safety rules \"of major significance.\" In 1956, Brown called for a review of base rates for EAP exemption in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Assistant Administrator Kantor discussed the salary issue, with some suggesting the elimination of salary tests. Kantor disagreed, stating that salary reflects an employee's status and importance in management or the professions. The salary tests for employees were discretionary, with proposals for wage increases varying between industry and labor. Kantor highlighted the challenge of drawing a precise line with the salary test, emphasizing its approximate nature and historical recognition in previous regulations. Kantor emphasized the approximate nature of salary tests and the need for consideration of regional differences in wage levels. He suggested setting the tests at lower salary points for each category to address concerns about overlapping salaries for exempt and non-exempt employees. The Department of Labor raised salary thresholds for exempt employees in 1959 to address misclassification issues, with executives required to earn at least $80 per week, administrators at least $95 per week, and professionals at least $95 per week. In the early 1960s, the Wage/Hour Division addressed the adjustment of salary thresholds for exempt employees and the broader application of exemptions, especially in retail and service industries. Administrator Lundquist held hearings in 1962 to discuss the issue due to widespread increases in wage and payroll levels since the last adjustment in 1959. Employer reactions to the EAP exemption were divided. In response to the EAP exemption, employer reactions were split. Some proposed eliminating salary tests entirely, while others suggested setting them based on industry or region. Employee representatives favored a threshold increase tied to the cost of living. Ultimately, salary thresholds were raised for executives and administrative workers. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) was amended in 1961 and 1966 to extend wage/hour protection to workers in retail and service trades. The salary thresholds for executives, administrative workers, and professionals were increased to not less than $100, $115, and $150 per week respectively, with adjustments for regions like Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, or American Samoa. The Department updated its EAP coverage criteria to reflect these changes. The Department of Labor (DOL) is concerned that the [29 CFR 541] regulations are not suitable for the retail and service industry. Employer representatives argue that assistant managers and assistant buyers in retail establishments have equal authority and responsibility as managers or buyers. They believe it is necessary to delegate managerial authority downward in retail establishments. The Department of Labor is concerned about the regulations not being suitable for the retail and service industry. Employer representatives argue that assistant managers and assistant buyers in retail establishments have equal authority and responsibility as managers or buyers. Lundquist disagrees with the imposition of salary tests for executive employees in retail and service establishments, stating that the managerial functions do not differ significantly from other industries. Lundquist also argues against including a definition of the managerial function exclusive to any one industry in the regulations. The employer argued for a lower \"tolerance\" for non-exempt work by exempt executive and administrative employees, with an interim threshold adjustment for newly covered workers in retail and service industries. The Wage and Hour Administrator addressed concerns about overlapping work between executive and administrative employees. In June 1969, Wage and Hour Administrator Robert D. Moran proposed an across-the-board increase in wages and salary levels, with employers urging for rates not to be raised, salary tests to be eliminated, and differentials for geographical regions and industries. Some argued for limiting increases to the Consumer Price Index. Labor spokespersons agreed on the need for salary requirement increases but deemed the proposed ones insufficient. Labor representatives agreed that salary requirements needed to be increased, but felt that the proposed raises were not enough. One union representative suggested implementing automatic salary reviews to keep salaries current and meaningful. Wage and Hour Administrator Robert D. Moran defended the current system, stating that it had been successful for 30 years and that arguments for eliminating salary tests were not supported by experience. Industry objections to higher thresholds were dismissed as the increases were seen as necessary to keep up with past trends. Labor representatives agreed that salary requirements needed to be increased, but felt that the proposed raises were not enough. Wage and Hour Administrator Robert D. Moran defended the current system, stating that objections to higher thresholds were dismissed as necessary to keep up with past trends. New salary tests were set for different employee categories, with phased-in structures for those brought under FLSA wage and hour requirements by the 1966 amendments. Labor representatives and Wage and Hour Administrator Robert D. Moran discussed increasing salary requirements. New salary tests were set for different employee categories, with phased-in structures for those brought under FLSA wage and hour requirements by the 1966 amendments. Moran also addressed concerns about the exemption status of employees in hospitals, nursing homes, and the data processing field. Employees in the data processing field have various titles and perform tasks that are hard to measure in terms of importance. The Division is reconsidering the scope of the EAP to potentially include highly skilled technicians in industries like electronics and aerospace. The Division is reevaluating the EAP exemption to possibly include workers with specialized training in science and learning, focusing on the level of discretion and judgment they exercise. An initial hearing was set for December 1, 1970, but the scope was later expanded by the Administrator on November 13, 1970. The Administrator expanded the scope of the hearing on the EAP exemption, calling for written testimony on clarifying the 'primary duty' test and addressing employees with responsibilities similar to owners or managers. A new final rule was issued in December 1971 by Administrator Horace E. Menasco, primarily focusing on interpretation and adding guidelines for paramedical employees' exemption. Menasco was hesitant to recognize computer services workers as professionals, despite offering clarification on their status. Some employee spokespersons opposed granting professional status to computer services workers, citing the field's new and evolving nature with overlapping job titles and duties. They argued that expanding the exemption for these workers could lead to longer hours without additional compensation. Menasco agreed that the field lacked standardization and professional status at that time. Menasco declined to grant professional status to computer services workers due to the field not being recognized as a bona fide academic discipline by colleges and universities. He expressed concerns that granting professional status could lead to longer hours without extra compensation and weaken the professional exemption. Additionally, he made certain additions and clarifications in Subpart B but did not provide professional status for the industry. In a review of submissions and testimony, Menasco found that salary levels for targeted technicians were not high. Workers feared a loss of income through the loss of overtime pay, expressing concerns about longer hours and increased unemployment. Menasco declined to change the definition of professional employee for technicians. Congress added language to Section 13(a)(1) as part of the \"Education Amendments of 1972,\" creating a situation where an employer may be exempt from minimum wage and overtime pay requirements but must comply with equal pay requirements. In mid-March of 1973, Acting Wage and Hour Administrator Ben Robertson adjusted the Code of Federal Regulations for equal pay provisions. Wage and Hour Administrator Betty Southard Murphy proposed new salary thresholds under the FLSA due to outdated levels and increased cost of living. In January 1976, Wage and Hour Administrator Murphy proposed new salary thresholds under the FLSA, sparking substantial response and negative feedback from various groups, including the National Association of Manufacturers. The proposed threshold increases were deemed \"inflationary\" and questioned for their justification. The proposed salary thresholds under the FLSA in January 1976 sparked substantial negative feedback from various groups, including concerns about the interim character of the increases and the need to set salary tests high enough to separate exempt from nonexempt employees. Nathaniel Goldfinger of the AFL-CIO emphasized the importance of setting effective salary tests to ensure compliance with the law. Interim threshold levels were discussed, along with issues such as regional differentials, small business viability, and inflationary impacts. Murphy suggested using the Consumer Price Index as a guide for establishing interim rates. She opted for a conservative approach to prevent inflationary impact, setting rates slightly below CPI-based rates. No further distinction was made between the covered workforce and those brought under the act by amendments. The new rates, effective in April 1975, were set for different categories of employees, with special sub-minima for certain regions. Murphy considered these rates as an interim measure to protect the interests of employees and employers. The salary thresholds for executive, administrative, and professional status were established under Andrews and continued by his successors. There were debates about the thresholds being too low or too high, with suggestions to index them or rely solely on duties tests for exemption classification. Despite advocating for their retention and updating, the thresholds were eventually eliminated after 1975, subject to a proposal in March 2003. The 1975 threshold levels for executive, administrative, and professional employees were considered temporary pending an economic study. In 1978, Wage and Hour Administrator Xavier M. Vela called for a review of the thresholds due to inadequate protection for low-paid employees. Hearings in May 1978 discussed raising the thresholds based on CPI changes and a federal minimum wage increase. The Department of Labor (DOL) received feedback from 22 witnesses and 189 written statements regarding concerns about threshold levels and potential impacts on employees. Some employers expressed the need to lay off employees if levels were raised, while employee witnesses believed proposed salary tests were lower than industry average wages. AFL-CIO's Rudy Oswald argued that the proposed tests were not high enough to exclude questionable management or professional employees from exemptions. There was a disagreement within the Carter Administration between the Council on Wage and Price Stability (COWPS) and DOL regarding exemptions rationale. COWPS criticized the Department of Labor's methodology for proposing salary test increases, arguing that it lacked rationale and could be inflationary. They suggested implementing some form of indexation for thresholds instead. The Council urges the DOL to withdraw its unnecessary proposal, citing concerns about inflationary pressures and contradicting administration policy. The proposed rule to increase thresholds was signed by Assistant Secretary Elisburg on January 9, 1981, with implementation set for February 13, 1981 and February 13, 1983. The DOL's proposed rule to increase EAP exemption thresholds was delayed indefinitely for review after opposition from mainly restaurants and hotels. Despite being targeted for review by the President's Task Force on Regulatory Relief, a new rule did not materialize. The DOL's proposed rule to increase EAP exemption thresholds was delayed indefinitely for review after opposition from restaurants and hotels. The process restarted with an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking in November 1985, seeking public input on various aspects of the regulations. The comment period was extended to March 1986, but no action was taken for several years. The Secretary had imposed requirements for workers to be salaried under Section 13(a)(1) regulations. The DOL's proposed rule to increase EAP exemption thresholds was delayed indefinitely for review after opposition from restaurants and hotels. The Secretary had imposed requirements for workers to be salaried under Section 13(a)(1) regulations, which included the condition that employees must receive a predetermined amount each pay period without deductions for variations in work performed. This ensured that employees would be considered salaried and receive full pay for any week in which work was performed, regardless of the number of days or hours worked. State and local governmental employees were later brought under the act, with some statutes prohibiting payment for time not worked. The Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled that salaried employees could no longer be exempt under Section 13(a)(1) if deductions were made for absences of less than a full day, making them eligible for overtime pay. State and local governments faced back pay liability as a result, prompting calls for clarification from the Department of Labor. Senator John Seymour criticized the DOL for not issuing final regulations, leading to conflicting court rulings. In September 1991, the Department issued a new regulation for immediate relief, but it was invalidated by the U.S. District Court in March 1992. Public sector employers and Members of Congress voiced concerns. In August 1992, a new final rule was issued by DOL, allowing public agency employees to be exempt from EAP status despite pay deductions for short-term absences. The Clinton Administration aimed to update earnings thresholds, with a target date for rulemaking set for September 1993. The Department of Labor aimed to update earnings thresholds for regulations regarding exempt employees. Despite no action being taken after a target date was set in September 1993, concerns were raised about outdated salary level tests and confusion over compliance with regulations. Legal developments in court cases were causing issues for the 23 million employees affected by these regulations. The Department of Labor aimed to update earnings thresholds for regulations regarding exempt employees due to concerns over outdated salary level tests and compliance confusion. Legal developments in court cases are causing a loss of control over guiding interpretations, leading to the need for comprehensive regulations to provide uniform control. DOL announced a comprehensive review and re-opening of the comment period, with a proposed rule expected by April 1995, but the issue was deferred multiple times. The target date for notice of proposed rulemaking was projected for April 2001. The Bush Administration deferred the update of the EAP regulation multiple times, with a proposed rule finally being posted in March 2003 by Wage and Hour Administrator Tammy McCutchen. The proposed rule aimed to raise the salary threshold for EAP workers to $425 per week, making those earning less eligible for overtime pay. The Bush Administration proposed raising the salary threshold for EAP workers to $425 per week to determine eligibility for overtime pay. A new highly compensated threshold at $65,000 per year was suggested, exempting those earning above this amount and performing EAP duties. Redefinition of portions of the duties test for EAP exemption was also considered, sparking intense interest and debate with over 75,000 comments received by the Department. In 2003, the Department of Labor was evaluating testimony and policy options regarding the Section 13(a)(1) exemption, which had sparked intense debate. The General Accounting Office had previously reviewed these exemptions during the Clinton Administration, leading to a report in 1999 focusing on white-collar exemptions in the workplace. The General Accounting Office (GAO) found in 1998 that between 19 and 26 million full-time workers were classified as exempt from FLSA minimum wage and overtime pay protections. A shift from manufacturing to a service economy had increased the number of exempt workers, with about 42% being women. Exempt workers were more likely to work overtime. Major concerns of employers and employees regarding white-collar exemptions remain unresolved. Employers and workers were dissatisfied with the EAP exemption due to concerns about misclassification, confusion in regulations, and inadequate protection for workers. Representative David Obey attempted to block implementation of the exemption during House floor consideration of H.R. 2660 on July 10, 2003. Representative David Obey (D-WI) attempted to block the proposed EAP rule in H.R. 2660, but his amendment was defeated in the House. The Senate later approved an amendment by Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA) on September 10, 2003, restricting the use of funds to implement any regulation that exempts certain employees from the Fair Labor Standards Act. This amendment allowed the Department of Labor to increase earnings thresholds but prevented changes that would expand exemptions. The House conferees were instructed to support the Harkin amendment in conference, narrowing the exemption without changing definitions of duties. The Senate had already approved the Harkin amendment, restricting changes that would expand exemptions under the Fair Labor Standards Act. The House and Senate were in disagreement over the Harkin amendment and the Section 13(a)(1) regulation. The threat of a Presidential veto loomed if certain provisions were not removed from the bill. The House developed an omnibus appropriations bill, while H.R. 2660 remained in conference. The conference report on H.R. 2673 deleted language proposed by the Senate regarding exemptions from the Fair Labor Standards Act. The conference report on the omnibus appropriations bill would allow the Department of Labor to restructure the Section 13(a)(1) exemption, despite objections from some representatives who accused the bill of undermining the Fair Labor Standards Act and overtime protections for workers. The omnibus bill includes provisions to restructure overtime protections for workers, with objections raised by some representatives. Representative John Boehner highlighted the bill's benefits for education, while House Majority Leader Tom DeLay praised its fiscal aspects. Representative C. W. Bill Young emphasized fiscal responsibility and staying within budget. The House vote on the conference report was 242 yeas to 176 nays. The Senate postponed consideration of the omnibus appropriations bill until late January 2004. Majority Leader Bill Frist warned of dire consequences if the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2004 was not approved. Resolution was debated in response to changes demanded by the Administration, causing concerns about adverse effects on workers. Democratic Senators led the discussion on the overtime question, highlighting issues affecting American families. Senator Biden expressed worries about the proposed regulation's impact on workers. Senator Biden expressed concerns about the proposed regulation, stating it could lead to employers classifying workers as white-collar employees, potentially resulting in millions losing overtime pay. Other Democratic Senators raised objections to the bill's process, citing contradictions with previous bipartisan votes and the need for more time to address problematic provisions. Senator Frist emphasized the costs of delaying the resolution. Senator Frist highlighted the costs of delay in the fight against terrorism, food security, support for veterans, and HIV/AIDS. A cloture vote failed, but on January 22, 2004, the Senate reconsidered. Senator Daschle criticized the process and the pressure to avoid a government shutdown. Senator Daschle criticized the erosion of democracy in the Republic due to the legislative process surrounding the overtime pay issue. Senator Corzine attempted to restore the Harkin amendment but faced objection. Senator Hutchison warned of major funding losses if the bill was not passed. Senator Hutchison emphasized the need to pass the omnibus bill to secure funding for homeland security, education, and cancer research. Senator Kennedy questioned the removal of approved language without explanation, calling for transparency in decision-making. The Labor Department's regulation was approved after Senator Hutchison highlighted the importance of passing the omnibus bill for funding homeland security, education, and cancer research. Senator Frist reviewed the programs at risk if the bill was not approved, leading to cloture and the eventual approval of the conference report. President signed the bill into law on January 23, 2004 (P.L. 108-199), while other initiatives regarding overtime pay regulation were also being developed. On July 29, 2003, bills were introduced in both the House and Senate to restrict the Department from exempting workers from overtime pay protection. A hearing on the proposed overtime rule was held on July 31, 2003, chaired by Senator Arlen Specter. Testimony focused on the potential impact of the proposed Section 13(a)(1) rule. No action has been taken on the bills introduced. The Economic Policy Institute criticized the Department of Labor's underestimated impact of the proposed overtime rule. They conducted their own analysis, raising concerns about definitions in the rule potentially affecting workers' wage/hour protection. Wage/Hour Administrator Tammy McCutchen argued that reclassifying workers would have minimal impact. Critics continued to express concerns about the rule. Senator Specter introduced S. 1611 in response to concerns about the proposed overtime rule's impact on workers. The bill proposed a commission to study and make recommendations on modernizing overtime provisions under the FLSA. This was seen as a way to address concerns and bring clarity to existing regulations. The commission proposed in S. 1611 would review exemptions, impacts of overtime pay changes, clarity of regulations, paperwork burden, and other relevant issues. The pending Section 13(a)(1) regulation would be put on hold until the commission's report is submitted. This commission would ensure a thorough examination before any modifications to FLSA overtime pay requirements are made. The commission's report is submitted, ensuring Congress evaluates any proposed regulatory changes regarding overtime pay. The proposed revision of Section 13(a)(1) regulation had mixed responses from labor and employer communities. A hearing was convened by Senator Specter on the proposed rule, with Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao as the lead witness. The proposed rule aims to benefit low-wage workers by restoring overtime protections and clarifying existing law to prevent costly class action lawsuits. Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao emphasized the need for clear, concise, and updated rules to better protect workers and enforce the law. The Department has 'zero tolerance' for employers manipulating overtime laws. Witnesses agree that current regulations are unclear and salary thresholds for exemption need updating. AFL-CIO opposes the proposed rule, claiming it would harm millions of workers by stripping them of overtime rights. They argue the rule benefits employers, not workers. The proposed rule, criticized by economist Jared Bernstein, may benefit employers more than workers. Management attorney David Fortney praised Secretary Chao for updating regulations but warned of potential legal challenges ahead. The Subcommittee expressed concerns about the lack of clarity in the proposed rule regarding exemptions for \"professional\" and \"administrative\" employees from overtime protections. Secretary Chao admitted that both the current regulation and the proposed rule were complex. The dispute over the Administration's Section 13(a)(1) proposal remained unresolved despite legislative efforts and hearings. The dispute over the Administration's Section 13(a)(1) proposal revolves around the definition of a \"professional\" for FLSA wage/hour protection. The proposed rule seeks to expand the exemption for professionals by moving away from requiring a professional degree to a more flexible criteria. The proposed rule seeks to redefine the criteria for professionals under FLSA wage/hour protection, moving away from requiring a professional degree to alternative sources of knowledge. Concerns were raised about the impact on military veterans who received technical training in the armed forces. Garrity argued that veterans returning to civilian work could be considered professionals exempt from FLSA protection. Concerns about veterans' status were raised during a hearing, with Senator Murray questioning the equivalence of military training to a four-year degree. Secretary Chao's response did not alleviate concerns, with Trumka criticizing the Administration's proposed rule as \"particularly reprehensible.\" The Administration's proposed rule is criticized for stripping overtime rights from veterans with technical training in the military. Employers can now deny veterans overtime eligibility based on military training equivalence to professional training. This change is seen as denying veterans their right to overtime pay, which was previously protected under current regulations. The Bush administration's proposed rule would eliminate overtime pay for veterans with technical training in the military, equating their training to professional training. Senator Kennedy raised concerns about the impact on veterans who received valuable training in the armed forces. The Administration's decision to ban veterans from receiving overtime based on military training equivalence has sparked controversy. The Bush administration's proposed rule would eliminate overtime pay for veterans with technical training in the military. Secretary Chao clarified that the rule does not apply to military personnel or veterans, stating that they will not be affected by the proposed regulations. Critics raised concerns about how the concept of \"professional\" would be defined and applied to veterans reentering the civilian workforce. The proposed rule to eliminate overtime pay for veterans with technical training in the military has sparked controversy. Critics argue that the rule would strip overtime protections from veterans transitioning to civilian jobs. Senator Kennedy raised concerns about the expansion of the definition of learned professional to include those with military training, stating that it would harm veterans. The focus is on veterans leaving the military, not those currently serving. On February 12, 2004, Representative Steny Hoyer questioned Secretary Chao about the expanded definition of a learned professional, causing concerns among veterans groups. Secretary Chao defended the rule, stating there is misinformation and difficulty in enforcing regulations. Secretary Chao clarified that there is no impact on veterans in the proposed rule, which is focused on white-collar workers and does not affect blue-collar or military personnel. She emphasized that misinformation is causing unnecessary fear among veterans. The issue discussed pertains to overtime pay regulations for civilian workers, not military personnel. Secretary Chao highlighted the complexity and ambiguity of current regulations, stating that military training alone does not qualify for exemptions. Representative Pomeroy raised concerns about overtime pay during a hearing before the House Committee on Ways and Means. Secretary Chao addressed concerns about employers avoiding paying overtime by providing guidance that seemed to benefit them. Representative Pomeroy accused Chao of changing overtime rules to favor employers over employees. Chao defended herself, stating that the advisory points were part of a regulatory proposal. The advisory points in the regulatory proposal were required by the regulations. The defeat of the Harkin amendment in the FY2004 appropriations bill may have been more about concluding the appropriations process. Senator Harkin planned to offer an amendment to stop the administration from eliminating overtime pay protection for workers. He criticized the administration's credibility on the issue and called the proposed regulation a frontal attack on the 40-hour workweek. Senator Harkin criticized the proposed regulation as a threat to the 40-hour workweek, stating that the new criteria for excluding employees from overtime are vague and elastic. He also raised concerns about veterans being reclassified as ineligible for overtime based on military training. In contrast, Senator Enzi supported the Administration's proposal, citing the struggles of small businesses under current regulations. Senator Enzi criticized the Harkin amendment, stating it would prevent the Secretary of Labor from updating rules exempting white-collar employees from wage/hour protections. He highlighted the potential impact on veterans losing overtime pay under the proposed rules. Military personnel and veterans may lose overtime pay under proposed rules, but their status or training exempts them. Senator Enzi criticized the current regulation as outdated and confusing, leading to litigation and confusion over exempt employees. The proposed regulation aims to update and clarify worker treatment under Section 13(a)(1). The overtime pay issue was discussed during the general debate on S. 1637, with Senator Reid calling for a vote on the Harkin amendment. Senator Reid and Senator Harkin expressed frustration over the lack of a vote on the Harkin amendment to limit the authority of the Department of Labor (DOL) on the proposed rule regarding overtime pay. The discussion on S. 1637 continued with Senator Harkin emphasizing the urgency of addressing the proposed overtime rule and urging for a good debate on the bill's serious trade and international economy issues. Senator Reid urged for a good debate on the proposed regulations, emphasizing the need for an up-or-down vote on whether the Senate agrees with the administration. He suggested that the Department should work with Congress in an open manner. Senator Grassley proposed amendments to S. 1637, including the Harkin amendment, while Senator Reid expressed concern about the Majority invoking cloture. Senator Harkin called for immediate consideration of his overtime amendment, emphasizing the need for debate and a vote on the issue. There were concerns about the Majority invoking cloture to block the amendment, with Senator Grassley acknowledging the possibility but expressing opposition to it. Senator Grassley expressed opposition to invoking cloture on the overtime amendment, hoping to avoid poisoning the waters. He suggested using the 48-hour cloture process to reach an agreement and potentially vitiating the motion. Senator McConnell then submitted a motion for cloture, seen as a challenge by some. Senator Reid argued for an up-or-down vote on the amendment, accusing the Majority of avoiding it due to lack of support from the public. Senator Max Baucus (D-MT) explained the parliamentary situation regarding the cloture motion on the Harkin amendment, which could block a vote on the amendment. Senator Harkin predicted that cloture would delay the vote until March 24 and expressed doubt that it would pass. The primary bill was deemed important due to a World Trade Organization ruling on illegal export subsidies. Senator Harkin expressed concerns about the Republican leadership potentially pulling the bill and blaming Democrats for not passing it. He emphasized the importance of voting on overtime regulations and criticized the preference for paying tariffs to Europe over overtime for workers. Senator Kyl opposed the Harkin amendment and defended the views of opponents of the Department of Labor initiative. Senator Kyl defended the Department of Labor's proposed overtime rule, stating it would benefit workers by expanding eligibility for overtime pay and reducing litigation costs. Senator Sessions agreed with Senator Kyl's points. Senator Jeff Sessions (R-AL) supported the Department of Labor's proposed overtime rule, refuting claims of negative impact and emphasizing the need to update confusing regulations. He stated the rule would ensure more workers receive overtime pay and dismissed arguments against it as politically motivated. Senator Jeff Sessions (R-AL) supported the Department of Labor's proposed overtime rule, emphasizing the need to update confusing regulations to clarify the distinction between exempt and nonexempt employees. He stated that making overtime rules clearer would reduce confusion and litigation costs for employers. The Senate's vote on cloture on March 24 was largely along party lines, with Republicans in favor and Democrats opposed, falling short of the 60 votes needed to end debate. Various bills, including welfare reform reauthorization, occupied the Senate's attention in late March and early April. Senators Boxer and Kennedy proposed raising the federal minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.00 an hour, but the motion for cloture failed in the Senate. The debate then shifted to overtime pay and other labor-related concerns, with Senator Frist expressing concerns about gridlock on legislation. Senator Daschle denied any partisan purpose in resisting cloture, stating it was about being locked out of the process. He highlighted the refusal to allow an up-or-down vote on worker's overtime, minimum wage, and unemployment compensation. Despite the failure of cloture on H.R. 4, discussions on overtime pay and S. 1637 continued, with talks of compromise between the Majority and Minority. Senator Frist announced plans to try again to complete consideration of S. 1637, emphasizing the importance of the bill. Senator Frist emphasized the urgency of completing the legislation quickly by filing a second cloture motion on S. 1637. Senator Harkin discussed the economy, criticizing the Majority for prioritizing tax and trade provisions over issues like outsourcing and minimum wage. Senator Grassley highlighted the importance of the tax and trade provisions in S. 1637. Senator Frist filed a second cloture motion on S. 1637, but it failed with 50 yeas to 47 nays. Senator Gregg accused the Minority of hindering job creation and Senator Grassley warned against voting against tax relief for the manufacturing sector. Despite the setback, Senator Frist remained hopeful for progress on S. 1637. Senator Frist announced that the Senate will resume consideration of S. 1637 after reaching an agreement on limitation of amendments. The bill was set aside temporarily, but efforts to address it will continue. Senator Frist sought unanimous consent for Senator Harkin to offer his amendment on overtime. Floor consideration of S. 1637 and the Harkin amendment is still pending. The final rule governing Section 13(a)(1) was published on April 23, 2004, sparking hearings and floor debate. The rule raised the lower salary threshold to $23,660 and set $65,000 as the salary test for highly compensated employees. The final rule differed from the proposed rule in some details but not in broad approach. The final rule, published in 2004, increased the lower salary threshold to $23,660 and set $100,000 as the salary test for highly compensated employees. Workers earning less than $23,660 are protected by minimum wage and overtime pay laws, while those earning between $23,660 and $100,000 may be exempt depending on their duties. Workers earning over $100,000 are likely exempt. The changes in threshold levels have received attention, with exemption largely based on the duties test. Critics question the clarity and ease of applying the new duties test. The final rule in 2004 increased the salary threshold to $23,660 and set $100,000 as the threshold for highly compensated employees. Critics question the clarity of the new duties test under the final rule, which could lead to more complexity and litigation. The professional exemption based on knowledge acquired in the armed forces received negative public comment, with concerns that returning veterans could be unexpectedly exempt due to military training in fields like nursing and electronics. The proposed rule opened professional and exempt status to workers with similar knowledge levels as degreed employees but attained through various means like work experience or technical training. The final rule in 2004 increased the salary threshold to $23,660 and set $100,000 as the threshold for highly compensated employees. Critics question the clarity of the new duties test under the final rule, which could lead to more complexity and litigation. The professional exemption based on knowledge acquired in the armed forces received negative public comment, with concerns that returning veterans could be unexpectedly exempt due to military training in fields like nursing and electronics. The proposed rule opened professional and exempt status to workers with similar knowledge levels as degreed employees but attained through various means like work experience or technical training. In the final rule, DOL dropped the phrase \"training in the armed forces\" and restructured subsection 541.301(d) to include employees who have substantially the same knowledge level and perform substantially the same work as degreed employees, but attained advanced knowledge through a combination of work experience and intellectual instruction. DOL clarified that the professional exemption was not intended for any employee based on veteran's status. The Labor Policy Association (LPA) published a report in late 1994, calling for a reform of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) due to changes in workplace demographics and structures. The report criticized the FLSA as outdated and in need of revision, particularly focusing on Section 13(a)(1). The Department of Labor (DOL) emphasized the need for reform of the existing regulation, stating it was confusing and outdated. Secretary Chao mentioned that the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) is based on a workplace from fifty years ago. Critics question whether DOL's changes were substantive or not. The Department of Labor (DOL) made changes in the proposed rule to protect low-wage workers, emphasizing the importance of overtime pay. The final rule was declared to strengthen and clarify overtime protection, with new regulations being described as clear, straightforward, and fair. Critics of the initiative were suggested to lack integrity, with claims of misinformation surrounding the rule. The Small Business Survival Committee and the O.T. Coalition criticized opponents for spreading misinformation about the proposed rule update. The final rule received a divided reaction, with critics focusing on details and potential complications, while proponents emphasized the need for reform and benefits. Secretary Chao expressed pride in the final rule. The Department of Labor's final rule update aims to protect low-wage workers by ensuring their right to overtime pay. Secretary Chao and Deputy Administrator Robinson expressed satisfaction with the rule, highlighting its benefits for workers in the 21st century. Majority Leader DeLay also praised the administration for addressing a politically sensitive issue. Some praised the administration for taking on a politically sensitive issue and showing leadership. However, others raised concerns about the potential risks to overtime pay for millions of employees. Senator Harkin criticized the rule as anti-employee and a frontal attack on the 40-hour workweek, while industry representatives acknowledged improvements but noted controversies and unaddressed concerns. The final rules on overtime pay regulations by the Department were seen as more complicated and costly for restaurant operators. Critics questioned if the rule would reduce litigation as promised, while some praised it as a first step. The rule was noted to be streamlined but changes in language could lead to interpretive issues and new litigation. The final rule on overtime pay regulations by the Department of Labor was criticized for adopting unclear definitions and tests for exemption, leading to potential litigation. Hearings and debates were held in Congress to address the complexity of the rule. Chairman Boehner criticized the current overtime regulations as outdated, complex, and inciting needless litigation. He stated that the final rule would protect the overtime rights of certain workers and predicted that clear rules would reduce litigation costs and strengthen current protections, benefiting American workers, employers, and the economy. Representative Miller criticized the proposed rule, stating it would threaten overtime protections for millions of workers in various industries. Secretary Chao and Administrator McCutchen highlighted the ambiguity and potential impact of the new regulations. The lead witness, along with Administrator McCutchen, criticized the outdated and ambiguous nature of current regulations, emphasizing the need for clarity in the modern workplace. Secretary Chao defended the final rule, stating that it prioritizes workers' overtime protections and ensures that various groups, including veterans, cooks, union members, and manual laborers, are covered. The new rules prioritize workers' overtime protections and clarify definitions of executive, professional, and administrative duties to protect workers. Secretary Chao emphasized the importance of workers knowing their rights to overtime pay and employers understanding their legal obligations. She also addressed misinformation about the rules and urged people not to be misled. The final rule on overtime pay protections clarifies definitions of executive, professional, and administrative duties. Secretary Chao criticized critics for spreading misinformation and emphasized the importance of workers understanding their rights. The new rule introduces a broader standard for professional exemption, expanding criteria beyond degree-based qualifications. The questioning during the hearing focused on the definitions of substantially the same, work experience, and intellectual instruction in relation to the Section 13(a)(1) exemption. It raised concerns about how equivalency would be assessed and whether the exemption would be broadly applied. Chairman Boehner raised concerns about threats to overtime for registered nurses and licensed practical nurses under the proposed rule. Secretary Chao clarified that the new overtime rules strengthen overtime for licensed practical nurses, guaranteeing overtime for the first time. Registered nurses' status remains unchanged, and those receiving overtime under collective bargaining agreements will continue to do so. The final rule clarifies that executive chefs and sous chefs with a specialized culinary arts degree may meet the requirements for the learned professional exemption. However, cooks who perform routine work are not eligible for this exemption. Chefs whose primary duty involves invention, imagination, or talent may be considered exempt creative professionals. The rule does not address how the concept of \"substantially the same\" applies to nurses and LPNs or issues related to adjusting pay status for nurses and related workers. The final rule clarifies that only chefs with advanced four-year college degrees in culinary arts can be denied overtime pay. Ms. Chao affirmed that overtime rights are guaranteed and addressed concerns about disinformation causing fear among workers. Representative Miller questioned the exemption criteria for chefs with two-year degrees performing the same duties. The final rule clarifies that only chefs with advanced four-year college degrees in culinary arts can be denied overtime pay. Representative Robert Andrews raised concerns about chefs in the \"creative professional category\" potentially losing overtime protection if they create unique dishes themselves. Karen Delaney Smith, a former investigator with DOL's Wage and Hour Division, emphasized that being a chef is a manual and repetitive job, not a white-collar profession. The final rule clarifies that chefs with four-year degrees in culinary arts can be exempt from overtime pay. Concerns were raised about chefs in the \"creative professional category\" potentially losing overtime protection. The Department of Labor's declaration of culinary arts as a learned profession raises questions about determining knowledge equivalence between degreed and non-degreed employees. The restaurant industry, identified as a low-wage industry, often requires long work hours. The final rule allows for negotiation of higher overtime premiums and preserves overtime protections for union members under collective bargaining agreements. Secretary Chao addressed concerns from union workers, stating that the rule does not impact those covered by such agreements. The Secretary emphasized the preservation of overtime guarantees for union members under collective bargaining agreements to combat misinformation. Representative Kildee highlighted that the regulation does not relieve employers of their contractual obligations, but union workers will be directly affected if their contracts reference applicable law for overtime eligibility. The discussion focused on how union workers under collective bargaining agreements would be impacted by changes in the Wage and Hour Act regarding overtime eligibility. Representative Kildee raised concerns about the potential effects on union members, while Secretary Chao and McCutchen clarified that union members under collective bargaining agreements would not be affected by the proposed changes. McCutchen explained that union workers paid by the hour are entitled to overtime under the rules, regardless of their collective bargaining agreement. Representative Kildee expressed dissatisfaction with the response. The discussion continued with a focus on various technical issues related to inside and outside salespeople, nursery school teachers, team leaders, working foremen, computer services employees, and those in the financial services industry. Chairman Boehner and Senator Specter discussed the ambiguity surrounding the exempt or non-exempt status for Section 13(a)(1) purposes. Chairman Boehner acknowledged the difficulty in determining this status, stating that the final rule may not be perfect but is an improvement. Senator Specter had conducted oversight hearings on the Department of Labor's new overtime pay policy, questioning the benefits for both employers and employees. Some Subcommittee members raised concerns about the transparency of the new rule and its potential impact if finalized. The Subcommittee members questioned the impact of the finalized overtime pay rule on litigation. Ms. Chao and DOL spokesperson Ed Frank emphasized the importance of clear and updated rules to protect workers' rights. The Appropriations Subcommittee conducted a hearing on the updated rule, with Administrator McCutchen stating it will strengthen overtime rights for various workers. The Department of Labor's new overtime pay rule aims to clarify exemptions, protect low-wage workers, and reduce wasteful litigation. Administrator McCutchen assured the Subcommittee that the regulations are clear, fair, and designed to strengthen overtime rights for workers. She criticized misleading press coverage and misinformation about the rule's impact on employees. The Department of Labor's new overtime pay rule clarifies exemptions and protects low-wage workers. Administrator McCutchen emphasized that blue-collar workers are entitled to overtime pay, regardless of their pay level. The rule also ensures that employees under union contracts are protected and not affected by the changes. In defense of the new overtime pay rule, it was stated that there has been misinformation surrounding the regulations, with the final rule actually benefiting workers. The existing regulation was criticized as outdated and confusing, while the new rule was praised for providing clarity and facilitating compliance for employers. Fortney addressed confusion and misinformation surrounding the new overtime pay rule, emphasizing clarity and common sense. He clarified that the professional exemption does not apply based solely on veteran status, but on a combination of work and experience. Fortney praised the \"primary duty\" test in the new overtime pay rule, stating that it will avoid costly disputes and promote compliance. He emphasized that unionized employees will still receive overtime as per collective bargaining agreements, and 'blue collar' workers are not exempt from overtime. Fortney urged all parties to embrace the final rule, while technical administrative questions raised by critics remain to be addressed. Critics raised administrative questions regarding the final rule, focusing on practical aspects and workforce implications. The rule introduced the concept of exempt team leaders, stating that they meet duties requirements for the administrative exemption even without direct supervisory responsibility. The AFL-CIO quickly responded. The final rule introduced a provision regarding team leaders' responsibilities, which the AFL-CIO criticized as a loophole to disqualify workers from overtime. The Department of Labor clarified that the rules protect overtime pay for both blue-collar and white-collar team leaders. Representative Donald Payne questioned Secretary Chao about this during a hearing. The final rule strengthens overtime protection for workers by clarifying language and narrowing its scope. Administrator McCutchen affirmed that only leaders of major project teams can be exempt, defining significant assignments within a corporation. Concerns were raised about subjectivity and lack of clarity in the new regulations. Former Wage/Hour investigator Karen Dulaney Smith highlighted uncertainties regarding the term \"team leader\" not previously defined in the regulations. The new regulation introduces a broad exemption for 'team leaders', potentially impacting many non-supervisory workers' overtime rights. AFL-CIO and Economic Policy Institute representatives expressed concerns about the vague and sweeping nature of this exemption. The new regulation introduces a broad exemption for 'team leaders', potentially causing thousands of non-supervisory workers to lose their overtime rights. Concerns were raised about the vague nature of this exemption, with critics arguing that it could impact millions of front-line employees. Secretary Chao stated that the new rules are clear and only exempt 'white-collar' jobs from overtime protection, ensuring that blue-collar workers will not be affected. However, the final rule does not apply to manual laborers or other 'blue-collar' workers. The regulations in this part do not apply to manual laborers or other 'blue-collar' workers who perform repetitive operations with their hands, physical skill, and energy. Non-management production-line employees and employees in maintenance, construction, and similar occupations are entitled to minimum wage and overtime pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act, regardless of their pay. The final rule does not set a standard for the proportion of time a worker must spend on exempt work to be classified as exempt. The discussion raised concerns about the classification of blue-collar workers as exempt from overtime pay, particularly in cases where they may be considered as management blue-collar employees due to their role in team management. This could lead to a significant increase in the number of exempt workers under the new rules. The final rule moves towards exempting certain inside sales staff from FLSA overtime pay protection. Employees in the financial services industry may be exempt if their duties involve analyzing customer information, recommending financial products, and promoting employer's products. The final rule in the financial services industry exempts certain inside sales staff from FLSA overtime pay protection based on their duties involving analyzing customer information, recommending financial products, and promoting employer's products. The administrative exemption does not apply to employees primarily selling financial products, with the determinative factor being one's definition of \"primary duty.\" The definition of the financial services industry and the interpretation of marketing, servicing, or promoting financial products may raise concerns for some. The issue of defining roles in the financial services industry was discussed during a hearing, with concerns raised about differentiating between selling and other duties. Administrator McCutchen stated that the final rule reflects current regulations and case law, ensuring employees are not designated primarily as salespeople. Administrator McCutchen adopted existing federal court case law to update regulations, ensuring employees and employers have clarity without needing legal assistance. Representative Judy Biggert questioned how the rules apply to financial services workers, prompting a response on the incorporation of case law to define roles accurately. Ms. McCutchen clarified that financial services workers advising customers on appropriate products are entitled to overtime under federal regulations due to past confusion and litigation. Former investigator Karen Dulaney Smith highlighted a loophole in the final rule that could lead to more litigation and confusion for employers regarding exempt status for inside sales representatives. The distinction between inside sales (non-exempt) and outside sales (traditionally exempt) was discussed. Administrator McCutchen did not mention the financial services issue in her statement, but Craig Becker of the AFL-CIO raised concerns about the blanket exemption for the industry. He argued that the exemption was a departure from prior practice and criticized DOL's reliance on case law. Chairman Specter and Ranking Member Harkin expressed strong interest in the overtime pay issue during a hearing on the final rule. They reacted with skepticism to DOL testimony, with Senator Specter suggesting the new rules will lead to litigation and class actions. Senator Harkin criticized the final rule as \"anti-employee\" and an \"attack on the 40-hour workweek.\" The Senate considered the Harkin amendment to prevent DOL from reducing overtime pay protection through the final rule. Senator Gregg praised DOL for its work on the complex regulations governing overtime pay. Senator Gregg commended the Department of Labor for its work on the final rule governing overtime pay, criticizing the criticism and misinformation surrounding the rule. He emphasized the importance of providing overtime pay for those earning a modest income and highlighted the goal of bringing clarity and certainty to the law. Senator Gregg praised the Department of Labor for its work on the final rule governing overtime pay, emphasizing the importance of providing overtime pay for those earning a modest income. He criticized the Harkin amendment as an effort to stall the final rule and proposed his own amendment to protect the overtime rights of certain groups. The Gregg Amendment specifies that the Secretary shall not exempt certain groups from overtime pay provisions. The Gregg Amendment specifies that the Secretary shall not exempt certain groups from overtime pay provisions, including workers earning less than $23,660 per year. The list of impacted occupations includes hourly workers, blue-collar workers, those under collective bargaining agreements, team leaders, nurses, technicians, refinery workers, chefs, cooks, and police. The Gregg Amendment aims to prevent certain groups from being exempt from overtime pay provisions, including workers earning less than $23,660 per year. The list of impacted occupations includes hourly workers, blue-collar workers, those under collective bargaining agreements, team leaders, nurses, technicians, refinery workers, chefs, cooks, police officers, firefighters, craftsmen, funeral directors, outside sales employees, inside sales employees, assistant retail managers, and financial services industry workers. Senator Gregg emphasized the need for clarity in the law, while Senator Harkin raised concerns about potential loss of overtime pay for a wide range of occupations. The Gregg amendment aims to prevent certain groups from being exempt from overtime pay provisions, including workers earning less than $23,660 per year. However, there are concerns about the lack of clarity in defining occupations such as team leaders, technicians, and funeral directors. Senator Kennedy supports the amendment but argues that it may lead to additional litigation due to vague definitions in the final rule. The final rule clarifies that veteran status does not affect overtime pay, ensuring veterans receive overtime regardless of their training in the armed services. It also specifies that first responders and licensed practical nurses are eligible for overtime pay, and clarifies that collective bargaining agreements do not exempt individuals from overtime provisions. Senator Enzi criticized the Harkin amendment, while Senator Kennedy expressed concerns about vague definitions leading to potential litigation. The new rule guarantees overtime protection for blue collar and white collar team leaders, while maintaining current overtime status for various professions. Senator Enzi praised the rule for its simplicity and clarity, endorsing the Gregg amendment for fairer overtime rights. Senator Kohl expressed concerns about interpretive disagreements. Senator Herb Kohl criticized the final rule for not clarifying anything for small businesses, noting troubling exemptions of entire jobs and industries. He expressed concerns about certain industries avoiding paying overtime to their workers and criticized the rule for making certain classes ineligible for overtime. Kohl concluded that any weakening of the overtime rules is a step down on the ladder of economic progress. Senator Feingold criticized the final rule for only making cosmetic changes and not guaranteeing overtime pay for workers earning between $23,660 and $100,000. He argued that the administration's public relations campaign did not reflect the reality of the rule. Senator Specter acknowledged the need for clarity in the regulation to avoid unnecessary litigation. Senator Specter expressed concerns about the final rule, stating that it does not clarify issues and may even add complexity with the introduction of the term \"team leader.\" He opposed the proposed regulation and supported the Harkin amendment, highlighting a wide division on the issue. Senator Christopher Dodd questioned the Department of Labor's intentions regarding overtime pay, stating that the business community supports the rule change for different reasons. The Senate approved both the Harkin and Gregg amendments, with the issue now moving to the House for further action. In fall 2003, Congress considered H.R. 2660 for appropriations for various departments. An appropriation for various agencies was arranged through an omnibus bill, with a motion made to protect overtime pay provisions under the FLSA. Representative DeLay moved to table the motion, preventing further discussion. On May 18, 2004, Representative Miller's motion to block funding for the Department of Labor's final rule on overtime protection was met with opposition from Representative DeLay, who moved to table the motion. The recorded vote resulted in 222 ayes in favor of the DeLay motion and 205 nays supporting consideration of the Miller motion. Secretary Chao praised the DeLay motion as a win for American workers. The vote on the DeLay motion to table Representative Miller's motion regarding the Department of Labor's final rule on overtime protection resulted in 216 ayes and 199 nays, largely along party lines. Controversies surrounding the new regulations were identified between March 31, 2003, and April 23, 2004. The DOL made modifications to the rule based on feedback received during the comment process. The 152-page final rule was published in the Federal Register, which may have initially left non-specialists unprepared for early hearings. Alfred B. Robinson, Deputy Administrator for Policy, Wage and Hour Division, testified at the Subcommittee on Workforce, Empowerment and Government Programs hearing on the Department of Labor's final rule on overtime protection. He highlighted the benefits of the updated rule for American workers and praised it as clear, straightforward, and fair. Robinson emphasized that the new regulations would provide strengthened overtime protections for various groups of workers and address the alleged deficiencies of the previous rules. Alfred B. Robinson, Deputy Administrator for Policy, Wage and Hour Division, emphasized the need for clearer rules to protect low-wage workers and ensure fair overtime pay. He addressed concerns about the misleading press coverage and public debate surrounding the Department of Labor's final rule on overtime protection. Robinson highlighted the positive impact of the updated rule on American workers and small businesses, stating that the estimated costs are not likely to have a substantial impact. Alfred B. Robinson, Deputy Administrator for Policy, Wage and Hour Division, stated that the final rule on overtime protection is unlikely to have a substantial impact on small businesses. He estimated that only 107,000 employees earning at least $100,000 per year could be classified as exempt. Robinson emphasized that workers earning between $23,660 and $100,000 are unlikely to lose overtime pay rights. Despite misinformation, the Department of Labor is proud of the updated rule. Representative Linda Sanchez raised concerns about \"team leaders,\" to which Robinson responded that the final rule is more protective of such workers. The final rule on overtime protection is said to be more protective of workers, including \"team leaders\" engaged in major projects. Collective bargaining agreements for union employees are not affected by these regulations, but potential impacts on workers were raised during the hearing. The issue was not fully resolved by the Subcommittee. The final rule on overtime protection was discussed before the Small Business Subcommittee, with witnesses from the industry and labor perspectives. Neill Fendly of the National Association of Mortgage Brokers emphasized the skill and judgment required for loan officers, advocating for their exemption from overtime pay requirements. He noted that the rule could potentially classify loan officers as exempt administrative employees, which would benefit small business mortgage brokers. John Fitch, representing the National Funeral Directors Association, argued that licensed funeral directors and embalmers should be exempt from overtime requirements due to their discretion, unpredictable schedules, and employment by small, family-owned businesses. The final rule exempts licensed funeral directors and embalmers from overtime pay, with differing opinions on its impact. John Fitch argues for the exemption, while Ross Eisenbrey criticizes the rule as ambiguous and likely to lead to more litigation. Eisenbrey criticized the final rule as ambiguous, potentially leading to litigation. He highlighted concerns about the classification of employees for overtime pay, particularly in distinguishing between management and non-management roles. The rule introduces a broad new exemption for team leaders, potentially affecting 2.3 million non-exempt team leaders in various industries. The new 'learned professional' exemption allows employers to deny overtime pay to employees with similar knowledge levels as degreed employees. Questions arise about what 'substantially the same' means and how veterans' knowledge gained in the armed forces fits into this exemption. Eisenbrey raised concerns about the ambiguity of the rule and its potential impact on employee classification for overtime pay. Eisenbrey raised questions about the exemption criteria for highly compensated employees, working supervisors, and concurrent duties. Critics' options seemed limited as Congress was unlikely to intervene directly or through a study commission. Two bills before Congress could impact the Department's rulemaking, including the JOBS Act, S. 1637. Two bills before Congress, the JOBS Act, S. 1637 and the FY2005 appropriations bill for the Department of Labor, could have affected the Department's rulemaking process. The House counterpart of S. 1637, H.R. 4520, was passed without the Harkin and Gregg amendments. On July 14, 2004, Senate Majority Leader Frist sought unanimous consent for consideration of H.R. 4520, proposing S. 1637 as a substitute with amendments. He also suggested requesting a conference with the House and appointing Senate conferees. Senator Frist acknowledged differences with the House bill and the need for changes to S. 1637. The next day, H.R. 4520 was called up in the Senate. On July 15, 2004, H.R. 4520 was passed in the Senate with the inclusion of the Harkin and Gregg amendments. Senate conferees were appointed immediately, while the House took some time to appoint theirs. By September 29, 2004, when the House moved to appoint conferees, the new DOL overtime provisions had already been in effect for nearly a month. Reversing these provisions, to which industry had already committed, would prove challenging. The House and Senate passed H.R. 4520 with amendments, but the Harkin/Gregg amendments were removed in conference. Despite concerns about the new overtime regulations, the House and Senate proceeded with the legislation. Senator Snowe highlighted the absence of addressing the Department of Labor's overtime regulations in the bill. Senator Reed expressed disappointment that the Harkin amendment was not included in the legislation, noting the Senate's previous support for it. Despite objections, the Senate voted to accept the conference report on H.R. 4520, which was signed into law as the \"JOBS\" bill. Additionally, the House Appropriations Committee approved funding for the Department of Labor for FY2005. Representative David Obey proposed language in the FY2005 Labor bill to restrict the Department from implementing final rule changes to Section 13(a)(1) exemptions. This amendment focused on duties tests, not earnings thresholds. Representative Ralph Regula argued against it, stating it would hinder federal law enforcement. Obey saw it as an effort to address labor issues. Representative David Obey proposed an amendment in the FY2005 Labor bill to restrict the Department from implementing final rule changes to Section 13(a)(1) exemptions. The amendment was defeated in the full Committee by a party-line vote. Obey plans to offer a similar amendment when the appropriations measure is called up in the House. On September 7, 2004, a report was made to the full House on H.R. 5006 with discussions to begin. On September 7, 2004, a report was made to the full House on H.R. 5006 with discussions to begin the following day. Representative Louise Slaughter expressed concerns about workers losing access to overtime pay under new rules, while Representative Marsha Blackburn defended the reforms as worker-friendly. The House adopted the rule (H.Res. 754) and prepared for further debate. Representative Obey proposed an amendment to block sections of a new Departmental rule, but was threatened with the shutdown of the House if he proceeded. Despite calling the action \"outrageous,\" he did not introduce the amendment at that time. However, on September 9, he did propose the amendment to H.R. 5006, which was initially challenged by Representative Boehner but ultimately allowed to proceed. The amendment raised concerns about leaving the Department unable to enforce new rules without a clear alternative. Representative Obey proposed an amendment to block sections of a new Departmental rule, but was threatened with the shutdown of the House if he proceeded. Despite calling the action \"outrageous,\" he did not introduce the amendment at that time. However, on September 9, he did propose the amendment to H.R. 5006, which was initially challenged by Representative Boehner but ultimately allowed to proceed. The amendment raised concerns about leaving the Department unable to enforce new rules without a clear alternative. Boehner stated that the Secretary of Labor would need to start the regulatory process over to develop new regulations for worker overtime protections. Regula argued that the old regulations were gone, while Obey believed the Department of Labor could immediately reimplement previous overtime compensation regulations. On passage of the Obey/Miller amendment, the vote was 223 yeas to 193 nays\u2014the critics of the Department of Labor's rule having won a momentary victory. Senator Specter expressed discomfort with new overtime pay rules during hearings on the 2004 appropriations measure. He introduced new legislation for the 2005 appropriation for the Department of Labor on September 15, 2004.
