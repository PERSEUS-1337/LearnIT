    "content": "In this paper, a new encoder-decoder model called TP-N2F is proposed for Natural- to Formal-language generation. The model utilizes Tensor Product Representations (TPRs) to capture symbolic structure information from natural-language inputs. TP-N2F outperforms LSTM-based Seq2Seq models and achieves state-of-the-art results on two benchmarks. The TP-N2F model outperforms LSTM-based Seq2Seq models on MathQA and AlgoList datasets by using TPRs to capture relational structure information for symbolic reasoning. Relational representations are crucial for human cognition, and most existing deep learning models do not explicitly capture this. The TP-N2F model introduces a novel neural architecture, TP-N2F, to address natural-to-formal language generation tasks by encoding symbolic structures using Tensor Product Representations (TPRs). This model outperforms LSTM-based Seq2Seq models by capturing relational structure information for symbolic reasoning. The TP-N2F model proposes a role-level analysis of N2F tasks and introduces a new neural-network-level implementation that combines binding and unbinding operations of TPRs for generation tasks through deep learning. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on N2F tasks requiring symbolic reasoning and program synthesis. The TPR embedding of a symbol structure is the sum of embeddings of its constituents, each comprising a role and its filler. The embedding is constructed using the tensor product operation, \u2297, joining the role and filler embeddings. The TPR embedding of a symbol structure involves the tensor product operation, \u2297, combining role and filler embeddings. Each constituent of the structure is represented by a role vector and a filler vector. The TPR embedding of a symbol structure involves the tensor product operation, \u2297, combining role and filler embeddings. Each constituent of the structure is represented by a role vector and a filler vector, enabling recovery of the filler of any role in a structure given its TPR. The role matrix R has a left inverse U, allowing for unbinding vectors u j to recover fillers in a structure with TPR T. The architecture uses TPR binding with role vectors r i and TPR unbinding with u j to generate output relational tuples from tensor H. The binding and unbinding vectors used are not related to each other in this proposed TP-N2F neural network. The TP-N2F neural network architecture operates over TPRs to solve N2F tasks using a role-level description. Natural-language input is represented as an order-2 role structure, while output is represented with a new order-3 recursive role structure. The TP-N2F encoder utilizes LSTMs to produce filler and role vectors bound together with tensor products. The TP-N2F neural network architecture uses tensor products to create a context for attention in the decoder. The word-level TPRs are flattened and fed into the Reasoning MLP to encode the problem statement and generate a solution. The TP-N2F decoder attentional LSTM outputs a relational tuple at each time step. The model learns to shape the order-3 tensor into a TPR for a specific tuple. The TP-N2F model implements TPR binding and unbinding operations to solve N2F tasks. The neural network implementation of N2F tasks uses role-level description to compose tensor representations for each word token in a sentence. Role vectors and filler vectors are soft-selected from learned dictionaries to encode grammatical roles and lexical semantics, respectively. This mechanism follows Palangi et al. (2018) and aims to achieve similar results. The neural network implementation of N2F tasks uses role-level description to compose tensor representations for word tokens in a sentence. Token embeddings encode grammatical roles and lexical semantics. TPRs offer advantages in interpreting natural language and avoid BoW confusion. The proposed recursive role-level description represents symbolic relational tuples with relation and argument tokens. The recursive role-level description represents symbolic relational tuples with relation and argument tokens, using TPR encoding to compose tensor representations for word tokens in a sentence. The proposed scheme contrasts with the TPR scheme by embedding n-ary-relation tuples as order-3 tensors, simplifying unbinding of arguments. The order-3 tensor H is a TPR resulting from successful learning, different from the order-2 tensor T S. The decoder generates output relational tuples based on Eq. 3 structure and unbinding operations. If unbinding roles from an unknown tensor T produces target fillers, then T equals the TPR generated by those role/filler pairs. The decoder operates on the TPR of Eq. 3 to produce filler vectors matching the target relational tuples. The learning strategy involves a mapping function f that generates a tensor T F from a structural representation of natural-language input. The TP-N2F model consists of encoding, mapping, and decoding steps, implemented by the TP-N2F Encoder and Reasoning Module MLP. The Reasoning Module, implemented by an MLP, maps the natural-language-structure encoding to generate correct output programs. The TP-N2F Decoder decodes the relational tuples using TPR unbinding and an attention mechanism over individual-word TPRs. The TP-N2F encoder encodes each word token by softselecting fillers. The role scheme encodes word tokens by softselecting fillers and roles using two LSTMs, Filler-LSTM and Role-LSTM. Fillers and roles are embedded as vectors, learned through softmax scores and functions. The token is encoded as the tensor product of the filler and role vectors. The TP-N2F encoder uses tensor products of vectors to encode sequences, with a Reasoning MLP for mapping. The TP-N2F Decoder generates relational tuples using an attentional LSTM and unbinding module. The Tuple-LSTM encoder outputs hidden states to approximate a relational tuple. The unbinding module decodes the relational tuple from the hidden state using positional unbinding vectors. The TP-N2F decoder computes relational unbinding vectors to decode the relational tuple from hidden states. It uses TPR theory to generate softmax probability distributions for relations and arguments separately during inference. The TP-N2F model uses greedy decoding to decode relational tuples, concatenating relation and argument vectors for input to the Tuple-LSTM. It is trained with back-propagation using the Adam optimizer and teacher-forcing. The decoder selects relation and argument tokens from respective vocabularies, with loss calculated as the sum of cross entropy between true labels and predicted tokens. The model is evaluated on generating operation sequences for N2F tasks. The TP-N2F model achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating operation sequences for math problems and Lisp programs. The behavior of unbinding relation vectors in the model is analyzed. Experiments and datasets details are provided in the Appendix. The model is tested on the MathQA dataset, consisting of 37k math word problems with corresponding operation sequences. TP-N2F generates operation sequences for math problems using a corresponding list of multi-choice options. It outperforms the seq2prog model in accuracy for both execution and operation sequences. The model is tested on the MathQA dataset with 37k math word problems. The SEQ2PROG-best model achieved the best results after an extensive hyperparameter search. Experiments showed the importance of the TP-N2F encoder and decoder components for generating Lisp programs. The model was evaluated on the AlgoLisp dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance in program synthesis tasks. The AlgoLisp dataset is a program synthesis dataset with problem descriptions, Lisp program trees, and testing pairs. Evaluation metrics include accuracy on test cases. Results are compared with other models like LSTM seq2seq and Seq2Tree. The dataset has 10% noisy data, and results are reported on both full and cleaned test sets. The TP-N2F decoder from the Tree2Tree autoencoder (SAPS) outperforms existing models on the full and cleaned test sets. Ablation experiments show that the TP-N2F Decoder is more beneficial than the TP-N2F Encoder for tasks involving lisp codes due to their reliance on structure representations. The model's learned structure is analyzed by extracting unbinding relation vectors and clustering them using Kmeans, showing that vectors with similar semantics are grouped together. The AlgoLisp dataset contains 4 clusters, grouping functions like partial/lambda functions and sort functions together, as well as string processing functions. The TP-N2F decoder induces role structures using weak supervision signals from question/operation-sequence-answer pairs. N2F tasks involve symbolic reasoning and semantic parsing, requiring models with strong structure-learning ability. TPR is a promising technique for encoding symbolic structural information and modeling symbolic reasoning. Our proposed TP-N2F neural model combines TPR binding and TPR unbinding to learn structure representation mappings explicitly, unlike previous models. Researchers are increasingly focusing on N2F tasks, but existing models either lack explicit structural information encoding or are task-specific. Our model can be applied to various tasks. Our proposed TP-N2F neural model combines TPR binding and TPR unbinding for structure representation mappings. It achieves state-of-the-art results on N2F tasks, emphasizing the importance of both encoder and decoder. Future work includes combining TP-N2F with large-scale deep learning models like BERT for other generation tasks. The experiments of TP-N2F on MathQA dataset involve generating operation sequences for math word problems, executing the operations to find solutions, and computing multi-choice accuracy. Around 30% of examples are noisy, leading to incorrect answers in the execution script. The AlgoLisp dataset is a program synthesis dataset with training, development, and testing samples. Each sample includes a problem description, a Lisp program tree, and input-output testing pairs. The program tree is parsed into a sequence of commands, and an execution script is provided to run the generated program with evaluation metrics for accuracy. The AlgoLisp dataset includes evaluation metrics like Acc, 50p-Acc, and M-Acc. It has 10% noise data and results are reported on both full and cleaned test sets. Hyperparameters for TP-N2F encoder and decoder are specified. In the MathQA experiment, specific values are used for nF, nR, dF, dR, dRel, dArg, and dPos, with training for 60 epochs at a learning rate of 0.00115. In the AlgoLisp dataset experiment, hyperparameters include nF = 150, nR = 50, dF = 30, dR = 30, dRel = 30, dArg = 20, dPos = 5, trained for 50 epochs with learning rate 0.00115. The reasoning module has one layer, similar to MathQA. Padding symbols are added for function calls with fewer than three arguments. The attention mechanism used in the TP-N2F ENCODER involves computing dot products between inputs and generating softmax scores. Unbinding processes are applied to encode operator-argument bindings, followed by generating unbinding vectors for operators to encode arguments. The TP-N2F ENCODER uses an attention mechanism to compute dot products between inputs and generate softmax scores. Unbinding processes encode operator-argument bindings, generating unbinding vectors for operators to encode arguments. The generated vectors produce probability distributions over symbolic outputs, used in the cross-entropy loss function. The most probable symbols are selected for generating a single symbolic output. The task involves finding the length of a segment e rounded down based on given coordinates b, c, and d. The array of numbers a can be manipulated by replacing the median with the sum of its digits until it becomes a single digit number. Given numbers a, b, c, and e, find the length of segment f squared by reversing the digits in d and finding the maximum value within the range of 1 to b. The curr_chunk contains a series of mathematical operations involving variables and functions, including multiplication, addition, lambda functions, and reductions. The curr_chunk discusses the results of running K-means clustering on datasets with different numbers of clusters. It highlights how operators or functions with similar semantics tend to be clustered together, such as arithmetic operators in the MathQA dataset and basic arithmetic functions in the AlgoLisp dataset."
