    "content": "The \"Aid for Trade Act of 1993\" may be cited as the short title for this legislation. The Congress acknowledges the need to reassess foreign assistance priorities post-Cold War, emphasizing the importance of leveraging aid for economic competitiveness and building commercial relationships. Despite OECD agreements to limit tied aid, US competitors effectively use aid to expand markets. In 1989, only 35 cents of foreign aid went to American goods, increasing to 70% in 1991 through cash assistance. The Agency for International Development has not adequately responded to the need to use foreign assistance for developing long-term commercial relationships. The Trade and Development Agency is established. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended to include financing for capital projects in developing and middle-income countries. $435,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 1994 for this purpose. A capital project is defined as a construction, expansion, or alteration project. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended to include financing for capital projects in developing and middle-income countries, with $435,000,000 authorized for fiscal year 1994. A capital project involves the construction, expansion, or alteration of physical facilities, infrastructure, equipment procurement, feasibility studies, and related engineering services. SEC. 4. LIMITS ON CASH TRANSFERS.\n\n    Cash transfers are limited to a percentage of Economic Support Funds for fiscal years 1994-1998: 50%, 45%, 40%, 35%, and 30% respectively. Cash transfers are defined as assistance provided as cash payments not used for US goods/services or debt repayment. Economic Support Funds refer to assistance under chapter 4 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. \n\nSEC. 5. PROCUREMENT REQUIREMENTS. SEC. 5. PROCUREMENT REQUIREMENTS. Section 604 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended to address procurement. The policy of the United States is to prioritize procurement of commodities and services from the U.S. in foreign assistance programs. However, suppliers from other donor countries can compete for U.S. Government-financed procurements. Funds for assistance can generally only be used for procurement in the U.S., recipient country, or developing countries. The policy of the United States prioritizes procurement of commodities and services from the U.S. in foreign assistance programs. However, procurement from other countries may be necessary in certain situations, such as when the required commodities or services are not available in the U.S. or recipient country. The United States prioritizes procurement from U.S. firms in foreign assistance programs, but may consider other countries if necessary. Delegation of authority for determinations is limited to specific levels within the agency. The procurement of motor vehicles using funds from this Act is restricted to specific levels within the agency and cannot be used for certain transactions exceeding $100,000. The procurement of motor vehicles using funds from this Act is restricted to specific levels within the agency and cannot be used for certain transactions exceeding $100,000. Exceptions to this rule include situations where motor vehicles cannot be manufactured in the United States to meet demands, projected lack of spare parts and service facilities for US manufactured vehicles, or no US manufacturers for export of the needed vehicle type. No funds under this Act can be used to purchase commodities in bulk at prices higher than the prevailing market price in the US. Determinations for procurement of vehicles exceeding certain quantities must be made in writing by the Assistant Administrator of the agency. The President shall authorize the procurement of agricultural commodities within the United States for transfer to recipient countries, except when not available in sufficient quantities. No funds under this Act can be used to buy agricultural products outside the US if the domestic price is lower than parity, unless the product cannot be produced in the US. Funds can be used for construction or engineering services from advanced developing countries with competitive capabilities. Code 941 allows advanced developing countries with competitive capabilities in international construction services to participate in procurement if they receive direct economic assistance and have their own foreign assistance programs that allow US firms to compete. Additionally, US dollars can be used for marine insurance on commodities procured in the US, following normal trade practices. Code 941 allows advanced developing countries with competitive capabilities in international construction services to participate in procurement if they receive direct economic assistance. In the event of discrimination against a marine insurance company authorized in the US, commodities destined for that country must be insured in the US. None of the funds for commodity import programs can be used unless the supplier certifies information to the agency. The agency requires suppliers to certify information about the commodity supplied, including its description, condition, source, and origin, to approve it for financing. Funds from certain cash transfer programs cannot be used for commodity import transactions unless they meet agency requirements for US source, origin, and nationality. The agency requires suppliers to certify information about the commodity supplied, including its description, condition, source, and origin, to approve it for financing. Funds from certain cash transfer programs cannot be used for commodity import transactions unless they meet agency requirements for US source, origin, and nationality. An exception allows financing transactions from countries other than the United States with approval from a higher-level agency official. The Administrator must submit an annual procurement report to Congress detailing procurement of US commodities and services, comparing Buy-America procurement from the previous year, and providing data on the percentages of commodities and services financed by the agency. The agency analyzes programs to identify shortfalls in meeting Buy-America requirements and identifies remedial actions to overcome them. A new section is added to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 for a Buy-America Advocate. \"SEC. 604A. BUY-AMERICA ADVOCATE.\" The Buy-America Advocate designated by the agency will foster U.S. business participation in development. The Advocate, a senior employee with import and private enterprise experience, reports directly to the Administrator. Responsibilities include reviewing procurement documentation. The Buy-America Advocate has the authority to access technical services and information related to procurement activities, review cash transfer programs for potential commodity import alternatives, and review waiver actions approved at the Assistant Administrator level. The Buy-America Advocate, at the Assistant Administrator level, recommends actions to maximize Buy America procurement opportunities, supports outreach activities with US businesses, coordinates with trade and investment officials, and assists in report preparation. The Administrator ensures the Advocate has qualified staff and necessary support. The Buy-America Advocate is supported by qualified staff and provided with necessary support to fulfill their responsibilities. Sections 496(n)(4) and 636(i) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 are repealed. The Secretary of the Treasury must report to Congress on the OECD agreement to restrict tied aid practices within 180 days of this Act's enactment. The report will cover the agreement's intentions, history, enforcement, efforts to circumvent it, ongoing tied aid projects' value, and a recommendation on reopening negotiations."
