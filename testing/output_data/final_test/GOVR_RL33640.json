    "content": "During the Cold War, the U.S. nuclear arsenal included various delivery vehicles for nuclear weapons, such as short-range missiles, medium-range missiles, surface ships, long-range missiles, submarines, and heavy bombers. These were categorized as nonstrategic and strategic nuclear delivery vehicles. By 1990, the U.S. had over 12,000 nuclear warheads deployed on 1,875 strategic nuclear delivery vehicles. The United States reduced its nuclear warheads to 1,968 operationally deployed strategic warheads by December 2009. The New START Treaty further decreased the number to 1,550 warheads on deployed launchers and heavy bombers by April 2010. As of September 1, 2018, the United States had 1,398 warheads on 659 deployed ICBMs and SLBMs. The United States had 1,398 warheads on 659 deployed ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers as of September 1, 2018. Despite a significant decline in deployed warheads since the Cold War, nuclear weapons remain crucial to U.S. national security strategy. The U.S. does not currently plan to eliminate its nuclear arsenal or abandon the strategy of nuclear deterrence. President Obama expressed a commitment to a world without nuclear weapons in 2009 but acknowledged that this goal would take time to achieve. The United States maintains a significant nuclear arsenal, with a focus on deterrence. Both the Obama and Trump administrations have emphasized the importance of modernizing and adjusting strategic forces to ensure their capability in the future. The report emphasizes the need for a national commitment to maintain modern and effective nuclear forces, including developing a new low-yield warhead for deployment. Congress generally supports U.S. nuclear posture and ongoing modernization programs, but concerns about costs and trade-offs within the defense budget have arisen. Senator James Inhofe may address these concerns in the 116th Congress. In the 116th Congress, Senator James Inhofe supports nuclear modernization programs, while Representative Adam Smith criticizes the $1.5 trillion plan for new nuclear weapons. The report reviews the U.S. strategic nuclear force structure, detailing changes since the Cold War and ongoing modernization efforts for delivery vehicles. The United States maintains a \"triad\" of strategic nuclear delivery vehicles since the early 1960s, with different basing modes to enhance deterrence and ensure survivability in the event of a Soviet first strike. The United States has a triad of strategic nuclear delivery vehicles to enhance deterrence and survivability in case of a Soviet first strike. The number of delivery vehicles steadily increased through the mid-1960s, peaking at 2,268 in 1967, and then remained relatively stable until 1990, with between 1,875 and 2,200 ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers in the force structure. The number of warheads carried on US strategic nuclear delivery vehicles increased sharply through 1975, peaking at around 13,600 warheads in 1987. This increase was due to the deployment of ICBMs and SLBMs with multiple warheads, known as MIRVs. The deployment of the Minuteman III ICBM with 3 warheads on each missile in 1970 and the Poseidon SLBM with 10 warheads on each missile in 1971 contributed to the rise in warheads. The deployment of the Peacekeeper (MX) in the mid-1980s also led to an increase in warheads. In the mid-1980s, the United States deployed the Peacekeeper (MX) ICBM with 10 warheads on each missile. By 1990, the US had around 12,304 warheads on its ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers. This included Minuteman II and III missiles, Peacekeeper (MX) missiles, Poseidon submarines with Trident missiles, and bomber forces with B-52H, B-1, B-52G, and B-2 bombers carrying over 4,648 weapons. During the 1990s, the United States reduced its strategic nuclear arsenal in response to the 1991 START Treaty, maintaining a triad of forces with warheads on ICBMs, SLBMs, and bombers for flexibility in nuclear planning. The mix of forces also hedged against problems in any single delivery system, as the US retired various warheads and missiles, reducing redundancy in its force. The 1991 START Treaty limited the US to a maximum of 6,000 weapons. The 1991 START Treaty limited the United States to a maximum of 6,000 total warheads, with counting rules determining how many warheads would count against the treaty's limits. Different rules applied to ICBMs, SLBMs, and bombers, leading to varying estimates of the numbers of warheads on U.S. strategic nuclear forces during the 1990s. The United States reduced its nuclear weapons from 9,300 warheads in 1991 to approximately 1,900 warheads by early 2010, with around 850 delivery vehicles. The United States reduced its nuclear weapons from 9,300 warheads in 1991 to around 1,900 warheads on 850 delivery vehicles by early 2015. This included adding to its Trident fleet, retiring Poseidon submarines and Minuteman II missiles, deploying B-2 bombers, and removing older B-52G bombers from the nuclear fleet. In 2001, warheads were deployed on 18 Trident submarines, 500 Minuteman III ICBMs, 50 Peacekeeper (MX) missiles, 94 B-52H bombers, and 21 B-2 bombers. The United States reduced its nuclear arsenal from 9,300 warheads in 1991 to around 1,900 warheads on 850 delivery vehicles by early 2015. This involved deploying Trident submarines, retiring older submarines and missiles, adding B-2 bombers, and phasing out B-52G bombers. In 1994, to comply with the second START Treaty, the US planned to deploy 500 Minuteman III ICBMs, 14 Trident submarines, 76 B-52 bombers, and 21 B-2 bombers. The START II Treaty was never ratified, and Congress prevented unilateral reductions in US forces. The Clinton Administration was prevented by Congress from reducing U.S. forces unilaterally to START II limits. The Navy and Air Force continued to plan for the forces described and eventually implemented those changes. The George W. Bush Administration aimed to reduce strategic nuclear forces to 1,700-2,200 \"operationally deployed warheads\" by 2001, as stated in the 2002 Moscow Treaty. Operationally deployed warheads are those available immediately to meet unexpected contingencies. The Bush Administration aimed to reduce U.S. strategic nuclear forces to 1,700-2,200 \"operationally deployed warheads\" by 2001, as stated in the 2002 Moscow Treaty. The Administration did not offer a rationale for retaining a triad of ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers, but Admiral James Ellis highlighted the differing capabilities of each system. The Administration did not specify how it would reduce the U.S. arsenal from around 6,000 warheads to the lower level of 2,200 operationally deployed warheads. The Bush Administration aimed to reduce U.S. strategic nuclear forces to 1,700-2,200 \"operationally deployed warheads\" by 2001, as stated in the 2002 Moscow Treaty. After Congress removed restrictions, the United States eliminated 50 Peacekeeper ICBMs and continued plans to remove four Trident submarines from service, reducing U.S. forces to around 5,000 warheads on 950 delivery vehicles in 2006. Additionally, two Trident submarines remaining in the fleet would be in overhaul at any given time, further reducing the U.S. deployed force by 200 to 400 warheads. The Bush Administration aimed to reduce U.S. strategic nuclear forces to 1,700-2,200 \"operationally deployed warheads\" by 2001. Congress removed restrictions, leading to the elimination of 50 Peacekeeper ICBMs and plans to remove four Trident submarines. This would further reduce the U.S. deployed force by 200 to 400 warheads. The Obama Administration indicated in the 2010 NPR that the United States would retain a triad of ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers as it reduced its forces to the limits in the 2010 New START Treaty. The 2010 NPR stated that the United States would maintain a triad of ICBMs, SLBMs, and bombers to ensure strategic stability at reduced warhead numbers. Each leg of the Triad offers unique advantages, with submarines being the most survivable, ICBMs contributing to stability, and bombers providing visible deterrence in crisis situations. The NPR also emphasized the importance of retaining sufficient force structure in each leg to allow for effective hedging in case of unexpected technological or operational issues. The Obama Administration continued to support the triad of ICBMs, SLBMs, and bombers, even as it reduced U.S. nuclear forces under New START. The decision to maintain the triad was based on the need to maintain strategic stability and hedge against potential technical problems or vulnerabilities. The Obama Administration released a report detailing the force structure for U.S. nuclear forces under New START, with reductions to be completed by February 5, 2018. The force structure includes deploying all Minuteman III missiles with a single warhead, retaining Trident submarines, and converting some heavy bombers to conventional-only missions. The Trump Administration has continued to adjust the U.S. nuclear force accordingly. The Trump Administration has adjusted the U.S. nuclear force to meet planned structure, with 1,398 warheads on 659 deployed ICBMs. The New START limits of 700 deployed launchers and 1,550 warheads are expected to be reached when Ohio-class submarines return to active duty. The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review states that New START will remain in effect through 2021. The NPR notes that New START will remain in effect through 2021, with the option to extend it until 2026. It does not mention if the U.S. will pursue an extension or its plans for force structure post-2021. The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review reaffirms commitment to the nuclear triad and modernization programs. The United States deployed 50 Peacekeeper ICBMs with multiple warheads in the late 1980s. The START II Treaty would have banned these missiles, leading to Pentagon planning for their elimination. Congress prohibited spending on deactivation until START II entered into force, delaying the process. The Bush Administration requested $14 million in FY2002 to retire the Peacekeeper missiles, which were deactivated by the Air Force between October 2002 and September 2005. The MK21 reentry vehicles and W87 warheads from these missiles have been placed in storage for potential redeployment on Minuteman III missiles. The Air Force retained the Peacekeeper missile silos when deactivating the missiles, allowing the warheads to remain outside of treaty limits. The United States retained warheads from deactivated Peacekeeper missiles outside treaty limits until START expired in 2009. Under the New START Treaty, the US can eliminate silos without blowing them up, as demonstrated by filling them with gravel in 2015. Minuteman III ICBMs are located at three Air Force bases. The Air Force deactivated missiles in Malmstrom's 564th Missile Squadron, known as the \"odd squad,\" due to a different communications and launch control system. The drawdown of deployed Minuteman III ballistic missiles from 500 to 450 began in Fiscal Year 2007, with reentry vehicles removed in early 2008. The Air Force deactivated missiles in Malmstrom's 564th Missile Squadron, known as the \"odd squad,\" in early 2008. The squadron was deactivated by the end of August 2008, with the missiles removed from their silos by July 2008. General Cartwright stated that the Air Force retired the missiles to use them as test assets for the remaining force, ensuring a robust test program. The decision to retire the missiles raised questions as it was 10 years before the test assets would run out. The Air Force retired 50 ICBMs at Malmstrom to reduce long-term costs, but it may not save money in the short term due to deactivation expenses. The missiles were used as test assets and included in modernization programs. The silos were retained initially but later filled with gravel in 2014 to comply with the New START Treaty. The Air Force retired 50 Minuteman missiles in 2014 by filling silos with gravel to comply with New START limits. Congress questioned the rationale, believing more silos increased U.S. security. Congress required a detailed report before any missile withdrawal could begin. The Secretary of Defense submitted a report to Congress in late March 2007 regarding the retirement of 50 Minuteman III missiles. The program allowed for participation in transforming the Pentagon in response to post-Cold War threats. The missiles may still have a role in U.S. national security strategy, but may not be needed in the same numbers as during the Soviet threat. The United States faced the Soviet threat and the question of how many ICBM silos were needed for deterrence. Congress tried to prevent the possible elimination of up to 50 silos under the New START Treaty. The House Armed Services Committee mandated the retention of all 450 ICBM silos through 2015 for national security interests. The Secretary of Defense mandated the preservation of intercontinental ballistic missile silos to maintain the interconnected command and control system. The Air Force conducted flight tests of Minuteman III missiles, launching from Vandenberg Air Force Base to the Kwajalein Atoll in the Pacific Ocean. The Air Force terminated a test in July 2018 due to an unspecified anomaly. The Obama Administration planned to retain 400 deployed Minuteman III ICBMs out of a total force of 450 launchers. This option would allow for deactivation and repair of damaged silos. Congress has also discussed the force structure for U.S. security. The Air Force implemented a plan to reduce ICBM launchers, completing the reductions by early June 2017. Currently, there are 400 silos with operational missiles, each with 1,200 total warheads. In 2001, to meet START limits, 2 warheads were removed from each Minuteman missile. The \"bulkhead\" platform on the reentry vehicle was also destroyed to comply with START rules. Under START II, the United States had to reduce the number of warheads on Minuteman III missiles from three to one. General Robert Smolen stated that the Air Force planned to maintain the ability to deploy 500 missiles with up to 800 warheads, with the flexibility to reload warheads if needed. This was in line with the 2001 NPR's indication of maintaining such flexibility. General Cartwright mentioned that some Minuteman missiles may carry multiple warheads, even after the reduction from 500 to 450 missiles. Major General Deppe confirmed that the Air Force would keep some Minuteman III missiles with multiple warheads. However, the Obama Administration stated that under the New START Treaty, all U.S. Minuteman III missiles will only carry one warhead to enhance nuclear balance stability. The Air Force completed the process of ensuring all Minuteman III missiles have a single warhead. The Air Force completed the process of ensuring all Minuteman III missiles have a single warhead on June 16, 2014, under the New START Treaty. The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review reaffirmed this deployment, allowing for the restoration of warheads if needed. Despite considerations to reduce the number of missiles further, the Administration decided not to pursue this approach. Each of the 400 deployed missiles under New START is equipped with one warhead. The Air Force pursued programs to improve the accuracy and reliability of the Minuteman fleet under New START. The program began in 1998, replacing propellant in the Minuteman motors to extend their life. By mid-2008, around 80% of the fleet had completed the PRP program. The Air Force completed the PRP program in 2013, with funding in FY2008 supporting the purchase of the final booster sets. The Guidance Replacement Program extended the service life of Minuteman missiles' guidance sets, improving maintainability and reliability while maintaining accuracy. The Air Force began flight testing a new guidance system in 1998, exceeding operational requirements. Production started in 2000, with 652 units purchased. Some accuracy issues were identified and corrected in 2002 and 2003. By August 2007, 425 Minuteman III missiles were upgraded. Deliveries of new guidance units continued until February 2009. Funding requests were made in FY2011 and FY2012 to complete the program, with no further requests in subsequent years. The Air Force's Propulsion System Rocket Engine (PSRE) program aims to rebuild and replace Minuteman postboost propulsion system components from the 1970s to reduce life-cycle costs and maintain reliability through 2020. By FY2009, 441 units were purchased for $128 million, with additional funding requested for 96 units in FY2010 and 37 units in FY2011. The program plans to purchase a total of 574 units, with no additional units planned for purchase in FY2012. The FY2012 budget does not support purchasing additional units but includes $26.1 million for installing units. The FY2013 budget request has $10.8 million for the same purpose. The Air Force has not requested more funding in subsequent years. The REACT targeting system was first installed in Minuteman launch control centers in the mid-1990s, allowing for quicker retargeting of missiles and reducing crew workload. A modernized version was deployed in 2006 to enhance command and control capabilities. This effort was completed in late 2006. The Air Force completed the SERV program in late 2006, deploying MK21/W-87 reentry vehicles on Minuteman missiles. The program included modifying software, changing missile mounting, and support equipment. Three successful flight tests were conducted in 2005, leading to the installation of 20 kits at F.E. Warren Air Force Base in 2006. Modifications began at Malmstrom in July 2007 and at Minot in July 2008, with a total of 47 missiles modified by early August 2007. Additional modification kits were purchased in FY2009, totaling 570 kits. In FY2009, the Air Force purchased 111 modification kits, bringing the total to 570 kits for the program. The installation process was completed by 2012 to ensure the reliability of Minuteman III missiles. The W-87 warheads were refurbished in 2005, extending their service life past 2025. Congress approved the Solid Rocket Motor Warm Line Program in the FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Bill to sustain Minuteman III solid rocket motor production capability. The program received $42.9 million in FY2010 and produced motors for four Minuteman ICBMs. The Air Force received $42.9 million in FY2010 to produce motors for Minuteman ICBMs. In FY2011, $44.2 million was requested for motors for additional ICBMs. The FY2012 budget includes $34 million to complete prior motor work. The FY2013 budget did not allocate funds for this program, but the Air Force supports solid rocket motor production through its Dem/Val program. The ICBM fuze modernization program aims to replace MK21 fuzes to meet warfighter requirements through 2030 due to fuzes exceeding their lifespan. The Air Force plans to procure modernized fuzes for the Minuteman fleet and the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) missile system. The program leverages technologies from the U.S. Navy and NNSA for efficiency and cost reduction. Common components include the radar module. The Air Force's fuze modernization program aims to reduce costs by leveraging common components such as the radar module. Funding for the program has increased in recent years but is now declining as the program nears completion. The Air Force received varying amounts of funding from FY2015 to FY2018, with a request for $172.9 million in FY2019. Funding will continue at over $130 million per year in FY2020 and FY2021, decreasing to $60 million in FY2022 and $2 million in FY2023. The Air Force's funding for the ICBM Dem/Val program has varied over the years, with appropriations of $72.9 million in FY2014, $30.9 million in FY2015, $39.8 million in FY2016, and $108.7 million in FY2017. The budget request for FY2018 saw a significant reduction to $10.7 million. This program aims to mature technologies for both the existing Minuteman fleet and the future Ground Based Strategic Deterrent. The Air Force's funding for the ICBM Dem/Val program has decreased significantly in the FY2018 budget, with a request for $41.9 million in FY2019. The program includes projects for ICBM guidance, propulsion, reentry vehicles, and command and control applications. The Air Force is developing a new solid-state guidance system for the ICBM fleet to increase accuracy and target destruction capabilities. However, there are concerns about whether the program is meeting Air Force needs. Additionally, the DOD is exploring improvements to current propulsion systems to support the ICBM force and reentry systems beyond. DOD is seeking to support reentry systems beyond their original design life and develop advanced technologies for future requirements. The Air Force began exploring options for a new missile to replace the Minuteman III in 2002, with plans to deploy it in 2018. General Frank Klotz recommended an evolutionary approach to modernize the existing missile components. The Air Force is considering modernizing the existing Minuteman III missiles rather than developing new ones from scratch. General Robert Kehler believes the missile should remain viable through 2030, with ongoing flight tests and surveillance programs providing necessary data. Plans for a follow-on system post-2030 are also being considered through a capabilities-based assessment. The Air Force began a capabilities-based assessment of its land-based deterrent in early 2011 and initiated a new Analysis of Alternatives (AOA) for the ICBM force in 2012. Funding was allocated for the study in the FY2012, FY2013, and FY2014 budgets, with a focus on the Ground-based Strategic Deterrence (GBSD) project area. In January 2013, the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center issued a \"Broad Agency Announcement (BAA)\" for concepts addressing modernization or replacement of the ground-based leg of the nuclear triad. The Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center created five possible paths for further analysis in the evaluation of alternatives for the future of the ICBM force. These paths include continuing to use the current Minuteman III baseline, incorporating incremental changes into the current system, designing a new fixed ICBM system, designing a new mobile ICBM system, and designing a new tunnel-based system. Some analysts were surprised at the possibility of deploying a new ICBM on mobile launchers or in tunnels. During the Cold War, the Air Force explored deployment concepts to enhance ICBM survivability against Soviet attacks. However, these costly and impractical ideas were abandoned after the Soviet Union's collapse and reductions in U.S. and Russian warheads. Some analysts criticized the Air Force's reconsideration of these concepts, suggesting retirement of the ICBM force instead. Others pointed out that the presence of these ideas in studies didn't guarantee implementation, citing the 2010 NPR's mention of mobile basing for ICBMs for increased warning and decision time. The Air Force considered mobile basing for ICBMs to increase warning and decision time, but the cost and complexity led to the elimination of these concepts. A 2014 study proposed a \"hybrid\" plan for the next generation ICBM, maintaining the basic design but replacing key components. The Air Force indicated that the GBSD program will replace the entire flight system. The Air Force's GBSD program will replace the entire flight system, retaining silo basing mode while modernizing ground facilities. Questions remain about the option of deploying missiles on mobile launchers and the associated costs. The priority is on designing a new missile for fixed silos, with mobile launch control facilities as a possibility. Funding for the program has been allocated for FY2016 and FY2017, with a reduced request for FY2018. The Air Force's Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) program funding was reduced by $78.2 million in FY2018 to align with an Independent Cost Estimate. Congress authorized $215.7 million for GBSD in the National Defense Authorization Act for 2018. Prohibitions on developing a mobile variant of the missile were extended through 2020. The Air Force requested $345 million for GBSD in FY2019, with Congress adding $69.4 million for a total authorization of $414.4 million. The conference report on the GBSD program did not provide a rationale for the $69.4 million increase in funding, but noted that the program was ahead of schedule and strongly supported as part of nuclear modernization efforts. It also required a plan to accelerate development, procurement, and fielding of the program for the full intercontinental ballistic missile weapon system. The program's cost is expected to rise rapidly over the next few years. The cost of the program will increase to $570.4 million in FY2020, $1.5 billion in FY2021, $2.5 billion in FY2022, and $3 billion in FY2023. The Air Force aims to deliver an integrated flight system by FY2029, with booster production starting in FY2026. Two contracts were awarded in FY2017 for the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction phase, running through FY2020. The program's total cost over 30 years was estimated at $62.3 billion in 2015. The program's total cost over 30 years was estimated at $62.3 billion in 2015, including funds for missile acquisition, command and control systems, and launch control center renovation. Recent reports show a discrepancy in cost estimates, with the Pentagon's CAPE estimating $85 billion for the program due to different assumptions and methodologies used. The Air Force and CAPE must agree on cost estimates for the GBSD program. Initial operational capacity with 9 missiles on alert is expected by 2029, with full deployment of 400 missiles by 2036. New command and control systems will be installed in all 450 launch silos by 2037. The missile will have an \"open architecture\" for technology upgrades over its 60-year lifespan, aiming to reduce maintenance costs. Boeing's modular, open architecture system aims to reduce maintenance costs for the Air Force. Officials believe a new system will be more modern, capable, and cost-effective than extending the life of the Minuteman III. The system will be flexible for various scenarios and have improved performance against modern missile defenses. The U.S. fleet of ballistic missile submarines includes 14 Trident submarines, each now carrying 20 missiles to comply with New START launcher limits. Empty launch tubes have been modified to no longer carry or launch missiles. The United States reduced its Trident fleet to 14 submarines in the 1990s, with 12 operational submarines carrying 240 deployed launchers. The submarines were equipped with Trident missiles, each capable of carrying up to 8 warheads. The Navy deployed 8 submarines with Trident I missiles at Bangor, WA, and 10 submarines with Trident II missiles at Kings Bay, GA. The Clinton Administration decided to \"backfit\" 4 older submarines under the 1994 Nuclear Posture Review. The Bush Administration endorsed a plan to increase the Trident fleet to 14 submarines, with 4 older submarines backfitted to carry Trident II missiles. The Navy also converted 4 submarines to carry conventional weapons, designating them as guided missile submarines (SSGNs). The 2010 NPR supported a force of 14 Trident submarines, with a possibility of reducing to 12 in the future. Each submarine will deploy with 20 missiles to meet New START reductions, maintaining a force of 14 Trident submarines. The Navy converted four Trident submarines (USS Ohio, USS Michigan, USS Florida, and USS Georgia) to carry conventional cruise missiles and other weapons. The conversion process cost approximately $1 billion and took two years for each submarine. The SSGNs can carry 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles, special forces troops, and mini-submarines. The USS Ohio completed the conversion in January 2006 and achieved operational status in November 2007. The USS Georgia was scheduled for deployment in March 2008, with the other submarines to follow later in the year. According to Admiral Stephen Johnson, all four Trident submarines had returned to service by mid-2008, with two on routine patrols. The submarines are expected to remain in service through the mid-2020s. The Navy backfitted the submarines with Trident II (D-5) missiles, replacing the aging C-4 missiles. This upgrade provided improved accuracy, larger payload, and greater range for the submarines to operate in a larger area and cover more targets. The Bush and Obama Administrations enhanced Trident submarines to deter adversaries. Four submarines in Bangor underwent a backfit program, completing in 2002. The upgrade included refueling the reactor and improving strategic stability. The Navy completed maintenance objectives on Trident submarines ahead of schedule and under budget, including refueling the reactor, upgrading equipment, and replacing obsolete systems. All Trident submarines now carry Trident II missiles, with the last Trident I missiles removed in 2004. The fleet was balanced with 14 submarines, each deploying 7 Trident missiles. After initially planning to balance the Trident fleet with 7 submarines at each of the 2 bases, the Navy changed its plans due to the Bush Administration's Nuclear Posture Review. The fleet was ultimately balanced with 9 submarines at Bangor and 5 submarines at Kings Bay, with 7 operational submarines at Bangor and 5 at Kings Bay. The Navy began transferring submarines from Kings Bay to Bangor in 2002, completing the fifth transfer in September 2005. The Navy transferred submarines from Kings Bay to Bangor in September 2005 to improve coverage of targets in China and North Korea. The Trident II (D-5) missiles can carry up to eight warheads each, and the United States could remove warheads from Trident missiles to comply with the original START Treaty. The United States reduced the number of warheads on Trident submarines to comply with arms control treaties, including the 2002 Moscow Treaty and the New START Treaty. The Navy reduced the number of warheads on Trident missiles to meet the limits set by these treaties. Unlike the previous START Treaty, the United States can now deploy different numbers of warheads on different missiles. The United States can deploy varying numbers of warheads on different missiles, tailoring each missile to its assigned mission. It only needs to report the total number of deployed warheads on all strategic nuclear delivery vehicles. Verification of specific missile warhead numbers can be done through random inspections. The Navy can restore warheads to Trident missiles if needed, as the submarines have been extended in service from 30 to 42 years. The Navy has extended the operating lifetime of Trident submarines to at least 42 years, with two 20-year cycles separated by a refueling overhaul. The submarines will begin to retire from the fleet in 2027. The Navy has purchased 533 D-5 missiles and continues to produce rocket motors and procure alternation kits to support the extended service life of the submarines. The Navy plans to deploy its submarines with only 240 ballistic missiles. The Navy is extending the life of Trident submarines to 42 years, with plans to deploy them with 240 ballistic missiles. Around 50 Trident missiles are available for use by Great Britain. The Navy is also working on a life extension program for Trident II missiles and allocated $5.5 billion for this purpose. Reports indicate that the Navy started loading submarines with the new missile in 2017. The Navy allocated $5.5 billion for the Trident II missile program in FY2008 and FY2009, supporting the purchase of 36 new missiles. Additional funding was allocated for missile modifications and life extension programs in subsequent years. In FY2012, $1.3 billion was budgeted for the Trident II missile program, including funds for new missile purchases, support costs, and life extension. In FY2013, $980 million was allocated to the Trident II Life Extension Program, with $1.2 billion requested for the program. The Navy continued to purchase components for the Trident II missiles in subsequent years, with budgets of $1.14 billion in FY2014, $1.17 billion in FY2015, and $1.1 billion in FY2016. Requests for FY2017, FY2018, and FY2019 were $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion, and $1.1 billion respectively. The Navy's budget for FY2019 includes $1.1 billion for the Trident II program, with $576.5 million for the life extension program and $502 million for operating costs. The Navy plans to spend $4.9 billion on Trident II modifications between FY2020 and 2023, with a focus on enhancing the capabilities of the MK4/W76 warhead. The program initially targeted 25% of warheads but now aims to cover over 60% of the stockpile. NNSA has completed 80% of production units through FY2017. NNSA has completed 80% of production units for the W76 Life Extension Program (LEP) through FY2017 and expects to finish production in 2019. The LEP aims to extend the warhead life by refurbishing various components. NNSA requested $224.1 million for the W76 LEP in FY2018 and $133.9 million in FY2019. The FY2019 budget introduces a new component to the LEP in response to the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review's call for a low-yield option in SLBM warheads. The NPR argues that deploying a low-yield SLBM warhead will prevent Russian miscalculation on limited nuclear first use. The W76-2 modification was not funded in the FY2019 budget request, but the Administration plans to work with Congress for support. The White House requested $65 million for a modification to produce low-yield ballistic missiles to replace higher-yield weapons. Congress approved the funding in the Energy and Water Appropriations Act, emphasizing compliance with the W76-2 direction. Congress requested a report detailing the plan, costs, and implications of producing a low-yield variant of the W76 warhead, including military requirements. Questions arose during the W76 life extension program regarding the warhead's reliability and management practices at the National Nuclear Security Administration. These issues raised concerns about meeting the delivery date for the warhead. The W76 warhead delivery was delayed due to technical issues, with the first refurbished warhead accepted in August 2009. The W88 warhead, added to the U.S. nuclear stockpile in the late 1980s, also needs work for safety and reliability. The W88 warhead is in the development engineering phase for Alteration (ALT) 370 to replace aging components. The Nuclear Weapons Council addressed potential problems with the warhead's high explosive during the ALT 370 program, receiving funding in FY2014, FY2015, and FY2016. In FY2014, FY2015, and FY2016, the Nuclear Weapons Council received funding for the W88 warhead Alteration program. The program's budget increased to $281.1 million in FY2017, with further requests for $332.3 million in FY2018 and $304.3 million in FY2019. The funding increase in FY2018 allowed for an expanded scope of work on the weapon, with plans to produce the first production unit in 2020. The Navy's development and design work on the new Columbia class ballistic missile submarines, replacing the Ohio-class Trident submarines. The procurement of the new submarines was delayed by two years, with the first one entering the fleet in 2031. The number of SSBNs in the fleet is expected to decline to 10 in the 2030s. The Navy's SSBN(X) program received significant funding in the Navy's budget from FY2010 to FY2016, with allocations for research, development, and submarine development. The program faced delays, resulting in adjusted budget allocations in subsequent years. In FY2017, additional funding was requested for the Ohio-replacement (ORP) program, with a focus on submarine development. In FY2017, the Navy allocated $700.1 million for submarine development and $390.3 million for nuclear power systems. $773.1 million was requested for advanced procurement to support detailed design work. The House and Senate authorized the funding in the Defense Authorization Bill, with the House moving the advanced procurement funds to the National Sea-based Deterrent Fund. Congress approved the full funding requests in the FY2017 National Defense Authorization Act. In FY2018, $1.9 billion was requested for the Columbia class submarine, with allocations for submarine development and advanced nuclear power. In FY2018, the Navy allocated $776.2 million for submarine development, $265.5 million for advanced nuclear power systems, and $842.9 million for advanced procurement. Congress approved this request in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2018. For FY2019, the Navy requested $3.8 billion for the Columbia Class submarine, with $514.8 million for submarine development, $256.1 million for advanced nuclear power systems, and $3 billion for advanced procurement. Congress authorized $526.8 million for submarine development and $3.2 billion for advanced procurement in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019. The FY2019 request is mainly driven by procurement of equipment needed to begin construction of the first submarine. The Navy allocated funds in FY2018 for submarine development, advanced nuclear power systems, and advanced procurement. In FY2019, $3.8 billion was requested for the Columbia Class submarine, with a significant portion allocated to advanced procurement. The largest amount, $1.7 billion, was for nuclear propulsion plant equipment. The timeline for construction was adjusted to reduce costs and risks, with advanced procurement starting in FY2017. The Navy plans to begin building the first hull of the Columbia Class submarine in 2021, with efforts to reduce costs to around $4.9 billion per submarine. Concerns have been raised about the program's total cost, estimated at $97-$102 billion, and its impact on the Navy's shipbuilding plans. The Navy plans to build 12 submarines with a total acquisition cost estimated at $98 billion, including $13 billion for research and development. Concerns have been raised about the program's impact on the Navy's shipbuilding budget. The Navy's plan to build 12 submarines with an estimated total cost of $98 billion could strain its shipbuilding budget. Navy officials warned that funding this program could result in the Navy having to forgo acquiring up to 32 other naval vessels. Without additional funding from Congress, the production of these submarines could severely impact the Navy's shipbuilding budget for over a decade. Admiral Richard Breckenridge suggested in 2013 that significant increases in funding are needed to avoid impairing the construction of other essential ships in the battle force. Admiral Richard Breckenridge proposed setting up a $4 billion annual supplemental fund outside the Navy's budget to support the construction of 12 ballistic missile submarines. Congress established the National Sea-based Deterrence Fund in the FY2015 National Defense Authorization Act, allowing for funding of these vessels. However, no additional funding has been appropriated for this program yet. In the FY2016 NDAA, Congress expanded funding transfer authority for the Navy to save costs on submarine procurement. The National Sea-based Deterrence Fund may protect the Navy's shipbuilding budget, but without increased appropriations, it would require funds from other Pentagon budgets. Admiral John Richardson continues to prioritize the Columbia class submarine. The Navy is prioritizing the Columbia class submarine, with Admiral John Richardson emphasizing its importance for national security. The new submarines will have 16 ballistic missile launch tubes, down from 24 on existing Trident submarines. Concerns were raised in Congress about the reduction in missiles per submarine, but Navy officials believe they can still deploy enough warheads due to the current security environment and the ability to \"upload\" warheads onto Trident missiles. In FY2012, Congress called for a study on plans for the SSBN(X) submarines, considering options with 16 or 20 launch tubes per submarine. The Office of Management and Budget suggested reducing the fleet to 10 submarines with 20 launch tubes each to save costs. The OMB analysis suggests reducing the number of launch tubes on each submarine to 20, potentially saving the Navy $7 billion over the fleet's lifespan. Analysts propose building 8 submarines instead of 12, saving $27 billion over 10 years and $120 billion overall. Increasing warheads on Trident missiles could compensate for fewer launch tubes without compromising mission capabilities. The Navy plans to reduce the number of launch tubes on each submarine to 20, potentially saving $7 billion. By equipping Trident missiles with more warheads, they can maintain mission capabilities while deploying fewer missiles. This strategy allows the US to retain a larger number of submarines within the New START treaty limits. The Navy plans to maintain a fleet of 12 submarines with continuous deployments from 2 bases to meet its requirements. Critics question the approach, as a fleet of 12 submarines will cost more to procure and operate than a fleet of 8 submarines. Maintaining 12 submarines allows the Navy to have 4-5 on station at any time for prompt missile launches. Critics question the necessity of maintaining a fleet of 12 submarines for continuous at-sea deterrence, arguing that a secure second strike deterrent can be maintained with fewer submarines. However, supporters, including Congress, emphasize the importance of a robust fleet for national security. The Air Force deployed a fleet of 96 B-1 bombers in the mid-1980s, but after crashes, only 92 remained in 2001. Plans to retire 30 bombers faced resistance from Congress. The B-1 served as a nuclear delivery vehicle until 1991, when it was converted to carry conventional weapons by 1997. The B-1 bomber was converted to carry conventional weapons in 1997 and is no longer equipped to carry nuclear weapons. In 2011, it was displayed to the Russians under the New START Treaty to confirm its non-nuclear status. The B-2 bomber, based at Whiteman AFB in Missouri, can carry B61 and B83 nuclear bombs but not cruise missiles. It has participated in various military campaigns and is designed for stealth to penetrate enemy defenses. The Air Force needs maintenance and modernization funding to support its mission involving around 452 B61 and B83 bombs for strategic bombers and 300 B61 bombs for fighter aircraft. The B61 has different versions, with the B61-7 for strategic use by B-2 bombers, and the B61-3, 4, and 10 for nonstrategic use by fighter aircraft like the F-16 and F-35. The B61-11 has a modified case for penetrating hardened targets. The ongoing life extension program includes the B61-7, Mod-3, Mod-4, and Mod-10 versions to create a new B61-mod 12 bomb. The Trump Administration plans to sustain the B83-1 past its retirement date until a suitable replacement is found, despite previous plans to retire it by 2025. Congress has raised concerns about the need and costs of the B61 life extension program, leading to funding restrictions in the past. The Obama Administration supported the life extension program for the B-61 bomb in the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review, aiming to enhance safety, security, and use control. However, costs for the program have increased, and the timeline has been delayed. The cost of the B-61 bomb life extension program has risen sharply, with estimates now exceeding $8 billion. The timeline for the program has also been delayed, with the first production unit expected in 2022 instead of 2017. Some in Congress have questioned the need for such a costly and complex program, but the Obama Administration argued that a less complex program now would require a second program later. The B61 life extension program aims to replace the B83 bomb in the U.S. stockpile. The Trump Administration supports the program but has concerns about replacing the B83. The B61-12 gravity bomb is expected to be available in 2020. The Air Force is designing a new tail kit for the B61 bomb to improve accuracy. The Air Force is developing a new tail kit for the B61 bomb to enhance accuracy and capabilities. Analysts debate whether this will create new military capabilities, contradicting the Obama Administration's stance. The modified B61-12 bomb will have increased accuracy and reduced yield, meeting operational requirements for the bomber fleet and providing nuclear assurance to U.S. allies in Europe. Flight tests for the B61-12 LEP have been conducted by the Air Force and NNSA since 2015. The B61 bomb underwent qualification flight tests in 2017 and 2018, integrating a new tail kit with bomb hardware. These tests evaluate the weapon's functions and the aircraft's delivery capability. Funding for the B61 Life Extension Program has been allocated by Congress, with the Air Force supporting the tailkit program. The Air Force requested $91.2 million in FY2018, a reduction from the expected $151 million. Additional funding was requested for advanced procurement of tailkit assemblies. In FY2019, $92 million was requested for research and development on the B61 tailkit, along with $162 million for procurement of 250 tailkit assemblies to integrate the B61-12 into the force by the early 2020s. The Air Force maintains 66 nuclear capable B-52H aircraft at two bases, with 44 assigned to nuclear missions daily. The B-52 bomber fleet has faced proposed cuts over the past 25 years, with plans to reduce the fleet from 94 to 56 aircraft in the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review. The Air Force has considered retiring 18 bombers in the budget request for FY2007. The Air Force planned to retire 18 bombers in FY2007 and 20 in FY2008, while continuing to improve the B-1, B-2, and B-52 bombers' capabilities. New weapons have increased the efficiency of the bomber platform, allowing for a reduced number of deployed bombers without compromising overall capabilities. General Cartwright highlighted the efficiency of next-generation weapons like air-launched cruise missiles and joint direct attack munitions. The Air Force planned to retire 18 bombers in FY2007 and 20 in FY2008, while continuing to deploy B-52 bombers at two bases. Congress rejected the Pentagon's proposals to retire B-52 aircraft, citing a growing need for long-range conventional strike capabilities. The Senate allowed the retirement of 18 B-52 aircraft but emphasized no further reductions to maintain strike capabilities. The conference committee combined provisions to limit the retirement of B-52 aircraft to 18 after a report submission, requiring the Air Force to retain at least 44 \"combat coded\" aircraft until 2018 or until a new long-range strike aircraft with equal or greater capability is operational. Congress also mandated no funds could be used to retire B-52 aircraft until a modernization plan for the bomber fleets is submitted. The Air Force planned to reduce the B-52 fleet to 56 aircraft, with 32 combat coded aircraft included. They aimed to maintain 44 combat coded aircraft as mandated by Congress within the smaller fleet. The 20 aircraft planned for retirement in FY2008 would be stored at Barksdale Air Force Base. In FY2008, Congress mandated the Air Force to maintain a fleet of 74 B-52 bombers, with specific allocations for primary aircraft, backup aircraft, and attrition reserve. The Pentagon and STRATCOM consider the U.S. bomber fleet essential for long-range strike capabilities and conventional weapons. The Pentagon and STRATCOM prioritize the U.S. bomber fleet for long-range strike capabilities and conventional weapons. Discussions in 2006 suggested removing B-52 bombers from the nuclear mission, with potential reductions in their nuclear deterrence role in the future. However, a lack of focus on the bombers' nuclear mission led to an incident in 2007 involving live nuclear cruise missiles. The Air Force has established a new B-52 bomber squadron focused on the nuclear mission, adding 10 bombers to the existing fleet at Minot. This squadron will participate in more nuclear exercises and training missions, aiming to enhance operational proficiency, morale, and confidence in the nuclear mission. In April 2009, Secretary of Defense Gates announced that the Air Force planned to retain 76 B-52 bombers for the nuclear mission. The 2010 Nuclear Posture Review decided to convert some B-52s to carry only conventional weapons. By April 2014, the Obama Administration stated that the US would keep 42 deployed and 4 nondeployed nuclear-capable B-52 bombers, converting the rest to conventional-only. In September 2015, the Air Force began converting some B-52H bombers from nuclear to conventional capability, removing 30 bombers from New START accountability. As of March 2017, 41 bombers have been converted to carry only conventional weapons. The Air Force has converted 41 bombers to carry only conventional weapons, removing them from accountability under New START. The decision to retire Advanced Cruise Missiles was made after a study concluded that all ACMs should be retired, with some potentially being converted for other purposes. The Air Force plans to retire all Advanced Cruise Missiles, reducing the fleet to 528 missiles and consolidating them at Minot Air Force Base. Bombers at Barksdale may no longer have a nuclear mission. The ALCM will be sustained until 2030, with plans to replace it with a new Long Range Standoff cruise missile. The DOD budget request for FY2014 included $5 million for system engineering support for the new missile. The FY2014 DOD budget included $5 million for Air Force system engineering support for the new Long Range Standoff (LRSO) cruise missile. The FY2015 budget request indicated a three-year delay in the LRSO program due to fiscal constraints. Congress expressed concerns about the aging ALCMs and emphasized the importance of the LRSO in maintaining the nuclear triad. The Air Force requested funding for the new Long Range Standoff (LRSO) missile to replace the aging ALCM, citing reliability issues. Funding for the LRSO program increased significantly from $3.4 million in FY2015 to $36.6 million in FY2016, with expected funding to reach nearly $1.8 billion between FY2016 and FY2020. Congress appropriated $16.4 million for the LRSO in FY2016. The Air Force requested increased funding for the Long Range Standoff (LRSO) missile program, with plans to request a total of $2.6 billion between FY2018 and FY2022. Congress approved the FY2018 request of $451.2 million in the National Defense Authorization Act. The Air Force planned to request $615 million for the LRSO in FY2019 and $722.5 million in FY2020. The Air Force plans to request $722.5 million in FY2020 for the LRSO program, with reduced requests in subsequent years. Two contractors were selected for the TMRR phase, which will run for 4.5 years. Funding increased in FY2019 for continued system development. Congress mandated acceleration of the LRSO program in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019. The LRSO program requested a report on the joint development program with the W-80 warhead. NNSA is conducting a life-extension program on the W80 warhead, with plans for the W80-4 warhead delayed to 2025-2027. Congress mandated NNSA to deliver the first production unit of the new warhead by 2025. NNSA allocated resources to meet this requirement and align the warhead program with the plan to field the first LRSO missile in FY2026. Congress appropriated $195 million for the W80-4 life extension program. The LRSO program has attracted attention and debate among analysts and Members of Congress. The Air Force plans to buy 1,000-1,100 new cruise missiles through the program, costing around $10.8 billion. The first missile is expected to be completed in 2026, supporting testing and deployment plans. Some have questioned the need to accelerate the program and the affordability of developing it. The LRSO program, costing around $10.8 billion, has sparked debate among analysts and Congress members. Some question the need for a new cruise missile given the Air Force's other projects. Admiral Haney emphasized the importance of the LRSO for deterrence and warfighting capabilities. The LRSO program, costing around $10.8 billion, has sparked debate among analysts and Congress members. Admiral Haney emphasized the importance of the LRSO for deterrence and warfighting capabilities. As more countries develop advanced air defenses, these defenses provide \"anti-access/access denial\" capabilities. Cruise missiles complement stealth bombers, improving bomber fleet survivability and extending effective range. This complicates the air defense problem for adversaries. Lieutenant General (retired) David Deptula highlighted the significance of the LRSO program as a force multiplier for long-range bombers, enhancing the reach and target coverage of U.S. bombers. The deployment of B-2, B-52, and B-1 bombers in conventional conflicts has demonstrated the effectiveness of combining stealth bombers with LRSO weapons to challenge enemy air defenses and enhance deterrence. The Air Force is developing a new strategic bomber, the B-21 Raider, to meet emerging challenges. The start of the study on the new bomber was delayed due to a dispute over merging it with another study on prompt global strike capabilities. The Air Force's plan to develop the B-21 Raider, a new strategic bomber, was delayed by a dispute over merging it with a study on prompt global strike capabilities. General Cartwright supported merging the efforts to balance the force, while General Moseley preferred to keep the studies separate. Ultimately, the Air Force decided to keep the studies separate in May 2006, revealing differences in goals and capabilities sought for the new bomber program. The Air Force's plan to develop the B-21 Raider, a new strategic bomber, was delayed by a dispute over conventional capabilities. The Air Force sought a new bomber for conventional challenges, considering delaying nuclear capabilities to save money. Disagreements over needed capabilities further delayed the program. In May 2007, the Air Force decided the next generation bomber would be manned, subsonic, and incorporate stealth characteristics, omitting supersonic and unmanned options to control costs and maintain future aircraft capabilities. The development of the B-21 Raider strategic bomber was delayed due to disputes over conventional capabilities. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates suspended the program in 2009 to reassess the need, requirement, and technology. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review indicated the Air Force was exploring options for modernizing the bomber force with long-range surveillance and strike aircraft. The DOD budget request for 2011 included $200 million for a new bomber, with potential total expenditures of $1.74 billion through 2015. Secretary Gates expected the Air Force to field the next generation bomber in the late 2020s, emphasizing the importance of maintaining the bomber leg of the strategic triad. The long-range strike study focused on determining the appropriate type of bomber and timelines for development, production, and deployment. The report advised the President's budget submission for FY2012, with plans for a new long-range bomber using proven technologies and nuclear-capable. The Pentagon requested $197 million for the bomber in the budget, with $3.7 billion planned for development over five years. The Air Force aims to field 80-100 B-21 bombers by 2025. The Air Force plans to field 80-100 B-21 bombers by 2025, with a procurement cost of $550 million per bomber. The total program cost is estimated to be $36-$56 billion, not including research and development funding, which could reach $20-$45 billion. Analysts predict the final cost could be $60-$80 billion, with funding requests expected to increase in the coming years. Congress has allocated significant funds for R&D on the new bomber in recent years. The Air Force's bomber program faced budget challenges due to exceeding spending levels set by the 2011 Budget Control Act. Despite requesting $1.3 billion for FY2016, only $736 million was appropriated by Congress. The initial contract for 21 bombers was awarded to Northrup Grumman, with analysts estimating a total program cost of $80 billion for 100 aircraft. This includes development costs and an expected cost of $511 million per bomber. The Air Force requested $1.4 billion for the B-21 bomber in FY2017, lower than the expected $2.2 billion. Congress authorized $1.05 billion in the FY2017 National Defense Authorization Act. The Air Force planned to request $12.1 billion between FY2017 and FY2021, reflecting revised cost estimates after awarding the B-21 contract in late 2015. In FY2018, $2 billion was requested for the B-21 bomber, followed by $2.3 billion in FY2019. The Air Force requested $1.4 billion for the B-21 bomber in FY2017, lower than expected. Congress authorized $1.05 billion in the FY2017 National Defense Authorization Act. The Air Force planned to request $12.1 billion between FY2017 and FY2021. In FY2018, $2 billion was requested for the B-21 bomber, followed by $2.3 billion in FY2019. Most information about the costs and progress of the B-21 bomber remains classified. Congress authorized the increase in funding for FY2019 in the National Defense Authorization Act. In 2008, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates requested the resignations of the Secretary of the Air Force and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force due to concerns about the handling of nuclear weapons. This led to studies and changes aimed at improving morale and quality of life for service members in the nuclear enterprise. Several studies concluded that the Air Force leadership had neglected the nuclear mission in favor of other priorities, leading to a decline in morale, cohesion, and capability within the nuclear enterprise. Recommendations were made to refocus on the nuclear mission and address long-standing issues. The Air Force has refocused on the nuclear mission by making organizational changes, such as creating a Global Strike Command and a new headquarters office in the Pentagon. They have also adjusted their inspection program and expectations for achievement. A study by the Defense Science Board in April 2011 reviewed and evaluated these changes in the nuclear weapons enterprise. The report evaluated the changes made by the Air Force in its nuclear weapons enterprise, noting decisive actions taken to correct deficiencies. However, the study warned that some measures taken in response to earlier lapses could have negative impacts if extended beyond the urgent need period, particularly in oversight and inspection. The intense level of inspections and exercises was deemed counterproductive, as units may not have the time or resources to address deficiencies found during frequent and invasive inspections. Several incidents in 2013 and early 2014 raised concerns about the capabilities and morale of ICBM launch officers. For example, 17 launch officers were removed from duty at Minot Air Force Base for low inspection scores. A missile unit at Malmstrom Air Force Base also received a failing grade on an inspection. Air Force officials expressed concern but remained confident in the capabilities of nuclear officers. Some saw the commander's response as progress in identifying and correcting problems on site. In 2013 and early 2014, concerns were raised about the capabilities and morale of ICBM launch officers due to various incidents. This included low inspection scores leading to the removal of launch officers at Minot Air Force Base and a failing grade on an inspection at Malmstrom Air Force Base. Other incidents involving high-ranking officials being suspended or reassigned also contributed to the concerns about the U.S. nuclear enterprise. In response to concerns about the capabilities and morale of ICBM launch officers, the Air Force discovered cheating on proficiency exams and ordered internal and external reviews. Questions arose about burnout and boredom in the nuclear force, leading to plans to increase funding by nearly $8 billion over five years starting in FY2015. The Air Force plans to spend an additional $3 billion over the next five years to raise pay levels, introduce new management positions, modify the testing process, and raise morale among Air Force ICBM officers. These changes highlight the high value placed on the ICBM mission and aim to show airmen that their leaders value their effort and accomplishment. However, these initiatives will require additional funding and budget increases in an era of fiscal restraint. The Air Force nuclear enterprise is seen as part of the declining role of nuclear weapons in U.S. national security strategy. Suggestions have been made to further reduce the nuclear arsenal and remove weapons from the operational force, including from the bomber fleet. Congress may address concerns about weaknesses in procedures and review changes in command structures and security procedures related to nuclear weapons policies and programs. This report focuses on the numbers and types of weapons in the U.S. strategic nuclear force structure, without addressing the broader question of why the U.S. chooses to deploy these weapons or their role in national security strategy. The role of nuclear weapons in U.S. national security strategy is being reviewed by the Trump Administration. Congress could address broader questions about the relationship between U.S. and Russian nuclear forces. The size of the U.S. arsenal is influenced by the size of the Russian arsenal, as noted by the Obama Administration. Russia's nuclear force will impact how much and how fast the U.S. is prepared to reduce its forces. Improved relations have lessened the need for strict numerical limits on nuclear weapons. The Trump Administration's 2018 Nuclear Posture Review highlighted the worsening global threat conditions since 2010, with Russia and China challenging international norms and North Korea increasing the salience of nuclear forces. Large disparities in nuclear capabilities could raise concerns and may not be conducive to maintaining a stable, long-term strategic relationship as nuclear forces are reduced. The need for strict numerical parity between the U.S. and Russia is no longer as compelling, but the size of the U.S. arsenal is influenced by Russia's nuclear force. The Bush Administration's 2001 Nuclear Posture Review determined the need for 1,700 to 2,200 deployed nuclear warheads, with the capability to restore warheads for unexpected contingencies. The Obama Administration reduced forces to 1,550 warheads under the New START Treaty but retained the ability to restore warheads. The Obama Administration plans to retain many warheads in storage while reducing deployed forces to New START limits. They aim to reduce numbers of deployed and nondeployed warheads in parallel with Russia to maintain a stable strategic relationship. The Department of Defense conducted a study in 2013 to determine how deeply the US could reduce its forces, with some options considering reductions as low as 300 warheads. The Trump Administration did not directly address the size of the U.S. nuclear arsenal in the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review. It indicated support for New START until 2021 and continuing nuclear modernization programs started under the Obama Administration, including deploying 12 Columbia class submarines and 400 missiles under the GBSD program. No specific recommendations were made on the number of warheads. The Navy plans to keep the production line for Columbia class submarines open after completing the 12 submarines to potentially increase the fleet size. Additionally, there are plans for 5 additional heavy missile submarines after the Columbia class program, which could replace Ohio-class cruise missile submarines. General John Hyten of U.S. Strategic Command stated that the U.S. nuclear force size and structure are based on the threats faced by the country. The size and structure of the U.S. nuclear force are determined by the threats faced by the country. Analysts question the need for such a large force and suggest that the U.S. could maintain security with a smaller number of warheads, possibly between 500 and 1,000. Some argue for renegotiating arms control treaties to reduce nuclear arsenals. Some argue that the United States may need a significant nuclear force to assure allies of its commitment to security, regardless of the number of potential adversaries. This view contrasts with the suggestion to maintain security with a smaller number of warheads, possibly between 500 and 1,000. The 2001 Nuclear Posture Review and the Obama Administration supported retaining the nuclear triad for robust deterrence. The triad provides credibility, flexibility, and survivability in the 21st-century security environment. The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review also justifies the retention of the triad. The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review supports retaining the nuclear triad for deterrence, emphasizing its synergy, survivability, and flexibility. Congress also backs the triad's importance, as stated in the FY2017 National Defense Authorization Act. The FY2017 National Defense Authorization Act supports modernizing the nuclear triad for a strong deterrent. Analysts question the affordability and necessity of retaining all three legs of the triad, with some suggesting reductions in the ICBM force. Some argue that the Air Force may not afford a new ICBM after 2030 due to financial pressures. The Global Zero Organization suggests eliminating the ICBM force, citing them as dangerous and destabilizing in the current security environment. They claim that ICBMs can only support nuclear wartime operations against Russia and may cause confusion if flying over or near Russia on the way to other targets. The report highlights concerns that Russia may misinterpret attack indications and launch a retaliatory attack against the United States due to ambiguity. It questions the necessity of ICBMs in the U.S. nuclear deterrent, suggesting that the bomber and submarine forces are sufficient for a strong response. Former Secretary of Defense William Perry also doubts the need for ICBMs, emphasizing the deterrent power of the submarine force. Analysts supporting U.S. ICBM deployment argue that a large-scale attack would be needed to destroy the entire force due to the number of hardened silos and single warhead deployment. Some analysts suggest reducing the size of the SLBM fleet to save costs, potentially deploying fewer submarines with more warheads on each missile. This could lead to the elimination of a submarine base, leaving the U.S. with submarines based only in the Atlantic or Pacific Ocean. The U.S. may need to consider implications of reducing warheads before deciding on basing and operational changes. Analysts question plans to replace ALCM with LRSO in the 2020s. The Air Force's plan to deploy a new penetrating bomber may make cruise missiles redundant for attacking advanced air defenses. Critics argue that existing conventional cruise missiles could fulfill this role. Air Force officials maintain that bomber and cruise missile capabilities are complementary. Some analysts debate the value of different legs of the nuclear triad and whether the US should develop new nuclear weapons to counter emerging threats. Lower-yield weapons are a focus, with arguments that they could strengthen deterrence. Some argue that lower-yield nuclear weapons could strengthen deterrence by providing more limited and credible options for nuclear use. However, others believe that their deployment could increase the likelihood of nuclear war by making them more \"usable.\" Defense Science Board study and General David Goldfein have called for consideration of lower-yield warheads in the nuclear posture review. The Trump Administration's nuclear posture review includes plans to modify existing SLBM warheads for low-yield options to enhance deterrence and deny adversaries any mistaken confidence in limited nuclear employment advantages. This differs from previous debates on low-yield nuclear weapons' impact on deterrence. The NPR justifies the need for low-yield warheads based on Russia's nuclear doctrine and \"escalate to de-escalate strategy.\" It aims to prevent Russia from miscalculating the consequences of limited nuclear first use. The US plans to modify existing warheads to strengthen deterrence. The United States plans to modify a small number of W-76 warheads to strengthen deterrence and address Russia's \"escalate to de-escalate strategy.\" Concerns have been raised about the deployment of low-yield warheads, with some arguing that existing options already provide flexibility to deter Russia's escalation. Others worry that using low-yield warheads could lead to a broader and more destructive nuclear conflict if Russia retaliates without knowing the yield of the attacking warhead. The NPR's recommendation to deploy low-yield warheads is supported by the belief that it would raise the nuclear threshold and deter Russia from escalating to full-scale nuclear war. The Obama Administration indicated its intention to spend on this modification during the New START ratification process. During the New START ratification process, the Obama Administration expected to spend $210 billion over 10 years to maintain and modernize the U.S. nuclear arsenal. However, the total did not include costs for next-generation submarines, bombers, and missiles. Congress found it challenging to determine annual spending on nuclear weapons due to funding being divided between the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy, often combined with non-nuclear activities. The U.S. lacks a unified budget for nuclear weapons and related activities. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that the United States would spend $355 billion over the next 10 years on its nuclear weapons enterprise, including costs for command, control, communications, early warning activities, and additional costs based on historical cost growth. This total was higher than the Obama Administration's estimate in 2010, which did not include these categories. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that the United States would spend $400 billion on nuclear weapons between 2017 and 2026. Congress mandated the DOD and DOE to provide 10-year cost estimates for nuclear weapons programs, with GAO evaluating the cost estimates. GAO's review of the DOD and DOE combined report for FY2017 estimated costs for sustaining and modernizing nuclear delivery systems and command and control. The costs of sustaining and modernizing nuclear delivery systems, command and control, stockpile, and security enterprise will total $342 billion between FY2017 and FY2026. The United States is projected to spend $35-$40 billion per year on nuclear weapons programs, potentially reaching $1-$1.2 trillion over the next 30 years. This estimate aligns with outside organizations' projections, such as the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies. The Air Force estimated that investments in nuclear modernization programs would peak between 2025 and 2035 at $30 billion per year. There is disagreement on whether the US can afford all these programs due to budget constraints from the Budget Control Act. Rising costs for nuclear weapons could impact funding for other defense priorities. Congress has raised the caps in the Budget Control Act, increasing defense spending and easing pressure on modernization programs. However, the Office of Management and Budget has mandated a reduction in the Pentagon's planned budget for FY2020. This could lead to a decrease in funding below the FY2019 budget of $716 billion. The problem may persist beyond the Act's expiration in 2021, as the Trump Administration's defense spending plan remains relatively flat. Representative Adam Smith has raised concerns about the costs and direction of U.S. nuclear modernization programs. The current $1.5 trillion plan to modernize the nuclear weapons complex is deemed unrealistic and unaffordable by some, while others argue that failing to modernize the nuclear arsenal would be even costlier. Admiral Haney emphasized the importance of continued investment in strategic capabilities for achieving strategic deterrence in the 21st century. Any cuts to the budget for modernization programs could hinder the ability to sustain and upgrade military forces. Admiral Haney emphasized the need for increased spending on nuclear weapons modernization programs to maintain strategic stability in the face of other nations' modernization efforts. The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review also addressed concerns about the cost, stating that DOD's budget for maintaining and operating the nuclear force will rise to about 6.4% at the peak of modernization. The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review highlighted the need for increased spending on nuclear weapons modernization programs to maintain strategic stability. The budget for maintaining and operating the nuclear force will increase to about 6.4% at the peak of modernization, excluding costs for life extension programs and infrastructure recapitalization. The NPR does not address potential competition with other DOD priorities for funding."
