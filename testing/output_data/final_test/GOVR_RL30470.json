    "content": "This report discusses constitutional and statutory requirements related to affirmative action in employment, tracing back to the legal controversy in the 1960s regarding racial segregation. Judicial rulings recognized an \"affirmative duty\" to desegregate schools and eliminate state-enforced segregation. The Court has upheld affirmative action plans in employment for entities with a history of discrimination, while Congress and the Executive have approved laws and regulations in support. Affirmative action laws and regulations allow for \"race-conscious\" strategies to promote minority opportunity in jobs, education, and governmental contracting. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, national origin, religion, or sex, with judicial power to order remedies like monetary damages and affirmative action. Employers are not generally required to adopt affirmative action plans, but the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has issued guidelines for protection. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has guidelines to protect employers and unions from \"reverse discrimination\" charges when addressing past discrimination effects. Federal departments must create affirmative action plans and minority recruitment programs to correct underrepresentation. Executive Orders since the 1960s have set minority participation goals for federally financed projects and contracts. Executive Order 11246 mandates affirmative minority hiring for employers with 50+ employees and federal contracts. The Executive Order 11246 mandates that employers with 50 or more employees and federal contracts over $50,000 must file affirmative action plans with minority and female hiring goals. Judicial decisions have upheld this program as a valid response to racial segregation in industries. The Supreme Court has approved the use of race- or gender-conscious selection criteria as a remedy for racial imbalance in job categories. The Supreme Court required proof of remedial justification for affirmative action, rooted in past discrimination and persistent effects in the workplace. Racial preferences in employment must be based on evidence of underrepresentation of minorities or women in affected job categories. Consideration of race or gender as a \"plus\" factor in employment decisions is acceptable if it does not harm non-minority employees' legitimate expectations. Affirmative action preferences must be flexible, temporary, and narrowly tailored to avoid quotas. Judicial precedents on affirmative action in employment focus on remedial justification for minority goals based on past discrimination. Public employers may face stricter probative standards than private employers in adopting affirmative action plans. Affirmative action preferences in employment must be based on a firm basis in evidence of past discrimination and should not disproportionately burden non-minority employees. Remedies that displace senior white male employees are less likely to be legally acceptable, while hiring or recruitment goals should not unfairly hinder the advancement of non-minority candidates. \"Race-conscious\" affirmative action remedies must be flexible, temporary, and \"narrowly tailored\" to avoid rigid quotas. Federal circuit courts have approved using race or gender preferences to remedy historic discrimination, as seen in cases like Local 28, Sheetmetal Workers v. EEOC and United States v. Paradise. The Second Circuit approved an order reinstating a 29% minority membership goal for a union, with job referrals based on one apprentice for every four journeyman. The Supreme Court affirmed this decision, stating that Title VII allows race-conscious affirmative action as a \"last resort\" for cases of persistent discrimination. The remedy was enforced as a benchmark of compliance rather than a strict racial quota. The Supreme Court affirmed the Second Circuit's decision to reinstate a 29% minority membership goal for a union, with job referrals based on one apprentice for every four journeyman. The remedy was seen as a benchmark of compliance rather than a strict racial quota, with Justice Powell emphasizing the history of racial discrimination and the temporary nature of the remedy. The dissenting Justices found the referral quota excessive due to economic conditions in the construction industry, while others believed Title VII barred all judicially-ordered race-conscious relief for non-victims. In a similar case, Paradise addressed systematic exclusion of blacks from the Alabama State troopers, leading to hiring quotas and consent decrees for nondiscriminatory promotion procedures. The court approved new promotion procedures to address the lack of black troopers in higher ranks. A one-to-one racial quota was ordered for corporal and above ranks until 25% were black. The Supreme Court reviewed the order under the Equal Protection Clause, considering factors like necessity, flexibility, and impact on third parties. The order did not mandate promotions, leading to the suspension of the quota after one round of promotions for corporal. The Supreme Court approved a promotion quota to increase black troopers in higher ranks, tied to the percentage of minorities in the workforce. The plan did not require promotions and could be waived if no qualified minority candidates were available. The Court found the quota narrowly tailored and justified by the government's interest in addressing historical exclusion of blacks. Justice Stevens supported the Court's judgment, stating the district court's remedy was reasonable. The Supreme Court approved a promotion quota to increase black troopers in higher ranks, tied to the percentage of minorities in the workforce. One group of dissenting Justices found the plan \"cannot survive judicial scrutiny\" due to lack of tie to black promotion eligibility percentage. Another dissenting opinion stated the district court \"exceeded its equitable powers.\" The Court explored the remedial justification for voluntary affirmative action in employment in Wygant v. Jackson Board of Education, where a collective bargaining agreement provided hiring preference for minority teachers with layoff protection until faculty mirrored student body diversity. The Court voided the minority layoff provision in the face of a constitutional challenge. The Wygant Court voided the minority layoff provision, stating that voluntary affirmative action may be justifiable but must be supported by convincing evidence of past discrimination. Justice Powell argued that innocent non-minorities should not bear the entire burden of achieving racial equality. Justice Powell concluded that innocent third parties were impacted heavily by the minority layoff provision, unlike preferential hiring decisions. Justice White agreed that the layoff remedy went too far by displacing senior white employees for minorities who were not discrimination victims. Justice O'Connor also criticized the layoff plan, stating that societal discrimination does not justify affirmative action remedies that are not narrowly tailored. Wygant was a constitutional case based on equal protection principles, while the issue of voluntary affirmative action plans under Title VII was addressed in United Steelworkers v. Weber. The United Steelworkers v. Weber case upheld a voluntary affirmative action plan by a private employer to address racial imbalance in job categories without requiring specific findings of past discrimination. The plan aimed to increase the percentage of blacks in skilled craft positions by reserving slots for minorities, leading to some white employees being passed over. The Supreme Court ruled that \"racial preferences\" in a program were lawful to combat \"manifest racial imbalance\" in craft positions due to past segregation. Title VII's purpose was to open employment opportunities for minorities in traditionally closed occupations. The Supreme Court allowed for voluntary, private, race-conscious efforts to abolish workplace segregation. In Weber v. Kaiser Aluminum, private employers were permitted to implement temporary affirmative action to advance minority employment opportunities, even if it had an incidental adverse impact on white workers. Johnson v. Transportation Agency reviewed a voluntary affirmative action plan by a public employer to consider gender for promotions in traditionally segregated positions. The Johnson case involved a male employee who was passed over for a promotion in favor of a female competitor in a public employer's affirmative action plan to promote gender diversity in traditionally segregated job categories. The plan aimed for proportional representation but used short-term goals adjusted annually based on qualified minority and female availability, without specific numerical goals or quotas. The Supreme Court upheld the county's decision to promote a female candidate over a male candidate, citing considerations of qualifications, backgrounds, test scores, expertise, and gender. Justice Brennan ruled that Title VII was not the same as the Constitution, with the county's plan being likened to the \"Harvard Plan\" for race in admissions. In the Bakke case, Justice Powell approved the \"Harvard Plan\" for admissions, where sex was just one factor considered. The Court cautioned against blind hiring based on quotas, with dissenters criticizing the use of Title VII to achieve minority employment goals. The Supreme Court has allowed race-conscious hiring criteria by private employers under Title VII for past discrimination or to address racial imbalances in job categories, but rejected a state's interest in faculty diversity as a compelling reason for such practices. The Seventh Circuit upheld Chicago Police Department's affirmative action hiring program, citing a compelling need for diversity in law enforcement. The decision in Petit v. City of Chicago found that police departments have an even more compelling need for diversity than universities. The Seventh Circuit upheld Chicago Police Department's affirmative action hiring program, citing a compelling need for diversity in law enforcement. Expert testimony provided a \"strong basis\" for affirmative action, highlighting the importance of creating a diverse force at the sergeant rank to earn the trust of the community. While courts generally allow for race consideration in hiring and promotion decisions in response to past discrimination, voluntary affirmative action measures in employment have become somewhat disfavored in recent years. In 2009, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of white firefighters in Ricci v. DeStafano, a Title VII case where the New Haven Fire Department set aside a promotion exam that favored white firefighters. The Court found the city violated Title VII by discarding the test results, impacting future affirmative action plans and employment policies. Affirmative action plans in employment have received more judicial approval than public contracting preferences for minorities post the City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson and Co. decision. Employment preferences are often tied to settlements of discrimination lawsuits, with a formal record of past discrimination already established in some cases. This can lead to deference by the courts due to underlying findings of discrimination or court involvement in consent decrees. Between 1972 and 1983, the Department of Justice sued 106 public employers, with 93 cases settled by consent decree. These agreements set goals for increasing minority and female representation in the workforce. However, under strict scrutiny post Croson and Adarand rulings, consent decrees have faced challenges. For instance, a 1994 Eleventh Circuit ruling invalidated a fixed quota consent decree for the Birmingham fire department as arbitrary and restrictive to whites. In 1999, the Supreme Court declined to review a Fifth Circuit decision striking down the Dallas Fire Department's affirmative action plan, citing insufficient evidence of past discrimination to justify promoting women and minorities over white males with similar civil service exam scores. This decision followed a 1976 consent decree finding racial discrimination in the department. The court found impermissible racial discrimination by the city under Title VII and statistical underrepresentation of minorities in promoted ranks. It rejected interference with promotion based on exam performance without exhausting alternative remedies. The court also found insufficient evidence of past sex discrimination to justify gender-based discrimination. In Ensley Branch, NAACP v. Seibels, the Eleventh Circuit rejected imposed hiring goals for firefighters and police officers. The City of Birmingham, Alabama's affirmative action plan for hiring firefighters and police officers was criticized for setting rigid quotas for minorities without considering candidate qualifications. The court ordered the district court to revise the decrees to align annual goals with the proportion of qualified minority candidates and to ensure the goals are not permanent. An affirmative action promotional plan for the Maryland State Police was found deficient by the Fourth Circuit for not aligning goals with the qualified labor pool and not exhausting race-neutral alternatives. The Sixth Circuit also applied Croson to reject a 50% minority goal for sergeants in the Detroit Police Department. The court has invalidated state and local affirmative action plans due to factors such as statistical disparities, lack of waiver provisions for qualified minority candidates, and undue burden on nonminorities. The concept of \"racial classification\" for equal protection purposes remains undefined, but actions that do not benefit or burden individuals based on race may not be subject to strict scrutiny. Courts have not applied strict scrutiny to data collection activities on workforce demographics or minority outreach efforts that do not lead to preferential treatment in employment decisions. Public universities can gather racial and ethnic statistics and promote diversity without triggering equal protection review. These activities are considered neutral and do not create unequal treatment for individuals. The distinction between \"inclusive\" and \"exclusive\" forms of affirmative action is important in legal decisions. Courts do not subject institutions to strict scrutiny for data collection on workforce demographics or minority outreach efforts that do not result in preferential treatment. In cases like Shuford v. State Board of Education, provisions similar to E.O. 11246 were upheld in the face of constitutional challenge. A consent decree addressed hiring and promotion issues within the Alabama system, requiring yearly reports on new women hires. The court upheld provisions in a consent decree requiring yearly reports on new women hires, procedures for expanding the pool of female applicants, numerical hiring goals, and parity for women in the personnel selection process. The decree prohibited set-asides, quotas, and selecting less qualified candidates based on race or gender. The court supported the annual statistical report requirement to monitor progress and encouraged affirmative recruitment of qualified female candidates. The court upheld provisions in a consent decree requiring yearly reports on new women hires, procedures for expanding the pool of female applicants, and numerical hiring goals. Affirmative recruitment of qualified female candidates was deemed acceptable as long as it did not exclude male applicants. The goals were found to be inclusive and lawful, serving to measure the effectiveness of recruitment programs and identify positions where women were underrepresented. Shuford has been cited with approval by federal appellate courts for affirming consent decrees requiring race-conscious employment examinations to minimize discriminatory impact on minority candidates. Some courts apply strict scrutiny to affirmative action programs, like in Monterey Mechanical Co. v. Wilson where the Ninth Circuit considered a California statute mandating subcontracting work to female- and minority-owned businesses for state contracts. The appeals court found that a statute treating classes unequally by allowing minority prime contractors to avoid subcontracting requirements was unconstitutional. In another case, the Fifth Circuit rejected any distinction between inclusive and exclusive affirmative action, applying strict scrutiny to all governmental racial classifications. The court found that affirmative action programs went beyond recruitment and considered race or gender in employment decisions. Judge Garza warned that the decision could signal the end of affirmative action in the Fifth Circuit. In another case, the Third Circuit disapproved a casino's affirmative action plan for lacking evidence of past discrimination in the industry. The court found that the casino's affirmative action plan led to discriminatory hiring practices, as supervisors felt compelled to consider race when filling positions to meet minority percentage goals. This decision was compared to a previous case where similar goals were invalidated. In Bras v. California Public Utilities Commission, a circuit invalidated minority hiring goals that put a non-minority contractor at a disadvantage when competing for business from Pacific Bell. Another court applied strict scrutiny to defeat FCC regulations imposing affirmative minority outreach obligations on radio broadcast license applicants in Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod v. FCC. The ruling stemmed from a challenge to hiring practices of a Lutheran Church organization with FCC licenses for radio stations in Missouri. The FCC ruled against a Lutheran Church organization with radio stations in Missouri for their broad Lutheran hiring preference, ordering them to pay a $25,000 penalty and submit reports on their minority recruitment efforts. A three-judge panel rejected leniency arguments from the FCC and Justice Department. The panel rejected leniency arguments from the FCC and Justice Department, stating that all governmental actions based on race must be narrowly tailored to meet a compelling governmental interest. The FCC regulations were found to pressure stations to maintain a workforce mirroring the racial breakdown of the metropolitan area, extending beyond outreach efforts to influence hiring decisions. The court emphasized that it didn't matter whether the program imposed hard quotas, soft quotas, or goals. The appellate panel rejected the FCC program's justification for fostering diverse programming content, stating that it did not make sense in the radio market context where stations target specific segments. The regulations were deemed not narrowly tailored as they affected even low-level employees with negligible impact on programming. In a legal case, the judge found that the term \"diversity\" has been burdened with multiple meanings, leading to unconstitutional EEO regulations. The appeals court also voided FCC rules aimed at promoting diversity in broadcasting careers. The FCC regulations on promoting diversity in broadcasting careers were struck down by the court due to concerns about coercive recordkeeping and reporting of employment statistics. This decision may limit future FCC affirmative action efforts. Challenges to Army and Air Force equal opportunity policies have led to scrutiny of racial classifications in military staffing. In Berkley v. United States, white male officers challenged the selection process for a reduction in force, citing discriminatory practices. The Air Force Secretary's instruction on evaluating women and minority officers was found to trigger strict scrutiny, leading to a reversal and remand by the federal circuit court. In Christian v. United States, the U.S. Court of Claims reviewed an Army policy setting retention goals for minority and female officers facing early retirement. Different evaluation standards based on race and gender were deemed racially discriminatory, triggering strict scrutiny. The program's special procedures were found to pressure review board members into biased decisions, constituting a racial classification subject to strict scrutiny. The U.S. Court of Claims found that the Army's policy setting retention goals for minority and female officers was racially discriminatory and subject to strict scrutiny. The government's justifications for the policy were deemed insufficient, as they focused on addressing past discrimination in promotions and assignments rather than proving actual discrimination against individual officers. The court likened the policy to remedies for societal discrimination, which had been rejected in previous cases like Croson and Adarand. The Army's policy setting retention goals for minority officers was found to be racially discriminatory and not narrowly tailored to address proven present effects of past discrimination. The policy lacked a time limitation and did not consider race-neutral alternatives before implementing affirmative action measures. The government tried alternatives before implementing affirmative action. One suggestion was to increase educational opportunities for underprivileged officers of all races to expand the pool of eligible minorities for promotion. The Court of Claims decree requiring reinstatement and backpay for retired white male officers was successfully appealed. In another case, a white officer twice denied promotion challenged the Army's equal opportunity promotion practices. In 1997, Saunders v. White ruled the Army's promotion process unconstitutional as it required consideration of race and gender, despite statistics showing equal promotion rates for minorities and women. The court found no evidence of discrimination to justify these considerations. The district court found that the Memorandum instructing selection board officers to consider past discrimination for certain groups but not others establishes a preference based on race or gender, making it unconstitutional."
