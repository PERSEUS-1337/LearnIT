FINDINGS.\" The Congress finds that in the 1960s, racial segregation on buses and rail stations was unconstitutional according to the Supreme Court. The Freedom Riders played a crucial role in ending segregation in public transportation, leading to the full racial integration of the United States transit system. They faced prejudice, discrimination, and violence but sparked a movement that changed the nation. The Congress of Racial Equality (C.O.R.E.) selected thirteen volunteers for nonviolent response training to join the Freedom Rides from Washington, DC, to New Orleans, LA. The Freedom Riders challenged Jim Crow laws directly and enforced the Supreme Court decision in Boynton. On May 4, 1961, seven Blacks and six Whites boarded two buses, seated together, to begin the Freedom Rides. The Freedom Riders, including John Lewis and Hank Thomas, faced violent opposition in their journey to challenge segregation laws. Lewis was severely beaten in Rock Hill, while Thomas was jailed and delivered to a mob in Winnsboro. Despite the attacks, they continued their defiance of local laws by eating together at segregated lunch counters. On Mother's Day, May 14, 1961, the Freedom Riders faced violence in Anniston, Alabama, as an angry mob firebombed one bus and beat them with lead pipes and baseball bats. Ambulances refused to transport the injured Black riders. The bus exploded, and ambulances refused to transport the Black Freedom Riders. A mob beat the riders on the second bus and forced them to sit in the back. Another mob savagely beat the Freedom Riders on their way to Birmingham. The Nashville Student Group continued the Freedom Rides despite the violence. The Attorney General called in the National Guard and U.S. Marshals to protect the riders in Alabama, but the protection was short-lived. The Freedom Riders were turned over to Mississippi authorities and arrested for disturbing the peace. Many were imprisoned in Parchman Prison under harsh conditions but refused bail to spread their nonviolent message. Five months later, a Federal order banned segregation on interstate transportation. In 1961, a Federal order was issued banning segregation at all interstate public facilities based on race, color, or creed. In 2011, the President honored the Freedom Riders for their courageous acts that paved the way for Civil Rights in America. The Congressional Gold Medal is awarded. The Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate will arrange for a gold medal to be presented to the Freedom Riders for their contribution to Civil Rights. The Secretary of the Treasury will design and strike the medal. After the award, the medal will be given to the Smithsonian Institution for display. The gold medal awarded to the Freedom Riders will be given to the Smithsonian Institution for display and research, with the Congress suggesting it be displayed at appropriate locations associated with the Freedom Riders. The Secretary is authorized to produce and sell bronze duplicates of the gold medal at a price covering all costs. Medals created under this Act are considered national medals according to US law."
