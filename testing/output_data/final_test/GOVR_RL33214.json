Despite the text's focus on diversity cases, the Supreme Court has broadened state sovereign immunity beyond this. The Amendment was a response to Chisholm v. Georgia, which allowed citizens to sue states in federal court without their consent. The Eleventh Amendment was created in response to Chisholm v. Georgia, preventing citizens from suing states in federal court without their consent. The Supreme Court later expanded state sovereign immunity, stating that Congress can only abrogate state sovereignty under the Fourteenth Amendment. Recent Supreme Court cases have made it more challenging for litigants to find a Fourteenth Amendment basis for federal legislation in order to overcome an Eleventh Amendment defense. In Flores v. City of Boerne, the Court struck down the Religious Freedom Restoration Act as exceeding Congress's authority under the Fourteenth Amendment. The case involved a church denied a building permit by the City of Boerne, challenging the decision under RFRA. The Court emphasized that Congress has the power to enforce existing constitutional protections under \u00a75 of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court's City of Boerne test requires a \"congruence and proportionality\" between the injury and the law passed to address it. In Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents, the Court found that the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 exceeded protections afforded by the Fourteenth Amendment. This decision was based on the City of Boerne test, which has led to the striking down of laws addressing discrimination issues. The Supreme Court's analysis in City of Boerne requires a proportional and congruent legislative record to determine Congress's ability to legislate under section 5. The Court found no evidence of state governments discriminating against employees based on age, leading to a ruling that states cannot be held liable for damages under the ADEA. The application of the ADA to states was also considered in Board of Trustees v. Garrett, with a similar outcome regarding claims for money damages against a state university for failing to accommodate disabilities. The Supreme Court declined to consider evidence of discrimination by the private sector or local government against disabled individuals in cases involving plaintiffs with disabilities such as cancer, asthma, and sleep apnea. Despite Congress's findings on pervasive discrimination, the Court found no pattern of unconstitutional state discrimination and deemed the application of the ADA as disproportionate. In Nevada Department of Human Resources v. Hibbs, the Court ruled that Congress could override a state's Eleventh Amendment immunity under the FMLA, allowing a state employee to seek money damages for FMLA violations. Congress provided evidence of historical sex discrimination to support this decision. The court found significant evidence of sex discrimination history regarding leave benefits administration by states, justifying legislation under \u00a75. Judge Alito's opinion in Chittister v. Department of Community and Economic Development addressed Congress's abrogation of states' Eleventh Amendment immunity in enacting the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. Unlike the Hibbs case, Chittister focused on personal sick leave provision for serious health reasons. In Chittister v. Department of Community and Economic Development, Judge Alito found that Congress had not abrogated the state's sovereign immunity for causes of action related to personal sick leave provision under the Family Medical Leave Act. The Court's decision in Hibbs did not address the constitutionality of this provision, and there are arguments distinguishing the two cases. The denial or curtailment of women's employment opportunities is often linked to the presumption that women are primarily mothers, leading to discrimination against them. This stereotype discourages hiring women, as employers assume they are the primary caretakers. While family care leave provisions may address this disparity, personal sick leave does not fall under the same reasoning. Judge Alito noted that Congress's findings on women's caretaking responsibilities are relevant for family care leave evaluation, but similar findings are lacking for personal sick leave. Alito found no evidence of intentional discrimination against women in personal sick leave practices. He questioned if the FMLA was a suitable response as it only set a minimum leave entitlement without requiring nondiscriminatory practices. This aligns with previous court decisions, such as Kazmier v. Widmann, which also questioned the application of FMLA provisions against states. The Fifth Circuit rejected the argument that the personal sick leave provision in the FMLA was intended to target sex discrimination, citing separate provisions for maternity leave and Supreme Court rulings on pregnancy discrimination. The court found no evidence of intentional discrimination against women in sick leave practices. The Fifth Circuit found that mandating leave for pregnancy would not increase women's attractiveness as employees. The court determined that the FMLA provision in question targeted discrimination based on temporary disability, which receives minimal scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause. The court referenced the Kimel case, which dealt with age discrimination, to support its decision. The Sixth Circuit, in Touvell v. Ohio Department of Mental Retardation & Developmental Disability, relied on the Hibbs case to reach a similar conclusion regarding gender discrimination in the FMLA legislative record. The court found no evidence of gender discrimination with regard to personal medical leave. The Court in Touvell did not find evidence of gender discrimination in the FMLA personal sick leave provisions. It was determined that the sick leave provision was more likely intended to address disability discrimination, making it difficult to establish a pattern of constitutional violation. The Sixth Circuit concluded that the personal sick leave provisions were not a proportional response to any alleged violations. In Kazmier, the Sixth Circuit ruled that personal sick leave provisions couldn't be applied against the state under the Eleventh Amendment. The Commerce Clause divides Congress's power into regulating channels of commerce, instrumentalities of commerce, and economic activities affecting commerce. The Supreme Court's 1995 case, United States v. Lopez, questioned Congress's reliance on the Commerce Clause for federal jurisdiction, particularly in relation to the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990. In Lopez, the Court ruled that the Gun-Free School Zones Act exceeded Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause, setting new limits on legislative power. Post-Lopez, lower courts had to interpret these limits, with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7922(o) receiving significant attention. Several circuits had determined that section 922(o) was not a violation of the Commerce Clause, with varying reasoning. The majority in United States v. Rybar held that it regulated interstate commerce channels, while the Seventh Circuit saw it as essential for regulating economic activity. The Tenth Circuit upheld it as a regulation of interstate commerce instrumentalities. The majority opinion in Rybar upheld section 922(o) as a regulation of interstate commerce based on legislative history and connection to serious violent crime. It did not resolve the reasoning dispute among circuits and relied on supporting language in committee reports for constitutional analysis. Judge Alito's dissent in the case questioned whether the statute in question could be saved by including a necessary jurisdictional element or by proving that intrastate possession of machine guns significantly impacts interstate commerce. He argued that since neither requirement was met, the statute should have been deemed unconstitutional. The majority, on the other hand, upheld the statute based on its regulation of interstate commerce and connection to serious violent crime. Judge Alito's dissent refuted the established grounds for holding Section 922(o) constitutional, challenging the reasoning of the Fifth, Sixth, and Ninth Circuits. He argued that the statute's exemption of lawful possessions prior to its enactment did not justify its constitutionality, as it relied on faulty facts and flawed reasoning. Judge Alito's dissent challenges the rationale behind holding Section 922(o) constitutional, arguing that unlawful possession can result from various factors and that the statute's justification as a regulation of activities threatening interstate commerce is flawed. Judge Alito's dissent questions the constitutionality of Section 922(o), arguing that the statute's justification as a regulation of activities threatening interstate commerce is flawed. He believes that there must be a reasonable basis to conclude that the possession of machine guns facilitates the commission of crimes by violent criminals, racketeers, and drug traffickers with interstate effects. Judge Alito's dissent challenges the constitutionality of Section 922(o), questioning the rationale that possession of machine guns impacts interstate commerce. He argues that there is no substantial evidence to support Congress's conclusion that intrastate possession of machine guns has a significant effect on interstate commerce. Judge Alito's dissent in Rybar questioned the need for empirical support before upholding a novel law affecting federal and state criminal jurisdiction. However, the Supreme Court's decision in Gonzales v. Raich, regarding Congress's power to regulate local marijuana laws, casts doubt on Alito's reasoning. The Court ruled that Congress can regulate purely local activities under the Commerce Clause, contradicting Alito's stance on federalism. The Supreme Court's decision in Gonzales v. Raich upheld Congress's power to regulate local activities under the Commerce Clause, citing similarities to the precedent set in Wickard v. Filburn. The Court emphasized the impact of individual producers on interstate commerce and the potential for homegrown commodities to affect national markets due to their fungibility. The Supreme Court's decision in Gonzales v. Raich upheld Congress's power to regulate local activities under the Commerce Clause, citing similarities to the precedent set in Wickard v. Filburn. The Court emphasized the impact of individual producers on interstate commerce and the potential for homegrown commodities to affect national markets due to their fungibility. The Court concluded that Congress had a rational basis for regulating home-grown medicinal marijuana to prevent it from affecting price and market conditions. Despite this, the Court had to distinguish its more recent Commerce Clause decisions in Lopez and Morrison. The Supreme Court upheld Congress's power to regulate local activities under the Commerce Clause in Gonzales v. Raich, citing similarities to Wickard v. Filburn. The Court emphasized the impact of individual producers on interstate commerce and the rational basis for regulating home-grown medicinal marijuana. It distinguished its recent Commerce Clause decisions in Lopez and Morrison, concluding that the Controlled Substances Act's regulation of marijuana was constitutional. The Supreme Court upheld Congress's power to regulate local activities under the Commerce Clause in Gonzales v. Raich, citing similarities to Wickard v. Filburn. The Court emphasized the impact of individual producers on interstate commerce and the rational basis for regulating home-grown medicinal marijuana. It distinguished its recent Commerce Clause decisions in Lopez and Morrison, concluding that the Controlled Substances Act's regulation of marijuana was constitutional. The Court found that medicinal marijuana was indistinguishable from recreational versions and that California's state law permitting medicinal use cannot override federal law due to the Supremacy Clause.

In a conflict between state and federal law, the federal law shall prevail. The Court also rejected the argument that locally grown products used domestically are immune from federal regulation. Judge Alito's opinion in the Chittister case aligned with Supreme Court precedent at the time, despite criticism for not anticipating the outcome in the Hibbs case. His dissent in the Rybar case anticipated a broader application of certain decisions, but was later challenged in the Gonzales v. Raich case. Judge Alito's dissent in the Chittister case aligned with Supreme Court precedent, but his dissent in the Rybar case was later challenged in the Gonzales v. Raich case, suggesting a more limited interpretation of the Commerce Clause."
