    "content": "Traditional farm commodity programs for field crops include direct payments, counter-cyclical payments, and marketing loan benefits under the Direct and Counter-cyclical Payment Program (DCP). Eligible DCP crops are wheat, corn, sorghum, barley, oats, cotton, rice, pulse crops, soybeans, oilseeds, and peanuts. Direct payments are fixed annual payments based on historical plantings and yields, while counter-cyclical payments are crop-specific and depend on national averages. Farmers have flexibility in planting but must follow conservation provisions. Counter-cyclical payments are crop-specific payments based on national average farm prices. Participating farmers receive payments when prices drop below a certain level. The Marketing Assistance Loan Program offers government loans to farmers of designated crops, with the crop used as collateral. Farmers can repay the loan if market prices are at or above the loan rate, or receive a \"marketing loan gain\" if prices are below the rate. Farmers may also opt for a \"loan deficiency payment\" instead of taking the loan. The ACRE program provides farmers with protection against revenue loss for each crop regardless of its cause: price decline, yield loss, or a combination of both. Payments are made when actual state-level revenue falls below a guaranteed level, and the farmer experiences an individual crop revenue loss on a farm. The ACRE program provides farmers with protection against revenue loss for each crop regardless of its cause. Farmers must select the ACRE option on a farm to receive payments only if they experience a revenue loss. Enrolling in ACRE means forgoing direct payments, reducing loan rates, and being ineligible for counter-cyclical program payments. The program covers all DCP crops on the farm, with payments calculated separately for each crop. Once enrolled, a farm must remain in the program for subsequent crop years (2009-2012). Actual state revenue must be less than the state ACRE revenue guarantee, calculated based on the national average market price and current-year planted yield. The ACRE program provides farmers with revenue protection for each crop, with payments based on the state ACRE revenue guarantee. The guarantee is calculated using the average state planted yield and the two-year average national price. The 90% factor in the formula ensures a 10% loss below the average is needed before payments begin. The ACRE program provides revenue protection for farmers based on the state ACRE revenue guarantee. Actual farm revenue must be less than the farm ACRE benchmark revenue, calculated using the farm's five-year average planted yield and the two-year average national price. The per-acre payment rate is determined by meeting specific triggers, with the maximum payment set at 25% of the state ACRE program guarantee. The ACRE program calculates farmer payments based on planted area, yield ratio, and per-acre payment rate. Farmers can enroll planted acres up to total base acres. ACRE payments are based on current plantings, unlike Direct and Counter-cyclical Payment Program. ACRE payments are considered \"amber box\" for U.S. commitments to the World Trade Organization, counting against spending caps. The program guarantees a moving income support level based on recent farm prices and yields, with a 10% limit on yearly changes. Separate crop revenue guarantees are established for irrigated and nonirrigated land. ACRE payments contribute to the $65,000 per person payment limit. The counter-cyclical program payment limit is $65,000 per person, adjusted for the 20% reduction in direct payments under ACRE. ACRE participants have a total limit of $105,000 for direct and counter-cyclical/ACRE payments, which can be doubled to $210,000 for a sole proprietor's farm with a spouse. Producers weigh the trade-off between reduced benefits under traditional programs and increased revenue risk protection with ACRE participation. Farmers considering the ACRE program must factor in assumptions about future prices, crop yield variability, and expected price trends for the program's duration. The reduction in direct payments will vary by crop, with higher payment crops like rice and cotton seeing the greatest impact. To choose ACRE, the expected benefits per acre must outweigh the direct payments forgone. In Illinois, fixed payments average $18-$25 per acre, with a 20% reduction equaling $3.60-$5.00 per acre. Key to the decision is a farmer's price expectations for the coming years. The ACRE program decision for farmers is influenced by their price expectations for future years. If market prices are expected to remain high, farmers may choose traditional programs to retain direct payments. Economic tools are available to help farmers decide on participating in ACRE, especially if their current plantings and historical base differ significantly. The ACRE program is attractive for crops with high prices and yield variation, like wheat in the western Great Plains. In the South, farmers planting cotton, peanuts, and rice are less likely to choose ACRE due to higher traditional program payments. Approximately 8% of farms participated in ACRE for the 2009 crop year, representing nearly 13% of base acres. In 2010, base acres enrolled in the ACRE program increased slightly, with Illinois, Nebraska, Iowa, South Dakota, and North Dakota having the largest number of acres. The leading crops were corn, wheat, and soybeans. The Congressional Budget Office estimated ACRE program payments to total $4.9 billion during FY2010-FY2014, with corn, soybeans, wheat, and sorghum accounting for most of the total. This is compared to direct payments of $22.1 billion, counter-cyclical payments of $3.6 billion, and marketing loan program benefits of $0.8 billion. The estimates consider reduced traditional program payments for farmers in ACRE, with expected season-average prices influencing outlays. In November and December 2010, USDA issued approximately $420 million in ACRE payments for major crops like wheat, corn, barley, and soybeans. Most payments went to producers in states like Oklahoma, Washington, and Illinois. An additional $10 million was issued for crops like sunflowers and canola, with the majority going to sunflower producers in Minnesota and Nebraska. The ACRE payments in 2009 varied by state depending on yield performance relative to the past. For example, Oklahoma had a payment rate of $47 per acre, while Washington had $91 per acre due to historical yield levels. Other programs like SURE and crop insurance also interact with ACRE. The 2008 farm bill authorized the SURE program to compensate eligible producers for crop losses not covered by crop insurance. ACRE requires a revenue loss at the state level, so individual farmers with local losses may not be compensated. Payments under SURE include those made under ACRE and other commodity programs. Crop insurance products are available for most program crops, with farmers purchasing policies to cover yield or revenue risk on specific fields. Some policy observers question why taxpayers should fund programs that potentially reimburse a farmer twice. Research suggests that integrating ACRE and crop insurance could reduce premiums by up to 45%, with the federal government covering 60% of the total premium cost. The government covers 60% of the total premium cost for ACRE and crop insurance. Researchers suggest that the overlap between ACRE and crop insurance payments is less than 5%. ACRE reduces revenue risk by lowering farm revenue variability, with stronger effects in areas with low yield variability. High-yielding areas like the Corn Belt can receive high payments due to low yield and revenue variability. In the next farm bill debate, Congress will likely focus on the effectiveness and cost of the ACRE program in reducing revenue risk for producers of program crops. Program effectiveness will be measured by reaching farmers with revenue losses, participation levels, and how ACRE complements crop insurance. Critics suggest ACRE may duplicate payments from crop insurance, while some prefer a county-wide approach. Some farmers and researchers prefer a county-wide trigger for revenue losses over a state trigger to cover local losses effectively. Changing to a county level could increase program costs but reduce crop insurance subsidies. The crop insurance industry is concerned that a county-based ACRE program could decrease the need for crop insurance, especially in the Corn Belt. Payment timing is also a concern as farmers have to wait for national average market prices to calculate payments, which could take over a year. The ACRE program faces challenges with payment timing, program complexity, and farmer education. Some argue for early payments, but there is no statutory authority for it. USDA struggled to provide program information to producers, leading to limited participation. Farm groups criticized local USDA offices for lacking program knowledge. The United States reports farm support to the World Trade Organization as part of its agricultural policy commitments. ACRE payments are classified as \"amber box\" subsidies, which count against the U.S. subsidy limit. Policymakers may need to find ways to avoid violating U.S. commitments due to the mix and level of total program payments. The introduction of ACRE to U.S. farm policy offers farmers a unique opportunity to trade benefits. The introduction of ACRE to U.S. farm policy allows farmers to trade traditional income and price support benefits for reduced risk in crop revenues. Some farmers are hesitant to participate due to uncertainty in ACRE payments. Policymakers may need to consider different trade-offs in the next farm bill debate, such as integrating traditional farm commodity programs, crop insurance, and disaster programs to address concerns about the federal deficit. Farm payments should be tied to specific policy objectives according to the Secretary of Agriculture and others. Some members of Congress foresee a shift towards farm risk management over traditional commodity program payments. The Direct and Counter-Cyclical Payment Program may evolve to require farmers to give up traditional payments for potential ACRE payments, tying farm payments to specific policy objectives for long-term public support."
