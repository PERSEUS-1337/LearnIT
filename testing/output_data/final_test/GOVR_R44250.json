    "content": "Section 811 of the act mandates the establishment of Cooperative Disability Investigations (CDI) units in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and territories by October 1, 2022, to combat disability benefit fraud. Currently, there are 36 CDI units in 31 states and Puerto Rico. The SSA must report annually to Congress on its progress in achieving nationwide CDI coverage. Section 812 prohibits the SSA from considering medical evidence from certain healthcare providers when determining disability eligibility for SSDI. Section 812 of the act prohibits the SSA from considering medical evidence from certain healthcare providers when determining disability eligibility for SSDI or SSI programs. This includes individuals or entities convicted of felonies under specific sections of the Social Security Act, those excluded from federal health care programs, and those penalized for submitting false evidence. The SSA Inspector General and HHS are required to provide information on excluded providers, and the SSA must issue regulations within one year of enactment. The SSA is mandated to issue regulations for this section, which applies to determinations made after the effective date of the regulations or one year after enactment. Section 813 of the act makes conspiring to commit Social Security fraud a felony offense and increases penalties for violations of specific sections of the Social Security Act. The maximum civil monetary penalty is raised to $7,500 for those who violate Section 1129(a)(1) related to providing false evidence in disability determinations. Section 813 of the act prohibits payment of SSDI benefits to individuals penalized for fraudulently concealing work activity. Section 814 addresses misuse of Social Security or Medicare symbols in electronic communications. Section 815 adds costs for work-related disability reviews and fraud prosecutions to SSA program integrity spending adjustments. The discretionary spending cap adjustments for SSA program integrity authorized by Section 251(b)(2)(B) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 are modified for FY2017 to FY2021. The act also reauthorizes the SSA's authority to conduct SSDI demonstration projects, with expiration dates set for December 2021 and December 2022. The authority for SSDI demonstration projects will expire on December 31, 2022. Section 822 of the act outlines requirements for these projects, including promoting attachment to the labor force, reporting objectives and costs to Congress, ensuring voluntary participation with informed consent, and expecting statistically significant results. The SSA is required to conduct a demonstration project outlined in Section 823 of the act, starting no later than January 1, 2017. The project involves reducing benefits for earnings exceeding impairment-related work expenses, with no termination of benefits due to work and continued Medicare eligibility for 93 months if benefits are terminated. The project aims to yield statistically significant results. The SSA can enter data agreements with payroll providers to administer Social Security benefits efficiently and prevent improper payments. Notice must be published in the Federal Register before any exchange. Applicants for Social Security benefits must adhere to certain rules regarding impairment-related work expenses. Section 824 authorizes the SSA to access payroll data for benefit eligibility determination without penalizing inaccuracies. Section 825 requires considering earnings for SSDI eligibility. The SSA considers earnings from services earned in the month performed for initial eligibility, and in the month paid for all other cases. A system of electronic earnings reporting for SSDI beneficiaries must be established by September 30, 2017. Deemed filing rules apply to all persons for Social Security benefits based on disability. The deemed filing rules for Social Security benefits now apply to all individuals, including those at or above full retirement age. This extends the rule to allow dually entitled individuals to receive both retired-worker and spousal benefits, with the spousal benefit subject to reduction. The deemed filing process now applies to all individuals, including those at full retirement age. This allows individuals to receive both retired-worker and spousal benefits, with the spousal benefit subject to reduction. The provision of the dual entitlement rule, effective for individuals reaching age 62 in 2016 or later, states that if a person at full retirement age suspends their retired-worker benefits, no benefits will be payable to another person based on their work record. This allows a spouse at full retirement age to claim spousal benefits on the worker's record. The provision allows a spouse to claim spousal benefits on the worker's record if the worker suspends their retired-worker benefits at full retirement age. No benefits are payable to others based on the worker's record during the suspension period. Additionally, Section 832 of the act requires a qualified psychiatrist or psychologist to complete the medical evaluation for disability determinations. The pilot program allowing disability determinations without a medical review by a physician or psychologist is terminated. All disability determinations must now be made after a medical review. Section 833 reallocates the Social Security payroll tax for the Disability Insurance trust fund. SSDI benefits and administrative costs are being reallocated to increase the funds in the Disability Insurance trust fund. The current payroll tax allocation will change to 10.03% for the Old Age and Survivors Insurance trust fund and 2.37% for the Disability Insurance trust fund from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2018. This reallocation aims to delay the exhaustion of the Disability Insurance trust fund, predicted to occur in 2016. Additionally, authorization is required for the recovery of Social Security or SSI overpayments. The SSA requires authorization to obtain financial records for determining waivers. Section 841 of the act mandates an agreement between SSA and OPM for processing disability annuity and past-due SSDI benefits. OPM provides SSA with information on disability annuity overpayments within 30 days. SSA can withhold past-due SSDI benefits to repay OPM for overpayments, subject to certain limitations. Section 842 of the act removes the requirement for SSA to make determinations of pre-1957 military wage credits every five years. Section 843 adds divorced spouses of railroad workers to the list of beneficiaries whose information is transmitted electronically to the Railroad Retirement Board. Section 844 eliminates certain sections of the Social Security Act. Section 845 of the act requires SSA to make three new reports to Congress regarding program integrity activities for FY2016 through FY2021. Reports must include amounts spent above discretionary spending caps, expenditures on CDI units, fraud cases investigated, felony cases prosecuted under Section 208 of the Social Security Act, and continuing disability reviews conducted. The SSA must report to Congress on continuing disability reviews for SSDI and SSI cases, work-related reviews to assess earnings, cases of fraud leading to benefit termination, and savings from reviews. This includes improper reporting of earnings by beneficiaries and the resulting savings. The report must detail the number of individuals receiving disability benefits, earnings reports received, and outcomes of work-related reviews. The SSA must report to Congress on work-related continuing disability reviews, including outcomes such as suspension or termination of benefits, savings to the Treasury, and participation in the Ticket to Work program. The SSA must report to Congress on work-related continuing disability reviews, outcomes, savings, and participation in the Ticket to Work program. Additionally, the SSA must submit a report on overpayments recovered or waived, and OPM must conduct examinations for hiring administrative law judges as requested by the SSA. The SSA must report to Congress on work-related continuing disability reviews, outcomes, savings, and participation in the Ticket to Work program. Additionally, the SSA must submit a report on overpayments recovered or waived, and OPM must conduct examinations for hiring administrative law judges as requested by the SSA. If delaying the examination poses a risk of judge shortage, the appellant can choose to continue the appeal or take a new examination, with costs covered by the SSA. Successful appellants receive expedited consideration for hire by OPM and the SSA."
