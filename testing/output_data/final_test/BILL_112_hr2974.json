FINDINGS.\" Congress finds that encouraging the participation of small businesses owned by disadvantaged individuals in Federal contracting is beneficial for competition, innovation, and economic revitalization. Small businesses face challenges in accessing Federal opportunities, especially in transportation projects, and Congress supports their inclusion in federally funded projects. The United States Department of Transportation uses Disadvantaged Business Enterprise programs to ensure nondiscrimination in awarding contracts for federally funded projects. Congress and the Department work to provide a level playing field for small businesses owned by disadvantaged individuals to compete fairly for contracts. The Disadvantaged Business Enterprise programs support small businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals to compete successfully in the marketplace. Congress also supports veteran-owned small businesses to participate in Federal contracting and procurement opportunities. The President is required to establish an annual Government-wide goal of at least 3 percent for the award of procurement contracts to small businesses owned by service-disabled veterans. SEC. 2. Participation of disadvantaged business enterprises in high-speed rail projects. Section 26107 of title 49, United States Code, mandates that at least 10 percent of funds for projects under sections 26101 and 26106 must be allocated to small businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, with exceptions allowed if competitive bids are lacking. The Secretary may reduce the percentage of funds allocated to small businesses owned by disadvantaged individuals to ensure project completion. A report to Congress is required if such reduction occurs. The Secretary must establish uniform criteria for certifying small businesses for funding eligibility, including on-site visits and financial analysis. The curr_chunk discusses the eligibility criteria for small businesses to receive funds under specific sections. It includes definitions such as 'small business concern' and mentions compliance with court orders. The curr_chunk discusses the eligibility criteria for small businesses with gross receipts exceeding $19,570,000 per year. It defines socially and economically disadvantaged individuals and includes a clerical amendment. The sense of Congress is to encourage veteran-owned small businesses to participate in Federal contracting and procurement opportunities. This includes making them a key part of small business programs in various Federal agencies."
