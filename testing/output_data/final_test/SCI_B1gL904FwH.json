    "content": "The proposed model combines content and structure information for network embedding and clustering. It approximates the continuous embedding solution with the discrete clustering one, leading to simpler and more interpretable solutions. Experimental results show that the algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods for attributed network datasets. These networks are used in various real-world applications, such as academic and health care networks, where both node links and attributes are available for analysis. Attributed Network Embedding (ANE) aims to find a low-dimensional matrix representation for nodes in a network that preserves both the original network structure and node attribute proximity. Unlike traditional Network Embedding (NE), ANE considers both network proximity and attribute affinity for analysis. Research on ANE is still in its early stages, with a focus on learning representations for social networks, academic citation networks, and protein-protein interaction networks. ANE aims to capitalize on network proximity and node attribute affinity, presenting challenges for existing NE algorithms. The learned representation is beneficial for tasks like network clustering, node visualization, classification, and link prediction. ANE is complex due to high-dimensionality, sparsity, and non-linearity of graph data. Embedding and clustering are commonly used to extract content and structure information from clusters, with various approaches proposed for representation learning and clustering tasks. The proposed algorithms in ANE show benefits for clustering tasks, addressing drawbacks such as deviation of embedding solutions and information loss. The sequential approach of embedding generation and clustering leads to poor performance, prompting the need for a novel simultaneous ANE method. The proposed novel simultaneous ANE and clustering scheme addresses the weakness of sequential approaches by learning embedding from both network and attributes information, enforcing a discrete transformation on continuous labels, and integrating node links and attributes for node representation learning and discrete clustering. A smooth transformation is used to recover a discrete clustering solution from the relaxed continuous embedding. The paper introduces a novel Simultaneous Attributes Network Embedding and Clustering (SANEC) framework for community detection. It presents an objective function and algorithm for data embedding and clustering within this framework. The paper introduces the SANEC framework for community detection, focusing on constructing matrices integrating content and structure information in an attributed network. It discusses the adjacency matrix A, transition matrix W, and utilizing node similarity information from X for preprocessing. The paper introduces the SANEC framework for community detection, focusing on constructing matrices integrating content and structure information in an attributed network. In order to exploit additional information about nodes similarity from X, the dataset X is preprocessed to produce a similarity graph input W X. A K-Nearest-Neighbor (KNN) graph is constructed using the heat kernel and L2 distance, with K = 15 and neighborhood width \u03c3 = 1. The nodes proximity from both content information X and structure information W are combined in an (n \u00d7 n) matrix S. The similarity W is perturbed by adding the similarity from W X, illustrated by applying Multidimensional scaling on both W and S in Figure 3.1. The sparsity in S is overcome by the presence of W X, showing the interest of its use in S for clustering purposes. The paper proposes integrating clustering into a new data representation by assuming nodes with the same label have similar social relations and attributes. This concept is inspired by Canonical Discriminant Analysis (CDA), a dimension-reduction technique related to PCA and canonical correlation. CDA derives a linear combination of variables with the highest multiple correlation with groups, similar to PCA but replacing observations with centroids. The new data representation M = (m ij) of size (n \u00d7 d) is created. The new data representation M = (m ij) integrates W and X by replacing nodes with centroids of their neighborhood. Applying CDA on X and M shows better separated clusters with M than with X. Graph clustering aims to partition nodes into k disjoint clusters based on graph structure and attribute values. The SANEC method aims to obtain informative embedding based on clustering structure in attributed network data. The objective function includes cluster membership matrix G, embedding matrix B, rotation matrix Z, features embedding matrix Q, and regularization parameter \u03bb. Factorization of M and S encourages nodes with similar proximity to have closer representations in the latent space. Optimization leads to clustering nodes into k clusters. The optimization of clustering nodes into k clusters is supported by Z, aiming to achieve good embedding while considering the clustering structure. An alternating optimization algorithm is used to infer the latent factor matrices Z, B, Q, and G. The problem in (3) is equivalent to minimizing Z S \u2212 GZB 2, which can be reduced to maximizing Z Tr(G SBZ) subject to Z Z = I. The SVD for G SB is used to solve this problem efficiently. The SANEC algorithm involves computing matrices Q, B, G, and Z iteratively to optimize clustering and embedding simultaneously. The algorithm utilizes the SVD for G SB to solve the optimization problem efficiently. At each step, information from matrices Q, G, and Z is exploited, highlighting the simultaneity of embedding and clustering. The computation of B, Q, and G is done sequentially, with each step contributing to the overall optimization process. The SANEC algorithm, known as SANEC S, is detailed in Algorithm 1. Convergence is guaranteed but depends on initialization for reaching a local optima. The algorithm is run multiple times to select the best result minimizing the objective function. It focuses on various clustering methods and is compared with deep learning and graph clustering approaches. The algorithm iteratively computes matrices for clustering and embedding optimization. Various clustering methods are compared with deep learning and graph clustering approaches. These include Graph Encoder, DNGR, RTM, RMSC, TADW, DeepWalk, Spectral Clustering, and GAE, each utilizing different techniques for graph embedding and network representation learning. The GAE, VGAE, ARGA, and ARVGA algorithms are used for learning social embedding. These approaches involve autoencoder-based unsupervised frameworks and variational graph autoencoder methods. The graph embedding is learned first, followed by k-means clustering based on the embedding. The regularization parameter \u03bb is varied to find the best results, and clustering performance is evaluated on real-world datasets with known clusters. The SANEC model is evaluated on real-world datasets Citeseer, Cora, and Wiki, with varying \u03bb values to measure its impact on clustering performance. Performance metrics include accuracy, normalized mutual information, and adjusted rand index. The SANEC model's clustering performance is evaluated on real-world datasets using varying \u03bb values. Results show that \u03bb = 10^-2 leads to stable clustering results, while \u03bb > 10 degrades performance due to random initialization of G. The impact of the second term in the model improves clustering quality with smaller \u03bb values. In experiments evaluating clustering performance using ACC, NMI, and ARI, methods integrating information from W show high performance. Deep learning algorithms using both M and W perform even better. SANEC with versions relying on W (SANEC W) or S (SANEC S) show high performances across datasets. SANEC S shows the impact of W X, learning low-dimensional representations that suit the clustering structure. Standardization with tf-idf followed by L2 is used due to the sparsity of X. In this paper, a novel matrix decomposition framework is proposed for simultaneous attributed network data embedding and clustering. The SANEC model offers an embedding that shows a 2d or 3d structure into clusters. UMAP algorithm is used for data visualization, leading to dimension reduction based on manifold learning techniques. The construction of W X and the number of neighbors chosen with UMAP is discussed. Our proposed SANEC S framework combines AN embedding and clustering objectives into a single optimized function. It decomposes into PCA on M, graph embedding in low-dimensional space, and clustering criteria. A discrete rotation feature ensures a smooth transition to a discrete solution for tractable optimization. Results show SANEC S outperforms recent methods, including deep learning, in learning representation and clustering tasks.
