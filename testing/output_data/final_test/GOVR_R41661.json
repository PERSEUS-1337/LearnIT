    "content": "This report explains specific tort reform proposals commonly considered in medical malpractice liability reform measures, such as caps on damages, shared liability for defendants, reduction of damage awards from collateral sources, limits on lawyers' fees, federal statute of limitations, and periodic payment of future damages. Arguments for and against these proposals are discussed from a legal perspective. Medical malpractice liability can be paid periodically rather than in a lump sum. The report includes a summary of tort reform measures in H.R. 5. Tort actions derive from common law, and statutes can change the rules governing them. States and Congress have enacted tort reform statutes, including those related to medical malpractice. Congress can also enact tort reform laws affecting medical malpractice liability under state law. Medical malpractice liability arises from negligence or intentional tort by healthcare professionals. Negligence is defined as conduct falling below the standard of care, requiring doctors to possess a reasonable degree of learning, skill, and care. Many jurisdictions have laws governing medical malpractice liability under state law. Medical malpractice liability can arise from negligence or intentional tort by healthcare professionals. The standard of care is not based on what is \"ordinarily\" or \"generally\" practiced, but on what is \"reasonably\" applied. Negligence in medicine cannot be excused by others practicing the same negligence. Medical malpractice actions can be based on negligence or intentional tort, where the practitioner is accused of intentionally causing harm to the patient. The difference between negligence and intentional tort in medical malpractice lies in poorly performed procedures constituting negligence, while correctly performed procedures without consent may be intentional tort. Economic damages include monetary losses like medical expenses and lost wages, while noneconomic damages cover pain and suffering. Juries traditionally determine noneconomic damages, but judges can reduce excessive awards. H.R. 5 does not limit economic damages in health care lawsuits. The bill would limit noneconomic damages in health care lawsuits to $250,000, covering physical and emotional pain, suffering, and other nonpecuniary losses. Advocates argue that caps on noneconomic damages in health care lawsuits can lead to inconsistency and higher insurance premiums. Disagreements over pain and suffering damages hinder out-of-court settlements and may result in overpayment by insurers. Caps could disproportionately affect elderly and poorer plaintiffs who may not have significant economic damages to claim. Opponents argue that capping noneconomic damages in malpractice suits would reduce incentives for lawyers to represent certain plaintiffs, as well as point out that inflation has diminished the effectiveness of the $250,000 cap set in 1975. Additionally, punitive damages are awarded to punish egregious conduct by defendants, separate from compensatory damages, and are not automatically granted in tort cases. Punitive damages are not typically awarded for mere commission of a tort; there must be circumstances of aggravation, malice, or conscious disregard of others' interests. Some proposed restrictions on punitive damages include narrowing the circumstances for awarding them and requiring clear and convincing evidence from plaintiffs. Proposed restrictions on punitive damages include narrowing the circumstances for awarding them, requiring clear and convincing evidence from plaintiffs, determining liability for punitive damages separately from compensatory damages, and directing a portion of punitive damages to the government or a public-purpose fund. The bill restricts punitive damages in health care lawsuits, requiring clear evidence of malicious intent for their award. Claimants must prove a substantial probability of prevailing on the claim for punitive damages before amending their pleading. Malicious intent is defined as intentionally causing physical injury, excluding health care services. The bill restricts punitive damages in health care lawsuits, requiring clear evidence of malicious intent for their award. Claimants must prove a substantial probability of prevailing on the claim for punitive damages before amending their pleading. The trier of fact would consider factors such as severity of harm, duration of conduct, profitability, and number of products sold in determining punitive damages. No evidence relevant to punitive damages would be admissible in proceedings for compensatory damages. Advocates argue that a lack of cap on punitive damages in medical malpractice cases contributes to instability in the insurance system. Critics claim that punitive damage awards are often unfair, arbitrary, and unpredictable, leading to the need for reform due to outrageous awards. While punitive damages occur in a small number of cases, they can have a devastating impact on individuals. Punitive damages in medical malpractice cases can have a significant impact on defendants and the economy. Some argue that capping punitive damages does not lower insurance premiums. Awards are not always excessive, as data may suggest. These damages serve to deter others and fill gaps left by criminal law. Plaintiffs often do not receive the full jury award due to reductions by trial judges and recent Supreme Court decisions. Agreements limiting payouts before jury rulings are not uncommon. Traditionally, damages are paid in a lump sum, even for future expenses. In recent years, attorneys have opted for structured settlements over lump-sum payments in damages actions. Periodic payment statutes exist in the US, creating barriers for some. Proposals for periodic payment of damages have been applied to future and all damages, raising the issue of converting future awards to present value. The potential impact of requiring conversion of future awards to present value is significant, as it could reduce awards for defendants. However, if a jury is tasked with converting an award into present value, the practical outcome may not change much. Congress may consider the Uniform Periodic Payment of Judgments Act for guidance on addressing periodic payment of future damages. The Uniform Periodic Payment of Judgments Act includes provisions for inflation adjustments and termination of unpaid amounts upon the claimant's death. Future changes in purchasing power can be considered for future damages, while damages for economic losses are typically paid to the plaintiff's estate. Section 8 allows for future damages over $50,000 to be paid periodically without reduction to present value. H.R. 5 allows for periodic payments of judgments, guided by the Uniform Periodic Payment of Judgments Act. Advocates argue that this benefits both parties, as defendants can avoid immediate large payments and plaintiffs receive secure, tax-free income. Periodic payments are similar to structured settlements used in other transactions. Some argue that periodic payments can benefit plaintiffs without the need for legislation, as they provide full compensation when resources are limited. Joint and several liability allows each liable defendant to be held 100% responsible, with the option for overpaying defendants to seek contribution from others. Some states have eliminated joint and several liability, making each defendant liable only for its share of responsibility for the plaintiff's injury. Other states have adopted compromise positions, such as eliminating joint and several liability only for noneconomic damages or for defendants responsible for less than a specified percentage of the plaintiff's harm. See Table A-4 for a 50-state survey on joint and several liability in malpractice actions. Section 4 of the bill primarily addresses a cap on noneconomic damages and also addresses multiple liable defendants seeking contribution from others. The bill addresses joint and several liability, making each defendant responsible for their percentage of fault. Advocates argue that this system can unfairly burden defendants with minimal fault. This has led to the inclusion of deep-pocket defendants like governments and large corporations. Joint and several liability is advocated for to ensure wrongdoers pay more than their share of damages. The collateral source rule allows injured parties to recover damages from defendants even if they receive compensation from third parties like health insurers or the government. Abolishing this rule would result in courts reducing damages by amounts received from collateral sources, which often have a right of subrogation against the tortfeasor. The collateral source rule allows injured parties to recover damages from defendants even if they receive compensation from third parties like health insurers. The rule gives the collateral source a right of subrogation against the tortfeasor, enabling them to sue for the amount owed or paid to the injured party. Eliminating this rule would benefit liability insurers at the expense of health insurers in medical malpractice cases. Some jurisdictions have abolished the collateral source rule only when there is no right of subrogation, leaving the health insurer unaffected. Proposals to abolish the rule consider the plaintiff's insurance premiums, suggesting a reduction in damages by the amount paid for the benefit. Other proposals allow evidence of collateral source payments without specifying if economic damages should be reduced accordingly. The collateral source rule, if abolished, could impact economic and noneconomic damages awards. H.R. 5 included a provision on collateral source benefits, but it was eliminated during the House Committee on the Judiciary mark-up. Advocates argue that the rule allows for double recovery unless the collateral source is specified. Abolishing the collateral source rule may reduce damage awards without denying plaintiffs full recovery of their damages. Advocates argue that it is preferable for the victim, rather than the wrongdoer, to benefit from prudence or good fortune. There are concerns about government-provided benefits being cut back, affecting future services like physical therapy. Contingent fees in legal cases involve lawyers accepting a percentage of the recovery if the plaintiff wins, with no payment if the plaintiff loses. This arrangement allows plaintiffs to afford representation without upfront costs, and lawyers typically receive 33\u2153% to 40% of the recovery. Some states regulate contingent fees in medical malpractice cases by establishing limits on attorney fees or allowing court review of fees' reasonableness. Legislation to limit contingency fees may need to address whether plaintiffs' attorneys can add costs. The bill would impose a sliding scale for attorney fees in health care lawsuits, limiting the total of all contingency fees for representing claimants. The court would have the power to supervise payment arrangements to prevent conflicts of interest, redirecting damages if necessary. The bill proposes a sliding scale for attorney fees in healthcare lawsuits, limiting contingency fees based on the amount recovered by the claimant(s). Advocates argue that limiting contingent fees can prevent inflated verdicts, windfalls for lawyers, and frivolous suits. Opponents of limiting contingent fees argue that such fees enable injured persons to finance lawsuits they could not otherwise afford. They believe lawyers are less likely to file frivolous lawsuits under contingent fee arrangements. Additionally, they argue that hourly fee arrangements can lead to delay and inefficiency, while contingent fees incentivize lawyers to be efficient. The statute of limitations for medical malpractice suits varies by state, typically starting from the date of injury. Some states have a \"discovery\" rule where the statute of limitations begins when the plaintiff discovers the injury or should have discovered it. Plaintiffs prefer this rule as symptoms may not appear immediately. Section 3 of H.R. 5 proposes a statute of limitations for health care lawsuits, requiring them to be filed within three years of the injury or within one year of discovery. Exceptions include fraud, intentional concealment, or the presence of a foreign body with no therapeutic purpose. Minors have three years from the injury manifestation to file a lawsuit. The statute of limitations for medical malpractice actions varies by state, with some allowing minors under six years old to file within three years of injury manifestation or before their eighth birthday. Fraud may toll the statute of limitations for minors. Table A-1 provides definitions of medical malpractice actions in all 50 states, using variations of terms like medical, health care, liability, malpractice, negligence, injury, and claim. This table does not cover malpractice actions in other medical specialties like dentistry. Table A-2 summarizes state laws on caps for punitive damages and noneconomic damages in medical malpractice cases. It provides definitions of medical malpractice actions and the scope of parties covered under these statutes. \"No statute found\" indicates a lack of specific provisions defining medical malpractice actions in certain states. Table A-2 summarizes state laws on caps for punitive damages and noneconomic damages in medical malpractice cases. \"No statute found\" indicates states without specific provisions on caps, either due to constitutional restrictions or legislative choice. Economic damages cover monetary expenses like medical bills, while noneconomic damages compensate for pain and suffering. Punitive damages aim to punish and deter egregious behavior. Punitive damages are awarded to punish and deter egregious conduct by defendants, separate from noneconomic damages. The dollar amount in the chart refers to caps on compensatory noneconomic damages, with some states having total caps on all damages. The listed caps may not apply to all tort actions, but specifically to medical malpractice cases. Table A-3 outlines burden of proof and standards for punitive damages in medical malpractice suits across the 50 states. The state may require a separate hearing to determine punitive damages, with varying burdens of proof such as \"preponderance of the evidence\" or \"clear and convincing evidence.\" Colorado, however, requires proof \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\" To recover punitive damages in a medical malpractice case, the plaintiff must prove conduct more egregious than negligence. The availability of bifurcated trial process for punitive damages varies by state, with some requiring a separate hearing to determine punitive damages. Additional evidence related to the defendant's financial condition can be presented in such proceedings. \"N/A\" indicates that the state may not have specific statutes addressing bifurcation for punitive damages. The civil procedure rules in some states allow for bifurcation of punitive damages or separate trials for claims to expedite proceedings. Provisions in the chart apply to punitive damages in various tort cases, including medical malpractice. Joint and several liability and periodic payment provisions are outlined in Table A-4 for all 50 states. In a 50-state survey of joint and several liability, it is noted whether the doctrine applies, if there is a modified version, or if only several liability is in place. The term \"modified joint and several liability\" is used for cases where defendants are jointly and severally liable for certain damages but not others. For example, in Hawaii, joint and several liability applies. In Hawaii, joint and several liability applies for economic damages, while several liability applies for noneconomic damages if a defendant's negligence is over 25% of the total fault. The term \"modified joint and several liability\" is used when joint and several liability is triggered by a certain percentage of fault or for specific damages. In Iowa, joint and several liability does not apply if a defendant bears less than 50% of the total fault, but it applies for economic damages if a defendant bears over 50% of the fault. In some states, joint and several liability is abolished except in cases where tort-feasors acted in concert or with intent. Courts may enter judgments for periodic payment of future damages in malpractice actions. Structured settlement contracts are governed by general provisions in most states. For example, Massachusetts and Hawaii have specific laws governing structured settlements. In Hawaii, the state's Structured Settlement Protection Act is governed by Hawaii Revised Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 676-1 et seq. In New Jersey, structured settlements are governed by N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 2A:16-63 et seq. Table A-5 outlines limits on attorneys' contingency fees in the 50 states, with most statutes having a sliding scale. Some states have specific provisions on how attorneys' fees are calculated in relation to damages awards. Several states like Arizona, Kansas, and Washington have statutory provisions for reviewing the reasonableness of attorneys' fees in health care actions. Factors considered include time and labor required, fee customarily charged, amount involved, and results obtained. Alaska specifies how contingency fees are calculated when punitive damages are awarded. North Dakota has its own provisions on attorneys' fees. The curr_chunk discusses the statute of limitations for medical malpractice and product liability actions in the 50 states. It mentions that some states have specific provisions for attorneys' fees, while others do not. The table provided in the text outlines the different statutes of limitations for each state. The statute of limitations for medical malpractice and product liability actions varies by state, with exceptions for minors or individuals with mental disabilities. States like Arizona extend the time limit for filing a claim in such cases. Many states have special time limitations for specific types of actions, such as damages sustained during birth, blood transfusions tainted with HIV or AIDS, and products like the Dalkon Shield Intrauterine Device and breast implants. These exceptions vary across states and are not included in the general statute of limitations for medical malpractice and product liability actions. Many states have special exceptions that may affect the general time limitations for certain actions."
