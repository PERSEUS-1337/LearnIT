The Congress finds that torture creates fear and insecurity, destroys individuals and society, and is used by repressive governments to suppress democracy. Torture victims face long-term physical and psychological threats, with perpetrators often not held accountable. Torture victims and their caregivers need protection from reprisals. Many refugees in the US have been tortured and need prompt asylum consideration. Survivors should receive rehabilitation services to integrate into society. Democratic cultures require addressing torture survivors' needs. The development of a treatment movement for torture survivors has created new opportunities for action by the United States and other nations to oppose state-sponsored acts of torture. There is a need for a comprehensive strategy to protect and support torture victims and their treatment providers as part of the overall objective of eliminating torture. By acting to heal the survivors of torture and protect their families, the United States can move to defeat the actions of torturers.

The term \"torture\" in this Act refers to intentionally inflicting severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, on a person for purposes such as obtaining information, punishment, intimidation, or discrimination, by a public official or someone acting in an official capacity. It excludes pain or suffering from lawful sanctions. The terms \"substantial grounds for believing,\" \"in danger of being subjected to torture,\" and \"involuntary return\" are defined in this Act as substantial evidence, circumstances where a reasonable person would fear torture, and actions leading to a person's return without consent, respectively.

Any alien who claims to have been tortured in their country of nationality or last habitual residence and applies for refugee status, asylum, or withholding of deportation will be processed according to this section. Officials considering these applications must take into account the effects of torture. Officials processing refugee applications from individuals claiming to have been tortured must consider the impact of torture on the applicant's ability to provide information, the challenges victims face in recounting their experiences, and the fear of returning to their country where perpetrators may still hold power. Refugees with credible claims of torture are given priority in the selection process. The United States gives priority to refugees with compelling humanitarian concerns. Asylum officers can expedite asylum interviews for those at risk of torture. Parole may be granted to tortured individuals at the port of entry.
