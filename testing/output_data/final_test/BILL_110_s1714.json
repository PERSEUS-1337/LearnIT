    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Small Business Children's Health Education Act of 2007\". Congress finds that nearly 2 million uninsured children eligible for the State Children's Health Insurance Program are not enrolled, 4 million uninsured children eligible for Medicaid remain uninsured, and the SCHIP only reaches 69% of its target population. Additionally, children from self-employed or small business families are less likely to be enrolled in the program. The Federal Government aims to increase awareness and enrollment in the State Children's Health Insurance Program for uninsured families, especially those with parents working for small businesses or are self-employed. Data shows that a higher percentage of eligible children from small business families are not enrolled compared to those from large firms. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
