The GIRLS STEM Act authorizes grants for eligible schools to establish programs encouraging female students in STEM careers and preparing them for industry-recognized credentials. Grants are awarded in 4-year increments. The GIRLS STEM Act requires eligible local educational agencies to submit an application to the Secretary for grants or contracts. The application must include a program description, collaboration between schools, and a comprehensive plan to improve science and mathematics education. The GIRLS STEM Act requires eligible local educational agencies to submit an application to the Secretary for grants or contracts. The application must include a program description, collaboration between schools, and a comprehensive plan to improve science, mathematics, engineering, and technology education for female students in kindergarten through grade 12. The application should also detail the process for recruitment and selection of participants, planned instructional and motivational activities, and any necessary collaborations with institutions and organizations. The Secretary will consider each agency's application demonstrating their commitment to fulfilling the program's goals when selecting grant recipients. The eligible local educational agency must use grant funds to acquaint female students with STEM careers, educate parents on STEM opportunities, provide tutoring and mentoring programs, and establish partnerships. The grant funds must be used to expose female students to STEM role models, provide after-school activities, conduct summer programs, and purchase educational materials to encourage their interest in science and technology. The curr_chunk focuses on providing academic and career counseling services, facilitating internships, and offering professional development for teachers to eliminate gender bias in the classroom and engage students in STEM fields. The curr_chunk discusses the requirements for local educational agencies receiving grants under this program, emphasizing the need to supplement, not supplant, other funding sources. It also mandates that agencies evaluate improvements in academic and career counseling, internships, and teacher professional development in STEM fields. The curr_chunk defines an 'eligible local educational agency' as one serving underrepresented or low-income students. Authorization of appropriations for the program \"Preparing Females for the 21st Century\" is set at $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2019 through 2023."
