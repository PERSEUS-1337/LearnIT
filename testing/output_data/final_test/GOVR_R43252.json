    "content": "On September 30, 2013, the Office of Management and Budget announced an emergency shutdown furlough due to a lapse in annual appropriations for FY2014. Federal agencies were instructed to prepare contingency plans. The Department of Homeland Security released procedures for handling the funding hiatus, including determining essential personnel, ceasing operations, recalling workers in emergencies, and restarting operations once funding was resolved. On October 17, 2013, the President signed legislation for a short-term continuing resolution funding government operations through January 15, 2014. The legislation signed on October 17, 2013, resolved the funding lapse and returned federal employees to work with retroactive pay. The report discusses the DHS contingency plan and legislative actions to mitigate the impacts of a funding lapse. Lapses in annual appropriations result in a partial shutdown of government operations and emergency furloughs, but do not completely shut down operations. During a funding lapse, DHS personnel are divided into two categories: those funded through one-year appropriations and those essential for safety and property protection. Nearly 200,000 employees were exempt from emergency furlough, not receiving pay during the lapse. During a funding lapse, DHS personnel funded by fee revenues and multi-year appropriations would continue working and be paid. Specific activities under various programs would be funded through fee revenues and multi-year appropriations, ensuring continuity of operations. During a funding lapse, DHS personnel funded by fee revenues and multi-year appropriations would continue working and be paid. Some exempt employees at CBP, ICE, TSA, and FLETC may have continued to receive pay despite the lapse in appropriations for FY2014. Fees and multi-year funding must be used for their intended purposes. Certain activities can continue during a lapse if they relate to preserving human life or protecting property.

Some exempt employees at CBP, ICE, TSA, and FLETC may have continued to receive pay despite the lapse in appropriations for FY2014. Fees and multi-year funding must be used for their intended purposes. Certain activities can continue during a lapse if they relate to preserving human life or protecting property. According to the DHS plan, activities under this exception must have a reasonable likelihood of compromising safety or property protection significantly by delaying their performance. Employees working under this exemption are limited to essential activities related to the protection of life and property. Functions under CBP and ICE are included in this exemption. During a funding lapse, certain DHS employees continued working under exemptions, including Border Security Programs, Immigration Enforcement, Transportation Security, Maritime Security, Cyber Security, and Protection of Persons and Facilities. Only those exempt from furlough due to available funds received pay during the funding gap. During a funding lapse, exempted employees continued to receive pay for work performed. OMB guidance states that all excepted employees are entitled to payment for obligations incurred during the appropriations lapse. A narrow exception allows for up to four hours of work to orderly shut down non-exempt operations. Presidential appointees are also addressed in the guidance. During a funding lapse, exempted employees continued to receive pay for work performed. Presidential appointees who are not covered by a formal leave system cannot be put in \"nonduty status\" and therefore cannot be subject to furlough. DHS reports having 28 such personnel. The terms \"exempted employee\" and \"essential employee\" are not interchangeable. \"Essential employees\" are labeled as such because of their roles in providing continuity of government operations. By DHS's standards, \"essential personnel\" include \"mission critical\" and \"mission essential\" personnel. During a funding lapse, essential personnel at DHS include mission critical and mission essential personnel, emergency personnel, and exempted employees not covered by other categories. The contingency plan for the 2013 funding lapse outlined staffing impacts by component. Furloughed employees do not fully represent the shutdown's impact, as government contracting activities are also affected. During a funding lapse, essential personnel at DHS include mission critical and mission essential personnel, emergency personnel, and exempted employees not covered by other categories. The contingency plan for the 2013 funding lapse outlined staffing impacts by component. Furloughed employees do not fully represent the shutdown's impact, as government contracting activities are also affected significantly. Hiring, procurement, and other projects are stalled, and research efforts could be disrupted. Many excepted personnel are not paid during the lapse, curtailing their economic activities. Figure 1 shows the impact of the lapse in appropriations on the department's workforce, with the five largest components comprising 87% of total DHS personnel. The largest share of the projected furlough for DHS as a whole\u2014Customs and Border Protection, Coast Guard, Transportation Security Administration, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency bore 77% of the furlough burden. Management, research and development, training, and some operations functions were projected to furlough more than 90% of their personnel. The impact of a shutdown on these functions and the projected reduction in staffing for the DHS Office of Inspector General is unknown. Several activities would be subject to furloughs and curtailment of activities, including all non-disaster grant programs. The DHS plan included furloughs and curtailment of activities for various programs, such as NPPD's Critical Infrastructure Protective Security Advisor Program and FEMA Flood Risk Mapping program. Non-exempt employees could be recalled for exempt functions like unplanned projects or staffing needs. Staff recalled for a project were to work solely on that project. FEMA is recalling furloughed employees to prepare for emergency response operations. President Obama mentioned the recall of 200 employees, with over half facing re-furlough. The Pay Our Military Act provides funding during a funding gap for armed forces and Coast Guard personnel. The Pay Our Military Act provides pay for Coast Guard uniformed personnel on active service, civilian personnel, and contractors supporting them. The Department of Defense and DHS initially did not avoid furlough for employees, but later announced parameters for bringing employees back to work and paying contractors. The Administration outlined guidelines for civilians supporting the Armed Forces during a lapse in appropriations. Salaries would be paid for exempted civilians and those crucial for military readiness would be recalled. Acting Secretary of DHS sent a memorandum to the Coast Guard detailing the implementation of the Pay Our Military Act, specifying activities not to be restored under the act. After the passage of P.L. 113-46, the Coast Guard resolved the lapse in annual appropriations that began on October 1, 2013. If temporary appropriations expire without additional funding for DHS, another shutdown furlough could occur, affecting 475 Coast Guard civilian personnel. Despite P.L. 113-39 providing funding for most personnel, the funding hiatus still has a significant impact according to Under Secretary Hale and Acting Secretary Beers. The Coast Guard has funding for personnel under P.L. 113-39, but not for supplies or equipment. Civilian employees can be recalled and paid, but caution is advised against ordering supplies for non-excepted activities. The Act does not cover expenses beyond pay and allowances, except for certain contractors. The Coast Guard may have to send civilian employees home if Congress fails to provide funding, leading to a shortage of critical supplies. The economic impact of the shutdown on DHS activities is significant, affecting procurement activities and overall government costs. The economic costs of the DHS shutdown are complex and include late payment interest, lost discounts, travel expenses, and IT system shutdown costs. The shutdown has negatively impacted federal employee morale and could affect workforce retention. The DHS shutdown has led to parallel impacts at the department, including the expiration of three important authorities. One significant impact was the lapse of authority to regulate high-risk chemical facilities, affecting those working with DHS. In 2013, the Chemical Facilities Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) were reinstated by P.L. 113-46 after a lapse in effect. During the funding lapse, DHS could not enforce regulations on these facilities, impacting E-Verify, FEMA flood-risk data, civil rights investigations, Coast Guard licensing, and fisheries enforcement patrols. During the funding lapse in 2013, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) could not enforce regulations on chemical facilities, impacting various areas such as E-Verify, FEMA flood-risk data, civil rights investigations, Coast Guard licensing, and fisheries enforcement patrols. Legislation introduced aimed to mitigate these impacts, including the Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2014 and the Pay Our Military Act. Resolution, 2014 H.J.Res. 85 and H.J.Res. 89, along with P.L. 113-46, are related to appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security in FY2014. The Administration requested $39.0 billion in budget authority, with the House and Senate proposing slightly different amounts. Both bills also include $5.6 billion in disaster relief. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed H.R. 2217 on July 18, 2013, but it has not been considered on the Senate floor. An automatic continuing resolution, P.L. 113-39, was enacted on September 28, 2013, providing necessary funds for pay and allowances for FY2014 to members of the armed forces and civilians employed by DOD and DHS. This measure aims to ensure funding during periods when full-year appropriations are not in effect. The automatic continuing resolution, P.L. 113-39, provided funds for pay and allowances for military and civilian personnel of DOD and DHS during funding hiatus. Despite the legislation, furloughs for Coast Guard personnel continued until P.L. 113-46 was enacted. The fifth piece of legislation, P.L. 113-46, ended the lapse in annual appropriations with a short-term continuing resolution for DHS. It provided temporary funding at the same rate as FY2013 until December 15, 2013. The legislation contains four sections with authority and direction for DHS, including extending the authority for chemical facility anti-terrorism. Section 122 extends the authority for chemical facility anti-terrorism standards. Section 123 extends the ability of the Secret Service to expend resources gained in their investigations. Section 124 allows DHS Science and Technology to use Other Transaction Authority for R&D services and prototypes. Section 125 permits Customs and Border Protection to maintain 21,370 border patrol agents and allows Immigration and Customs Enforcement to keep 34,000 detention beds. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the cost of these provisions in the continuing resolution to be $37.7 billion. The continuing resolution includes funding for DHS provisions, with amendments shortening the bill's duration. The House requested a conference with the Senate, but the Senate voted to table the request. Enactment of the measure would have ended the government's emergency furlough. Funding details are not provided in the current version of the bill. The continuing resolution introduced on October 3, 2013, would restore DHS annualized appropriations at a rate equivalent to post-sequester resources provided under P.L. 113-6. It would fund several DHS components, including CBP, ICE, USCG, USCIS, and part of NPPD, at the same rate as P.L. 113-6. The House passed H.J.Res. 79 on October 10, 2013, with a vote of 249-175. The measure would fund DHS entities at the same rate as P.L. 113-6 through December 15, 2013, costing $18.8 billion annually. It would end emergency furloughs for listed entities until its expiration date, but lacks specific funding details or congressional intent statements. The House passed H.J.Res. 79 to fund DHS entities at the same rate as P.L. 113-6 through December 15, 2013. This measure would restore funding to key DHS components like CBP, ICE, and USCG, totaling 16,866 employees. Removing the funding hiatus impact on these components would represent a significant restoration of funding to the department. The CR introduced on October 3, 2013, aimed to provide temporary funding for FEMA to prevent a funding hiatus affecting various components of DHS, including management, intelligence, TSA, Secret Service, and other key functions. Most of these functions were projected to furlough a significant percentage of their employees if the funding was not restored. The House passed H.J.Res. 85 on October 4, 2013, providing temporary funding for FEMA until December 15, 2013. The bill would cost $10.2 billion, ending the emergency furlough for FEMA. No specific funding details were provided in the legislation. The bill H.J.Res. 59 provides legislative extensions of authority for DHS, leaving oversight functions unfunded. It is uncertain if funds would transfer to DHS OIG for disaster relief oversight. Figure 2 compares DHS appropriations under H.J.Res. 59 to other temporary measures. The pie chart reflects the annual discretionary budget authority for DHS provided through various legislative measures, including regular appropriations, adjustments for disaster relief and military operations, and continuing resolutions at the FY2013 post-sequester funding level. The FY2013 post-sequester funding level for DHS was covered by resolutions like H.J.Res. 59 and P.L. 113-46, while others only covered portions of the department. H.J.Res. 89, passed on October 8, 2013, provided temporary funding for federal employees until December 15, 2013. H.R. 2775, passed on October 8, 2013 by a vote of 420-0, provides temporary appropriations for federal workers during the government shutdown. The bill does not end furloughs but maintains compensation for \"excepted\" or \"exempted\" employees, including those at DHS. The legislation only covers \"salaries and related expenses\" with no specific funding direction or explanatory statement of congressional intent. The amended measure H.R. 2775 provides temporary appropriations for the federal government, including DHS, funding at the same rate as FY2013 through January 15, 2013. It passed the Senate by a vote of 81-18 and the House of Representatives by a vote of 285-144, leading to the government resuming operations on October 17, 2013. P.L. 113-46 contains five sections that specifically apply to DHS, with four having a similar impact as H.J.Res. 59 and the fifth requiring DHS to share reports with specific committees. The amended measure H.R. 2775 provides temporary appropriations for the federal government, including DHS, funding at the same rate as FY2013 through January 15, 2013. It passed the Senate by a vote of 81-18 and the House of Representatives by a vote of 285-144, leading to the government resuming operations on October 17, 2013. Division A includes legislative language authorizing back pay for furloughed and exempted federal employees during the October 1, 2013 funding lapse. The annualized cost of DHS-related provisions in the act is projected to be $37.7 billion, excluding additional funding for the Coast Guard and disaster relief. The House passed H.R. 3223 by a vote of 407-0 on October 5, 2013, authorizing back pay for furloughed employees of DHS after the funding lapse in FY2014. This measure ended the emergency furlough resulting from the lapse in appropriations on October 1, 2013. No detailed funding direction is provided, and it does not change DHS operations directly. Establishment of back pay for furloughed DHS employees after a funding lapse would have significant budgeting and performance implications, as resources allocated for regular duties would instead be used to compensate staff for shutdown procedures."
