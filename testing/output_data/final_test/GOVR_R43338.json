    "content": "Congress uses an annual appropriations process to provide discretionary spending for federal government agencies through 12 appropriations subcommittees. These subcommittees draft legislation for regular appropriations bills to cover all programs under their jurisdiction. If regular appropriations are not enacted by the fiscal year deadline, continuing resolutions (CRs) may be used. Supplemental appropriations can also be enacted during the fiscal year. Amounts provided in appropriations acts are subject to limits. The FY2014 appropriations process was influenced by the late resolution of FY2013 appropriations and disagreement over funding levels for discretionary spending. Annual appropriations for FY2013 were not completed until March 26, 2013, almost six months into the fiscal year. Despite ongoing congressional concern, efforts to restructure or eliminate reductions in non-exempt FY2013 discretionary spending were not successful. The FY2014 appropriations process was affected by disagreements over discretionary spending levels and constraints. Efforts to restructure or eliminate reductions in FY2013 discretionary spending were unsuccessful. Statutory discretionary spending limits were implemented for FY2014, with separate limits for defense and nondefense spending. Enforcement of these limits was set to occur 15 days after Congress adjourned its session in 2013. An agreement on FY2014 and FY2015 funding levels was announced on December 10, 2013. The House and Senate Budget Committees reached an agreement on FY2014 and FY2015 discretionary spending levels, leading to the Bipartisan Budget Act being enacted into law on December 26, 2013. A 16-day funding gap occurred in October 2013 due to the delay in enacting regular appropriations bills for FY2014. Ultimately, regular appropriations were passed through an omnibus measure, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014. Late in the fiscal year, three supplemental appropriations measures were considered by Congress. Three supplemental appropriations measures were passed late in the fiscal year, with Congress completing action only on H.J.Res. 76, providing additional appropriations for military cooperation with Israel's Iron Dome program. This report offers background and analysis on the FY2014 appropriations process, discussing discretionary budget enforcement, regular appropriations enactment, and aggregate discretionary spending. Additional details on these appropriations acts can be found in various CRS reports comparing House and Senate proposals. The congressional budget process includes budget enforcement measures derived from the Budget Control Act of 2011, setting limits on discretionary spending for defense and nondefense categories. The Bipartisan Budget Act amended these limits for FY2014 and FY2015. Enforcement mechanisms include sequestration if spending exceeds these limits. Budget enforcement measures are in place to limit discretionary spending, with sequestration as an enforcement mechanism if spending exceeds these limits. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 outlines the procedural elements of budget enforcement, including the allocation of discretionary budget authority among subcommittees to cap appropriations bills. The Budget Control Act (BCA) enforces discretionary spending limits through sequestration if spending exceeds set levels. The Office of Management and Budget evaluates enacted spending for FY2014 to determine if sequestration is necessary. The BCA specifies spending limits and a process to reduce them to achieve savings between FY2014 and FY2021. The revised FY2014 spending limits were $552 billion for defense and $506 billion for nondefense. These limits were further revised to about $498.1 billion for defense and about $469.4 billion for nondefense. The Bipartisan Budget Act amended these levels to $520.5 billion in defense and $491.8 billion in nondefense spending. Both the House and Senate completed initial floor consideration of the FY2014 budget resolution in March 2013. The Senate adopted S.Con.Res. 8 on March 23 by a vote of 50-49. A conference committee was agreed upon for the resolution on October 16, but no agreement has been reached yet. The House and Senate budget resolutions assumed different levels of discretionary spending compared to the revised BCA limits. The House resolution proposed $552 billion for defense and $414.4 billion for nondefense spending in FY2014. The Senate-adopted budget resolution increased defense discretionary spending to its revised BCA level and offset the total with reductions to nondefense discretionary spending. The House Budget Committee report and Senate Budget Committee print provided a 302(a) allocation for the Appropriations Committee to enforce budget procedures during FY2014 appropriations acts. The House allocation was $966.4 billion for total FY2014 discretionary spending, consistent with existing statutory limits. The House and Senate allocated about $966.4 billion for FY2014 discretionary spending, in line with existing statutory limits. Despite not agreeing on a budget resolution, both chambers began considering appropriations bills. The House adopted H.Res. 243 to enforce the allocation associated with the House budget resolution. The Senate Appropriations Committee adopted an FY2014 suballocation based on the Senate-adopted budget resolution. The Bipartisan Budget Act enabled the House and Senate Budget Committee chairs to provide 302(a) allocations for discretionary spending. Committee chairs provided 302(a) allocations for discretionary spending in FY2014, with House and Senate allocations filed in the Congressional Record. Annual appropriations are made in 12 regular bills for federal agencies' projects. Bills can be enacted separately or combined into an omnibus bill. If not enacted, funding may be provided through a full-year CR by October 1. During FY2014 appropriations process, House and Senate Committees reported regular bills, but no appropriations were enacted before the fiscal year began. OMB projected bills would exceed spending limits. After Bipartisan Budget Act, Committees reached agreement on appropriations. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees reached an agreement on regular appropriations for FY2014, resulting in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 (H.R. 3547; P.L. 113-76) being enacted on January 17, 2014. Subcommittee and full committee actions on approving and reporting regular appropriations bills took place over an 11-week period, with the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations bill (H.R. 2216) being the first to be approved in subcommittee on May 15, 2013. In 2013, the House Appropriations Committee reported the first regular appropriations bill to the House on May 28. A total of 12 regular appropriations bills were approved by subcommittees in May, June, and July. The final bill reported to the House was the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations bill on July 30. Two bills were not reported to the House, including the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill and the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill. The House Appropriations Committee reported 12 regular appropriations bills in 2013, with the Department of State bill being the final one on July 30. The Services, Education, and Related Agencies bill was not approved by the subcommittee or full committee. Five bills were considered on the House floor, starting with the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs bill on June 4, 2013, and ending with the Department of Defense bill on July 24. The House began initial consideration of the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill (H.R. 2610) on July 30, with a vote of 315-109. OMB projected budgetary levels for House regular appropriations bills on August 20, 2013, showing excess defense spending of $47.9 billion. Total nondefense discretionary spending was projected to be about $625.4 billion. Nondefense discretionary spending was projected to be about $431.5 billion, with various allocations for OCO/GWOT, disability reviews, health care fraud control, and disaster relief. The 12 regular appropriations bills were approved over a seven-week period, starting with the Agriculture Appropriations bill on June 18, 2013. The first four bills were reported to the Senate in June 2013, including Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, Transportation, Housing, Urban Development, and Energy and Water Development. A total of 10 regular appropriations bills were approved by subcommittees in June, July, and August, with one bill not reported to the Senate. The Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill was not reported to the Senate in 2013. The only regular appropriations bill to receive floor consideration was the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development bill. Cloture was invoked on the motion to proceed, but the Senate was unsuccessful in closing debate. OMB projected the budgetary levels of the Senate regular appropriations bills on August 20, 2013. On August 20, 2013, the Senate regular appropriations bills projected defense discretionary spending to be $552.2 billion, exceeding the limit by $54.1 billion. Including spending designated for OCO/GWOT, total defense discretionary spending was projected to be $631.6 billion. Nondefense discretionary spending was projected to be $503.7 billion, exceeding the limit by $34.3 billion. Including designated nondefense spending, the total was projected to be $514.5 billion. On January 13, 2014, an omnibus bill was announced by the House and Senate Appropriations Committee chairs. On January 13, 2014, an omnibus appropriations package combining 12 regular appropriations bills was announced by the House and Senate Appropriations Committee chairs. The bill, signed into law on January 17, 2014, provided discretionary appropriations within FY2014 spending limits as estimated by CBO. Total appropriations for FY2014 were projected to be about $1.1 billion, subject to spending limits. A funding gap began on October 1 due to the absence of regular appropriations or a broad continuing resolution. A narrow CR was enacted one day before the funding gap, funding pay and allowances for certain military members, DOD and DHS civilian personnel, and contractors. Only one narrow CR was enacted during the funding gap. The funding gap for FY2014 appropriations was resolved with the enactment of a broad Continuing Resolution (CR) covering projects and activities at an annualized rate of $986.3 billion through January 15, 2014. Prior to this, a narrow CR was enacted to fund certain military members, DOD and DHS civilian personnel, and contractors. Congressional action focused on the Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2014, which aimed to cover FY2013 projects and activities through December 15, 2013. The Congressional Budget Office projected total regular appropriations under the proposal to be $986.3 billion. The House passed H.J.Res. 59 to prohibit federal funds for the ACA. Senate cloture was invoked on September 25 and 27. The Senate passed H.J.Res. 59 with amendments to remove House ACA provisions and change the funding expiration date to November 15, 2013. Congressional action to resolve differences occurred between September 28 and October 1, with the House voting to concur with Senate amendments and the Senate tabling House amendments on September 30. The House and Senate engaged in a series of votes and amendments regarding H.J.Res. 59, with the House ultimately requesting a conference with the Senate. Another CR, the Pay Our Military Act (H.R. 3210), was also introduced before the fiscal year began. During the FY2014 funding gap, the Pay Our Military Act (H.R. 3210) was swiftly passed by the House and Senate to ensure pay and allowances for military personnel, civilian federal workers, and contractors. The measure was signed into law by the President on the same day it was passed. During the FY2014 funding gap from October 1-16, 2013, the House passed 15 narrow CRs to fund specific projects until December 15, 2013. CBO projected that 13 of these CRs would provide $108.306 billion in annualized regular appropriations, representing 11% of the FY2014 discretionary spending limits. The highest budget authority was for the National Institutes of Health at $29.173 billion, while the lowest was for the Department of Defense Survivor Benefits at $116 million. These CRs were considered on the House floor under special rules, except for one. During the FY2014 funding gap, the House passed 15 narrow CRs to fund specific projects until December 15, 2013. The Department of Defense Survivor Benefits CR (H.J.Res. 91) was enacted in response to a dispute regarding death gratuities. It was passed by the House and Senate and signed into law by the President. The total budget authority for regular appropriations in this CR was $116 million. The Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014 (P.L. 113-46) was enacted to address the funding gap during FY2014. The CR had a total CBO estimate of $150 million in annualized budget authority for OCO/GWOT. Congressional negotiations led to the passage of H.R. 2775, which was signed into law on October 17, 2013. The CR expired on January 15, 2014. On January 10, 2014, H.J.Res. 106 was introduced to extend the previous CR to January 18, 2014. It was adopted in the House and Senate, signed into law as P.L. 113-73. CBO estimated $986.3 billion in budget authority for regular appropriations in the FY2014 CR. The FY2014 CR under P.L. 113-73 had a total annualized budget authority of $1.088 trillion, including provisions for OCO/GWOT, disability reviews, health care fraud, and disaster relief. CBO projected that nondefense spending was below the limit at $468.3 billion, while defense spending exceeded the limit at $518 billion. The Bipartisan Budget Act later adjusted the limits, bringing defense spending in line. The FY2014 CR had budget authority of $1.088 trillion, with defense spending exceeding the limit. OMB announced no sequestration was necessary. A request for $4.346 billion in supplemental appropriations was made for border security and wildfire management. The President requested $3.731 billion for immigration and border security, and $615 million for wildland fire management as emergency spending. The Senate introduced a bill for $3.571 billion in additional appropriations for these purposes, along with military cooperation with Israel for the Iron Dome program. The Senate considered S. 2648 on July 31, but a point of order was raised and sustained under the Congressional Budget Act. The bill was then referred to the Committee on Appropriations. On July 29, Rep. Harold Rogers introduced H.R. 5230, providing $659 million for immigration and border security. The House debated the bill on July 31 under a special rule. The House passed H.R. 5230 with an additional $35 million for the Army National Guard for border security activities. The Senate passed a separate measure for Iron Dome funding as emergency appropriations. The House passed H.R. 5230 with additional funding for the Army National Guard for border security activities. The Senate later agreed to a substitute amendment by a vote of 395-8, and the measure was signed into law on August 4, 2014."
