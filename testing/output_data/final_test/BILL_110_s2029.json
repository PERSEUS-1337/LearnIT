The Physician Payments Sunshine Act of 2007 mandates manufacturers to report payments or transfers of value to physicians or entities they are associated with to the Secretary quarterly. This includes disclosing the names of physicians or entities, along with their addresses. The Physician Payments Sunshine Act of 2007 requires manufacturers to report payments or transfers of value to physicians or entities they are associated with, including details like the primary place of business, affiliated facility, value of payment, date provided, and nature of the payment. The Physician Payments Sunshine Act of 2007 mandates manufacturers to disclose payments or transfers of value to physicians or associated entities, including details like the nature of the payment, product rebates, consulting fees, and any other economic benefits defined by the Secretary. Manufacturers must also report the medical issue or condition addressed that was the basis for the payment or transfer. Manufacturers must submit a report summarizing information on payments to physicians by December 31 each year. Failure to comply may result in civil money penalties ranging from $10,000 to $100,000. The Secretary will establish procedures for public availability of this information by June 1, 2008. The Secretary will ensure public access to reported information on payments to physicians through a searchable website. An annual report to Congress will include aggregated data on manufacturers' submissions, enforcement actions, and penalties imposed. In subsection (c), manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, or medical supplies with annual gross revenues exceeding $100,000,000 are defined. The term 'covered drug, device, or medical supply' refers to products eligible for payment under Medicare or Medicaid. The term 'payment or other transfer of value' in the context of packaging, labeling, and distribution of covered drugs, devices, or medical supplies refers to transfers exceeding $25, including compensation, gifts, fees, travel, discounts, and services, but excludes product samples for patients and funding for clinical trials. The term 'payment or other transfer of value' excludes funding for clinical trials and transfers to physicians when they are patients and not acting in their professional capacity."
