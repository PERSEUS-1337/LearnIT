    "content": "The Even Start Family Literacy program, authorized by ESEA Title I, Part B, integrates early childhood education, adult basic education, and parenting skills education for disadvantaged parents and their children. The program aims to support children's educational success by providing educational services to parents and teaching them how to help their children learn. This approach is based on the belief that parents with low literacy levels can better support their children's education through participation in adult basic education programs. Even Start is a federal program dedicated to providing joint education programs for children aged 0-7 years and their parents. The program requires at least one parent to be eligible for Adult Education Act services. Even Start programs provide services for children within the compulsory school age range, including adult literacy instruction, early childhood education, parent support, recruitment, screening, staff training, and home-based instruction. They collaborate with other service providers like Head Start programs and AEA grantees, offer child care and transportation if needed, operate year-round, and undergo independent evaluation. Funds are reserved for migrant children, outlying areas, Indian tribes, and national evaluation, technical assistance, and program improvement. Even Start grants are provided to states based on ESEA Title I, Part A grants, with a state minimum allocation. State grants can be used for administration and technical assistance. Local grants are awarded by SEAs to programs in high-need areas. Grants are given for up to four years and must meet quality indicators for monitoring and improvement. The Even Start program requires states to develop quality indicators to monitor and improve programs, with funding declining over the years. Funding for the program has fluctuated, with a significant decrease in FY2006 and likely to continue in FY2007. The Even Start program has seen growth over the years, with 855 programs serving 32,000 families in 2000-2001. Data shows that families with children under age 5 are targeted, with parents having low levels of education and income. In 2000-2001, 84% of Even Start program families had income below the federal poverty level, with only 23% of parents employed. 46% of participants were Hispanic, 30% white, 19% African American, and 7% Asian, Native American, Hawaiian, or Multi-Racial. 45% of new enrollees speak English as a second language. Top reasons for enrolling include improving educational status, parenting skills, teaching abilities, and children's school success. Even Start programs coordinate services from other agencies. Even Start programs coordinate and integrate services from other agencies, focusing on early childhood education and parenting skills. Additional support services include child care, meals, transportation, and social services. The average federal budget for Even Start programs in 2000-2001 was $175,439, with an average expenditure of $4,708 per participating family. Participation rates in core services were high, with 82% of families engaging in all activities. In 2000-2001, Even Start programs faced challenges in maintaining service intensity and participation rates. About half of families left the program within 10 months, with 17% leaving after completing their education goals. Reasons for leaving included job conflicts, relocation, and motivational issues. Research shows that children benefit from intensive high-quality services, leading to higher literacy scores. Families are more likely to participate when more intensive services are offered. Even Start projects have increased early childhood and adult education services, but most parents don't use all available hours. Children receive varying percentages of service hours based on age. The 2000-2001 national evaluation used an experimental design study and ESPIRS data. Families in the EDS were randomly assigned, but the projects were not randomly selected. The national evaluation of Even Start projects found that Even Start children and their parents did not perform better than the control group. Both groups showed gains in literacy and other measures, with no significant difference between them. The national evaluation of Even Start projects found that Even Start children and their parents did not perform better than the control group. The only area where Even Start children did better was in teacher reports of behavior problems for elementary school aged children. The program was moved to the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 with a change allowing states to use funds for state-level activities to improve family literacy services. The Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for FY2001, renamed ESEA Title I, Part B as the William F. Goodling Even Start Family Literacy Programs. It was reauthorized for five years with an initial authorization of $250 million for FY2001. The reauthorization language closely resembled the Literacy Involves Families Together Act, H.R. 3222 (Goodling). However, certain provisions from H.R. 3222, such as treating religious organizations equally in subgrant awards, were not included. Additionally, the Inexpensive Book Distribution Program was not transferred to the Even Start program, and state grants for administration and technical assistance were increased from 5% to 6%. The Literacy Involves Families Together Act, H.R. 3222, proposed authorizing $250 million in funding for Even Start for FY2001. It aimed to rename the program as \"The William F. Goodling Even Start Family Literacy Programs\" and required more stringent qualifications for staff. Additionally, it allowed Even Start programs to serve children aged 8 or older in collaboration with ESEA Title I, Part A programs. State grants for administration were increased from 5% to 6%. The proposed changes to the Even Start program included authorizing states to use a share of their grants to improve services provided by low-quality grantees, requiring the use of scientifically based reading programs for children and adults, adding indicators of need such as domestic violence victims, and reserving funds for technical assistance and program evaluation. The proposed changes to the Even Start program include increasing funds reserved for specific groups, setting minimum subgrant amounts, providing coordination grants, and requiring program evaluation for improvement. The proposed changes to the Even Start program include increasing funds reserved for specific groups, setting minimum subgrant amounts, providing coordination grants, and requiring program evaluation for improvement. The current year's appropriation for Even Start exceeds the previous year's, with an allocation of \"the lesser of $2 million or 50% of the increase in total Even Start appropriations each year\" for scientifically based reading research on adult literacy and parental support. The Inexpensive Book Distribution Program is moved to Title II with an authorization of $20 million, and religious organizations are now included as eligible entities for subgrants, with restrictions on sectarian activities. The Educational Opportunities Act, S. 2 (Jeffords), introduced in the Senate, would have authorized $500 million for Even Start for FY2001. It aimed to amend Even Start to allow programs to serve children aged 8 or older in collaboration with ESEA Title I, Part A programs, improve the quality of services, and require instructional methods based on scientifically based reading research. The Even Start program under the Educational Opportunities Act aims to improve services by requiring scientifically based reading research methods for children and adults, allocating funds for technical assistance and evaluation, increasing funds for migrants and Indians, ensuring program completion for families, and mandating state plans for program quality and coordination of resources."
