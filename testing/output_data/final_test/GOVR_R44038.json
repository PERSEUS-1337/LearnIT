    "content": "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is an agency under the Department of Homeland Security that handles immigration and naturalization petitions, refugee and asylum claims, and other related services. USCIS relies on user fees for over 95% of its budget, authorized by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. Congress established the Immigration Examinations Fee Account in 1988, allowing USCIS to collect fees without annual congressional approval. This budget structure has drawn attention due to President Obama's recent executive action on immigration. The executive action on immigration expands deferred action provisions, potentially affecting up to 5 million unauthorized aliens. USCIS would process new deferred action petitions funded by user fees. Congress cannot use the appropriations process to stop the programs, requiring legislation to alter fee collection provisions. The report discusses issues that may merit congressional attention regarding USCIS, such as handling application surges, petition fees, and IT modernization. It provides an overview of USCIS functions, budget structure, fee accounts, and fee calculation for immigration services and benefits. USCIS, established in 2002, handles immigration services globally with over 200 offices and 19,000 employees. It processes petitions, naturalization, refugee claims, and provides various immigration-related services. USCIS provides a range of immigration services, including employment authorizations and change-of-status petitions. The agency processes about 6 million petitions annually, determining eligibility for permanent and temporary status for immediate relatives, employees needed by U.S. businesses, and other foreign nationals meeting specific criteria. Humanitarian functions are generally fee-exempt. USCIS provides immigration services for individuals in the United States on temporary visas, including work authorizations and status adjustments. The agency also oversees the E-Verify program for employment verification and conducts background checks for refugee and immigrant applications. USCIS is responsible for confirming applicant eligibility and detecting fraud for national security purposes. USCIS established the Office of Fraud Detection and National Security in 2003 to handle national security concerns and identify fraud in the immigration application process. Additionally, USCIS promotes civic integration by providing immigrants with information and tools for successful integration into American civic culture. USCIS promotes civic integration by managing the Immigrant Integration Grants Program and maintaining a Citizenship Resource Center website. Adjudicators determine eligibility for naturalization based on residency, moral character, English proficiency, and knowledge of U.S. civics and history. USCIS projects workload volume and user fees to plan for fluctuating application numbers. USCIS projects application workload volume and user fees based on modeling techniques and filing trends. Factors like immigration policy, economy, and international events influence decisions of potential immigrants. USCIS is criticized for processing petitions in a paper-based form, leading to complaints of lost files. Efforts to modernize systems and processes have been ongoing since 2008. The USCIS Transformation project aims to transition from a paper-based system to a digital format, funded mainly by fees. USCIS also receives appropriations for its budget. USCIS receives direct appropriations through the annual DHS process, with recent funding exclusively for E-Verify and immigrant integration grants. Direct appropriations constituted less than 4% of USCIS's budget in FY2014. USCIS funds its operations through user fees deposited into the IEFA, not subject to annual congressional approval, as mandated by the INA to recover full costs of providing services. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) allows for user fees to cover costs associated with immigration services, separate from annual appropriations. In 1998, the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act (ACWIA) increased temporary skilled H-1B workers to provide training for American workers. The H-1B Nonimmigrant Petitioner Fee Account was established by the H-1B Visa Reform Act of 2004 to fund training and education programs for U.S. workers. The fee is $1,500 ($750 for smaller employers) and USCIS receives 5% of the fees. Congress also established the Fraud Prevention and Detection Account with a $500 \"Fraud Fee\" for fraud detection activities. The Fraud Prevention and Detection Fee of $500 is required for petitions seeking H-1B, H-2B, or L visa classification. USCIS receives 33% of these fees, totaling $41 million in FY2014. USCIS maintains a cash reserve balance of $1.3 billion, aiming to keep at least $600 million annually for fiscal protection. USCIS aims to maintain a cash reserve balance of $600 million annually for fiscal protection. The agency can adjust fees to cover the costs of providing services, which are mainly funded by user fees. Setting fee levels can be politically contentious, requiring regular cost assessments and accurate fee calculations for each petition type. The USCIS derives most of its operating budget from user fees and has faced scrutiny for weak cost assessments and long processing waiting periods. The Government Accountability Office has investigated the correspondence between USCIS fee schedule and processing costs, leading to fee adjustments in FY2004, FY2007, and FY2010 based on cost reviews. The timing of assessments can impact fee increases and USCIS workloads. The Government Accountability Office recommended more frequent fee reviews for USCIS to avoid large fee increases. The FY2010 fee review saw a 10% increase compared to an 88% increase in FY2007. USCIS faced a backlog of 1.5 million petitions after the FY2007 fee increase. USCIS was conducting a fee review for FY2016-FY2017 to adjust its fee structure. The President's executive action in 2014 highlighted challenges for Congress in controlling USCIS's budget funded by user fees. Some may appreciate USCIS's reduced reliance on appropriations for funding, while others are concerned about the limits it places on congressional oversight. Greater dependence on appropriations could increase congressional oversight and provide a check on the executive branch. USCIS not having to request budgetary resources from Congress each year may lead to less incentive to provide efficient customer service. To change existing statutory provisions regarding fees in the Immigration Examinations Fee Account would require new legislation subject to constitutional requirements. The debate over funding USCIS through user fees has divided advocates into agency cost and service cost advocates. Service cost advocates urge Congress to prevent fee increases during USCIS considerations. Cost advocates have called on Congress to prevent fee increases at times when USCIS was considering fee structure revisions. They argue that fees should only cover direct service costs and request direct appropriations to offset agency costs. Service cost advocates believe that more oversight by Congress of appropriated funds would protect the interests of immigration services applicants and provide transparency. They warn that escalating costs could lead to prohibitive fees for some applicants. Agency cost advocates argue that USCIS fees reflect the full cost of delivering immigration services and provide valuable benefits, including fraud prevention. The debate over who pays for immigration services received by fee-exempt beneficiaries reflects differing perspectives on subsidizing agency costs and fee levels. Policy decisions to exempt certain groups from fees can impact fee structures and necessitate cost recovery from other applications. Fee levels for immigration services can be influenced by various policy considerations outlined by GAO in a 2010 review of USCIS fees. In a 2010 review of USCIS fees, GAO identified four key policy considerations for setting fee levels: equity, efficiency, revenue adequacy, and administrative burden. These considerations can conflict with each other, such as USCIS not collecting fees from asylees and refugees for humanitarian reasons. USCIS aims for equity in fee levels but faces challenges when adjusting fees for naturalization petitions. Immigrant advocates are concerned about fee increases for immigration services, arguing that higher fees create hardships for applicants and may discourage naturalization. They also worry that increased fees could make wealth a determining factor in immigration policy and lead to more unauthorized work arrangements. Applicants can request fee waivers if they demonstrate financial hardship. Under current regulations, applicants may receive a fee waiver if they demonstrate an inability to pay. About 1% of applicants apply for fee waivers. Some argue that fees in the United States, like those for naturalization, are much higher than in other advanced economies. Advocates of agency costs argue that concerns about financial hardship should not determine USCIS fee schedules. They believe immigrants should pay the full cost incurred by the U.S. government for their immigration services, including overhead, personnel support, background checks, and fraud reduction. USCIS customers object to fee structure supporting agency costs, citing challenges in navigating immigration laws. USCIS previously relied on paper-based processes but has since modernized to improve efficiency. USCIS initiated a transformation to modernize its operations by transitioning to electronic processing through ELIS. This system allows individuals to apply online for certain visa types, streamlining the adjudication process. However, ELIS still needs to expand its features before USCIS can fully transition to an electronic platform. Congress has urged USCIS to improve processing times and eliminate backlogs. Between FY2002 and FY2010, Congress allocated $574 million to reduce backlogs at USCIS. Critics question the effectiveness of backlog reduction efforts due to changes in how USCIS defines backlogs and its reliance on other agencies for background checks. Future immigration reforms may strain USCIS's ability to process increased application volumes in a timely manner. Previous immigration reform efforts led to a surge in applications and adjudication costs at USCIS. Concerns persist about the agency's capacity to handle workload spikes from policy changes or major events. The agency believes it can scale up quickly, citing experience from the DACA program as a precedent for managing increased volumes. The USCIS faced challenges in handling increased workloads from past immigration reform efforts, such as the IRCA in 1986. Processing backlogs from surges in petition volume have impacted processing times and resources within the agency. Some argue that these backlogs may affect processing times for other petitions as resources are reconfigured to address urgent needs. The USCIS is facing challenges in handling increased workloads from past immigration reform efforts. Critics argue that resources are being diverted from processing petitions for legal immigrants to handle DACA and other petitions for unauthorized aliens. The agency plans to hire over 1,000 personnel to address the workload, with costs covered by DACA petition fees. It remains to be seen if the new personnel and procedures will be sufficient to handle the volume of petitions. The USCIS relies on user fees to fund its operations, reducing the fiscal burden on taxpayers. However, this funding model may limit Congress's oversight over how the agency spends its fees, as seen with the new deferred action program introduced in 2014. Some Members of Congress oppose a program that could lead to a sudden surge in USCIS adjudication services, impacting the agency's workload. USCIS has experience handling increased petition volume but may face processing backlogs and delays due to limited resources and a paper-based system. Concerns persist over fee levels and other perennial issues related to USCIS. The current naturalization petition fee is seen as a barrier to individuals seeking U.S. citizenship. Immigrant advocacy groups believe that lowering fees would increase naturalization rates, but USCIS has no plans to adjust fees. The history of USCIS fee funding dates back to the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. Following the 1968 legislation, the INS adjusted immigration fees periodically. During the Reagan Administration, there were efforts to make INS functions fee-reliant, especially after the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. The agency believed it was required to recover all costs for services provided, leading to fee increases for certain deportation-related motions. The 1987 amendment added fees for the legalization program under IRCA. In 1988, Congress mandated the creation of the Immigration Exam Fee Account (IEFA) to isolate funding for legalization fees and allow INS to retain a portion of those fees. The IEFA was amended in 1990, giving INS the authority to retain and expend all adjudication fees collected to recover costs associated with providing immigration services. Following the Immigration Act of 1990, the INS faced a surge in applications and petitions for immigration services, exacerbated by 3 million individuals becoming eligible for naturalization in 1995. A GAO report highlighted financial mismanagement within the INS, leading to centralization efforts and a new fee schedule in 1991 to address application backlogs. Despite increased fee funding, the agency struggled with processing times and leadership issues by 1993. Observers expressed concerns that increased fees in 1991 did not improve INS performance. Criticism continued from 1993 to 2001 for not meeting service objectives despite increased funding. There were allegations of funds being used for enforcement rather than adjudication services. Calls were made to separate service and enforcement functions of the INS. Following the 9/11 attacks, Congress decided to separate INS's enforcement and adjudication functions. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 dissolved INS and established USCIS under DHS, relying mainly on fees for funding. USCIS is largely funded by fees, with appropriations mainly for temporary projects."
