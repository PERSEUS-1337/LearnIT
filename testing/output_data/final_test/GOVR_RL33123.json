    "content": "It is challenging to differentiate between cyber attacks by terrorists seeking to cause harm and cyber criminals aiming to steal information for financial gain. Terrorists exploit vulnerabilities in targets for future attacks, while cyber criminals target the same vulnerabilities for monetary gain. Strengthening domestic physical security policies has reduced the risk to previously vulnerable targets. Experts suggest terrorists may be improving their computer skills or collaborating with cybercriminals with advanced telecommunications expertise. Increased awareness of Internet security vulnerabilities may attract terrorists to cyber activities. Publicity on Internet security vulnerabilities may prompt terrorists to consider cyberattacks on U.S. critical infrastructure. The FBI notes terrorists' growing technical capabilities for network-based attacks and predicts they may hire hackers for larger conventional attacks. FBI Director Mueller expressed concern over terrorists' use of the internet for communication, planning, recruitment, and financial support. Cybercrime is a growing concern, with criminal-driven computer security attacks increasing by 50 percent in the first half of 2005. Government agencies and industries in the United States are targeted most frequently. Extremists have used identity theft and credit card fraud to support terrorist activities, and online credit card fraud may have financed the 2002 Bali bombings. The report explores vulnerabilities that could raise interest in cyberattacks on U.S. critical infrastructure. Distinctions between crime, terrorism, and war blur in describing cyberattacks. If a nation state sponsors non-state actors for cyberattacks supporting terrorism or causing economic disruption, the line between cybercrime and cyberwar becomes unclear. It's hard to trace the origin of cyberattacks, leading to suspicion towards innocent parties. Terrorists and criminals using technology may collaborate, complicating the situation further. The distinction between cybercrime and cyberterrorism can blur, especially when terrorists and criminals collaborate using computer technology. It is challenging to determine the source of sophisticated cyber attacks on the Internet, leading to debates on focusing on the act rather than the perpetrator. The Internet is utilized as a recruitment tool for insurgents in Iraq, with Arabic-language websites allegedly containing plans for new attacks. Some Arabic-language websites allegedly contain coded plans for new attacks, offering advice on building weapons and evading border checkpoints. A younger generation of terrorists are acquiring technical skills to avoid detection by law enforcement technology. There is debate on whether cyberterrorism can cause terror like traditional weapons, with some arguing that economic disruption and civilian deaths could qualify as terrorism. The definition of cyberterrorism varies, with some focusing on the effects of computer attacks. Cyberterrorism is defined by effects-based and intent-based criteria, involving disruptive computer attacks that generate fear or are politically motivated to intimidate or cause harm. The Internet is the medium for cyberattacks, which target critical infrastructure and require the network to remain intact for success. A cyberattack on U.S. critical infrastructure, timed with a physical or CBRN terrorist attack, aims to disrupt integrity, availability, confidentiality, and cause physical harm. Richard Clarke warns that a widespread cyberattack could target the economy. A cyberattack on the United States could target the economy, with death and destruction as collateral damage. Security experts suggest combining cyberattacks with conventional bombings for maximum impact. However, a widespread cyberattack without a physical attack may be difficult to orchestrate and less effective for terrorists. There is no evidence of significant cyberattacks by terrorist groups, but interdependencies among infrastructure sectors could amplify the impact of a large-scale cyberattack. A large-scale cyberattack on one infrastructure sector could have devastating effects on other sectors and the economy. Al Qaeda and terrorist groups are becoming more technically sophisticated and aware of U.S. cyber vulnerabilities. Publicity is a primary objective for terrorist attacks, and the potential harm of a cyberattack on the U.S. has been extensively covered. Terrorists may see a cyberattack as a way to gain significant publicity. At the July 2005 Black Hat computer security conference in Las Vegas, a security expert demonstrated a significant Internet security flaw in commonly used Internet routers, which could be exploited to disrupt parts of the Internet or target specific banks or power stations. Bruce Schneier, a critic of cyberterrorism, acknowledged the router flaw as a major vulnerability. The router flaw was identified as a major Internet security vulnerability that could be exploited by criminals to steal identity information or attack networks. Despite releasing a software patch in April 2005, the company failed to notify customers and government agencies about the seriousness of the issue. The United States is vulnerable to cyberattacks, as highlighted in a February 2005 report by the President's Information Technology Committee (PITAC), which emphasized the importance of deploying sound security products to protect national security. A recent survey of 136,000 PCs in 251 commercial businesses in North America found that only nine percent had installed a major security software patch, SP2, despite Microsoft's one-year-old recommendation. The remaining 91 percent are at risk of security threats until they deploy the patch. Studies show that critical infrastructures like government, financial services, manufacturing, and power are the main targets of computer attacks. The United States is highly targeted for computer attacks, with federal agencies criticized for their cybersecurity programs. A report by the Government Accountability Office highlighted limitations in responding to cyber threats due to the sophistication of malicious code. Various federal departments have established programs to address cybersecurity. Some argue that the federal government's efforts in cyber-security demonstrate its recognition of the issue as a national priority. However, concerns exist about the duplication of organizations and programs, the lack of a coherent strategy, and delays in cyber security efforts. Experts worry that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not progressed enough to meet the growing cyber threats posed by terrorists. Difficulty in identifying the origins and intentions behind cyber attacks is also cited as a challenge for DHS and the federal government. In February 2006, DHS participated in exercise Cyber Storm to test the ability to respond to cyber attacks. The exercise produced eight major findings to enhance the nation's cyber preparedness. Some observers saw this as an acknowledgment of the work not accomplished since DHS's establishment. DOD Directive 3020.40 in August 2005 assigned responsibility for coordinating with public and private sectors for defense critical infrastructure protection. The DOD is responsible for coordinating with public and private sectors to protect defense critical infrastructures from terrorist attacks, including cyberattacks. They have established the Joint Functional Component Command for Network Warfare (JFCCNW) to defend DOD computer systems. The FBI provides support for investigating computer intrusions, with programs for counterterrorism investigations and international cooperation. The NSA has established National Centers of Academic Excellence in Information. The NSA's National Centers of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education (CAEIAE) Program promotes higher education in information assurance to reduce vulnerability of national information infrastructure. Four-year colleges and universities can apply to be designated as a CAEIAE, allowing students to access scholarships and grants for IA expertise. The CIA Information Operations Center conducted a cybersecurity exercise in 2005 called \"Silent Horizon\" to evaluate threats to U.S. computer systems. The exercise aimed to examine who would deal with a major cyberwar attack, highlighting the role of civilian telecommunications firms in cyber defense. The simulated attacks were set in the future, with the premise of cyberspace facing devastation similar to the 9/11 attacks. Previous exercises raised questions about the government's role during cyberattacks depending on the culprit. The U.S. government is taking steps to improve cybersecurity by creating task forces and divisions to coordinate cybersecurity functions and reduce vulnerabilities in computing networks. Security vendors emphasize the need to treat cybercrime as a global problem. Some security vendors have developed advance-warning systems for customers by linking security equipment into global networks to share information. An example is a global network of 19,000 firewall and intrusion-detection devices that detect potential cyber attacks and notify administrators for defense. Another partnership program, the Cyber Incident Detection Data Analysis Center (CIDDAC), installs sensors on partner networks to automatically detect threats. Following the September 11 attacks, concerns arose about possible cyberattacks from terrorist groups. Security experts debated whether such attacks could target U.S. critical infrastructure or disrupt the economy. Simulated cyberattacks in 2002 suggested that attempts to cripple the U.S. telecommunications infrastructure would fail due to system redundancy. Observers believe that critical infrastructure systems, such as banking and power, would likely recover from such attacks. To date, there have been no reports of a coordinated cyberattack on critical infrastructure by terrorists. A CIA war game in 2005, called \"Silent Horizon,\" simulated a widespread cyberattack on the United States. While some experts believe the likelihood of far-reaching effects from a cyberattack is low, others argue that testing countermeasures is prudent. Many cyber security observers are concerned about the U.S. government's lack of preparation for a catastrophic cyberattack. A report identified three \"cyber-gaps\" hindering readiness: lack of attack indicators, unclear responsibility for infrastructure restoration, and insufficient resources for cyber operations post-attack. The internet is predicted to play a larger role in terrorist activities due to increased physical security and government tracking efforts. Many observers believe that Islamic extremists are turning to the Internet for organizing due to intensified counterterrorism efforts worldwide. Terrorist groups use online services for covert messaging through steganography, anonymous e-mail accounts, and encryption. Some argue that the lack of consistent reporting on cyber-security threats is a result of the government's lack of strategy and unclear assignments among departments. The delay in progress is attributed to the recent establishment of governmental organizations, with predictions that as DHS and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence mature, cyber-security assessments will improve. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence is expected to prioritize cyber-security assessments as it matures. Two annual U.S. government reports on terrorism show inconsistent attention to cyberterrorism issues. The Department of State's reports briefly mention cyberterrorism from 1996 to 2000, highlighting the likelihood of terrorists using hacking software. However, there is no mention of cyberterrorism in the 2001 report, and only sporadic references in the following years. The DOS report from 2002 to 2004 mentioned security forums and cybersecurity working groups. The FBI's Annual Terrorism Report had inconsistent mentions of cyberterrorism issues, with no mention in the 1996 and 1997 reports. In 1998, it acknowledged the potential for cyber tools in the hands of terrorists. The 1999 report highlighted the growing threat of cyberterrorism in the new Millennium. Reports from 2000 to 2003 also mentioned cyberterrorism. Since 2000, the FBI reports have addressed cyberterrorism programmatic aspects, but not specific incidents or projections. Concerns have been raised post-9/11 about the decrease in cybersecurity discussions, indicating a potential lack of preparedness for cyberterrorism threats. Al Qaeda members are noted for their education and familiarity with cyberattacks. Al Qaeda members are well-educated and have technical expertise, including in engineering. Documents left behind in Kabul in 2001 revealed their proficiency in computer systems. Terrorists use the Internet for communication and have created numerous websites for psychological operations and funding. Recently, extremist groups have utilized thousands of Internet websites for psychological operations, recruitment, and coordination. Concerns have been raised about lone operatives using web sites hosted in the United States to plan attacks. Al-Qaeda has shown increased technical sophistication, even producing a manual on using Google for global jihad. British forces in Iraq found Google-Earth pictures for targeting coalition forces. Extremist groups utilize internet websites for operations, recruitment, and coordination. Terrorist websites use advanced multimedia technologies and communication tools more than US government sites. CIA warns of cyberwarfare attacks on US infrastructure by terrorists. The CIA warns of terrorist groups becoming more adept at using technology for cyberattacks, with Al Qaeda and Hizballah potentially developing the skills necessary. FBI director Robert Mueller testified about terrorists understanding the importance of information technology in the US economy and recruiting individuals with math, computer science, and engineering backgrounds. Al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups are reportedly building an online library of training materials with modern technology equipment and support from experts. Experts in online forums provide information on various terrorist activities, including mixing poisons, ambushing soldiers, coordinating suicide bomb attacks, and hacking computers. One popular forum, Qalah, offers links to the latest hacking techniques for potential al Qaeda recruits. Some security experts believe monitoring known terrorist websites is more effective than disrupting them, as terrorists can quickly reestablish sites under different names. Intelligence sources can gather valuable information by monitoring these websites and the Internet addresses of frequent visitors. Islamic extremists are calling for creation of an Islamist hackers' army to plan cyberattacks against the U.S. government. Extremist websites resemble online training camps offering instructions on various terrorist activities. Iman Samudra, convicted for the 2002 Bali bombings, has written a book on terrorism. Iman Samudra, convicted for the 2002 Bali bombings, has written a book titled \"Aku Mekawan Terroris!\" advocating for Muslim youth to develop hacking skills to attack U.S. computer networks and fund the struggle against the United States and its allies using stolen credit card numbers. The Department of Homeland Security report in March 2005 indicated that five of the six nations listed as terrorist sponsors are a diminishing concern for terrorism, with only Iran remaining on the list. Iran is the only nation-state listed as a potential sponsor of terrorism, with other countries like Libya and Cuba being described as diminishing concerns. Experts suggest that a decrease in state-sponsorship may lead terrorist groups to turn to activities like drug trafficking or cybercrime. China is known for supporting hackers, with military officials discussing the use of information warfare to target financial markets and infrastructure. Hackers, believed to be based in China, have been acknowledged by DOD officials. Since 2001, hackers from China have successfully infiltrated U.S. military networks, obtaining data on a future Army command system. There is debate among DOD and security officials on whether these cyberattacks are coordinated by the Chinese government, carried out by independent hackers, or orchestrated by a third-party using Chinese servers to mask their identity. The true identity and purpose of the cyber attackers remain difficult to determine, with attacks increasingly focused on stealthily stealing information. Cyberattacks are evolving to silently steal information without causing noticeable damage. Attackers target home user desktops and web applications to steal confidential data like passwords. They use \"bot networks\" to disrupt Internet service. Symantec and Cyber Security Industry Alliance studies show a rise in targeted attacks on home users, leading to concerns about financial and personal information security. Cybercrime poses a risk to information security, with identity theft facilitated by computer technology advancements and poor security practices. Instances of data breaches, such as the theft of personal information from NNSA employees in 2006, highlight the vulnerability of systems to cyberattacks. The \"Titan Rain\" attacks in 2003, suspected to originate from China, targeted DOD systems and contractors, remaining undetected for months. In 2006, cyberattacks targeted the U.S. Naval War College and other military installations, leading to sensitive information being copied. The Global Information Grid faces millions of daily scans by potential intruders, with suspicions that many originate from the United States and China. Security experts warn of the need for heightened awareness in cyberspace for all U.S. federal agencies. Experts warn that U.S. federal agencies need to be aware of the blurred boundaries between military and civilian targets in cyberspace. An IBM report from August 2005 revealed over 237 million security attacks globally in the first half of the year, with government agencies being the primary target at 54 million attacks. The United States, New Zealand, and China were the most targeted countries, with government agencies and industries in the U.S. facing 12 million attacks. Cyberattacks are difficult to detect and often involve compromised computers from around the world. New types of attacks may encounter inadequate defenses, as most security measures focus on known threats. A 2004 survey found that hacking had become a profitable criminal pursuit, with hackers selling unknown computer vulnerabilities. Hackers sell zero-day exploits on the black market to criminals for fraud. Bot nets are rented for coordinated attacks on individuals or businesses, including financial institutions. Stolen credit card numbers and bank account information are traded online. Each stolen MasterCard number can be sold for $42 to $72. In 2005, over 40 million U.S. credit card numbers were accessed by hackers, leading to potential fraud. Some numbers were sold on a Russian website, with reports of fraudulent charges. UFJ bank in Japan also faced fraud issues related to stolen MasterCard information. In 2004, cybercriminals targeted Sumitomo bank in London, attempting to steal \u00a3220 million. This incident nearly succeeded, making it a significant cyber attack on a major bank. In 2003, a major bank faced a cyber attack by external hackers, with 83% of U.K. companies targeted by hackers. Insider employees with access to sensitive information systems can initiate threats through malicious code. For example, in January 2003, 20 employees of subcontractors at Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation were arrested for using false identification to obtain security access. Several individuals were arrested for possession of false identification used to access facilities with restricted military technology. The connection between cybercrime and terrorism is complex, with criminal groups potentially aiding terror networks in carrying out large-scale attacks by providing money and resources. Examples include a criminal suspect in Dubai using ransom money for the 9/11 attacks and terrorists obtaining explosives from an Eastern European black market for the 2005 bombings. The recent subway and bus bombings in the U.K. suggest the presence of terrorist groups in countries with advanced technology infrastructure. Potential sponsors of terrorist attacks against the U.S. homeland include groups like Jamaat ul-Fuqura and Jamaat al Tabligh. The U.S. DEA reported that many foreign terrorist organizations are involved in drug trafficking, linking the war on drugs with the war on terrorism. The war on drugs and terrorism are linked, with evidence of terrorist groups involved in drug trafficking. Some groups use drug trafficking for financing and weakening enemies. Western Europe and North America are major narcotics markets for criminal and terrorist groups. Drug traffickers use computer messaging and encryption extensively. Traffickers use encryption and steganography to make Internet messages hard to decipher. They hire high-level computer specialists, often from former Soviet Union and Indian subcontinent, to operate internationally without detection. Some specialists may be unaware of their employers' political objectives. Terrorist groups are involved in counterfeiting intellectual property. The involvement of terrorist groups in counterfeiting intellectual property is a growing concern, as it can be more profitable than drug trafficking. Criminals and terrorists collaborate to move money internationally, with terrorists receiving special training in computer software or engineering to aid in communication through the Internet. Financial specialists and advisors may knowingly or unknowingly assist cybercriminals in evading bank regulators and international investigators. This includes accountants, bank employees in offshore zones, and individuals in major financial centers who may support the political motives of their clients. Cybercrime remains a significant international challenge, with varying attitudes towards what constitutes criminal computer activity across different countries. The European Union has established the Critical Information Infrastructure Research Coordination Office (CI2RCO) to assess member states' protection of critical infrastructures from cyberattacks. The Convention on Cybercrime, adopted in 2001 by the Council of Europe, requires countries to update their laws against hacking, fraud, and other cybercrimes. The United States has signed the Convention on Cybercrime but did not sign a complementary protocol criminalizing xenophobia and racism online, citing concerns about freedom of expression. The Department of Justice stated that it would be unconstitutional to sign the protocol due to the First Amendment. The Electronic Privacy Information Center objected to U.S. ratification of the Convention on Cybercrime due to privacy concerns. However, a coalition of U.S. industry associations urged ratification. The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved the Convention on July 26, 2005. The United States will comply with the Convention based on existing federal law. Legal analysts say U.S. will comply with the Convention on Cybercrime without new legislation. Computer security experts debate terrorist cyberattack likelihood. Vulnerabilities in internet and computer systems persist, making them susceptible to increasingly sophisticated cyberattack tools. Terrorists may be forming alliances with cybercriminals for access. Terrorists may be forming alliances with cybercriminals to gain high-level computer skills, potentially leading to cyberattacks. The U.S. could face small cyber intrusion events before a larger devastating attack. National security experts suggest the Director of National Intelligence monitor potential cyber threats. The Director of National Intelligence has the ability to coordinate cyber-threat information and task the intelligence community to understand potential threats. DHS has created a new position for Cyber and Telecommunications Security to strengthen computer security for federal agencies and the private sector. The DHS is working on addressing IT vulnerabilities, incident response, and remediation efforts. They are also supporting the transition to IPV6. However, they lack an Internet recovery plan and a national cybersecurity threat assessment. A finalized cybersecurity plan is not expected until 2006. Leaders have expressed concerns about DHS's ability to detect coordinated cyber attacks. Many experts are concerned about the lack of a robust way for DHS to detect coordinated cyber attacks on critical infrastructure. Security vulnerabilities in the Internet and critical infrastructure systems are widely publicized. There are concerns that private sector cyber security firms do not promptly notify DHS or their customers of serious vulnerabilities, which could lead to potential disruptions. Should vendors and service providers be required to report newly discovered vulnerabilities to DHS? Some actions are underway for Congress to consider regarding cybersecurity. An interim rule issued in 2005 outlines new steps for IT security in federal purchases. Government contracting officers must include additional cybersecurity rules in acquisition planning to improve computer security for products and services supplied to the government. Experts believe terrorists collaborate with organized crime networks for international smuggling. Criminal drug traffickers can provide terrorists with access to computer systems. The pro's and con's of linking counterterrorism efforts with agencies that counter drug trafficking and international efforts to prevent cybercrime are being discussed. Security experts suggest closer collaboration between DOD and DHS for new technologies to strengthen civilian computer security. Trends show a potential increase in cybercrime activities. Trends for cybercrime suggest a rise in attacks in terms of number, speed, and sophistication. The possibility of future unknown vulnerabilities and advanced attacks raising concerns about the ability of civilian agencies to respond effectively. New approaches like quantum cryptography could enhance computer security but may also introduce new threats. Commercial products with unbreakable cryptography could hinder law enforcement's ability to combat threats from terrorists, organized crime, and foreign intelligence agents. H.R. 1, \"Implementing the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act of 2007,\" aims to improve national computer security by prioritizing grants based on reducing cyber threats. The evaluation is based on risk assessments by intelligence and infrastructure protection offices to counter terrorism."
