    "content": "The Act titled \"Directed Energy Coordination and Consolidation Act of 2000\" aims to coordinate and facilitate the development of directed energy technologies, systems, and weapons. Congress finds that directed energy systems can address military challenges, maintain technological superiority, and support priority acquisition programs. Funding for directed energy science and technology programs should align with large-scale demonstration programs for future growth. The industrial base for critical directed energy technologies lacks incentives for large-scale investments needed to meet Department of Defense requirements. It is crucial for the Department of Defense to utilize and expand upon directed energy research from various sources to address recruitment and retention challenges for skilled personnel. The High Energy Laser Master Plan of the Department of Defense aims to recruit and retain personnel with critical skills for directed energy technology development. Implementation of the plan's recommendations will facilitate the development of revolutionary capabilities in directed energy weapons through a new management structure featuring a joint technology office with senior-level oversight. The Department of Defense's High Energy Laser Master Plan includes the establishment of a Joint Technology Office at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico, under the authority of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Science and Technology. The Office will be led by a civilian Director and provided with necessary resources for its duties. The Office established at Kirtland Air Force Base will oversee a Department of Defense-wide program on directed energy technologies, coordinate initiatives, and manage the National Directed Energy Technology Alliance for collaboration among various entities. The Office at Kirtland Air Force Base oversees a Department of Defense program on directed energy technologies, coordinates initiatives, and manages the National Directed Energy Technology Alliance for collaboration among entities. It also carries out activities related to directed energy technologies as deemed appropriate by the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Science and Technology. Coordination within the Department of Defense involves assigning liaison functions and forming Technology Area Working Groups. Additionally, a Technology Council is established. The Technology Council, established in the Department of Defense, consists of 7 members including senior science and technology executives from the Army, Navy, Air Force, DARPA, and BMDO, with the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Science and Technology as the chairperson. The Technology Council in the Department of Defense consists of 7 members, including senior science and technology executives from various branches, with the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Science and Technology as the chairperson. The Technology Board of Directors, established in the Department of Defense, is composed of 8 members and is responsible for reviewing and recommending priorities among programs, projects, and activities proposed by the Office. The Technology Board in the Department of Defense consists of 8 members, including senior acquisition executives from the Army, Navy, Air Force, and other agencies. The Board's duties include reviewing and making funding recommendations for proposed programs, projects, and activities. The Technology Board in the Department of Defense, consisting of 8 members including senior acquisition executives, reviews and oversees proposed programs, projects, and activities. The Office under this section is responsible for evaluating and implementing these activities. The Secretary of Defense will establish the Joint Technology Office at the National Directed Energy Center in Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico by January 1, 2001. The High Energy Laser Master Plan will be implemented, including technology area working groups for solid state lasers within the Department of the Army. The Secretary of Defense will establish technology area working groups on solid state lasers, advanced technology, free electron lasers, chemical lasers, beam control, lethality/vulnerability, and high power microwaves within the Department of Defense to enhance the industrial base. Initiatives aim to enhance industrial base for directed energy technologies and systems by stimulating development in higher education and private sector. $20,000,000 allocated for Advanced Tactical Laser development. Secretary of Defense to modernize High Energy Laser Test Facility at White Sands Missile Range for enhanced testing capabilities. The Department of Defense aims to enhance test and evaluation capabilities for directed energy weapons at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. $2,000,000 allocated for testing free electron laser technologies developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Secretary of Defense to explore cooperative programs with other agencies, universities, and private sector for research and development. The Department of Defense aims to enhance programs related to directed energy technologies, systems, and weapons through cooperative programs with the Department of Energy's national laboratories. $50,000,000 allocated for these activities. Secretary of Defense to work with the Joint Technology Council for implementation. The Department of Defense is authorized to appropriate $150,000,000 for science and technology activities related to directed energy technologies, systems, and weapons for fiscal year 2001. The Director of the Joint Technology Office will allocate these funds among appropriate program elements of the Department of Defense. The Director will establish procedures for the competitive selection of programs, projects, and activities to receive funds for directed energy technologies, systems, and weapons. Directed energy includes technologies like high energy lasers and high power microwaves."
