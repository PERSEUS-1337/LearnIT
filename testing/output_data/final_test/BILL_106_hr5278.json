    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Energy Independence Through Presidential Leadership Act\" and focuses on Presidential leadership to enact comprehensive energy policy. The Congress finds that the United States increasingly depends on foreign nations for energy, making it vulnerable to national security threats. Lessening this dependence requires a comprehensive energy policy focused on increasing domestic energy production and refining capacity. The Congress emphasizes the need for a comprehensive energy policy to reduce dependence on foreign nations for energy. This policy includes environmental guidelines, diplomatic pressure on oil-producing countries, energy efficiency improvements, increased use of renewable energy sources, and tax reforms.
