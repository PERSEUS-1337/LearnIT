    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Consumer Products Safe Testing Act\". It includes findings and policy statements. The Congress finds that nonanimal acute toxicity tests have shown reliability for replacing animal tests, and many manufacturers have found them adequate for product safety evaluations. Federal departments and agencies are encouraged to promote alternative methods of testing that accurately reflect human health effects without relying on animals. This will benefit private industry and consumers by providing more humane and cost-effective testing procedures.

This will benefit private industry and consumers by providing more humane and cost-effective testing procedures. SEC. 3. FEDERAL ACTION. Federal departments and agencies are required to review regulations on animal acute toxicity tests like the Draize test, evaluate nonanimal alternatives, and establish guidelines for nonanimal acute toxicity tests. Federal departments and agencies must review regulations on animal acute toxicity tests and consider nonanimal alternatives, with the option to use nonanimal tests if they are deemed more effective in predicting human health effects. Corporate testing policies are not restricted by this Act, allowing companies to use their own testing protocols. If a Federal department or agency decides not to amend regulations requiring animal tests, they must justify their decision in the Federal Register. Federal departments and agencies are required to periodically review regulations on animal acute toxicity tests to determine if continued use is justified based on technological advances. If deemed necessary, an explanation must be published in the Federal Register. This Act excludes regulations, guidelines, or recommendations related to medical research. The Act defines \"animal\" as any vertebrate and \"animal acute toxicity test\" as a test on animals to determine acute toxicity. It also defines \"Federal department or agency head\" as the head of a department or agency with authority over safety testing procedures for products containing hazardous substances. Medical research refers to research related to causes, diagnosis, treatment, or control of physical or mental impairments in humans or animals, excluding product toxicity testing for regulatory compliance. Nonanimal acute toxicity tests are acute toxicity tests that do not involve animals. An acute toxicity test is a test that does not involve animals and can include cell culture, computer modeling, protein alteration, and chorioallantoic membrane techniques."
