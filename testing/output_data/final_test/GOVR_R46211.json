    "content": "The National Security Space Launch (NSSL) program, initiated in 1995 as the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) program, aimed to acquire cost-effective launch services for critical national security missions. The program faced challenges such as high launch costs, lack of competition among U.S. companies, and reliance on a Russian rocket engine (RD-180). The 2014 U.S. sanctions against Russia further exacerbated concerns over this reliance. The NSSL program, formerly known as EELV, was established in 1995 to ensure affordable and reliable access to space for national security missions. It aimed to address concerns over high costs, lack of competition, and reliance on Russian rocket engines. Legislative actions were prompted by cost increases and legal challenges in the program. The EELV program, now known as the NSSL program, provided critical space lift capability for DOD and intelligence community satellites. The Air Force approved an acquisition strategy in 2011 and revised it in 2013 to sustain two rocket-powered launch vehicle families, license the Russian-made RD-180 engine, commit to a block-buy of launches, and increase competition to reduce costs. The NSSL program, managed by the Launch Enterprise Systems Directorate, includes four launch vehicles: Atlas V, Delta IV Heavy, Falcon 9, and Falcon Heavy. These launches support the Air Force, Navy, and National Reconnaissance Office. The program has reduced launch costs and provided reliable access to space, but some argue it remains too costly and lacks competitiveness. The NSSL program includes launching various satellites into orbit, such as commercial and military communications satellites, lunar probes, earth observation satellites, and missile warning systems. The program is managed by the Launch Enterprise Systems Directorate and utilizes launch vehicles like Atlas V, Delta IV Heavy, Falcon 9, and Falcon Heavy. ULA, a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, operates the launch vehicles and space launch complexes. SpaceX and ULA have multiple launch complexes in Florida and California. SpaceX was certified by DOD to compete for NSS launches in 2015. Falcon 9 flew its first NSSL mission in 2018, delivering GPS III to orbit. SpaceX also has Falcon Heavy, certified in 2018, and awarded NSS missions. SpaceX has launch sites in Florida and California. Air Force awarded three Launch Service Agreements in 2018. The Air Force awarded three Launch Service Agreement (LSA) OTA agreements to space launch companies in 2018 to develop NSSL launch system prototypes. Two NSS launch service providers will be selected for launch service procurements starting in FY2020. The Air Force released an RFP for Phase 2 of the NSSL program in May 2019, with plans to award two LSP contracts in summer 2020 for launching national security satellites through 2027. The Air Force awarded three Launch Service Agreement (LSA) OTA agreements to space launch companies in 2018 to develop NSSL launch system prototypes. Two NSS launch service providers will be selected for launch service procurements starting in FY2020. Congress may consider whether the strategy's cost-benefit analysis warrants further research. Should no more than two launch providers be chosen for LSP contracts in Phase 2, the companies not selected would lose the LSA funds received from the Air Force and could potentially be faced with difficult choices. By the early 1990s, the U.S. space industrial base supported the production of a number of launch vehicles. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 directed DOD to develop a Space Launch Modernization Plan (SLMP) to address increasing launch costs and operational deficiencies. The SLMP led to the implementation of the EELV program, aimed at reducing costs by 25% and ensuring 98% launch vehicle design reliability. The FY1995 NDAA directed DOD to develop an integrated space launch vehicle strategy to replace current medium and heavy launch vehicles. Congress recommended funding for reusable rocket technology and expendable launch vehicle development. The EELV acquisition strategy involved a competitive down-select to a single launch provider, with Lockheed Martin, Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, and Alliant Techsystems selected in 1995. After selecting Lockheed Martin and McDonnell Douglas in the first round of competition, the Air Force later revised the EELV acquisition strategy to include both companies due to the belief in a growing commercial launch market. However, the anticipated market growth did not materialize as expected, leading to challenges in sustaining two EELV providers. The two launch companies selected for the EELV program did not materialize, leading to increased prices and program costs. Despite having two providers, confidence in assured access to space was lost after six space launch failures in the late 1990s, resulting in the loss of three national security satellites costing over $3 billion. One of the lost satellites, MILSTAR, was not replaced until 2010 with an AEHF satellite, which faced acquisition challenges and design changes. The failures of six space launches in the late 1990s, including the loss of an NRO reconnaissance satellite and a DSP satellite, led to significant impacts on the cost, schedule, and operational aspects of national security space missions. President Clinton ordered a review, resulting in the Broad Area Review (BAR) recommending increased contractor and government oversight for the EELV program to enhance reliability and confidence. The early 2000s brought turmoil to the Air Force space community and EELV launch providers due to competition, cost increases, and the need for reliable access to space. Lockheed and Boeing considered leaving the market, prompting the U.S. government to increase its involvement and shoulder EELV program costs to ensure assured access to space. The George W. Bush Administration conducted internal reviews to protect the ability to deliver NSS satellites into orbit. In 2004, the George W. Bush Administration issued NSPD-40, requiring \"assured access to space\" and funding fixed launch costs for Lockheed and Boeing. Due to market collapse, DOD revised its EELV strategy to maintain two launch providers. In 2006, Boeing and Lockheed formed ULA to consolidate launch operations. In 2006, Boeing and Lockheed formed a joint venture - ULA - to combine resources and assure access to space at lower cost. The Federal Trade Commission granted ULA antitrust clearance in October 2006, leading to \"unparalleled EELV mission success.\" Since then, the Air Force has procured space launches from ULA on a sole-source basis, focusing on mission success over cost control. However, by 2010, DOD officials predicted unsustainable cost increases in the EELV program due to potential instabilities in the launch industrial base. The EELV program faced unsustainable cost increases due to instabilities in the launch industrial base and inefficient buying practices. SpaceX entered the market in 2009, but was not certified for national security missions until 2015. In response, DOD reorganized its acquisition of launch services, leading to a new EELV acquisition strategy in 2011 advocating for a steady production rate to stabilize costs. The new EELV acquisition strategy aimed to stabilize the space launch industrial base through block-buys of launch vehicles and renew competition. DOD sought greater insight into ULA program costs before contract negotiations, leading to a contract modification in December 2013 for 35 launch vehicle booster cores over five years. The DOD modified the contract with ULA to negotiate better launch prices and achieve cost savings. However, there were disputes over the estimated savings, leading to a reduction in the number of EELV launches open to broader competition. Some questioned the transparency of the competition process, possibly due to previous cost breaches and instabilities in the acquisition strategy. The EELV acquisition strategy involved a three-phased approach: Phase 1 (FY2013-FY2019) awarded a sole-source block-buy to ULA for up to 36 cores and 7 years of NSS launch infrastructure. Phase 1A (FY2015-FY2017) allowed competition for NSS launches to new entrants like SpaceX. Phase 2 (FY2018-FY2022) aimed for full competition among all providers, with Phase 3 (FY2023-FY2030) envisioning full competition and awarding launch services to any certified provider. The Air Force's NSSL program has launched over 70 successful missions for various agencies. Uncertainty surrounds the EELV acquisition strategy due to concerns over costs, national security vulnerability, legal challenges, and potential legislative changes. The EELV program underwent significant cost growth, reaching $69.6 billion in March 2013, a $34.6 billion increase from the previous year. Factors contributing to this included extending the program's life cycle, increasing the number of launch vehicles to be procured, unstable demand for launch services, and industrial base instability. These changes were not indicative of poor performance by the Air Force or industry. The EELV program experienced significant cost growth, reaching $69.6 billion in March 2013, with factors such as extending the program's life cycle and increasing the number of launch vehicles. This increase complicated funding challenges for the Air Force and led to a reevaluation of their acquisition strategy. SpaceX claimed that ULA's launch costs were higher than what they would charge once certified by the Air Force for NSS launches, but verifying these claims is challenging due to proprietary and speculative cost data. The Air Force, GAO, ULA, and SpaceX have provided launch cost data, but it is not directly comparable. SpaceX's cost figures for NSS launches lack a long history of actual cost data. Reliable and consistent cost data for comparison has been a frustration for Congress. The licensing of the Russian RD-180 engine for the Atlas V was due to concerns about the collapse of the Soviet Union and potential proliferation of Russian expertise to hostile countries. The U.S.-Russian partnership acquired Russia's heavy lift rocket engine capabilities through a license agreement for the coproduction of the RD-180 engine. This later changed to stockpiling engines for the Atlas V, viewed as cost-competitive. Concerns were raised about the EELV program's reliance on a single critical Russian component, leading to a directive to examine future space launch requirements. The 2006 RAND study and GAO expressed concerns about the use of Russian RD-180 engines in the Atlas V common core for future space launch requirements. Congress directed DOD to assess the national security implications of using foreign components in the EELV program, but the Air Force did not change its acquisition strategy in response. After Russian incursions in Ukraine triggered U.S. sanctions in 2014, concerns over the vulnerability of the EELV program led to a desire for change in the acquisition strategy. Sanctions imposed on Russian entities, including Deputy Prime Minister Dimitry Rogozin, raised alarm over the supply of RD-180 rocket engines. Rogozin threatened to halt engine exports unless guarantees were made for civilian use only, causing uncertainty in the U.S. about potential bans on engine exports for military purposes. The uncertainty surrounding the ban on RD-180 engine exports to the United States has raised questions about the future of the EELV program. Congress has taken steps to end reliance on the RD-180 and develop a domestic alternative. The Air Force faces challenges in transitioning to a competitive launch market, especially with ULA's retirement of the Delta IV Medium. SpaceX is currently the only other viable option. In 2014, a commission was formed by DOD to address the potential loss of the Russian RD-180 engine in the EELV program. The commission recommended accelerating purchases of the RD-180 and developing a new U.S. liquid rocket engine by 2022. Congress has taken steps to end reliance on the RD-180 and transition to a competitive launch market. Congress has supported the development of a U.S.-made main rocket engine to replace the Russian RD-180 by 2022. The FY2015 NDAA allowed ULA to use pre-purchased RD-180 engines for national security missions. Subsequent NDAA bills increased the number of authorized RD-180 engines to 18 by December 31, 2022, to maintain competition in the launch market during the transition to domestic rocket engines. The FY2017 NDAA set the end date for the use of Russian RD-180 rocket engines to December 31, 2022. The Air Force's NSSL priorities include mission success, innovative mission assurance, transitioning to new launch vehicles, and assured access for future space architectures. Cost savings are expected through acquisitions and operability improvements, such as common components, standardized interfaces, launch pads, and reduced on-pad processing. Acquisitions are improved through block buys of launch vehicles and competition between certified providers via Launch Service Agreements (LSA) and Launch Service Procurement (LSP) awards. The Air Force awarded Launch Service Agreements (LSA) to ULA, Northrop Grumman, and Blue Origin in 2018 to develop domestic launch system prototypes. The ongoing Launch Service Procurement (LSP) competition is in Phase 2, with plans to select two space launch providers in 2020. ULA, Northrop Grumman, SpaceX, and Blue Origin have submitted bids for Phase 2, proposing their rocket designs: Vulcan, OmegA, Falcon, and New Glenn. ULA and SpaceX have received Phase 1 and Phase 1A awards, with 18 active contracts for the NSSL program. The Air Force awarded Launch Service Agreements to six companies, with ULA and SpaceX being the only certified space launch providers for NSS payloads. ULA is focused on developing the Vulcan launch vehicle powered by the Blue Origin BE-4 engine. There is widespread support for robust competition and assured access to space within the space community and Congress. The challenge is to drive down costs through competition while ensuring launch reliability and performance. The Air Force's decision to down-select to two launch providers and award two separate Launch Service Procurement contracts in 2020 could have significant implications. Congress may consider directing the Air Force to provide a cost-benefit analysis of selecting more than two providers, authorizing additional funds for diversifying launch options, and assessing cost savings and risks of using reusable and expendable launch vehicles. Transitioning away from the RD-180 engine to a domestic alternative also presents technical and program challenges. Transitioning from the RD-180 engine to a domestic U.S. alternative for launch vehicles poses technical, program, and schedule risks. Replicating the performance and reliability record of the RD-180, with 81 successful launches since 2000, may not be achieved until after 2030."
