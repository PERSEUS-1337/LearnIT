    "content": "The \"Civil Rights Act of 1964 Commemorative Coin Act\" commemorates key events in the civil rights movement, including Rosa Parks' defiance on a segregated bus, college students' lunch counter sit-ins, and the Freedom Rides testing segregation in interstate transportation. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. led civil rights supporters in the March on Washington in 1963, delivering his famous \"I Have A Dream\" speech to raise awareness for civil rights legislation. Mrs. Coretta Scott King was a prominent figure in the civil rights movement, organizing Freedom Concerts and participating in marches alongside her husband. The Civil Rights Act of 1964, influenced by Rosa Parks and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., expanded civil rights protections, outlawing racial discrimination and segregation in public places, federally funded programs, and employment. It also encouraged desegregation in public schools and served as a model for subsequent anti-discrimination laws. Equality in education was a cornerstone of the civil rights movement, with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. emphasizing the importance of education for shaping the future. The United Negro College Fund has supported over 300,000 young African Americans in earning college degrees, including leaders in various fields like education, science, medicine, and law. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 marked a significant milestone in the fight against discrimination. Congress has a duty to continue this struggle for equal rights.
