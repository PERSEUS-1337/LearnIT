    "content": "The \"Healthy Hospitals Act of 2009\" requires hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers to publicly report data on health care-associated infections. This amendment aims to improve transparency and accountability in healthcare facilities. The \"Healthy Hospitals Act of 2009\" mandates hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers to report health care-associated infection data to the CDC. The Secretary will post this data on the Department of Health and Human Services website for public comparison. Additionally, an annual report to Congress will be submitted based on the data collected. The Secretary is required to submit an annual report to Congress summarizing the number and types of health care-associated infections reported in hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers, factors contributing to these infections, the number of certified infection control professionals on staff, and the impact on healthcare costs. The Secretary may impose a civil money penalty of up to $5,000 for each knowing violation of infection control regulations by hospitals or ambulatory surgical centers. This penalty will be collected in the same manner as penalties under the Social Security Act. State laws on health care information disclosure are not preempted by this section. State law requires hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers to disclose information on health care-associated infections. These infections develop in patients receiving health care and are not present before treatment. The requirement for hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers to report health care-associated infections takes effect one year after the enactment of the Act. This includes critical access hospitals as well. The Congress urges health care providers and facilities to reduce health care-associated infections to zero for patients they serve."
