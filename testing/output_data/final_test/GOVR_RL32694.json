    "content": "Open ocean aquaculture involves rearing marine organisms in exposed areas far from shore, facing harsh environmental conditions. It has less control over organisms and the environment compared to inshore aquaculture. The development of offshore aquaculture is controversial, with concerns about environmental degradation and impacts on wild fish populations. Proponents see it as the start of a \"blue revolution\" in aquaculture methods. The \"blue revolution\" marks a period of advancements in aquaculture methods and production. Industry regulation is deemed necessary for orderly development while minimizing environmental impact. Legislation like the National Offshore Aquaculture Act of 2007 aimed to regulate aquaculture in the Exclusive Economic Zone. However, no further action was taken on these bills. On January 28, 2009, the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council approved a plan to regulate aquaculture in the Gulf of Mexico. The plan took effect on September 3, 2009, despite opposition from environmentalists and some fishing industry representatives due to concerns about environmental protection and wild fish populations. H.R. 3534, introduced on September 8, 2009, aimed to rescind the authority of certain entities in aquaculture regulation. Several bills have been introduced regarding offshore aquaculture in the U.S., including H.R. 3534 and H.R. 4363. S. 3417 would prohibit offshore aquaculture until a report on its impacts is submitted. Terms like offshore aquaculture and offshore fish farming are used interchangeably. Open ocean aquaculture facilities consist of various systems such as cages, net-pens, and longline arrays, which can be free-floating, secured to a structure, moored to the ocean bottom, or towed by a vessel. Commercial aquaculture farms in nearshore waters and estuaries use methods like ponds with earthen dikes, cages and net-pens moored to the ocean bottom, and suspended lines. Offshore shellfish culture experiments have been conducted on the seabed and from suspended ropes and longlines. International open ocean aquaculture facilities are found in countries like Australia, Chile, China, France, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, and Norway. In the U.S., there are four commercial open ocean facilities operating in state/territorial waters, cultivating species like moi (Pacific threadfin) and cobia (ling). In the U.S., commercial aquaculture facilities operate in state/territorial waters cultivating species like moi (Pacific threadfin) and cobia (ling). Some facilities are located in deepwater pens, while others cultivate blue mussels off the coast of New Hampshire. Regulatory challenges exist for developing commercial aquaculture facilities in federal waters due to unclear processes and technical uncertainties. Regulatory uncertainty is a major barrier to developing offshore aquaculture in the United States, along with potential environmental and economic impacts. Proponents see open ocean aquaculture as the start of a \"blue revolution\" with benefits such as meeting consumer demand, creating new jobs, reducing the seafood trade deficit, and establishing a new industry. Opponents of open ocean aquaculture raise concerns about environmental impacts, including pollution, entanglement of marine wildlife, introduction of nonnative species, and genetic effects on wild species. They also worry about the potential effects on commercial fisheries, such as habitat degradation, preemption of fishing grounds, and market competition. The future of aquaculture in the EEZ is uncertain, with technological, biological, and economic factors influencing profitability. Tradeoffs between benefits and environmental/social impacts will shape the industry. Questions remain about the viability and impacts of open ocean aquaculture, complicated by evolving technology, economic uncertainties, and environmental concerns. Major concerns include biological factors and market competition. Open ocean aquaculture development faces concerns in biological, operational, business, social, economic, environmental, legal, and regulatory aspects. Current species and culture techniques are limited, requiring further research and new techniques for rearing species not currently grown. Various economically important species are being studied for possible culture, including amberjack, black sea bass, blue mussels, cobia, cod, corvina, flounder, haddock, halibut, mahimahi, mutton snapper, red drum, striped bass, tuna, and yellowtail snapper. Other research topics include hatchery culture. Open ocean aquaculture development involves research on various economically important species such as amberjack, black sea bass, blue mussels, cobia, cod, corvina, flounder, haddock, halibut, mahimahi, mutton snapper, red drum, striped bass, tuna, and yellowtail snapper. Research topics include hatchery culture technologies, automated feeder design, disease control, cages for rough water environments, nutrition requirements, and environmental monitoring. Operators may lack experience with technical requirements for offshore facilities due to the industry's newness. Technology limitations require water depths of 100-150 feet, restricting development to a narrow band offshore. Open ocean aquaculture facilities face challenging environmental conditions such as strong currents, steep waves, and seasonal anoxic conditions. To overcome these obstacles, innovative cage designs, submersible cages, and autonomous feeding systems have been developed. Closed containment systems and automated buoys are also being researched to address environmental concerns and improve stock monitoring and feeding efficiency. Developing automated buoys and floating cages for open ocean aquaculture faces challenges in estimating profitability, securing financing, and navigating regulatory uncertainties. Proponents argue that long-term permitting or leasing is essential for attracting capital. Securing capital and insurance for open ocean aquaculture is challenging due to unclear property rights beyond the territorial sea. The insurance sector, with over 30 years of experience in insuring conventional aquaculture, can facilitate obtaining capital. Involving insurers early in the development of open ocean aquaculture can help them become comfortable with the risks involved. Profitability in this industry requires sufficient investment capital. Ocean aquaculture profitability depends on investment capital availability, property rights, permitting, and environmental concerns. Critics debate the economic viability of open ocean aquaculture compared to nearshore options. The level of capital investment will hinge on its competitive rate of return. U.S. aquaculture economic potential relies on operational costs, product prices, regulations, technology, and economic conditions. Labor, energy, capital, and input costs are influenced by economic conditions. Product prices are affected by global demand. Prices of U.S. aquaculture products are influenced by global demand and competition from similar products. Government support in other countries may promote the development of a U.S. open ocean aquaculture industry. The United States has a competitive edge in technological innovation, but faces challenges such as higher operating costs and environmental standards in other countries. The location of aquaculture facilities further from shore will require additional capital costs. Aquaculture facilities located further from shore will incur higher costs for fuel, security, and surveillance. Land-based aquaculture products may compete with offshore aquaculture. Most aquaculture production in the United States comes from freshwater ponds and raceways, like catfish in the southern U.S. and trout farms in Idaho and North Carolina. Advances in intensive culture techniques, such as closed systems, aim to increase production with minimal environmental impacts. Cobia, a potential species for offshore aquaculture, is currently being cultured in land-based tanks far from the ocean. The commercial viability of this aquaculture method is uncertain, as supportive shoreside infrastructure like hatcheries and nurseries would need to be developed. The development of open ocean aquaculture industry may benefit from fostering industry/academic partnerships and seeking collaborations with multinational corporations. This approach is seen as crucial for the industry to overcome challenges such as finding appropriate sites due to the high value of shoreline property. Proponents suggest that open ocean aquaculture should be considered \"big science\" and align itself with major research projects to drive its growth and success. Proponents argue that open ocean aquaculture needs ocean engineering, marine technology, and floating platform infrastructure for large-scale production. The industry must improve biological methods for hatcheries and grow-out facilities. Without domestic financial support, innovation may come from countries with greater investment in technology. In 2008, the US had a $9.9 billion trade deficit in edible seafood, with shrimp and salmon being the largest imports. The value of annual U.S. aquaculture production of edible fish has leveled off at $672 million in 2005, while seafood imports continue to increase. Proponents argue that open ocean aquaculture could help narrow the U.S. seafood trade deficit, but economists suggest that the U.S. should specialize in industries where it has a comparative advantage. Trade is not always strictly free as economic theory assumes, making it challenging to determine the benefits of developing new industries. Shrimp and salmon, major contributors to the seafood trade deficit, may not be suitable for open ocean aquaculture. Current operations are mainly in ponds or net-pens in protected areas. The competitiveness of open ocean aquaculture with established inshore operations is questionable. Future investment may focus on new species in tropical regions. If carnivorous species are chosen, the demand for fishmeal from low-value wild fish may increase. Imports of fishmeal could increase the U.S. trade deficit if domestic supplies are insufficient. Some Members of Congress are interested in understanding the social and economic effects of open ocean aquaculture development. Lower prices from aquaculture production could benefit U.S. consumers, but may also supplant commercial fishery production. Imports of shrimp and salmon have led to lower prices and increased consumption in the United States. Domestic shrimp production has remained steady while imports of aquaculture shrimp have risen, with over 90% of shrimp consumed in the US being imported in 2007. This has resulted in decreased prices and vessel revenues, leading to fewer active commercial fishing vessels in the Gulf of Mexico fishery. The salmon industry has also seen significant changes due to aquaculture, with farmed fish production increasing total salmon supply. The value of Alaskan wild salmon landings decreased from $800 million per year in the late 1980s to $300 million per year from 2000 to 2004, leading to a decline in income for Alaska fishermen. About two-thirds of U.S. salmon consumption was farmed, while one-third was from capture fisheries targeting wild stocks. Competition and lower prices have impacted Gulf of Mexico shrimp fisheries and Alaska salmon fisheries, but aquaculture has not replaced them. The exact impacts are challenging to quantify due to market complexities. Proponents of open ocean aquaculture believe it can improve the quality of wild fishery management, increase efficiency, and provide consumer benefits. They argue that whether the United States allows open ocean aquaculture or not, there will be socioeconomic impacts, such as changes in prices and markets, likely influenced by foreign production. To better understand the gains and losses to specific sectors and economies, social and economic impact assessments should be included in aquaculture development plans from the beginning. Supporters of open ocean aquaculture anticipate socioeconomic benefits from the industry's development. The development of open ocean aquaculture is seen as a way to support the domestic seafood industry and create employment opportunities for commercial fishermen. Various support roles are needed for offshore aquaculture operations, including land-based hatcheries, feed mills, manufacturing, maintenance, logistics, transportation, and harvesting of fish. Aquaculture advocates believe open ocean farming can support seafood industry, create jobs, and utilize underutilized fish processing plants. Critics raise concerns about sustainability, impact on local communities, and potential automation leading to job loss. Critics of aquaculture argue that open ocean facilities may be automated, leading to minimal local employment benefits. Little evidence supports the economic benefits of open ocean aquaculture, with concerns about interference with maritime transportation and commercial fisheries. Potential conflicts may arise in open ocean aquaculture due to interference with maritime transportation and commercial fisheries. A process is needed to identify suitable areas and address safety issues with offshore facilities. Proponents suggest that open ocean finfish aquaculture systems may have fewer environmental impacts compared to nearshore systems, as waste products can be assimilated and recycled more efficiently. However, the effects can vary depending on various factors. The lack of knowledge about open ocean aquaculture limits understanding of potential environmental concerns. Critics worry about fish escape, water pollution from uneaten feed and waste products, antibiotic use, alteration of benthic habitat, and spread of disease to wild fish. Proponents believe nutrient release from aquaculture operations could increase wild production, but waste settling could also alter benthic habitat. Regulatory measures are hoped to be stringent. Some concerns about open ocean aquaculture include waste settling altering benthic habitat and the need for larger scale operations for profitability. Currents around fish cages can help dissipate waste products, minimizing water quality impact. Combining finfish operations with seaweed or bivalve aquaculture to consume excess nutrients is being tested as a solution. The use of pharmaceuticals and other chemicals in aquaculture is also a concern. The use of pharmaceuticals, antibiotics, growth-enhancing chemicals, and other animal drugs in open ocean aquaculture can harm the environment. Regulations by the U.S. FDA and veterinarian oversight aim to minimize environmental impact. Antibiotics and other drugs used in fish feed can pass through containment systems and affect wild organisms. Efforts to reduce antibiotic use include the development of vaccines. Offshore aquaculture proponents argue that pristine water conditions eliminate the need for antibiotics in tested areas. The use of antibiotics is not necessary in offshore areas being tested in the United States for open ocean aquaculture. Fishmeal and fish oil, obtained from wild stocks like anchovies and menhaden, are used for feeds. These species are not typically consumed by humans and serve as prey for wild carnivorous fish and sea birds. Environmental concerns arise from the large amount of wild fish needed to produce farmed fish, potentially leading to overfishing of ocean stocks. Proponents of aquaculture argue that using fish for animal feeds is necessary as markets for direct consumption of most species harvested in industrial fisheries do not exist. They claim that farmed fish are more efficient at converting fishmeal to edible protein compared to wild species, with a favorable feed conversion rate. The use of less desirable commodities to produce more valuable products is common in livestock and aquaculture operations. If large quantities of fishmeal are used, prices are likely to increase. The price of fishmeal and fish oil may increase for open ocean aquaculture due to high demand. Researchers are working on improving feeding techniques and using alternative protein sources like canola, algae, and soybean meal to partially replace fishmeal. Some operations already use feed with as little as 30% fishmeal, but anti-nutritional factors in plant-derived ingredients are a challenge. The presence of anti-nutritional factors in plant-derived materials is a challenge for using fishmeal in aquaculture. The demand for fishmeal and fish oil is expected to increase due to the popularity of carnivorous fish species. Concerns also arise regarding the spread of fish-borne diseases between aquaculture and wild populations, such as sea lice transfer and infectious diseases like the infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus. Genetic anomalies could occur if wild and hatchery-raised fish interbreed, especially if genetically modified or non-native fish escape from aquaculture facilities. Genetically modified or non-native fish escaping from aquaculture facilities and interbreeding with wild fish can be reduced by farming only sterile fish. Concerns include the displacement of native fish by faster-growing genetically modified fish, especially in states where they are banned. There is also a risk of introducing exotic species into non-native waters, such as Atlantic salmon in British Columbia, which may escape from open ocean facilities. Escape from open ocean facilities, such as submerged cage-culture operations, has been documented with Atlantic salmon in the Pacific Northwest and the Atlantic. Concerns include genetic interactions with native species and competitive displacement. Improved management techniques and modified cage designs help prevent escapes, but closed containment systems may be necessary to fully address the issue. Some are concerned that offshore and underwater facilities may harm marine mammals and wildlife by causing entanglement in nets and lines. Dolphins and other marine mammals have been known to get entangled in fish farms, and sound devices used to keep animals away could potentially harm marine mammals. Open ocean facilities could impact endangered species like North Atlantic right whales during migration and alter essential habitat for feeding, breeding, and nursing. There are concerns about the potential harm to marine mammals and wildlife from offshore and underwater facilities, including entanglement in nets and lines. Open ocean aquaculture may lead to renewed interest in killing \"nuisance\" animals like seals and sea lions, as well as potential issues with predatory animals such as sharks. The privatization of offshore waters for aquaculture activities could be controversial, as it may be seen as a departure from the traditional view of these resources as held in the public trust. The legal and regulatory framework for open ocean aquaculture will determine the success of private industry in establishing commercial operations. Challenges include uncertainties in multi-agency permitting, which make it difficult to plan and finance operations. Moving aquaculture away from the coast could alleviate some public concerns. The open ocean aquaculture industry faces challenges with multi-agency permitting, involving the EPA, Army Corps of Engineers, and NMFS. Delays or denials can occur if expected effects are deemed too great. Future decisions on permits or leases will involve these agencies. The lead federal permitting agency must ensure consistency with state programs under the Coastal Zone Management Act for offshore projects. State waters will be used for operations and fish processing. The EPA regulates discharge from finfish aquaculture facilities in federal waters under the Clean Water Act. States with approved Coastal Zone Management plans can veto federal permits inconsistent with their plans to protect state interests. Discharges causing unreasonable degradation in offshore federal waters are prohibited. The Army Corps of Engineers has jurisdiction over devices in federally controlled waters, the Coast Guard regulates vessel traffic for aquaculture structures, and NOAA defines marine aquaculture as fishing under the Magnuson-Stevens Act. The Department of Defense may review proposals that interfere with naval operations. NMFS leads in promoting open ocean aquaculture development. Under the authority of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, regional fishery management councils like the New England and Gulf of Mexico Councils oversee open ocean aquaculture. The Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council has approved a generic offshore aquaculture fishery management plan to regulate aquaculture in the Gulf of Mexico EEZ. NMFS has authorized open ocean aquaculture operations in federal waters for scientific purposes. The Magnuson-Stevens Act authorizes open ocean aquaculture operations in federal waters for scientific purposes through exempted fishing permits. These permits are limited in duration and do not apply to commercial aquaculture. NMFS must be consulted for potential impacts on essential fish habitat, marine mammals, and endangered species. These reviews could hinder open ocean aquaculture development in certain areas. Establishing separate ocean areas or zones for specific activities, such as aquaculture, has gained attention due to increased ocean uses in the EEZ. Identifying areas with the greatest aquaculture potential, least environmental sensitivity, and community support through a public process could help in planning and permitting aquaculture activities. This approach could address concerns about interference with commercial or recreational fishing during early stages of development. Pre-approved areas could streamline aquaculture permitting process if social and environmental factors were fully studied. In 2005, a task force examined risks and benefits of open ocean aquaculture, focusing on environmental impacts like nonnative species introduction, disease spillover, water pollution, and market-based incentives for environmental protection. The panel proposed a governance framework for environmental protection in marine waters, assigning NOAA a lead role in aquaculture planning. The National Offshore Aquaculture Act of 2007 aimed to regulate aquaculture in federal waters of the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone. H.R. 3534, the Consolidated Land, Energy, and Aquatic Resources Act of 2009, aimed to restrict offshore aquaculture development by rescinding authority from relevant agencies and invalidating permits issued under the Magnuson-Stevens Act. The bill passed the House in 2010, but the section related to offshore aquaculture was removed. H.R. 4363, the National Sustainable Offshore Aquaculture Act of 2009, introduced provisions for regulating offshore aquaculture in the U.S. EEZ, requiring environmental impact statements, and funding research for sustainable management. The bill would prohibit siting aquaculture facilities on oil or gas platforms. Concerns were raised about potential negative impacts on Gulf of Mexico aquaculture and the economy. The bill introduced would prohibit offshore aquaculture until a report on its impacts is submitted to Congress. It also requires a report on land-based aquaculture systems. Environmental and commercial fishing interests have concerns about weak environmental provisions, use of wild species for fishmeal, fish escapement, disease threats, impacts on marine wildlife, and ecosystem impacts. Commercial fishing interests are worried about potential market and community impacts. Both groups advocate for a precautionary approach to aquaculture expansion. Aquaculture industry representatives support offshore aquaculture legislation but express concerns about short permit durations and the need for public investment. NOAA released a 10-Year Plan for its aquaculture program in October 2007, outlining goals, strategies, outcomes, and budget. NOAA released a 10-Year Plan for its aquaculture program in October 2007, outlining goals, strategies, outcomes, budget, and staffing requirements. The plan aims to establish a comprehensive regulatory program, develop commercial marine aquaculture, enhance wild stocks, improve public understanding, and increase collaboration with international partners. It projects an increase in annual domestic aquaculture production to 1.51 million metric tons by 2025, with over 90% from anadromous species and marine aquaculture. The projection for future aquaculture production by 2025 is over 1.51 million metric tons, with challenges including regulatory processes, environmental research, infrastructure, communication, access to coastal sites, and international competition. The Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council approved a plan for offshore marine aquaculture on January 28, 2009, which took effect on September 3, 2009. The purpose is to regulate and promote environmentally sustainable aquaculture in the Gulf of Mexico EEZ. The GMFMC developed an amendment in response to proposals for aquaculture in the region. Public hearings were held to address concerns about environmental impacts, disease spread, and seafood imports. Some support offshore aquaculture with proper management, while others worry about added bureaucracy under the Magnuson-Stevens Act. Currently, regional fishery management councils are developing their own open ocean aquaculture management policies, which may be contradictory. Commercial aquaculture is limited in offshore federal waters due to the lack of aquaculture FMPs or generic aquaculture amendments. Regulatory authority over species like mussels, not managed under federal FMPs, is unclear. NOAA is working on a national policy for marine aquaculture to regulate offshore aquaculture in federal waters, including the Gulf of Mexico. The development of federal standards for permitting aquaculture facilities and the potential use of decommissioned oil platforms for aquaculture in the Gulf of Mexico region are key issues. The Rigs-to-Reefs program allows operators to convert obsolete platforms into artificial reefs to enhance fisheries. Some are considering alternative uses like energy generation platforms and aquaculture support facilities. The Mineral Management Service (MMS) announced a program for alternative uses of offshore oil and gas production platforms, including aquaculture operations. Concerns were raised about platform removal, liability, and end-of-lease obligations if aquaculture businesses fail. The program allows for issuing leases, easements, and rights-of-way for alternative uses on a case-by-case basis. Offshore aquaculture could be authorized to use existing OCS facilities. Proponents suggest that if Alaska had embraced intensive salmon aquaculture, it could have dominated the world salmon market. Instead, Alaska now competes with salmon aquaculture from Chile and Norway. The potential socioeconomic impacts of open ocean aquaculture on wild fisheries are highlighted. The potential socioeconomic impacts of open ocean aquaculture production on wild fisheries, such as changes in prices and markets, may result from increased production, whether domestic or foreign. Environmentalists and commercial fishermen may have different views on the absence of salmon aquaculture in Alaska, with concerns about potential environmental and social problems being avoided by focusing on traditional wild fisheries. Despite competition from aquaculture salmon imports affecting Alaska salmon fisheries, improvements in marketing and product quality have helped maintain competitiveness in many market segments. The future of aquaculture in the U.S. EEZ remains uncertain, with the need for a regulatory framework to potentially spur industry development. Aquaculture in other countries may offer advantages. The future profitability of open ocean aquaculture in the U.S. will depend on a mix of technological, biological, and economic factors. Government funding may support research and pilot projects, but large-scale production will rely on private initiatives and innovation. Environmental concerns related to aquaculture development in open ocean areas need to be addressed, with a balance needed between industry growth and environmental protection. Policy makers face the challenge of balancing flexibility for the aquaculture industry with public concerns about environmental and social impacts."
