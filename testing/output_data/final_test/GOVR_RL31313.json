The House and Senate approved the conference report accompanying the Act, which extended funding levels until January 31, 2003. The House version of the bill for FY2003 included a provision allowing the District of Columbia to spend locally raised funds while Congress completed action on federal contributions. Congress passed a continuing resolution postponing further consideration of DC appropriations until the start of the 108th Congress. The District of Columbia government has made progress in improving services and financial health since the phaseout of the Authority in 2001. However, the city faced a projected budget shortfall of $323 million for FY2003. The CFO's report showed a $77.6 million surplus for FY2001, marking the city's fifth consecutive year of balanced or surplus budgets. The District of Columbia achieved a $77.6 million surplus for FY2001, marking the city's fifth consecutive year of balanced or surplus budgets. However, the significance of this achievement has been eroded by the city's projected fiscal imbalance of $323 million. Various governance-related issues were addressed, including school reform and medical services for the uninsured. School reform is a work-in-progress, with the new Board of Education addressing a budget deficit and issues surrounding special education services. The downsizing of D.C. General Hospital and the financial crisis facing Greater Southeast Community Hospital remain contentious political issues. The replacement of D.C. General with Greater Southeast Community Hospital has raised concerns about the new system's viability. The District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Act of 1995 created the Authority and the Office of Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) to oversee financial matters. The city ended FY1997 with a surplus of $186 million and FY1998 with a surplus of $445 million. The CFO, in collaboration with the District's elected leadership, implemented financial and management reforms. The city's budget surplus for FY1998 was $445 million, followed by a surplus of $135 million for FY1999, $241 million for FY2000, and $77.6 million for FY2001. However, a projected budget shortfall of $323 million was reported for FY2003, leading to significant reductions in city services. The CFO's revised budget estimates for FY2003 to FY2006 highlighted a deficit of $323 million for FY2003, prompting the mayor and city council to submit a revised budget to address the shortfall. The Office of the CFO played a crucial role in maintaining budget discipline and restoring fiscal health. The CFO released the city's FY2001 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, showing a budget surplus of $77.6 million. The report met key objectives for the fifth consecutive year. In 2001, legislation made the OCFO a permanent part of the city's governing structure. A proposal regarding the District's Chief Financial Officer was considered but later withdrawn in July 2001. The city council approved the Establishment Act of 2001, making the CFO position permanent and giving them authority over managing the city's finances. Political division persists over healthcare system reforms for the poor, including downsizing D.C. General Hospital and restructuring healthcare delivery for the uninsured. The downsizing and restructuring of D.C. General Hospital led to a last-minute challenge to the mayor's reelection bid. The Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) mismanaged the hospital, accumulating $109 million in unbudgeted loans. Questionable financial and hiring practices were also highlighted. The new healthcare system aims to reform delivery for the indigent and uninsured residents of the city. The Health Care Safety Net Administration, created to replace the mismanaged Public Benefit Corporation, began providing health care services to District residents in 2001. The new system, led by the Health Care Alliance, offers care to those with incomes below 200% of the poverty level. Critics feared reduced services for the poor, while supporters praised the system for expanding health care options and lowering costs. The new health care system in the city, led by the Health Care Alliance, aimed to provide care to the uninsured at a lower cost. However, recent revelations have raised concerns about its effectiveness. Greater Southeast Community Hospital is facing financial crisis due to security fraud, leading to a reduction in services and a shift in demand to other hospitals. Additionally, an audit found significant oversight issues with the Department of Health's contract with the Health Care Alliance. Critics argue that the privatization of care is flawed. The audit found oversight issues in the enrollment process, with ineligible enrollees in the Health Care Alliance rolls. Enrollment rules require proof of residency, income below 200% of poverty level, and no other health coverage. Supporters argue the privatized system is better than the previous public hospital.

The city's budget includes $15 million for emergency planning and security, with additional funding requested for a unified communications system for regional emergencies. Congress considered funding a needle exchange program, touching on issues of home rule, public health policy, and government sanctioning of illegal drugs. The debate over needle exchange programs in the city revolves around reducing HIV spread among drug users by providing clean needles, while opponents argue it sanctions illegal drug use. Congress prohibited the use of federal funds for such programs in the District of Columbia, allowing only private funding. The District of Columbia Appropriations Actfor FY2001, P.L. 106-522, continued the prohibition on federal and District funds for needle exchange programs. Section 150 of the Act initially restricted needle distribution near schools but was later removed in the FY2002 Act, P.L. 107-96. Private funds can now be used for needle exchange programs, but federal and District funds are still prohibited. Prevention Works is the only entity running a privately funded needle exchange program in DC. The District sought to use local government funds for needle exchange programs, but P.L. 108-7 prohibits the use of both District and federal funds.

The ruling under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution allowed the city to tally the votes on the November 1998 ballot initiative for medical marijuana. Congress had 30 days to pass a resolution of disapproval to prevent its implementation. Language prohibiting the initiative was included in the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY2000. The Act for FY2002 continued to prohibit the District government from implementing the initiative, leading to challenges in the courts.

This change aimed to reduce the number of students placed in private educational institutions, which added to the cost of special education. The District of Columbia Public Schools faced limitations on attorney fees for disabled students under the IDEA. Appropriations Acts for FY2000 and FY2001 set hourly rates and case ceilings for attorneys. The FY2002 Act lifted the ceiling due to concerns about financial hardship for families. District officials argued that attorney fees diverted funds from special education services. The FY2002 Appropriations directed the superintendent of DCPS to provide a list of attorney's fees for prevailing plaintiffs under IDEA. The General Accounting Office was also directed to report on attorneys' fees exceeding payment ceilings in previous years. The District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY2003 limited attorney fees to $4,000 for IDEA cases against DCPS. Attorneys in special education cases were required to disclose any financial or legal relationships with diagnostic services. The District of Columbia School Reform Act of 1995 allowed for the creation of public charter schools to address declining performance in public schools. The District of Columbia Board of Education and the District of Columbia Public Charter School Board have the authority to establish charter schools independently, with a limit of 20 schools per year. Charter schools can be converted from existing schools or created as new startups, receiving funding based on a per pupil basis. The District of Columbia has 39 public charter schools serving 14% of the school population. P.L. 108-7 provides $17 million for charter school activities, including funds for a credit enhancement revolving fund and facilities improvement. It also establishes the Office of Public Charter School Financing and Support and the Charter School Fund, with a provision for a detailed analysis of charter school efforts. The District and national efforts support charter schools by addressing the challenge of finding and financing adequate facilities."
