Travel cards were mandated for federal employees in 1998 to reduce costs and streamline travel program administration. Since the enactment of the Travel and Transportation Reform Act (TTRA) in 1998, federal employees are required to use travel cards for official business travel, except for those who travel fewer than five times a year. The dollar volume of travel card transactions has increased by 103%, reaching $8.93 billion in FY2009. Audits have revealed instances of waste, fraud, and abuse in travel card programs at various agencies, prompting Congress to hold hearings and introduce legislation for better management and oversight. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has issued guidance for agencies to implement internal controls to prevent travel card misuse. The federal travel card program is managed by individual agencies with oversight from GSA and OMB. Agencies must adhere to government-wide guidance and choose travel card services from contracts negotiated by GSA with banks. Each agency is responsible for establishing its own travel card program. Within the framework of OMB guidance and federal travel regulations, agencies establish internal policies and procedures for their travel card program. Individual cardholders are assigned to an approving official (AO) who ensures compliance with statutes, regulations, and agency policies. An agency program coordinator (APC) serves as the liaison to the bank and GSA. The agency program coordinators (APCs) serve as liaisons to the bank and GSA, responsible for agency-wide activities such as managing travel cards, monitoring account activity, and ensuring proper training. GSA negotiates contracts with card vendors under the SmartPay2 initiative, allowing agencies to select credit card products from four banks. Travel card services include individually and centrally billed accounts. The agency offers travel card services with both individually and centrally billed accounts. Centrally billed accounts are used for transportation services, while individually billed accounts cover lodging and other expenses. Agencies are liable for centrally billed accounts, while cardholders are responsible for individually billed accounts. GSA publishes the Federal Travel Regulation to implement statutory requirements. The Joint Federal Travel Regulation (JFTR) applies to members of the Uniformed Services and is promulgated by the Per Diem, Travel, and Transportation Allowance Committee under the Department of Defense. OMB issues charge card management guidance for agencies to follow, establishing responsibilities for purchase, travel, and fleet card programs. Chapter 4 of the guidance identifies the responsibilities of charge card managers in developing risk management controls. Agency charge card managers must ensure that cardholder statements and account activity reports are reviewed to monitor delinquency and misuse, employees are questioned about suspicious transactions, timely payments are made, disciplinary actions are taken for misuse, ATM cash withdrawals are monitored for reasonableness, appropriate training is provided, and cases of fraud are referred to the Office of Inspector General or the Department of Justice. To address delinquency in travel card programs, agencies must have split disbursement and salary offset procedures in place for individually billed accounts. Split disbursement divides reimbursement between the card vendor and cardholder, while salary offset deducts delinquent amounts from an employee's payroll. Circular A-123 requires agencies to submit a charge card management plan annually to minimize misuse and delinquency. Delinquent payments to card vendors incur costly late fees for the government. Card vendors are costly to the government due to late fees for delinquent payments and lost rebate opportunities. Circular A-123 mandates agencies to report delinquent accounts monthly and assess credit worthiness of new card applicants. Audits of agency travel card programs have revealed waste, fraud, and abuse, including personal purchases, unauthorized premium-class travel, and failure to claim reimbursement for unused tickets. Systemic weaknesses in management policies cost the government millions. Audits of agency travel card programs between FY2003 and FY2009 revealed weaknesses in management policies that cost the government millions annually. Examples of misuse include fraudulent and abusive purchases, such as a Federal Aviation Administration employee charging $3,700. The extent of these weaknesses across agencies and the resolution status remain unknown without follow-up audits. Auditors found instances of card misuse, including an FAA employee charging $3,700 for laser eye surgery, a DOD employee reimbursed for 13 airline tickets not purchased, and a State Department employee taking an unauthorized trip to Hawaii. Ineffective monitoring of cardholder transactions is a key reason for these fraudulent activities. Supervisory review of monthly statements is crucial in preventing fraud, as seen in an audit of the Department of Housing and Urban Development's travel program. Inadequate monitoring of cardholder transactions led to fraudulent activities in the Department of Housing and Urban Development's travel program. Approving officials face competing workload requirements, hindering thorough review of travel card purchases. Implementing software to detect fraudulent charges and blocking certain merchant categories could help prevent misuse of travel cards. Some agencies have adopted merchant blocks as a best practice, while others have not. An audit of the Department of Transportation found that it had requested blocks on 46 merchant categories, compared to DOD and Education, which had requested blocks on over 200 merchant categories. Federal civilian and military travelers must buy airline tickets from GSA-negotiated contracts, with refundable tickets. Agencies need to identify unused tickets and initiate the refund process. Some agencies have not independently determined whether tickets have been used. Some agencies have not independently determined if airline tickets have been used, relying on travelers to notify them. This has led to millions of dollars in unused tickets not being refunded, highlighting a costly weakness in the travel program. Some agencies lack independent methods to identify unused tickets, leading to lost refunds. Agencies receive rebates based on charge card transactions and payment performance. Delinquent accounts result in reduced rebates, and late payments may be written off as bad debt. Federal agencies received $255 million in rebates in FY2009 for purchases made with government credit cards. In FY2009, federal agencies received $255 million in rebates for purchases made with government credit cards, including travel cards. Delinquencies have hindered the government from maximizing potential rebates. Delinquency rates for centrally billed accounts improved from 19.23% in January 2009 to 3.10% in September 2010, with only one agency close to a 10.0% delinquency rate in the latest data. The Department of Labor (DOL) has the highest delinquency rate close to 10.0%, while the Department of Justice has a rate of 1.82%. The government-wide individually billed account delinquency rate increased from 1.97% in September 2009 to 2.37% in September 2010, with fluctuations seen in agencies like HUD, DOD, VA, and USDA. Auditors have identified causes of travel card account delinquency, such as agencies deducting potentially fraudulent charges without following the dispute process. Workforce demographics influence delinquency rates, with higher-paid employees and those with more years of work being more likely to have delinquent accounts. Employees' demographics, pay, and work experience influence delinquency rates. Misuse of travel cards is linked to delinquency. Delinquent accounts have cost agencies millions in lost rebates. The FTR mandates coach-class accommodations for travel, with limited exceptions for premium-class accommodations. Premium class includes first-class, the highest airline accommodation in cost and amenities. First-class accommodations are the highest class offered by airlines, above business-class but below coach-class. They can be used when no other accommodations are available, for disabilities, or exceptional security circumstances. Business-class can be used in similar situations, as well as when coach-class is unsanitary, for cost-savings, non-federal payment, agency mission, flights over 14 hours, and outside the continental US. Some agencies did not ensure premium-class use was justified by the FTR. The audit of the Department of State's travel accounts revealed that nearly half of all airline tickets purchased were for premium-class travel, with two-thirds of those tickets not justified or authorized. Poor oversight led to violations of travel regulations, including self-approved upgrades and unauthorized premium-class accommodations by executives. Auditors found that executives and diplomatic couriers frequently used premium-class travel without proper justification, leading to millions of dollars in unauthorized expenses. A 2003 audit at the Department of Defense also revealed similar issues, with a majority of premium-class ticket purchases being unauthorized or unjustified. The GAO identified oversight as a key weakness in DOD's monitoring of premium-class travel. Legislation in the 111th Congress required agencies to assess credit worthiness before issuing government travel cards and establish disciplinary procedures for misuse of charge cards. These requirements were enacted for FY2010 to address improper use of government cards. The Government Charge Card Abuse Prevention Act of 2009, introduced in the 111th Congress, included provisions for internal controls over government travel cards and purchase cards. Agencies were required to maintain records, review cardholder needs, monitor rebates, provide training, assess creditworthiness of applicants, and use that information for card issuance. The Government Charge Card Abuse Prevention Act of 2009 required agencies to have policies in place to prevent card misuse, close accounts of departing employees, identify penalties for misuse, report violations to OMB, and have IGs assess travel card controls and transactions. The Government Charge Card Abuse Prevention Act of 2009 aimed to address illegal, improper, or erroneous uses of travel cards by requiring agencies to review vouchers, dispute charges, and request refunds for unused tickets. The act would improve internal controls for centrally billed accounts to prevent reimbursing employees for charges they did not incur. The Government Charge Card Abuse Prevention Act of 2009 aimed to dispute improper charges and save millions annually. It would expand the role of IGs in travel card oversight, increasing audit activity to assess program controls and weaknesses. Agency IGs would determine audit frequency, providing varied information availability. The Government Charge Card Abuse Prevention Act of 2009 aimed to improve oversight of agency travel card programs. Auditors found that poor transaction monitoring by approving officials is often linked to travel card misuse. Lack of current, comprehensive information on program weaknesses hinders congressional oversight. Audit reports have identified millions of dollars in wasteful, fraudulent, and abusive travel card transactions. The Government Charge Card Abuse Prevention Act of 2009 aimed to improve oversight of agency travel card programs. Audit reports have identified millions of dollars in wasteful, fraudulent, and abusive travel card transactions. However, there is a lack of current and comprehensive information on program weaknesses, hindering congressional oversight. Key questions remain unanswered regarding high delinquency rates, lost rebates, abuse of premium travel, and detection of fraudulent transactions. Additional information is needed to assess the extent of travel card waste, fraud, and abuse. The Government Charge Card Abuse Prevention Act of 2009 aimed to improve oversight of agency travel card programs by conducting additional audits to identify waste, fraud, and abuse. Congress may require audits for agencies with higher-risk travel card programs, follow-up audits to ensure implementation of recommendations, and data collection on potential rebates earned. Potential rebates earned by agencies, categorized by card type, are not currently reported to Congress. This information could help identify agencies not maximizing rebate opportunities."
