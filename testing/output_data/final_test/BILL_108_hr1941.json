    "content": "The Act titled \"Voter Freedom Act of 2003\" is cited as the short title. The Congress finds that the rights of eligible citizens to participate in the election process for members of Congress, including seeking election, voting, and associating for political purposes, are fundamental to democracy. The Supreme Court has ruled that states cannot discriminate against candidates for Congress and that all voters must be treated equally. Voters have elected non-major party candidates to Congress on numerous occasions. Throughout the twentieth century, around 3.7% of voters have supported minor party and independent candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives. This percentage was 4.2% on November 7, 2000, indicating a significant desire among voters for alternative candidates. Minor party nominees and independent candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives face challenges with election laws in some states, requiring petitions signed by a large number of registered voters within a district. Georgia, for example, mandates a petition signed by 5 percent of registered voters in the district, which must be notarized. In contrast, political parties meeting certain polling thresholds are exempt from submitting petition signatures. In Georgia, candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives must submit a petition signed by 5 percent of registered voters in the district. North Carolina requires a 4 percent petition for independent candidates, while South Carolina mandates 10,000 signatures for independents. Qualified political party members in North Carolina and South Carolina do not need to submit petitions to run for Congress. California requires independent candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives to submit a petition signed by 3 percent of registered voters in the district. In contrast, members of qualified political parties only need 40 signatures to run. Throughout U.S. history, only four individuals have successfully overcome a signature requirement greater than 10,000 signatures to gain a place on the ballot for the U.S. House of Representatives. In various states, independent candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives have faced high signature requirements to run for office, such as in Ohio, Florida, California, and Montana. However, some states do not have such stringent requirements and still maintain an uncrowded ballot. For example, Florida no longer requires any signatures for congressional candidates. In 2000, Florida had no U.S. House race with more than 4 candidates on the ballot. Different states have varying signature requirements for individuals to run for Congress, with some states requiring as few as 25 signatures. New Jersey only requires 100 signatures for independent candidates to run for the U.S. House of Representatives. It is unnecessary for states to require thousands of signatures for candidates to run for the House. Some states have laws requiring new political parties or independent candidates to file petitions months before a general election. Illinois mandates independent candidates for Congress to file a petition in December of the year before the election, signed by 5% of the last vote cast. Ohio requires new parties to submit a petition equal to 1% of the last vote cast by January in mid-term election years. Some states have laws requiring new political parties or independent candidates to file petitions months before a general election. California mandates new political parties to have registered members equal to 1% of the last vote cast by October of the year before an election. Mississippi requires independent candidates for Congress to file a petition by January of an election year. Virginia prints party labels on the ballot if the candidate is the nominee of a party that polled 10% of the statewide vote at a previous election. Other candidates must be labeled as \"independent\". The establishment of fair and uniform national standards for access to the ballot in elections for the U.S. House of Representatives would remove barriers to citizen participation in the electoral process. This would maximize the rights identified in this subsection and facilitate greater participation. The Act aims to establish fair and uniform standards for ballot access in U.S. House of Representatives elections to promote citizen participation and maximize eligible voter involvement in Federal elections. SEC. 3. BALLOT ACCESS RIGHTS. An individual has the right to be placed as a candidate on a ballot in a Congressional election by presenting a petition with at least 1,000 signatures of registered voters in the district. To be a candidate in a Congressional election, a petition with 1,000 signatures of eligible voters is required. The petition must be circulated within specific time frames based on the election date. Savings Provision: Subsection (a) does not apply to states with greater ballot access rights than those provided under the subsection. The Attorney General will create rules to implement the Act. In this Act, key terms such as \"Congressional election,\" \"State,\" \"individual,\" \"petition,\" and \"signer\" are defined. The term \"signature\" in the context of a petition includes incomplete names, names with abbreviations, and names with titles like \"Mr.\" or \"Dr.\". The term \"address\" refers to the address used for registration and voting purposes by a signer."
