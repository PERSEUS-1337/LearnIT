Prior to MMA, 38% of Medicare beneficiaries did not have drug insurance coverage, leading to higher drug prices for those without insurance. Medicare Part D provides voluntary insurance coverage for drugs, with an estimated federal cost of $44.7 billion in 2007. The \"noninterference\" provision in the Medicare Modernization Act prevents the federal government from negotiating drug prices with pharmaceutical manufacturers. There is growing support in Congress and among Americans to repeal this provision and allow the government to negotiate prices. If repealed, Congress may need to provide guidance on how the Secretary of Health and Human Services should negotiate prices. The report provides an overview of pharmaceutical pricing policies used by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Medicaid, two major federal purchasers of prescription drugs. It discusses implications of current U.S. pharmaceutical pricing for Medicare and options to lower costs for the Medicare Part D Program and its beneficiaries. Formularies are commonly used in drug price negotiations, but other incentives can also be utilized. Drug pricing policies do not determine formularies, and adopting a pricing policy does not mean adopting the formulary. Understanding the extent of drug inclusion in a formulary can help in deciding on appropriate pricing policies. The current law provides prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries through prescription drug plans (PDPs) and Medicare Advantage prescription drug (MA-PD) plans. PDPs only cover prescription drugs (Part D), while MA-PDs cover the entire set of Medicare benefits (Parts A, B, and D). Competitive bidding for pharmaceutical pricing may vary depending on the formulary's inclusiveness, which can range from one to multiple drugs in each drug class. The PDPs cover prescription drugs (Part D) for Medicare beneficiaries through contracts with CMS. Plans create benefit packages, negotiate prices with manufacturers, and enrollees make copayments and pay premiums affected by negotiated prices. Satisfaction with drug plans is linked to drug costs. Part D plans are required to include two drugs in each therapeutic class, with coverage mandated for certain drug classes like antidepressants and antipsychotics. Plans cannot change formularies without CMS approval or drop coverage for current users, except at the start of the year. However, beneficiaries may not have access to every prescribed drug, as seen with the \"doughnut hole\" gap in coverage. In 2007, drug expenditures ranged from $2,400 to $5,451. Most coverage for the \"doughnut hole\" was limited to generic drugs. Patients may face inefficiencies when choosing their own plan. The \"noninterference\" provision in MMA prevents the Secretary of HHS from negotiating drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries. Polls show that most patients are satisfied with their drug plans. The conference report discusses pharmaceutical pricing policies for Medicare, emphasizing the need for PDPs to negotiate price concessions with manufacturers. Repealing the \"noninterference\" clause could change drug pricing policy, allowing the Secretary of HHS to negotiate prices. Congress may need to provide guidance on the type of pricing policy and goals to be negotiated. The federal government may use its market share to negotiate lower drug prices, but the impact on costs for Medicare beneficiaries and other consumers is uncertain. Any new drug pricing policy for Medicare could affect manufacturers' research, Part D plans, pharmacies, and other consumers, depending on the type of policy implemented. The impact of implementing new drug pricing policies for Medicare, including the potential ripple effects on costs for beneficiaries and consumers, is uncertain. The VA pharmaceutical procurement model has been a focus of attention in discussions about negotiating drug prices under Medicare Part D. Understanding the differences between Medicare, VA, and Medicaid systems is essential for evaluating the implications of applying VA or Medicaid drug pricing policies to Medicare. The VA health care system is a closed system where physicians are employees, providing care directly to veterans. They purchase pharmaceuticals directly from manufacturers and manage a national formulary. The VA uses four contracting mechanisms for pharmaceutical supplies. The VA health care system uses four contracting mechanisms for pharmaceutical supplies, including incentive agreements, Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs), pricing under the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, and national standardization contracts. The FSS program managed by the VA's National Acquisition Center offers a price catalog with a wide range of products, including pharmaceuticals. The FSS is open to all federal agencies and currently contains about 17,000 pharmaceutical products, with 36% being brand name drugs and 64% generic drugs. The VA's National Acquisition Center manages the FSS program, which offers a wide range of pharmaceutical products through multi-year contracts. Contracts are awarded to multiple companies for comparable products at varying prices. The contracting officer evaluates proposals based on drug manufacturers' discounting policies, without considering competitors' policies. Under GSA procurement regulations, FSS prices for brand name drugs must not exceed prices charged to Most-Favored Customers (MFC). MFC is the customer receiving the best discount from manufacturers. VA's NAC evaluates if the government was offered a fair price, if the manufacturer is responsive and responsible, if all certifications were completed, and if past performance is satisfactory. The VA evaluates drug manufacturers based on regulatory requirements, past performance, financial capability, and overall government interest. Awarded FSS contracts include a BPA clause for further negotiations and additional discounts. BPAs involve market share agreements for specific drug volume commitments. Performance-based incentive agreements offer 5%-15% discounts off FSS prices. The VA's performance-based incentive agreements provide 5%-15% discounts off FSS prices. Legislation required pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide rebates to state Medicaid programs based on lowest prices, leading to the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 mandating drug listing on the FSS and price controls for federal purchasers like the VA. Under P.L. 102-585, pharmaceutical manufacturers must adhere to statutory requirements by signing a master agreement and pharmaceutical pricing agreement with the \"Big 4\" agencies. They agree to sell each covered drug at no more than 76% of the non-federal average manufacturers price, with additional discounts if the price increases faster than inflation. The federal ceiling price (FCP) is calculated to prevent the non-FAMP price from exceeding the CPI change. Manufacturers not offering products on the FSS or under P.L. 102-585 are restricted from contracting with certain agencies. The FCP is exclusive to the \"Big 4\" agencies, leading to dual pricing options for drug companies. The federal ceiling price (FCP) acts as a price ceiling for FSS eligible federal customers. Some pharmaceutical products on the FSS equal the FCP, while others are below it. The VA uses national standardization contracts to purchase drugs, allowing other agencies like DOD and PHS to participate. Competitive bids are sought from manufacturers for therapeutically equivalent products, based on medical effectiveness, safety, and price, to be included in the VA's national formulary. The VA uses national standardization contracts to purchase drugs, committing to specific products in exchange for lower prices. These one-year contracts can be renegotiated and result in savings of 10%-60% compared to FSS prices. Prior to 1995, VA medical centers managed their own formularies, but now the Drug Product and Management division in Hines, Illinois oversees drug usage and purchasing. In 1995, the VA established a Pharmacy Benefit Management (PBM) Health Care Strategic Group to manage pharmaceutical costs and develop formularies. VISNs were created to develop formularies by combining medical center formularies, and a national formulary was established to ensure all veterans have access to pharmaceuticals. The VA established a national formulary in 1997 to lower prescription drug costs through bulk purchases. The formulary process aims to provide comprehensive pharmaceutical benefits to all VA patients. The VA's formulary management involves various committees and clinical experts to ensure desired patient outcomes. The VA Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) team, consisting of field-based physicians and clinical pharmacists, reviews pharmaceutical purchases and identifies high-usage items based on patient treatment and outcomes. The VA formulary includes 1,294 chemical entities, with multiple dosage forms available for many drugs. For example, felodipine, used for high blood pressure, has three dose-specific formulations in the VA formulary. The VA national formulary includes a variety of drugs, with 44% being brand-name medications and 56% generic drugs. Despite concerns about restrictions, a study by the National Academy of Sciences found that the formulary is not overly restrictive and has helped reduce drug expenditures. The VA national formulary has reduced drug expenditures without adverse effects on quality. Guidelines are in place for prescribing non-formulary drugs when medically necessary, with decisions made within 96 hours. Medicaid provides health care coverage, including pharmaceuticals, to low-income individuals. Medicaid provides health care coverage, including pharmaceuticals, to low-income individuals. States and the federal government share the cost of each program based on a statutory formula, with federal matching payments ranging from $1 to $1.52 for every $1 of state spending on Medicaid services. Prescription drug prices are subject to upper limits established in federal law to restrict federal matching payments. The law requires drug manufacturers to pay rebates to states for drugs available to Medicaid beneficiaries, based on a \"best price\" policy. States negotiate for lower Medicaid drug prices and may have their own upper limit payment formulas and supplemental rebates. For example, Florida's Medicaid program includes preferred drugs from manufacturers who pay supplemental rebates. Medicaid's federal upper payment levels are calculated based on data from pharmaceutical manufacturers and apply to preferred drugs. The FULs for multiple source drugs are set at 250% of the average manufacturer price, as reported to CMS. These FULs are published in the state Medicaid Manual and apply to all other drugs as well. The FUL requirement for Medicaid ensures that states must adhere to upper limits when reimbursing for multiple source drugs, encouraging the use of lower-cost generic equivalents. Exceptions can be made for brand-name drugs deemed medically necessary with physician certification. The upper limit for \"other\" drugs under Medicaid is determined by the estimated acquisition cost (EAC) plus a reasonable dispensing fee or the provider's usual charge. States can use alternative payment methods as long as payments for \"other\" drugs remain below the upper limit. Pharmaceutical manufacturers pay rebates quarterly based on drug utilization data provided by state programs. The Medicaid rebate calculation for drugs is based on two groups: single source drugs and innovator multiple source drugs, which receive rebates equal to 15.1% of the AMP or the difference between AMP and best price. Additional rebates are required if prices rise faster than inflation. Non-innovator multiple source drugs receive rebates equal to 11% of the AMP. States can establish formularies for Medicaid, and pharmaceutical manufacturers pay rebates quarterly based on drug utilization data. States can establish formularies for their Medicaid programs, but federal rules prevent them from being too restrictive. Federal rebate policies ensure that all drugs from a manufacturer participating in the rebate program are available to Medicaid beneficiaries. States must cover non-formulary drugs requested through prior authorization, except for drugs in 10 specific categories. These categories include drugs for anorexia, weight loss, fertility, cosmetic purposes, coughs and colds, smoking cessation, and prescription vitamins/minerals (excluding prenatal). In 2005, 25 state agencies established preferred drug lists for Medicaid programs to control drug spending. States use various mechanisms like generic substitution, prior authorization, and co-payments. Congress can look to Medicaid and the VA as models for negotiating drug prices to achieve cost savings. One approach Congress may consider to lower drug prices and overall costs is through establishing Medicare ceiling prices. This could help achieve cost savings without directly impacting premiums or co-payments for beneficiaries. Establishing Medicare ceiling prices could help lower drug prices and costs, but there are administrative complications. Combining this policy with a national Medicare formulary and excluding high priced drugs may be necessary for favorable negotiations. However, ceiling prices may not directly reduce costs for beneficiaries or pharmacies. Other policies may be needed to ensure lower prices. Significant reductions in reimbursements could impact access to innovative drugs and have economic effects on payers and providers. Pharmaceutical manufacturers may face economic impacts, affecting research and development. Lower profits could lead to increased drug prices for consumers. Mandating larger rebates from manufacturers to Part D drug plans could lower out-of-pocket payments for beneficiaries. Assuming market competition works in the Part D Program, lower net costs could be passed onto beneficiaries through reduced premiums and copayments. Congress may need to intervene if competition does not fully work by requiring plans to pass on cost savings. Lower Medicare profits for manufacturers could impact research and development, but larger rebates may not affect wholesalers or pharmacists. Implementing a new Medicare pharmacy purchasing system, similar to the VA's mail-order system, could help lower drug prices for beneficiaries. The new Medicare pharmacy purchasing system could negotiate drug prices, distribute drugs, and receive payment from beneficiaries. This approach may be administratively burdensome, requiring the development of a Medicare pharmacy distribution system. Pharmacists could face increased administrative costs and potential profit loss if required to track and purchase drugs separately for Medicare customers. The Part D plans might have a reduced role in the new system, with manufacturers possibly experiencing lower profits from Medicare. Manufacturers' profits from Medicare might be reduced, leading to potential price increases for other consumers. A complete mail-order system may not be feasible as many beneficiaries prefer direct interaction with pharmacists."
