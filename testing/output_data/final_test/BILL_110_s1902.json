    "content": "The \"BRAC Cost Overruns Protection Act of 2007\" or the \"BRAC COP Act of 2007\" limits cost growth associated with the 2005 round of defense base closure and realignment. This amendment adds a new section to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990, imposing restrictions on cost growth for major closures and realignments under the 2005 round. The Secretary of Defense must submit semiannual reports to Congress on the costs of implementing recommendations from the 2005 Commission report on base closures and realignments. The reports include estimates of one-time implementation costs for each recommended closure or realignment. The Secretary of Defense must notify Congress if the estimate of one-time implementation costs for a major base closure or realignment exceeds the baseline estimate by at least 25%. The Secretary of Defense must notify Congress of any substantial increase in costs for a major base closure or realignment. A business plan must be developed to reduce costs to less than 25% above the baseline estimate. Recommendations for over-budget closures must be submitted to the President within 45 days. Defense must recommend to the President whether to continue an over-budget base closure or realignment. Justification must be provided if recommending to proceed despite cost overruns. The President must report to Congress within 30 days of receiving the recommendation. The Secretary of Defense must recommend to the President whether to continue an over-budget base closure or realignment. Congressional disapproval can halt the implementation if a joint resolution is enacted within 45 days of the President's recommendation. The Secretary of Defense recommends to the President on over-budget base closures or realignments. Congressional disapproval can stop implementation through a joint resolution within 45 days of the recommendation. Congress excludes days of adjournment over three days in computing periods for consideration. Realignment. The term 'joint resolution' refers to a resolution introduced within 10 days of the President's report on over-budget base closures or realignments. It must not have a preamble and should state Congress's disapproval of the President's recommendation. The joint resolution must be introduced within 10 days of the President's report on over-budget base closures or realignments. It should state Congress's disapproval of the President's recommendation and be referred to the Committee on Armed Services in the House of Representatives or Senate. The joint resolution must be introduced within 10 days of the President's report on over-budget base closures or realignments. If the committee does not report or act on the resolution within 20 days, it will be discharged from further consideration and placed on the House calendar. If a joint resolution on over-budget base closures or realignments is not acted upon by the committee within 20 days, it will be discharged from further consideration and placed on the House calendar. A Member can move to proceed with the resolution the day after announcing their intention, or immediately if directed by the committee. All points of order against the resolution will be considered. The motion to proceed with the joint resolution is highly privileged and not debatable. It cannot be amended, postponed, or considered alongside other business. A motion to reconsider the vote on the motion is not allowed. If agreed to, the respective House must immediately consider the resolution without interruption until it is resolved. Debate on the resolution is limited to 2 hours, divided equally between supporters and opponents. Amendments are not allowed, but a motion to limit debate is permitted. Other motions like postponement or reconsideration are not in order. The final vote must follow immediately after. The final vote on the resolution must occur immediately after the debate, with appeals on Chair decisions decided without debate. If the resolution passes one House, procedures for consideration in the other House are outlined. If one House receives a resolution from the other House, certain procedures apply: the receiving House cannot refer the resolution to a committee and can only consider it for final passage. The receiving House's procedure for the resolution will be the same as if no resolution had been received from the other House. Upon receiving a resolution from the other House, certain procedures apply: the receiving House must vote on final passage based on the resolution received. Once the resolution from the other House is disposed of, the receiving House cannot consider its own resolution. This section is enacted by Congress as part of the rules of each House. The text outlines the procedures for handling resolutions between Houses, emphasizing the need for each House to follow specific procedures when dealing with resolutions from the other House. It also highlights the constitutional right of each House to change its rules regarding procedures. Additionally, it defines a \"major base closure or realignment\" as one requiring significant military construction costs. The curr_chunk discusses the baseline estimate of one-time implementation costs for military base closure or realignment, as outlined in the Cost of Base Realignment Actions (COBRA) report. The implementation cost is significant, amounting to $300,000,000 or more."
