    "content": "The Act titled \"Breast Cancer Prescription Drug Fairness Act of 2001\" aims to ensure fairness in access to prescription drugs for breast cancer treatment. The Congress finds that all women are at risk for breast cancer, with risk increasing with age. Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women, with 180,200 new cases annually in the United States. Manufacturers of prescription drugs engage in price discrimination practices, causing older Americans and women to pay substantially more for drugs than favored customers. Older Americans and women who buy their own prescription drugs pay twice as much on average compared to favored customers. The discriminatory pricing by major drug manufacturers causes older Americans and women to pay over 15 times more for prescription drugs than the most favored customers, leading to financial hardship and health impairments. Medicare beneficiaries are denied the benefit of obtaining prescription drugs at low prices available to other federally funded health care programs. Implementation of the policy in this Act is estimated to reduce prescription drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries by over 40%, significantly lowering costs for older Americans and women while improving their health and well-being. This will also reduce costs to the Federal taxpayer and benefit terminally ill individuals receiving hospice care services. The Act aims to protect vulnerable individuals by providing lower prescription drug prices to Medicare beneficiaries under hospice care. It also seeks to prevent discriminatory pricing for women with breast cancer and reduce drug costs by over 40%. The Act aims to protect vulnerable individuals by providing lower prescription drug prices to Medicare beneficiaries under hospice care. SEC. 3. PARTICIPATING MANUFACTURERS.
