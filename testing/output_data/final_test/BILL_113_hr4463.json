    "content": "The \"Tax Refund Protection Act of 2014\" regulates refund anticipation payment instruments and tax return preparers under the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010. The Bureau under the \"Tax Refund Protection Act of 2014\" regulates refund anticipation payment arrangements, licenses tax return preparers, and imposes fees for licensing or certification. Tax preparers must demonstrate good character, reputation, qualifications, and competency. The Bureau requires tax return preparers to disclose fees for tax preparation, filing, and refund anticipation. They must also disclose the average time for receiving a refund and differences in days for refund anticipation involving a depository account. The consumer controls the difference in days between receiving a tax refund through a refund anticipation payment arrangement and receiving it directly from the taxing authority. It is not necessary to use a refund anticipation payment arrangement to receive a tax refund. If the refund is less than anticipated, the consumer may be responsible for associated fees and interest. The Bureau requires tax preparers in refund anticipation payment arrangements to comply with Truth in Lending Act regulations. The Bureau can take enforcement action against preparers who are incompetent, disreputable, violate regulations, or intentionally mislead consumers. Definitions for tax return preparer and refund anticipation payment arrangement are provided in this section. A tax return preparer subject to this section is defined as a preparer not regulated under section 330 of title 31, United States Code. A refund anticipation payment arrangement involves a consumer agreeing to pay a fee or interest upon receiving their tax refund in exchange for tax preparation services.

Amendments are made to Section 1027(d) of the Act to remove subparagraph (B) and make conforming changes.
