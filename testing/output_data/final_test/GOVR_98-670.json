Illinois, it was clarified that the first two prongs of the test are factual issues for the jury, while the third prong focuses on the work's overall value. The Miller test determines if a work is legally obscene based on offensive sexual content and lack of serious value. The Communications Decency Act of 1996 expanded laws prohibiting interstate commerce in obscenity to include the use of interactive computer services. The Supreme Court's decision in Reno v. ACLU did not affect provisions of the Communications Decency Act (CDA) related to the Internet. The Court discussed the use of community standards for judging online content but later ruled that community standards alone cannot ban \"harmful to minors\" material on the Internet. Child pornography is material depicting sexual conduct by children below a specified age, and is unprotected by the First Amendment. Federal law bans interstate commerce in child pornography and defines it as any visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct involving a minor. The difficulty in halting the exploitation of children justifies the legislature's actions in banning child pornography. The Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996 expanded the definition of child pornography to include visual depictions that appear to be of a minor, even if no minor was actually used. This included banning visual depictions using adult actors who appear to be minors, as well as computer graphics and drawings done without any models. In Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, the Supreme Court declared the Act unconstitutional in part. In Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, the Supreme Court ruled the Child Pornography Prevention Act unconstitutional for prohibiting pictures not produced with actual minors. Child pornography must be obscene or depict actual children in sexual activity to be unprotected by the First Amendment. The Act targeted content, not production means, unlike statutes focusing on the production of child pornography using real children. The government's rationales for the Act included concerns about pedophiles using materials to encourage sexual activity with children and increasing sexual abuse and exploitation of actual children. The Supreme Court found the government's rationales for the Child Pornography Prevention Act inadequate, stating that legislation cannot be based on controlling private thoughts or prohibiting speech that may lead to unlawful acts in the future. The Court also rejected the argument that virtual child pornography makes it harder to prosecute offenders using real minors, stating that the government cannot suppress lawful speech to prevent unlawful speech. In response to this ruling, Congress enacted Title V of the PROTECT Act in 2003, which prohibits digital images of child pornography. Title V of the PROTECT Act, P.L. 108 - 21 (2003), prohibits any digital image, computer image, or computer-generated image that depicts a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct. It also prohibits visual depictions, including drawings, cartoons, sculptures, or paintings, that depict a minor in sexually explicit conduct and lack serious value. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 amended 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2257, requiring producers of material depicting sexually explicit conduct to keep records of performers' names and dates of birth. The PROTECT Act prohibits digital images depicting minors in sexually explicit conduct and visual depictions lacking serious value. The Adam Walsh Act amended 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2257 to require records of performers' names and dates of birth. P.L. 110-358 expanded laws on child pornography violations affecting interstate commerce. The FCC defines \"indecent\" material as depicting sexual or excretory activities, protected by the First Amendment unless obscene or child pornography. The First Amendment protects indecent material unless it is obscene or child pornography. The government can only restrict indecent material on broadcast media to promote a compelling interest using the least restrictive means. There are federal and state statutes that limit the distribution of material harmful to minors. The Supreme Court has upheld New York's \"harmful to minors\" statute, which prohibits material of a sexual nature with no serious value for minors. In 1997, the Court declared unconstitutional provisions of the Communications Decency Act that aimed to restrict indecent communications to minors. This led to the enactment of the Child Online Protection Act, which prohibits communication of \"material that is harmful to minors\" to minors. The Child Online Protection Act (COPA) only applies to material harmful to minors on publicly accessible websites for commercial purposes. COPA was found unconstitutional in 2007 and never took effect. The Supreme Court declined to review the case in 2009. In 2003, at the Golden Globe Awards, singer Bono used an indecent word that the FCC found to have a sexual connotation. The FCC's policy on fleeting expletives was challenged in court in 2007 and found to be arbitrary and capricious. The FCC's policy on fleeting expletives was challenged in court and found to be arbitrary and capricious. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the FCC's fine against CBS for Janet Jackson's SuperBowl incident, citing arbitrariness. The Supreme Court later vacated and remanded the decision in light of a previous ruling. CIPA amended federal statutes to require schools and libraries to block minors' access to harmful online content. The Supreme Court upheld CIPA in 2003, acknowledging the potential for filtering software to mistakenly block protected speech. The Supreme Court upheld CIPA in 2003, stating that filtering software may mistakenly block constitutionally protected speech, but patrons can easily disable the filters. CIPA ensures public funds are used for their intended purposes without denying benefits to libraries that choose not to use filters."
