    "content": "Federal assistance to public transportation is primarily provided through the Federal Transit Administration's public transportation program. The program was authorized under the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) and extended through the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014. MAP-21 simplified the program structure, strengthened safety oversight, and introduced performance management. This report discusses potential issues for Congress to consider in extending MAP-21 or reauthorizing it. Public transportation, funded through the Federal Transit Administration's program, is defined as shared-ride surface transportation services open to the general public. It excludes intercity rail and bus services, charter bus, school bus, sightseeing, and shuttle services. The main forms include bus, heavy rail, commuter rail, light rail, and paratransit. Public transportation modes include bus, heavy rail, commuter rail, light rail, paratransit, and ferryboat. Bus trips account for 51%, heavy rail 35%, commuter rail 5%, light rail 5%, paratransit 2%, and ferries less than 1%. Despite a decline after World War II, ridership has increased in the past two decades to 10.6 billion trips in 2012, reaching levels not seen since the late 1950s. Public transportation makes up 2% of daily trips and 5% of trips overall. Public transportation accounts for about 2% of all daily trips and 5% of commute trips, heavily concentrated in large cities like New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago. Federal involvement dates back to the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964. The federal public transportation program has evolved to support operational expenses, safety oversight, planning, and research. Funding levels have been between $10 billion and $11 billion since 2009, with authorized funding levels of $10.6 billion in FY2013 and $10.7 billion in FY2014. The Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014 extended the FY2014 funding level through May 31, 2015. Program funding for federal public transportation has been around $10-11 billion since 2009. Additional funding was provided by ARRA in FY2009 and DRAA in FY2013 for emergency relief programs, with a portion subject to sequestration. The funding comes mainly from the mass transit account of the highway trust fund and the general fund of the U.S. Treasury. Congress authorized a transfer of general fund money into the mass transit account in FY2010. In FY2010 and FY2014, $4.0 billion was transferred from the general fund to the mass transit account of the highway trust fund. Public transportation also receives funding from the Surface Transportation Program and the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program. Flexing allows for varying amounts of funds to be transferred from highways to public transportation annually. The TIGER program has also provided federal funding for transportation projects. The Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) program has been a significant source of federal funding for public transportation in recent years. It has received funding from the general fund in various amounts from FY2009 to FY2014. Special-needs paratransit, which provides non-fixed-route service for people with disabilities and the elderly, is another area where federal funding is available. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) identified 73 federal programs funding special-needs transportation services, totaling $2.3 billion in FY2010. This is significantly higher than the FTA spending of $270 million on special-needs paratransit in the same year. Transportation costs include operating expenses (vehicle maintenance, administration) and capital expenses (equipment purchase). Public transportation expenses are mainly for equipment like buses, rail lines, and stations. Federal programs cover 80% of capital projects and 50% of operating costs. Operating expenses make up two-thirds of total costs, while capital expenditures make up one-third. Fares and revenues only cover a quarter of costs, with the rest funded by federal, state, and local governments. The federal government supports less than 10% of operating costs but over 40% of capital expenses through various funding programs administered by FTA. The public transportation program funding includes the Growing States and High Density States Formula, distributing money based on population growth and density. Funding for these programs, except New Starts, comes from the mass transit account of the highway trust fund. Urbanized Area Formula Grants Program provides funding for public transportation in urbanized areas designated by the Census Bureau. The Urbanized Area Formula Grants Program provides funding for public transportation in urbanized areas with populations of 50,000 or more. Funding amounts increased from $4.160 billion in FY2012 to $4.459 billion in FY2014. Funds are distributed based on population, population density, bus and fixed guideway metrics, and a 1.5% set-aside for Small Transit Intensive Cities. The Urbanized Area Formula Grants Program provides funding for public transportation in urbanized areas with populations of 50,000 or more, with a 1.5% set-aside for Small Transit Intensive Cities. The Rural Area Formula Program provides funding for public transportation outside of urbanized areas, with funding authorized at $600 million in FY2013 and $608 million in FY2014. Funding is apportioned based on rural land area, population, vehicle revenue miles, and number of low-income individuals. The Rural Transit Assistance Program (RTAP), Public Transportation on Indian Reservations, and Appalachian Development Public Transportation Assistance Program received funding in FY2013 and FY2014. RTAP funding was $11.9 million and $12.2 million, while Indian Reservations received $30 million annually. The State of Good Repair Program (SGR) was created to replace the Fixed Guideway Modernization Program, providing funding for rail transit systems and other fixed-guideway systems. SGR funding was $2.136 billion in FY2013 and $2.166 billion in FY2014. The State of Good Repair program, authorized at $2.136 billion in FY2013 and $2.166 billion in FY2014, distributes funding for maintaining fixed guideway transit systems. It has two components: High Intensity Fixed Guideway SGR Program (97.15% of funding) and High Intensity Motorbus SGR program (2.85% of funding). Funding is distributed based on fixed guideway vehicle miles and route miles for facilities operating for at least seven years. The Bus and Bus Facilities Program provides funding for bus purchase, rehabilitation, and construction. The Bus and Bus Facilities Program, funded at $422 million in FY2013 and $428 million in FY2014, supports bus purchase, rehabilitation, and facility construction. Funding distribution is now formula-based under MAP-21, with a minimum allocation to states and territories. The New Starts Program funds new fixed-guideway transit systems like rail and bus rapid transit. The New Starts Program received funding from the U.S. Treasury for FY2013 and FY2014, with appropriations slightly reduced from previous years. MAP-21 allowed funds to be used for core capacity improvement projects and interrelated projects. Projects must go through project development, engineering, and construction stages, with easier entry into the project development phase. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) allows project sponsors to develop necessary information for the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) review during project development. FTA must expedite the review process for sponsors with recent successful projects. Projects can move to the engineering phase after completing NEPA, being selected as the locally preferred alternative, adopted into the metropolitan plan, and justified based on various factors including financial commitment and benefits. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) may use special warrants for projects with a federal share of $100 million or less or 50% of the total project cost to expedite project approval. Projects meeting cost-effectiveness criteria defined by FTA receive automatic medium ratings without detailed analysis. Small Starts projects, requesting $75 million or less in federal assistance and costing $250 million or less, have two phases: project development and construction. They include corridor-based bus rapid transit. MAP-21 did not reserve funds for Small Starts projects in FY2013 and FY2014 but created a pilot program for expediting New Starts project delivery. The pilot program aims to expedite project delivery for fixed guideway capital projects and core capacity improvement projects. The Enhanced Mobility of Seniors and Individuals with Disabilities Program combines two former programs and is allocated funds based on a statutory formula. The program allocates funds based on the size of the elderly and disabled population in specific areas. Under MAP-21, certain programs like JARC were eliminated, but their activities are now eligible expenses under other programs. Discretionary programs such as Clean Fuels Grant, Transit in Parks, Over-the-Road Bus, and Alternatives Analysis were also eliminated. However, public transportation serving national parks and federal lands can still receive federal funding under renamed programs. Under MAP-21, the Federal Lands Transportation and Federal Lands Access programs were renamed and planning is now eligible under the Urbanized Area Formula Program and Rural Area Formula Program. The Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program, similar to the Highway Emergency Relief Program, provides funding for capital and operating costs in the event of disasters. $10.3 billion was appropriated for this program after Hurricane Sandy. Under MAP-21, performance management is required in transportation planning, including establishing measures and targets. Metropolitan Planning Organizations must set performance targets for public transportation aligned with measures set by the Secretary of Transportation. Progress towards targets must be evaluated, and Transportation Improvement Programs must align with these targets. Coordination with public transportation providers is required, and asset management systems must be developed by public transportation agencies. Public transportation agencies are mandated to develop an asset management system with performance targets based on state of good repair standards. Progress towards these targets must be reported annually, with no sanctions for non-compliance. The DOT is also required to develop performance measures for the Enhanced Mobility of Seniors and Individuals with Disabilities Program in consultation with advocacy groups. A new pilot program for transit-oriented development planning was established under MAP-21 with $10 million in funding authorized annually. The new program under MAP-21 provides grants for transit-oriented development near transit stations to promote ridership and economic development. FTA's role in public transportation safety was expanded with the development of a national safety plan and certification training program for safety audits. The training program for federal, state, and local employees conducting safety audits or oversight can be funded with up to 0.5% of urbanized and rural formula funds, totaling about $22 million annually. A 20% state or local match is required. Public transportation agencies and states must establish comprehensive safety plans, and states with non-FRA regulated rail systems must have a state safety oversight program. Formula funding for the SSO program comes from the Urbanized Area Formula Program with an 80% federal share. FTA has authority to inspect and audit transit agencies, issue directives, and require corrective actions using federal funding. Growth in public transportation ridership has led to calls for higher federal spending to address safety deficiencies and funding issues. Congress may need to consider extending or reauthorizing programs with a focus on funding levels, revenue sources, problems with the Bus and Bus Facilities Program, support for operating expenditures, privatization, the New Starts program, and special-needs paratransit. Infrastructure needs assessments show a significant gap in public transportation capital spending needed to prevent deterioration in assets. The Department of Transportation estimates that bringing transit assets up to a good state of repair would cost about $2 billion more per year over the next 20 years. Funding for backlog and system expansion is projected to cost between $5.5 billion and $8.0 billion per year. There are differing views on whether funding for public transportation programs should be the responsibility of states and localities or the federal government. Decisions about funding levels and investment priorities for public transportation programs should be made at the state and local levels, rather than by the federal government. This shift in responsibility would leave a greater share of motor-fuel tax revenues for road users, as federal involvement in public transportation decreases. The Congressional Budget Office projects that the imbalance between outlays and receipts from the mass transit account of the highway trust fund will continue in the future. The Congressional Budget Office projects an ongoing imbalance in the mass transit account of the highway trust fund. Congress transfers general fund monies to maintain the balance, primarily funded by a fuels tax. Revenue from the fuels tax for the mass transit account is around $5 billion annually, with total receipts of about $6 billion per year. Outlays from the mass transit account are expected to be $8 billion in FY2014. The mass transit account is projected to have a balance of $1 billion by the end of FY2015, which could lead to cash flow problems. Solutions could involve administrative or legislative actions, such as slowing payments or transferring funds from the general account. Sustainable solutions may require program spending cuts, increased revenues, or a combination of both. Funding shortfalls in the highway account of the highway trust fund have also necessitated general fund transfers. Funding shortfalls in the highway trust fund have required general fund transfers, leading to potential actions in the highway and public transportation programs. Proposed solutions include program spending cuts, revenue increases, or transfers from the general fund. Redirecting revenues from the mass transit account to the highway account was considered in the past but was not popular. This option may be proposed in the future, as some argue against diverting taxes paid by highway users. The Bus and Bus Facilities program faces concerns from small urbanized and rural transit agencies regarding insufficient help for bus acquisition and related investments. Changes in MAP-21, including a significant reduction in funding specifically for buses and a shift to formula-based distribution, have raised worries among small transit systems. The American Public Transportation Association has suggested restoring funding to the bus and bus facilities program to address issues faced by small transit systems. Federal operating support for public transportation in urbanized areas over 200,000 was largely eliminated in 1997, leading to pressure to increase federal funding availability. In response to pressure to increase federal funding availability for operating expenditures, Congress has liberalized the definition of \"capital expense\" in federal law. MAP-21 maintained the prohibition on using federal funds for operating expenses in urbanized areas over 200,000 residents, but introduced the \"100 bus rule\" allowing transit systems with 76-100 buses to use 50% of their Urbanized Area apportionment for operating expenses. Systems with 75 or fewer buses can use 75%. Congress may face demands for transit operating support in reauthorization legislation. One proposed approach was to allow transit agencies with 100 or more fixed-route buses in urbanized areas of 200,000-400,000 people to use up to 50% of program funding for operating expenses. Another option is to eliminate federal transit operating assistance, potentially leading to productivity improvements. The 112th Congress considered encouraging privatization in transit agencies by increasing federal cost share for bus projects if services were contracted out. Federal labor requirements in the transit industry, known as 13(c), mandate the preservation of existing employment rights and benefits for federal funding. The preservation of employment rights and benefits in transit agencies is mandated by federal labor requirements. Privatization advocates often call for the repeal of these protections, arguing that cost savings come at the expense of employees. Changes in MAP-21 aim to address criticisms of project development time, with a focus on speeding up the process and potentially impacting project quality. Reauthorization may lead to a shift in funded projects, with core capacity projects potentially diverting funds from new system construction. The demand for special-needs paratransit has grown rapidly since the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 required transit agencies to provide complementary paratransit services. Between 1991 and 2012, paratransit ridership tripled, compared to a 23% increase in other services. This growth may impact federal funding for traditional light rail and heavy rail projects. Between 1991 and 2012, paratransit ridership tripled, with operating expenses doubling in inflation-adjusted terms. Paratransit now accounts for 12% of public transit systems' operating costs, limiting resources for fixed-route service. Increasing costs and service demands may lead to pressure for greater federal help for special-needs paratransit. Pressure for greater federal help for special-needs paratransit may lead to changes in ADA mandates, such as enforcing eligibility rules and improving coordination of transportation services. Transit agencies are already controlling costs by providing travel training and allowing disabled riders to use fixed-route services for free. These efforts could be encouraged in transit legislation."
