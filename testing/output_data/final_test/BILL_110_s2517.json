The amendments to Section 143(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allow for special rules for subprime refinancings, including modifications to the application of certain subsections for residences originally financed through qualified subprime loans. The amendments to Section 143(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 provide special rules for subprime refinancings, exempting certain subsections for residences financed through qualified subprime loans originated between December 31, 2001, and January 1, 2008. The amendments to Section 143(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 provide special rules for subprime refinancings, exempting certain subsections for residences financed through qualified subprime loans originated between December 31, 2001, and January 1, 2008. Characteristics indicating a foreseeable default risk and potential for lower cost refinancing include loan payment increases over 10% after December 31, 2007, and loan-to-value ratios of 97% or higher at the time of the original mortgage loan. The special rules for subprime refinancings exempt certain subsections for residences financed through qualified subprime loans originated between December 31, 2001, and January 1, 2008. Borrowers with lower credit scores below 660 and no significant increase since the original loan may be considered subprime. The State ceiling for calendar year 2008 will be increased by $15,000,000,000 for qualified mortgage bonds. This paragraph does not apply to bonds issued after December 31, 2010. The State ceiling for 2008 will increase by $15 billion for qualified mortgage bonds. Not less than each State's share of the increase will be allocated solely for qualified mortgage issues meeting specific requirements. Unused limitations can be carried forward. The Internal Revenue Code is amended to include special rules for increased volume cap under subsection (d)(5), restricting the use of the increase for qualified mortgage bonds only and prohibiting the issuance of any bond after 2010. Additionally, the Alternative Minimum Tax clause excludes qualified 501(c)(3) bonds and qualified mortgage bonds from certain provisions.
