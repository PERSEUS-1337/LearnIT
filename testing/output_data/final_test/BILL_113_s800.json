    "content": "The Act titled \"Treto Garza Far South Texas Veterans Inpatient Care Act of 2013\" establishes an inpatient health care facility at the Department of Veterans Affairs medical facility in Harlingen, Texas. Congress finds that the current and future health care needs of veterans in Far South Texas are not fully met by the Department of Veterans Affairs, with over 108,000 veterans residing in the area. Travel times to the nearest VA hospital can exceed six hours, yet there is a high demand for services due to ongoing overseas deployments of Texas Armed Forces members. The Department of Veterans Affairs uses a Strategic Capital Investment Planning process to address gaps in services and develop solutions. Final approval of the priority list influences the annual budget request for the Department. Arturo \"Treto\" Garza, a Vietnam War veteran and former co-chairman of the Veterans Alliance of the Rio Grande Valley, passed away on October 3, 2012. His efforts led to the creation of the South Texas VA Health Care Center at Harlingen, which has now been redesignated as the \"Treto Garza South Texas Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care Center.\" The South Texas VA Health Care Center at Harlingen has been renamed as the \"Treto Garza South Texas Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care Center.\" The Secretary of Veterans Affairs is required to ensure that the facility includes a full-service inpatient health care facility and to expand its capabilities as needed. The Department's annual Strategic Capital Investment Plan will include a project to expand the Treto Garza South Texas Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care Center by adding inpatient capability for 50 beds, an urgent care center, and services for women veterans. The Secretary must report to Congress within 180 days with a plan to implement these requirements. In Far South Texas, the term includes specific counties in Texas. The requirements in subsection (c) must be implemented with cost and time estimates."
