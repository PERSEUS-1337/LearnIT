By optimizing priors in latent variable models, a lower bound on negative log likelihood can be derived. If changing the prior can enhance log likelihood, it is possible to adjust the likelihood function instead to achieve the same outcome. Rate-distortion theory is relevant for optimizing both priors and likelihood functions in latent variable modeling. By deriving quantities from rate-distortion theory, the usefulness in image modeling can be demonstrated. The statistician plans to use a latent variable model with known prior and likelihood functions, which are often parametrized. Designing these parametric families can be time-consuming but crucial in the modeling process. Parametric families are essential in latent variable modeling, but can be time-consuming to design. The article explores improving p(z) for fixed (x|z) and vice versa, aiming to help statisticians decide where to focus their efforts. By optimizing the average negative log likelihood of data, the study indirectly addresses the question of improving (x|z) for a given p(z). The paper discusses optimizing priors in latent variable models to improve model performance. BID14 proved that a lower bound can indicate how much the model can be enhanced by changing the prior, applicable to both discrete and continuous latent variable spaces. The lower bound in latent variable models can indicate how much the model can be improved by adjusting the prior, applicable to both discrete and continuous latent variable spaces. Lindsay (1983) derived these results without referencing earlier work on rate-distortion theory. The connection between lossy compression and latent variable modeling can be derived from rate-distortion theory. The optimal log likelihood in latent variable modeling can be seen as minimizing the variational free energy of a statistical system. Lindsay's result on the optimal prior in latent variable models is related to rate-distortion theory. The Information Bottleneck method, originating from rate-distortion theory, has led to significant advancements in research. BID1 established a connection between maximum likelihood and the information bottleneck method, showing their mathematical equivalence in certain cases. BID27 further studied this relationship in the context of a rate-distortion problem with a finite output alphabet and optimized test channel. Latent Variable Modeling is a form of representation learning that introduces a trade-off between rate and distortion in the neural network community. It is motivated by the Information Bottleneck method and the entropic risk measure, aiming to train autoencoders effectively. The article explores rate-distortion theory as a tool for developing a theory of representation learning, aiming to utilize tools from lossy compression in latent variable modeling. The goal is to establish a foundation for further research in this area. The article establishes a foundation for utilizing rate-distortion theory in representation learning by proving the equivalence between two fields using convexity arguments. It explores improving the likelihood function for a fixed prior and highlights the relevance of rate-distortion theory in this context. Through a change of variable argument, it shows that modifying the likelihood function can achieve the same result as modifying the prior. The text discusses how modifying the likelihood function can achieve the same result as modifying the prior in representation learning. It also explores the application of rate-distortion theory in improving a fixed prior and likelihood function. The article tests the derived lower bound and fundamental quantity in image modeling using Variational Autoencoders. The text discusses entropy, mutual information, and the fundamental lossless compression theorem of Shannon in the context of data reconstruction with rate-distortion theory. Shannon's idea of allowing losses in data reconstruction is explored in relation to compression techniques for independently, identically distributed data samples. Shannon introduced rate-distortion theory, involving a reconstruction alphabet Z and a distortion function to measure the cost of reproducing X with Z. The rate-distortion function determines the minimum bits per sample needed for compression within a fidelity D. This concept is essential for lossy source coding and compression techniques for data reconstruction. The theory of rate-distortion functions involves choosing a uniform distribution over a set of values and connecting it to the empirical distribution observed in training data. The distortion function in latent variable modeling is crucial, and optimization problems can be linked to Lagrangians. The prior optimization problem is shown to be an instance of rate-distortion theory in a theorem. The prior p(z) and Q Z|X play significant roles in latent variable modeling and rate-distortion theory. p(z) is the \"output marginal\" related to compressed output distribution, while Q Z|X is the \"test channel\" used in optimizing the ELBO. In variational autoencoders, Q Z|X is also known as the \"stochastic encoder\". Optimal prior and test channel in lossy compression are interconnected. The optimal prior and test channel in lossy compression are interconnected. The proof involves deriving an optimal prior for modeling from an optimal test channel. By setting p(z) as 1/NQ(z|x_i), the divergence term is eliminated, proving \"less than or equal\". The goal is to derive the lower bound (4) for negative log likelihood in latent variable modeling. Theorem 1 connects this to lower bounding a rate-distortion function, with mathematical tricks from information theory. The twist is applying these bounds to different optimization objects in latent variable modeling compared to information theory. The proof involves taking the infimum and minimum in the right hand side, completing the proof. The text discusses deriving a lower bound for negative log likelihood in latent variable modeling. Theorem 2 connects this to optimizing a rate-distortion function using mathematical tricks from information theory. The proof involves eliminating dependence on the optimal prior and considering a suboptimal prior. The lower bound on negative log likelihood in latent variable modeling is sharp, with the optimal prior achieving zero slackness in the bound. This is analogous to rate-distortion theory, where the variational problem dictates that the optimal prior must satisfy certain conditions. Even if the true model is unknown, the proposed model for the data typically yields favorable results in variational inference. When using variational inference, a lower bound to p(xi) can be evaluated exactly, leading to an upper bound on the gap sup z c(z). Increasing the number of samples in importance sampling can provide a tighter bound, approximating p(xi) closely. Assuming a simple prior distribution like a zero mean Gaussian random vector, the focus is on designing a good likelihood function (x|z). Can rate-distortion theory shed light on this setting? Assuming Z is an Euclidean space in dimension k, starting with a latent variable model (p(z), (x|z)), a better choice p(z) for the same (x|z) is noticed. A function g : Z \u2192 Z exists where Y = g(Z) follows p(y) if Z follows p(z). Examples include unit variance memoryless Gaussian vector for p(z) and Gaussian vector with correlation matrix for p(y), with a linear mapping g(z) transforming Z to Y. Another example is when both p(z) and p(y) are product distributions, where g(z) exists through probability integral transform. From the integral transform, it is deduced that a measurable function g(z) exists. The likelihood function can be improved if the lower bound in Theorem 2 shows slackness, indicating potential for enhancement with a fixed prior. The function can be improved with a fixed prior, even if the rate-distortion theory suggests no further improvement. Theoretical results in the article may have practical implications for image modeling problems by guiding the design of priors and likelihood functions. The methodology used to prevent overfitting in the modeling task involves training a model with checkpoints to store the best model found based on performance on a validation data set. Training continues until a certain number of epochs, after which the best model is used if no better model is found. This approach ensures a balance between model improvement and avoiding overfitting. The analysis tool focuses on the quantity c(z) to guide model improvement. If sup z log c(z) > 0, the negative log likelihood can be enhanced by adjusting the prior or likelihood function. If sup z log c(z) = 0, the prior cannot be further improved, but the likelihood function can still be enhanced. This quantity helps in modeling guidance. The quantity c(z) is used to guide model improvement. If sup z log c(z) > 0, adjusting the prior or likelihood function can enhance the negative log likelihood. If sup z log c(z) = 0, the prior cannot be further improved, but the likelihood function can still be enhanced. This helps in modeling guidance, especially when dealing with continuous latent spaces. The glossy statistics are computed to indicate the sub-optimality of the prior in generative modeling using lossy compression ideas. These statistics vary based on sampling methods and serve as a qualitative metric for the prior's optimality. In Variational Inference, a \"helper\" distribution Q(z|x) is introduced to optimize the ELBO lower bound of log likelihood. This distribution, also known as the \"encoder\" in variational autoencoder, aids in optimization and model improvement. The \"encoder\" distribution Q(z|x) in variational autoencoder helps map data samples to a latent space distribution. By setting z i as the mean of Q(z|x i ), we aim to find values of z where (x|z) is large. This approach provides estimates for glossy statistics in generative modeling. The authors extended the VampPrior article's source code to explore various prior and likelihood function combinations using image modeling datasets like Static MNIST, OMNIGLOT, Caltech 101 Silhouettes, Frey Faces, Histopathology, and CIFAR. The synthetic dataset illustrates the evolution of proposed statistics during model training with known latent variables. The authors extended their code to create samples from Z using the described strategy and computed the c(z) quantities. They used a zero mean, unit variance Gaussian prior and a variational mixture of posteriors prior parametric family. Different autoencoder architectures were employed, including a single stochastic layer VAE, a two stochastic layer HVAE, and a PixelHVAE. These models represent distinct likelihood function classes. The paper discusses different choices of priors and models for likelihood function classes, focusing on a prototypical setting with a Gaussian unit variance, zero mean prior and a simple likelihood function class. The dimension of the latent vector is 40 for both stochastic layers, and Adam BID9 is used as the optimization algorithm. The log test likelihood reported is obtained through importance sampling. The goal is to determine if the chosen priors and models can be improved. The modeling expert in the study analyzes the statistics in the data sets and concludes that the negative log likelihood can be improved by updating the prior or likelihood function. Improvements are observed in the negative log likelihood when either the prior or likelihood function is enhanced. The glossy statistics in the first row do not predict these improvements, but rather allow for them to occur. The statistics suggest that improving the negative log likelihood by enhancing the prior is becoming more challenging. A more complex prior class did not lead to an improvement in the negative log likelihood. Transforming the latent variable with an invertible transformation is unlikely to result in fruitful improvements. This pattern is observed in other data sets as well. The introduction of PixelHVAE in different data sets shows a significant reduction in statistics, particularly in Caltech 101. An interesting finding is the zero statistics for Histopathology, indicating the likelihood function ignores the latent variable. This serves as a cautionary tale that glossy statistics only indicate improvements for fixed likelihood functions or priors, highlighting the importance of understanding the interaction between likelihood and latent variables. The statistics reported in the study suggest that the information theoretically motivated quantity log c(z) and its associated glossy statistics can provide useful guidance in modeling tasks. Experimentation showed that changing the sampling process resulted in the same general conclusion. This highlights the importance of rate-distortion theory in model development. The article strongly argues for rate-distortion theory's inclusion in representation learning theory. It shows how classical latent variable modeling results stem from rate-distortion function computation. The article also discusses the application of lossy compression tools in latent variable modeling, emphasizing the importance of Shannon's source coding theorem. The research discusses the connection between rate-distortion theory and latent variable modeling, highlighting the potential for improving models by changing the likelihood function. The proof involves Lebesgue integrals and measurable functions. This work will be further explored in future research. The article explores using information theoretic methods to improve models by changing the likelihood function. It involves creating training and test data samples from a true latent variable model and showcasing proposed statistics. The model assumes a discrete latent alphabet and adds Bernoulli noise to binary pixels. The study involves adding Bernoulli noise to binary pixels of digits associated with a latent variable z. A data set with 50K training, 10K validation, and 10K test images was created following the MNIST structure. The test images have a true negative log likelihood score of 78.82. Experimental results on the synthetic data set are presented in Figure 1, showing the upper and lower bounds on negative log likelihood. The gap between the bounds decreases as epochs progress, approaching the true negative log likelihood. The glossy standard deviation and variance statistics are shown in Figure 1 for the synthetic data set. The gap between upper and lower bounds decreases as training progresses, indicating convergence. Improvements in the standard deviation statistic are also observed, although not as significant as the bounds."
