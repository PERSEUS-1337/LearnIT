The Congress recognizes the oceans and coastal areas of the United States as valuable resources contributing to economic growth, quality of life, and national security. Oceans play a crucial role in driving global and regional climate, impacting agriculture, fishing, and severe weather prediction. Maintaining leadership in oceanography is essential for wise ocean use and resource protection. Ocean research and education activities are conducted by Federal agencies, academic institutions, and industry with similar research requirements. The need for a formal mechanism to coordinate partnerships in ocean sciences and education to optimize the use of resources for the well-being of Americans. The National Oceanographic Partnership Program is established by the Secretary of Commerce to promote national goals of national security, economic development, quality of life, and science education through improved ocean knowledge. The program aims to coordinate and strengthen oceanographic efforts by forming partnerships among Federal agencies, academia, industry, and the oceanographic scientific community in data, resources, education, and communication, with annual reporting to Congress. The National Ocean Research Leadership Council is established to promote national goals of national security, economic development, quality of life, and science education through improved ocean knowledge. The National Ocean Research Leadership Council (Council) is established with members including the Administrator of NOAA, Secretary of the Navy, Director of NSF, Administrator of NASA, Deputy Secretary of Energy, Administrator of EPA, Commandant of the Coast Guard, Director of the Geological Survey, and Director of DARPA. The National Ocean Research Leadership Council includes various members such as the Director of DARPA, Director of the Minerals Management Service, Presidents of the National Academies, Director of the Office of Science and Technology, Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and representatives from ocean industries, State governments, and academia. The National Ocean Research Leadership Council appoints members to represent various views, with a two-year term of office. Initial appointments must be made by December 1, 1996. The Council's responsibilities include establishing the Ocean Research Partnership Coordinating Group. The National Ocean Research Leadership Council appoints members with a two-year term of office and establishes the Ocean Research Partnership Coordinating Group. The Council also creates the Ocean Research Advisory Panel and submits an annual report to Congress on the National Oceanographic Partnership Program. The report includes activities carried out in the previous fiscal year and outlines planned activities for the current fiscal year. The annual report to Congress on the National Oceanographic Partnership Program includes a summary of ongoing and upcoming projects, involvement with Federal coordinating entities, budget requests for the following fiscal year, and estimated expenditures. The first report must be submitted as required by the program. The first annual report under this subsection must be submitted to Congress by March 1, 1997, and should include information on the Ocean Research Advisory Panel established by the Council. SEC. 5.

The Chairman is appointed by the Council, and the group is responsible for implementing the National Oceanographic Partnership Program by prescribing policies, selecting partnership projects, and allocating funds based on specific criteria. The Ocean Research Partnership Coordinating Group, established by the Council, consists of members appointed from Federal departments with oceanographic research programs. The group is responsible for implementing the National Oceanographic Partnership Program by selecting partnership projects based on specific criteria such as addressing research objectives, broad participation, long-term commitment, shared resources, and peer review to promote participation in partnership projects by Federal departments and agencies involved in oceanographic research and development. The Coordinating Group oversees a partnership program office in the National Ocean Service to implement the National Oceanographic Partnership Program. This includes establishing working groups, managing peer reviews, and submitting annual reports to the Council. The Coordinating Group oversees the National Oceanographic Partnership Program, authorizing contracts and grants for partnership projects in various forms. An annual report on project status is submitted to the Council. The Coordinating Group oversees the National Oceanographic Partnership Program and submits an annual report on project status to the Council.
