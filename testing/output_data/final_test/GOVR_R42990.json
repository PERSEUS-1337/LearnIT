    "content": "The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA; P.L. 105-220) is the primary federal program supporting workforce development. It includes four main titles: Title I provides job training and services, Title II offers adult education and literacy, and Title III amends the Wagner-Peyser Act of 1933. Title III of the Workforce Investment Act integrates the U.S. Employment Service into the One-Stop system established by WIA, providing job search and matching assistance. The authorizations for appropriations for WIA programs expired in FY2003, leading to funding through the annual appropriations process. Reauthorization bills were passed in the 108th and 109th Congresses, but no further action was taken. In the 112th Congress, discussion drafts were released to amend and reauthorize WIA. In the 112th Congress, discussion drafts were released to amend and reauthorize the Workforce Investment Act (WIA). The House Committee on Education and the Workforce ordered reported H.R. 4297, the Workforce Investment Improvement Act of 2012, introduced by Representative Virginia Foxx. A legislative hearing was held, and the bill was considered with amendments before being ordered reported by the committee. No further action was taken on H.R. 4297 in the 112th Congress. In the 113th Congress, the House Committee on Education and the Workforce ordered reported H.R. 803, the SKILLS Act, introduced by Representative Virginia Foxx. The bill was debated, amended, and passed in the House of Representatives. This report summarizes the WIA titles and highlights major features of H.R. 803. It compares proposed provisions to current law in tables for Title I, Title II, and Title III. The One-Stop delivery system coordinates employment programs for adults, youth, and targeted subpopulations. Title III of WIA, known as the Wagner-Peyser Act of 1933, authorizes the Employment Service for job matching and search assistance. Title IV and Title V address amendments to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, focusing on employment services for individuals with disabilities. Title I establishes the One-Stop delivery system for coordinating state and local training and employment activities. Funding is provided for state formula grant programs and Job Corps. H.R. 803 consolidates multiple workforce development programs into a single block grant allocated to states by formula. It maintains the One-Stop delivery system for employment and training services while repealing 24 programs under WIA Title I and related legislation. H.R. 803 consolidates multiple workforce development programs into a single Workforce Investment Fund (WIF), reallocating funding from 19 programs. Key programs repealed include Youth Activities, Native American programs, Migrant and Seasonal Farmworker programs, and YouthBuild. Coordination with the WIA system is emphasized, with specific allocations for technical assistance, Native American employment, Job Corps, and national emergency/dislocated worker activities. H.R. 803 consolidates workforce development programs into the Workforce Investment Fund (WIF), reallocating funding from 19 programs. States would receive funding based on a new formula considering unemployment, labor force, long-term unemployment, and youth poverty. States would initially receive 100% of their previous funding share, decreasing to no less than 90% in later years. States must set aside up to 15% of funds for statewide activities like rapid response and grants for individuals with barriers to employment. H.R. 803 changes the composition and majority requirements of state and local Workforce Investment Boards (WIBs), making business representatives the only required members and two-thirds of the membership must be comprised of business representatives. It also requires local WIBs to reserve a percentage of funds for training activities and expands the requirements for state and local plans to serve various subpopulations' employment and training needs. H.R. 803 expands the scope of state and local plans to serve various subpopulations' employment and training needs, including at-risk youth, disabled workers, ex-offenders, Native Americans, and veterans. It allows governors to propose consolidating funds into the Workforce Investment Fund, subject to approval. H.R. 803 allows governors to propose consolidating funding for employment and training into the Workforce Investment Fund. It combines core and intensive services into a new category called \"work ready services\" and eliminates the priority of service for low-income individuals. Additionally, it allows individuals to be eligible for training after an interview or assessment without needing to go through work ready services. H.R. 803 adds incumbent worker training as an allowable local activity and requires each local area to hire a \"veteran employment specialist\" with a preference for disabled or other veterans. The Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA) supports basic education for out-of-school adults through formula grants to states for subgranting to local centers. The SKILLS Act reauthorizes the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA) from FY2014 through FY2020 with administrative changes and aligns accountability measures with standardized measures. It authorizes $606,294,933 per year, reduces the set-aside for national programs to 2%, and maintains state grant distribution formulas and matching requirements. The SKILLS Act reauthorizes the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act with administrative changes, aligns accountability measures with standardized measures, reduces the duration of state plans from five years to three years, increases the scope of required plans, updates language, and makes minor changes to state and local activities. It also replaces considerations for awarding local grants with measurable goals for local grantees to demonstrate. The Act\u2014Workforce Investment-Related Activities\u2014amends the Wagner-Peyser Act of 1933, authorizing the Employment Service (ES) as a central component of One-Stop delivery systems. ES facilitates matching job seekers with employers and provides labor market information. H.R. 803 repeals Sections 1-14 of the Wagner-Peyser Act, consolidating ES funding into the Workforce Investment Fund. The Rehabilitation Act consolidates funds from the ES into the Workforce Investment Fund to support programs for individuals with disabilities. The SKILLS Act authorizes VR state grants and other programs under the Rehabilitation Act, aligning performance indicators with standardized metrics. The VR State Grants program is mandatory spending, with an annual authorization of $3,121,712,000 from FY2014 through FY2020. Funding is determined by a formula. The SKILLS Act emphasizes transitional services for students with disabilities, requiring states to allocate 10% of VR state grant funds for this purpose. It also mandates coordination between VR services and transition services for individuals aged 16-21. Funding for the VR State Grants program is determined by a formula in the Rehabilitation Act, which provides an annual inflationary increase. The SKILLS Act authorizes funding for grant programs administered by the Department of Education, including NIDRR grants at $109 million per year. It also extends authorization for the National Council on Disability and the Access Board through FY2020. The Act repeals the Supported Employment State Grants program. The SKILLS Act authorizes funding for grant programs administered by the Department of Education, including NIDRR grants at $109 million per year. It also extends authorization for the National Council on Disability and the Access Board through FY2020. The Act repeals the Supported Employment State Grants program. Additionally, a program with a $29 million appropriation in FY2012 is repealed, and its functions are absorbed by VR state agencies. Three competitive grant programs, two of which were unfunded in FY2012, are also repealed."
