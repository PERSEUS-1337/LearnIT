It started as a revolving fund from land and water sales, now includes proceeds from power generation and mineral leasing. Balances have grown significantly since the 1990s, reaching over $9.6 billion by FY2011. Without increased appropriations or redirection of receipts, the fund balance is expected to keep increasing. This report offers background on the fund's history, deposits, and trends. The Reclamation Fund, established in 1902 within the US Treasury for irrigation development in western states, receives proceeds from land sales. The fund's balance has grown significantly, reaching over $9.6 billion by FY2011. This report provides a brief history of the fund, trends in deposits, and issues related to using the surplus balance for other purposes. The Reclamation Fund, established in 1902 for irrigation development in western states, funded projects without further appropriation by Congress. The fund balance grew to $68 million by 1910, but borrowing from the U.S. Treasury was necessary due to inadequate income and repayments. The Reclamation Fund, established in 1902 for irrigation development in western states, funded projects without further appropriation by Congress. Funds were borrowed from the U.S. Treasury to carry on the authorized construction program. Congress authorized advances of $20 million in 1910 and $5 million in 1931 from the General Fund. These funds were reimbursed in 1938 under the Hayden-O'Mahoney Amendment. By the late 1920s, Congress directed the General Fund to finance some of Reclamation's largest construction projects. By the late 1930s, major Reclamation projects were financed by the General Fund of the Treasury, including the construction of Hoover Dam. In the 1950s and 1960s, other large projects like Glen Canyon Dam and the Central Arizona Project were also supported by the General Fund. The Reclamation Fund, originally meant to be a revolving fund, proved impractical over time due to project repayment and land sale proceeds. The Reclamation Fund, initially funded by the sale of public lands, was recognized as inadequate by Congress in 1910. By 1914, it became subject to annual appropriations and received additional revenue from water and power uses, as well as sales of federal lands and resources. Natural resource royalties and power revenues have been the main sources of income for the fund, with royalties initiated in the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920. The Reclamation Fund receives 40% of royalty payments from oil, gas, coal, and other minerals on federal lands, which are its main revenue sources. Hydropower receipts were added in 1938 through the Hayden-O'Mahoney Amendment. Water contract sales authorized in 1920 also contribute significantly to the fund. The Reclamation Fund, authorized by Congress in 1920, receives revenue from various sources including royalties from federal lands and water contract sales. Funds are appropriated for different accounts like the Bureau of Reclamation's Water and Related Resource account and the Western Area Power Administration's Construction account. Funds are only available for authorized projects, with appropriations typically provided in annual Energy & Water Development Appropriation bills. The Reclamation Fund, established in 1920, saw stable balances until the 1990s. From the mid-1990s, revenues from power sales and royalties exceeded appropriations, leading to significant balance growth. Receipts consistently surpassed appropriations by over $100 million annually since FY1994, reaching over $10.8 billion by FY2012. The only exception was in FY2009 when ARRA allocated funds from the Reclamation Fund. From 1990 to 2010, receipts deposited into the Reclamation Fund mainly came from natural resource royalties and hydropower revenues, accounting for the majority of incoming funds. On average, 87% of the fund's receipts came from these two sources, increasing to 91% from 2006 to 2011. Limited data is available on the state sources of these receipts. Mineral royalties made up approximately 79% of all receipts in recent years. The Reclamation Fund receives most of its revenues from mineral royalties and power generation, with the majority coming from five western states. Calls have been made to use the increasing fund balance for new purposes or to supplement existing expenditures. Congress could potentially increase appropriations from the Reclamation Fund for projects, but this would compete with other allocations. Alternatively, a dedicated revenue stream from the fund could be used for specific projects, with or without additional funding. PAYGO requirements may require spending offsets for these changes. Some argue that the fund should be used for its intended purpose of water resource projects in western states, while others may suggest different uses for the fund. Some argue for redirecting surplus balances from the Reclamation Fund to debt reduction or other state needs, citing unforeseen increases in mineral receipts. Congress faced challenges in dedicating fund balances for specific purposes, as seen in the 2009 Omnibus Lands Act. The law established a new fund of up to $120 million annually between FY2020 and FY2034 for rural water projects, without requiring further appropriation. A Senate bill proposes a similar fund receiving $80 million per year, with some funding redirected to projects over the next 10 years."
