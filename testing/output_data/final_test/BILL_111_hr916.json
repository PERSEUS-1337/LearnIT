The American Board of Preventive Medicine defines preventive medicine as focusing on the health of individuals and populations to prevent disease and promote well-being. Specialists in preventive medicine are trained in clinical medicine and public health to reduce risks of disease and disability. Preventive medicine includes clinical services like screening and health counseling for various health conditions. Preventive medicine focuses on immunization for various health conditions, including diabetes and heart disease. It is the only medical specialty that combines training in clinical medicine and public health. Preventive medicine doctors often work in public health roles at State, local, and Federal Government agencies. In the workplace, preventive medicine doctors in occupational medicine deal with illnesses and injuries in workplace populations through worker protection, health promotion, hazard control, business continuity, and medical management. There is a shortage of doctors in the public health field, with many nearing retirement. The demand for public health professionals is growing rapidly, with many physicians nearing retirement.
