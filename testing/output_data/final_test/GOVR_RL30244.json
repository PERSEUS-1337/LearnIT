    "content": "The primary function of standing committees in the House of Representatives is to evaluate bills and resolutions introduced by Members. This process involves initial screening, public hearings, and markup meetings where amendments are proposed and voted on before recommending legislative action to the House. The House committees evaluate bills and resolutions through initial screening, public hearings, and markup meetings where amendments are proposed and voted on before recommending legislative action to the House. The markup stage focuses on selecting text, proposing and debating amendments, voting procedures, and ordering the marked-up text reported back to the House for consideration. The markup process in House committees reflects rules and practices governing the amending process on the House floor. The House committees follow rules and practices for amending bills and resolutions during the markup process. Committee rules may differ from House rules, leading to ambiguity in the application of procedures for debate and amendments. The House's standing committees are given guidance on how to conduct markups, with some discretion in setting their own rules. Committee markups are less formal than House floor sessions, allowing for more efficient decision-making. The House Parliamentarian does not attend committee markups, giving committees more freedom in their proceedings. House committees have discretion in conducting markup meetings, with some committees following formal rules while others have informal practices. The House Parliamentarian does not attend markups, allowing committees to rely on their own judgment. Not all committees follow the expected markup procedures at all times. The report discusses markup procedures followed by House committees, including informal practices and tactical alternatives. It may not cover every variation in committee practices, and readers should not expect it to align with all markup meetings they have observed. Committees have the discretion to choose the text for markup, typically selecting from bills introduced by Members or the House Parliamentarian. The House committees have the discretion to choose the text for markup, which can include bills introduced by Members or referred by the House Parliamentarian. The committee may mark up a draft bill that has not been formally introduced, with the chair directing the committee's staff to prepare the draft reflecting their policy preferences. This draft bill, also known as a staff draft or chair's mark, serves as the starting point for the markup process. The committee selects the base text for markup, which serves as the framework for policy debates. Amendments can be proposed to the base text during markup, requiring proponents to convince a majority of committee members to vote for the changes. The committee chair has the authority to select the text for markup, which must be made publicly available 24 hours before the meeting. This power is derived from the authority to schedule meetings and set agendas. House Rule XI allows committees to establish regular monthly meeting days for conducting business, including marking up legislation. The chair has the authority to decide the agenda for each meeting and can cancel meetings as needed. Additionally, the chair can call special meetings to consider bills or other committee business, with prior notice required. House Rule XI allows committees to establish regular monthly meeting days for conducting business, including marking up legislation. The chair must give prior notice before scheduling a meeting, with specific rules on when a meeting can commence. The committee chair has the authority to schedule meetings and select matters for consideration, with the option for committee members to object using specific mechanisms. When a matter is placed on a committee's agenda for a meeting, a member can request a vote on whether to consider it by raising the question of consideration. If a majority votes against considering the matter, the committee does not proceed with it. This process allows committee members to prevent action on certain matters. When a matter is placed on a committee's agenda, members can prevent action by raising the question of consideration. The chair's agenda decisions typically align with the majority party's interests, making it unlikely for the committee to block consideration of a measure. Control of the agenda is crucial for the majority party's powers in the House. Committee members can request a special meeting if the chair fails to schedule legislation markups. If the chair does not call the meeting within three days, and it does not happen within seven days, a majority of the committee can force a meeting for that specific purpose. This allows committee members to take control of the agenda away from the chair. The rule allowing committee members to request a special meeting to mark up legislation has rarely been formally invoked since 1970. It is expected to be used by the committee's minority, possibly with some majority party members, to challenge the chair's control over the agenda. The threat of invoking this rule may pressure chairs to schedule markups they would prefer to avoid. Committee chairs have effective control over scheduling markups, but their decisions can be overridden by the majority party. Minority party members have limited recourse when they object to the agenda set by the chair. The House committee markup process is governed by ambiguous rules that require committees to adopt written rules consistent with House rules. However, there are challenges in interpreting these rules, as they lack criteria to judge consistency and do not specify which House rules apply to committees. The House committee markup process is governed by ambiguous rules that require committees to adopt written rules consistent with House rules. However, challenges arise in interpreting these rules as they do not define which House rules are applicable to committees and subcommittees. The House Parliamentarian provides guidance on the procedures applicable in committees, with some exceptions noted. The House may use procedures known as \"Committee of the Whole\" to consider measures on the floor, combining elements of House and Committee of the Whole procedures. When a standing committee begins a markup, the text to be considered is read in full and then considered for amendment section by section. Amendments must be in writing and can be offered before the next section is read. When a standing committee begins a markup, the text to be considered is read in full and then considered for amendment section by section. Each amendment must be in writing and is to be read before debate on it begins. An amendment may be withdrawn without the need for unanimous consent unless the committee has acted on it. Committee members may speak on the bill and amendments under a five-minute rule. Members may vote to close the debate or order the previous question on a pending amendment or the entire bill. Both motions are decided by a simple majority vote. During a committee markup meeting, the chair announces the matters to be considered and the presence of a quorum. The committee proceeds to consider the bill section by section, with each written amendment read before debate. Members can speak for five minutes on the bill and amendments. They can vote to close debate or order the previous question, both decided by a simple majority vote. The House rules do not specifically outline these procedures, but standing committees typically follow them unless agreed otherwise by unanimous consent. During a committee markup meeting, the chair announces the matters to be considered and the presence of a quorum. The committee proceeds to consider the bill section by section, with each written amendment read before debate. Members can speak for five minutes on the bill and amendments. They can vote to close debate or order the previous question, both decided by a simple majority vote. House rules do not specifically outline these procedures, but standing committees typically follow them unless agreed otherwise by unanimous consent. The committee clerk may read the entire text of the bill, but this is usually waived by unanimous consent. If unanimous consent cannot be obtained, a committee member may move to waive the first reading of a bill or resolution. Clause 1(a)(1)(B) of House Rule XI provides for a privileged and non-debatable motion to waive this first reading in committee or subcommittee if printed copies of the measure are available. During a committee markup meeting, the chair announces the matters to be considered and the presence of a quorum. Members can speak for five minutes on the bill and amendments, with the chair recognizing them in order of seniority or arrival. Chairs may allot more time for opening statements, and members can yield to colleagues or request additional time. During committee markup meetings, chairs may allot more time for opening statements, but rules do not guarantee this right. Chairs typically reserve the right to limit the number or length of opening statements, often only recognizing themselves and the ranking minority member. Other members may submit their statements in writing for the record. During committee markup meetings, chairs may allow opening statements, but transcripts are rarely published. The chair's authority to permit or restrict opening statements is clearer before the bill is considered. Opening statements can be seen as debate under the five-minute rule after the bill's presentation. During committee markup meetings, the committee entertains, debates, and votes on amendments to recommend to the House for adoption. Only the House has the authority to change the text of bills introduced by Members. The amending process in committee is similar to the process in the House floor's Committee of the Whole. Members offer amendments to each section of the bill in sequence unless the committee agrees. Members offer amendments to each section of the bill in sequence unless the committee agrees otherwise by unanimous consent. The chair directs the clerk to read the first section of the bill, and members may propose amendments to that section only. This process is repeated for each section until the committee has voted on the last amendment. Some committees may use an informal system for prioritizing amendments. When the chair first calls up the bill for consideration, unanimous consent is often requested for each section to be considered as read. This is to delay proceedings and allows for amendments to be proposed in sequence. Larger bills may be divided into titles, chapters, and sections, with the option for amendments to be proposed to any part of the title or chapter. Members can propose amendments to any part of the title or chapter, not just one section at a time, saving time and allowing for a comprehensive review. The chair may request unanimous consent for the entire bill to be considered as read and open to amendment at any point, which can be confusing for long and complex bills with many amendments. When there are few amendments to consider, opening a bill for amendment can save time without causing confusion. Committees usually agree to unanimous consent requests made by the chair, but objections can prevent the bill from being opened for amendment. It is not allowed to waive the reading of any section or move to expedite the process. Non-debatable motions can be made to dispense with the first reading of a bill at the beginning of markup, but motions to expedite or change the reading process are not permitted. During bill markup, the chair gives priority to subcommittee-approved amendments for each section. Senior party members are recognized first to offer amendments, followed by minority party members in order of seniority. Chairs are not required to follow specific recognition practices and may offer amendments themselves. Members can offer amendments in committee, which must be germane and meet certain requirements. Amendments on matters outside the committee's jurisdiction are likely to violate the germaneness requirement. The process for making points of order against amendments is discussed below. House Rule XVI, clause 6, allows four kinds of amendments on the floor. House Rule XVI, clause 6, allows four types of amendments on the floor: a first-degree amendment to change the text being marked up, a second-degree perfecting amendment to that amendment, a substitute to replace the entire text of the first-degree amendment, and an amendment to the substitute. The order in which members vote on these amendments is specified by the rule. An amendment in the nature of a substitute is only allowed at the beginning or end of the amending process, often used tactically by the chair or a member. The markup process for amendments in committees requires written amendments to be provided before debate can begin. Members can draft amendments in advance with assistance from the House's Office of Legislative Counsel, but it is not mandatory. Committee staff prefer to receive copies of amendments before the markup starts, although some members choose not to do so. Once an amendment is offered, the clerk must read it aloud before debate can commence. During the markup process in committees, written amendments must be provided before debate can start. The sponsor may request to skip the reading of the amendment, but if there is an objection, it must be read in full. Members can request a full reading to prolong the proceedings. Amendments are debated under the five-minute rule, with the sponsor and opponent each given five minutes to speak. During committee markups, members are recognized to speak for or against amendments, with each member allowed five minutes. After 10 minutes of debate on an amendment, a member can offer an amendment to the pending one. Recognition practices follow conventional rules, alternating between majority and minority party members. During committee markups, members are recognized to speak for or against amendments, with each member allowed five minutes. Chairs follow conventional rules, alternating between majority and minority party members, and giving preference based on seniority. Green, yellow, and red lights indicate time remaining for speakers. Members can ask for additional time with unanimous consent and may yield their time to others. Decorum rules in debate apply in committees as on the floor. During committee markups, members are recognized to speak for or against amendments, with each member allowed five minutes. Chairs follow conventional rules, alternating between majority and minority party members, and giving preference based on seniority. Green, yellow, and red lights indicate time remaining for speakers. Members can ask for additional time with unanimous consent and may yield their time to others. Decorum rules in debate apply in committees as on the floor. Representative White is not required to yield, and may decide not to do so if he has much to say, does not expect to agree with Representative Black, or finds the request disruptive. If Representative White yields to Representative Black, the latter speaks on the former's time. Representative White may not yield for a specific period, only choosing to yield or decline. If he yields, he can reclaim his time at any point. During committee markups, chairs and amendment sponsors may signal the need to vote on pending amendments or questions. If signals are ineffective, members can use non-debatable motions to conclude debates. These motions include the motion to order the previous question and the motion to close. The motion to order the previous question during markup aims to stop debate and block amendments. If agreed upon by majority vote, the committee proceeds to vote on the amendment without further debate or additional amendments. During markup, a member may move on a pending amendment or the entire bill for amendment. The previous question cannot be moved on a section open for amendment to allow minority party members to offer their amendments. If unanimous consent is given, the bill can be considered as read and open to amendment at any point, allowing for expedited completion of the markup. The motion to close debate can be used to force votes on each pending amendment or section of the bill. It can be moved on the pending amendment, section, title, chapter, or entire text of the bill. The committee can vote to close debate on a section but cannot order the previous question on it. The effect of the motion to close debate is more limited compared to the previous question. The motion to close debate brings a debate to an end without affecting members' rights to offer amendments. It can be proposed immediately, at a certain time, or after a period of additional debate. Members can still offer amendments but cannot take time to explain them. Members tend to move the previous question more often than closing debate when both motions are in order. Members often move to close debate when both motions are in order, especially on pending amendments or bills. The majority party can use special rules to limit floor amendments and control the amendments that can be offered. The majority party can control the consideration of amendments in Committee of the Whole using special rules, but during committee markups, there is no equivalent to the Rules Committee. Minority members can insist on marking up a bill section by section and offer amendments with roll call votes. The committee majority cannot preclude consideration of certain amendments that comply with House rules. During committee markups, the majority party can gain control by offering a complete substitute amendment, blocking the minority from offering amendments to the bill section by section. During committee markups, the majority party can gain control by offering a complete substitute amendment, blocking the minority from offering amendments to the bill section by section. The substitute can be agreed upon without further debate or amendment, effectively amending the entire bill and ending the amending process. This gives the majority more control over the length of the markup, but there are potential disadvantages to this approach. During committee markups, the majority party can gain control by offering a complete substitute amendment, limiting the minority's ability to offer amendments. However, there are drawbacks to this approach, as any member can demand the substitute be read in full, leading to time-consuming processes. Additionally, the majority's advantage in using the amendment process is restricted when facing second-degree perfecting amendments from the minority. During committee markups, the majority party can control by offering a complete substitute amendment, limiting the minority's ability to offer amendments. Second-degree amendments cannot be amended, but committees may employ various motions during markups, such as adjourn, table, postpone, and reconsider. Chairs can declare recesses for breaks and to allow Members to participate in votes. During committee markups, motions like tabling and reconsidering amendments are used. The motion to table is rarely used to dispose of amendments as it can kill the entire bill. The motion to reconsider is used when members believe they lost a vote due to absent committee members. If a majority votes for reconsideration, the committee can vote again on the amendment. During committee markups, motions like tabling and reconsidering amendments are used. The committee may dispose of a motion to reconsider by voting to table it. Each motion must be in writing, but this is not always enforced, especially for routine motions. Different quorum requirements govern committee markups, with a majority required for ordering a measure reported. Other votes and proceedings during a markup may have different quorum rules set by the committee. During committee markups, motions like tabling and reconsidering amendments are used. Most committees may set their own quorum requirement, typically one-third of the members. It is easier in committee than on the House floor to demand a quorum. Any member recognized by the chair can point out the absence of a quorum, prompting a count by the chair. If a quorum is present, business resumes; if not, a quorum call is initiated. During committee meetings, questions can be decided by voice, division, or record votes. The chair asks for \"Aye\" or \"No\" responses, then announces the apparent outcome. A division vote can be requested if there is disagreement, followed by a roll call vote if needed. During committee meetings, questions can be decided by voice, division, or record votes. A roll call vote can be requested if needed, with the chair directing the clerk to call the roll and tally the vote. Committees have the authority to adopt rules for obtaining roll call votes. House committees have the authority to postpone roll call votes to accommodate absent members who want to be recorded as having voted. Chairs may delay the vote or reporting of the tally to allow members to cast their votes. Committee staff ensure all members are present for the final vote in markup. The House's ban on proxy voting in committee since 1995 has led to a premium on maximizing attendance for roll call votes. With the absence of only one or two majority party members, the minority party can prevail on a party-line vote if all their members are present. It is crucial for as many members as possible to attend committee meetings. Since 1995, the House has banned proxy voting in committees, emphasizing the importance of maximizing member attendance for roll call votes. Committee staff should ensure absent members are contacted promptly during votes. House rules mandate that results of roll call votes in committees be available to the public electronically within 48 hours. Committee chairs play a crucial role in overseeing markups, participating in debates, and maintaining order during proceedings. They are responsible for ensuring proper decorum and enforcing procedures, including declining to recognize members who violate rules. Committee members must protect their rights by raising points of order when necessary. Additionally, amendments must be made publicly available in electronic form within 24 hours of approval. Committee members must protect their rights by raising points of order when appropriate. To do so, they address the chair, explain the violation, and allow for debate before the chair makes a ruling. The chair bases rulings on proper procedure, with advice from senior committee staff. The House Parliamentarian does not attend meetings but committee staff can seek guidance from them. Committee members can challenge the chair's ruling by appealing to the committee, which can be debated under the five-minute rule. During committee markups, members can make non-debatable motions to end debate on an appeal, such as moving the previous question or to table the appeal. If the committee votes to table an appeal, the ruling of the chair stands. Points of order are commonly raised against amendments, but must be made at the proper moment before debate begins. Once the proponent of an amendment starts explaining it, a point of order cannot be made against it. This can be a challenge in informal committee markups. During committee markups, members sometimes reserve points of order against amendments as soon as they are offered to avoid issues with timing and debate. This allows the sponsor to explain and defend the amendment while other members review it and decide on any points of order. During committee markups, members may reserve points of order against amendments to avoid timing and debate issues. The member who reserved the point of order can make it or withdraw the reservation to continue the debate. If uncertain about procedures, a committee member can address the chair with a parliamentary inquiry, which must be about procedure, not the substance of the bill. The chair usually entertains parliamentary inquiries unless repetitive or dilatory. The chair's reply is not appealable as it is an explanation, not a ruling. Committee members cannot raise points of information or clarification as they do not exist in House procedures. The House Parliamentarian has stated that committee procedures are generally final unless reversed by a majority vote. Points of order against defective committee procedures prior to a bill being reported to the House are not typically allowed. Each committee is responsible for enforcing its own markup procedures. The House Parliamentarian has stated that committee procedures are generally final unless reversed by a majority vote. Committees do not have the authority to change the text of a bill referred to them, they only vote on recommended amendments. Markups may start with an amendment in the nature of a substitute offered by the chair. During markups, committees offer amendments to a complete substitute rather than the underlying bill. The final vote is on agreeing to the substitute amendment, which may have been amended. The committee then reports the bill with only one substitute amendment, even if multiple amendments were adopted. The markup concludes with a motion to report the bill to the House with adopted amendments for approval. The House committee reports the bill with recommended amendments after completing a markup session. The bill is then printed with the committee's actions and amendments, listed on the Union or House Calendar based on its impact on funds or revenues. The committee can choose to report the bill with amendments, such as H.R. 1, to the House for approval. The committee may vote to order H.R. 1 reported with one or more amendments, including a substitute amendment, or separate amendments affecting different provisions of the bill. Incorporating amendments into a single substitute is more convenient for the House when considering the bill on the floor. The committee may choose to report a clean bill instead of H.R. 1 with multiple amendments. A clean bill is a new bill with a new number that includes all amendments adopted during the markup of H.R. 1. The committee may report a clean bill instead of H.R. 1 with amendments adopted during markup. This new bill incorporates all proposed changes into a single text, typically done when the original sponsor finds the amendments unacceptable. The committee may choose to report a clean bill instead of H.R. 1 with amendments, especially if the original sponsor finds the amendments unacceptable. The clean bill must be prepared, introduced, numbered, and referred back to the committee before they can act on it. Committees have sometimes expedited this process by authorizing the chair to report the clean bill immediately after markup. After completing markup, the committee authorized the chair to report a clean bill. The official records did not specify if the bill was introduced before or after markup. The ranking minority member can request to include their views in the committee's report. When a member needs to file views on a report to the House, they have additional time to do so. The House may create a conference committee with the Senate to negotiate bill compromises. If unanimous consent is not obtained, a special rule or motion can be used to proceed. House committees can request a conference with the Senate on bills, with the chair needing authorization to make the motion on the House floor. Some committees have blanket authorization for their chairs to make such motions. If not, the committee must agree to authorize the chair. The committee must authorize the chair to make the motion necessary to go to conference with each bill or resolution. The vote in committee on this motion requires a majority to be present, as does the vote to order the bill reported back to the House. By adopting the motion at the same meeting as the bill markup, the committee avoids the need for another meeting when arranging for the conference with the Senate."
