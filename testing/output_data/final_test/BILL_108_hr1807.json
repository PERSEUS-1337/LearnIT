    "content": "The Trade Adjustment Assistance for Self-Employment Act of 2003, also known as the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program, establishes a demonstration project for self-employment training and assistance. This project aims to provide support for individuals seeking self-employment opportunities. The Trade Adjustment Assistance for Self-Employment Act of 2003 establishes an alternative program for workers providing self-employment training and start-up cost assistance. The Trade Adjustment Assistance for Self-Employment Act of 2003 offers self-employment training and start-up cost assistance to workers who complete the program successfully. Eligibility is determined based on a petition filed under section 221. The Secretary determines individual worker eligibility for the alternative trade adjustment assistance program by a specified date. Eligible workers can receive benefits if covered by a certification, submit a self-employment business plan, and are likely to obtain self-employment. Eligible workers under the alternative trade adjustment assistance program must submit a self-employment business plan and are expected to engage in full-time self-employment within 26 weeks of separation from their previous job. Payments for training and start-up costs are capped at $2,500 per worker during a 2-year period. Payments to workers under the program are limited to $10,000 per worker over a 2-year period. Workers receiving payments from the program are not eligible for other benefits. State payments under the program cannot exceed 5 years after implementation, with exceptions for workers already receiving payments. The program provides payments to workers meeting specific criteria, with a limit of $10,000 over 2 years. State payments cannot exceed 5 years post-implementation. Self-employment training includes entrepreneurial activities approved by the appropriate agencies. The Trade Act of 1974 is amended to include information on a demonstration project for self-employment training and assistance under section 246A."
