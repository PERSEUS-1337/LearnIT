    "content": "The \"Pacific Northwest Earthquake Preparedness Act of 2017\" defines the Cascadia Subduction Zone as a fault line separating the Juan de Fuca and North America plates along the western coast of the United States. The Act also establishes an Earthquake Early Warning System for the Cascadia Subduction Zone. The Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency is required to develop a plan and secure funding for an earthquake early warning system for the Cascadia Subduction Zone. Within 90 days of the Act's enactment, the Administrator must submit the plan to Congress. Additionally, a report summarizing the plan's implementation must be submitted to Congress within one year. The term \"appropriate committees of Congress\" refers to specific committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate. The term \"earthquake early warning system\" includes improvements to networks and infrastructure for early earthquake detection. SEC. 3. EARTHQUAKE AND TSUNAMI TASK FORCE. The President shall establish an Earthquake and Tsunami Task Force to develop a strategy for preparing, mitigating, responding to, and recovering from events in the Cascadia Subduction Zone. The Task Force will include experts from federal agencies, Oregon, Washington, California, Indian tribes, local governments, private sector, and academia. The Earthquake and Tsunami Task Force will be chaired by the Administrator and will include detailed employees to assist in developing a comprehensive strategy for coordinating federal agencies to prepare for events in the Cascadia Subduction Zone. The Earthquake and Tsunami Task Force, chaired by the Administrator, will coordinate federal agencies for events in the Cascadia Subduction Zone. A strategy will ensure collaboration between various departments for needs assessment, strategic planning, and retrofitting critical assets to withstand and save lives during and after a covered event. A strategy will assist in developing and implementing a coordinated plan for preparing, mitigating, responding to, recovering from, and adapting to the impacts of a covered event in the Cascadia Subduction Zone. It will also link existing statewide mitigation plans with this comprehensive strategy. The comprehensive strategy includes examining the feasibility of acquiring earthquake insurance by the public sector, private sector, and individuals, identifying funding opportunities, addressing barriers to funding, and outlining the role of Federal agencies in implementation. The strategy includes collaborating with governments on mitigation alternatives for critical infrastructure, assisting in developing recovery plans for the Cascadia Subduction Zone, and identifying steps for an earthquake early warning system. An evaluation of offshore earthquake early warning systems and recommendations for a system suitable for the Cascadia Subduction Zone, including operational guidelines and government roles and responsibilities. The Task Force will develop recommendations for integrating an earthquake early warning system into public alert systems, including mobile technologies. Recommendations will cover administrative and legislative changes, funding requirements, and the order of priority for implementation. Collaboration with the National Academies is also required. The Task Force will collaborate with the National Academies to develop recommendations for a Federal research strategy on Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake and tsunami preparedness, covering geologic conditions, early warning systems, environmental impacts, and social factors for disaster preparedness. The Task Force will collaborate with the National Academies to develop recommendations for a Federal research strategy on disaster preparedness and response, including cost-effective mitigation alternatives for infrastructure, strategic planning for network robustness, and tools for communities to invest resources effectively. A report outlining the comprehensive strategy will be submitted to relevant committees within 18 months of the Act's enactment. The definitions in this section include the meaning of \"Administrator\" as the head of FEMA, \"covered event\" as an earthquake, tsunami, or both, and \"Task Force\" as the interagency group established under subsection (a). The Administrator of FEMA is responsible for national efforts to reduce loss from earthquakes and tsunamis by preparing, planning, mitigating, responding to, recovering from, and adapting to such events. Additionally, there are additional hazard mitigation activities. The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act is amended to allow recipients of hazard mitigation assistance to conduct activities to reduce the risk of future damage from earthquake hazards, including improvements to seismic and geodetic networks for earthquake early warning capabilities. The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act was passed by the House of Representatives on March 27, 2017."
