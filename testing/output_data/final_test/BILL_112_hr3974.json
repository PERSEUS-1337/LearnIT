    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Smarter Approach to Nuclear Expenditures Act\" and includes findings. Congress finds that the nature of threats to national security has changed since the end of the Cold War. The United States still maintains a large nuclear arsenal, including approximately 5,000 warheads deployed across different delivery systems. The United States maintains a large nuclear arsenal, including 450 intercontinental ballistic missiles and 14 Ohio-class submarines armed with up to 96 nuclear warheads each. However, the cost of maintaining this Cold War-based approach is significant, with hundreds of billions of dollars to be spent over the next 10 years. It is suggested that reducing the nuclear arsenal would be prudent for both the budget and national security, as it can still serve the country's interests by decreasing the number of deployed warheads and delivery systems. The United States is urged to reduce its nuclear arsenal to no more than 1,000 warheads for national security and economic reasons. Admiral Mike Mullen emphasizes that the national debt is a significant threat to national security. The Government Accountability Office has identified significant waste in nuclear construction projects. Significant waste is found in the construction of nuclear facilities for the National Nuclear Security Administration of the Department of Energy. Reduction in nuclear forces is addressed in Section 3. Prohibition on arming B-2 and B-52 aircraft with nuclear weapons and on developing new long-range penetrating bomber aircraft or F-35 nuclear missions for fiscal years 2013 through 2023. The funds for the Department of Defense or Energy in fiscal year 2013 onwards cannot be used for making the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter capable of carrying nuclear weapons. Additionally, funds cannot be used for the B61 or W78 life extension programs. Beginning in fiscal year 2013, the Navy's forces will be limited to eight operational ballistic-missile submarines for deployment. Funds cannot be used for the procurement of SSBN-X submarines for fiscal years 2013 through 2023, and no more than eight such submarines can be procured from fiscal year 2024 onwards. Additionally, there will be a reduction in the number of ICBMs. The Department of Defense is restricted from maintaining more than 200 intercontinental ballistic missiles and 250 submarine-launched ballistic missiles starting from fiscal year 2013. Additionally, no new funds can be used for the procurement of SSBN-X submarines. The Department of Defense is prohibited from using funds for the research, development, or procurement of new intercontinental ballistic missiles. Additionally, funds cannot be used for the MOX Fuel Plant, CMRR Project, or UPF. The Department of Defense is prohibited from using funds for the Uranium Processing Facility (UPF) and the medium extended air defense system (MEADS) starting from fiscal year 2013. SEC. 4. REPORTS REQUIRED. The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy must submit an initial report within 180 days of the Act's enactment outlining their plans for section 3. They must also submit annual reports by March 1 of each year, detailing their ongoing plans. Additionally, the President must provide an annual nuclear weapons accounting report by September 30 of each year. The Federal Government must report on the amounts obligated and expended for each nuclear weapon and related program annually to specific Congressional committees."
