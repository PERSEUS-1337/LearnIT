A hierarchical approach to structured exploration is proposed to improve sample efficiency in large state-action spaces by modeling a stochastic policy as a hierarchical latent variable model. This enables lower sample complexity and preserves policy expressivity. The approach combines hierarchical variational inference with actor-critic learning for joint learning and exploration strategy. The benefits include being principled, simple to implement, and easily scalable to settings with many. The hierarchical approach proposed aims to improve sample efficiency in large state-action spaces by modeling a stochastic policy as a hierarchical latent variable model. This approach combines hierarchical variational inference with actor-critic learning for joint learning and exploration strategy, demonstrating effectiveness in learning deep centralized multi-agent policies. The hierarchical structure leads to meaningful agent coordination and more efficient learning in challenging multi-agent games with a large number of agents. In large-scale environments, the optimal policy can be difficult to discover due to the high-dimensional state-action space. However, many environments have a low-dimensional structure that can be exploited, especially in collaborative multi-agent problems. An example is the Hare-Hunters problem where hunters need to capture prey within a set time frame, requiring coordination over a large number of spaces. In collaborative multi-agent problems like the Hare-Hunters scenario, hunters must coordinate over many time steps to maximize rewards. To address the challenge of large state-action spaces, a structured exploration approach is proposed to improve sample efficiency by learning deep hierarchical policies with a latent structure. This method aims to capture the low-dimensional coordination structure in the policy distribution, reducing the number of weights needed for training. The approach involves utilizing a shared stochastic latent variable model for structured exploration and employing a variational method to learn the posterior distribution over the latents along with the optimal policy. This method does not rely on prior domain knowledge but discovers coordination structure from empirical experience. It enables end-to-end training of the policy class and utilizes a hierarchical policy structure. Our approach introduces a structured probabilistic policy class with a hierarchy of stochastic latent variables. We propose an efficient algorithm using variational methods for end-to-end training. Validation is done in synthetic multi-agent environments requiring team coordination, showing improved sample complexity in coordination games. Our approach introduces a structured probabilistic policy class with a hierarchy of stochastic latent variables. We empirically verify improved sample complexity on coordination games with a large number of agents. Learned latent structures correlate with meaningful coordination patterns in multi-agent environments. The focus is on efficiently learning a centralized policy for all agents in the full-information setting. The variable model of the multi-agent policy contains stacked layers of stochastic latent variables and global variables shared across agents. A neural network instance of the actor-critic uses the reparametrization trick to sample actions and compute value functions. The exploration-exploitation trade-off is a central issue in reinforcement learning, especially in large state-action spaces where discovering good policies becomes combinatorially intractable as the number of agents grows. The multi-agent policy model incorporates hierarchical latent variables for structured exploration in large state-action spaces. The approach, MACE, utilizes correlated actions between agents and a variational method to optimize the objective. Coordination is encoded through shared structure in individual policies, represented by a latent variable \u03bb t \u2208 R n. The joint policy for a single time-step introduces dependencies among actions, allowing for more flexibility compared to standard policies. Centralized learning and decentralized execution are supported by sharing a random seed among agents. To make learning tractable, a variational approach is used, deriving a hierarchical variational lower bound for a tractable learning algorithm. The text discusses optimizing a lower bound for total rewards in reinforcement learning. It introduces a latent variable in the probability of a rollout and uses a variational approach to derive a lower bound on the log-likelihood. This approach involves an approximate factorized variational distribution weighted by the total reward. The text discusses optimizing a lower bound for total rewards in reinforcement learning using a variational approach with factorized variational distribution. It introduces a latent variable in the probability of a rollout and computes policy gradients to address high variance and instabilities. In practice, using more general objectives can reduce variance in rewards. Two grid-world games inspired by classic games were created to validate the approach. Predator-Prey is a test environment for multi-agent learning with hunters trying to capture prey. In the Stag-Hunt game, hunters must efficiently distribute targets to inactivate all prey within a time limit. The game involves capturing either hares for low rewards or stags for high rewards, with hunters having a limited number of hit-points. In the Stag-Hunt game, hunters must capture prey (stags and hares) within a time limit. Stags have more hit-points than hares and hunters. The terminal reward is based on capturing live prey before the time limit. Agents need to coordinate to capture the same prey for higher rewards. The multi-agent policy class uses deep neural networks without memory. The model computes features using a convolutional neural network. The model computes features using a 2-layer convolutional neural network to compute the latent variable \u03bb \u2208 R d. It learns the variational distribution Q(\u03bb|s) using the reparametrization trick and samples \u03bb via N(0, 1). The model then computes policies P(ai|\u03bb, s) and value functions Vi(s) for end-to-end training using A3C with KL-controlled policy gradients and policy-entropy regularization. MACE is compared against two baselines in the experiments. The model uses a variational approach to train hierarchical multi-agent policies with shared weights. Experiments show that the method scales well to environments with a large number of agents, achieving higher rewards compared to baselines. MACE achieves significantly higher rewards compared to baselines, solving game instances faster and coordinating for higher rewards more often. The use of KL-regularization in the ELBO objective is investigated, showing that MACE enables more efficient learning. The KL-regularized policy gradient improves training stability and prevents mode collapse, leading to consistent success in capturing moving prey in game instances. Without KL-regularization, training is unstable and prone to failure, reflected in low rewards and an inability to solve the game. The KL-regularized policy gradient enhances training stability and prevents mode collapse, resulting in successful capture of moving prey in game instances. The relative difficulty of capturing moving prey compared to fixed preys is highlighted, showing that capturing moving prey is easier due to the expected distance between hunter and prey being lower. Additionally, the impact of the time limit on rewards is discussed, with larger time limits leading to sparser rewards and requiring more samples for discovering good policies. Empirical evidence supports the efficacy of structured exploration, demonstrated through the behavior of the latent variable \u03bb in a Hare-Hunters game. In the large N = M = 10 case, the dynamics of the agent collective are a generalization of the N = M = 2 case. There are redundancies in multi-agent hunter-prey assignments. In the N = M = 2 case, there are redundancies in multi-agent hunter-prey assignments that are complex to analyze due to combinatorial complexity. Experiments suggest that the latent code correlates with agents' behavior, showing meaningful multi-agent coordination. Recent works focus on learning structured representations using expressive distributions for more powerful probabilistic inference. Our work builds upon these approaches to learn structured policies in reinforcement learning, considering the RL problem as an inference problem in the multi-agent setting. Variational methods in reinforcement learning (RL) have been discussed in previous works, but end-to-end trainable models were not considered. Multi-agent coordination in RL has been studied to reduce instability when multiple agents learn simultaneously. The shared latent variable in structured policies can be used to induce coordination between agents and break ties between alternatives. Our method learns coordination end-to-end via on-policy methods and scales well to many agents with its simple hierarchical structure. The hierarchical model and variational approach provide a simple way to implement multi-agent coordination and can easily combine with existing actor-critic methods. There are opportunities to expand on this work, especially in complex environments where memoryful strategies may be more effective. Our approach to multi-agent reinforcement learning involves using memoryfull policies with flexible priors and a hierarchical structure for communication between agents. We derive a tractable learning method by casting the optimization problem as a probabilistic inference problem and optimizing a lower bound on the total reward. This method scales well to many agents and can easily combine with existing actor-critic methods. The total reward in reinforcement learning is treated as a random variable with an unnormalized distribution. The RL objective is framed as a maximum likelihood problem involving marginalization over latent variables. Learning the policy distribution exactly is challenging, so a variational approach is used to obtain a lower bound on the log-likelihood. In reinforcement learning, the total reward is considered a random variable with an unnormalized distribution. The objective is framed as a maximum likelihood problem involving marginalization over latent variables. A variational approach is used to obtain a lower bound on the log-likelihood, known as the evidence lower bound (ELBO), which can be maximized as a proxy for the optimal policy distribution. The text discusses maximizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO) as a proxy for the optimal policy distribution in reinforcement learning. The training method used is A3C with 5-20 threads, each performing stochastic gradient descent. Adding entropy regularization on the policy can positively impact performance, but it is not always necessary. The text discusses the impact of the number of environment steps on training in reinforcement learning. A smaller number of steps (L) leads to faster training with higher variance, while a higher number of steps results in slower training with lower variance."
