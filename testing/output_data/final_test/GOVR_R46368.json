    "content": "This report provides an overview of U.S. foreign assistance to sub-Saharan Africa, focusing on funding trends, major focus areas, select programs, and the Trump Administration's FY2021 aid budget request. It also highlights legislative measures and challenges for congressional oversight. Africa has received a growing share of annual U.S. foreign assistance funding over the past two decades, with the region receiving 37% of State Department- and USAID-administered aid obligations. The report focuses on funding allocated for African countries or regional programs managed by the State Department and USAID in sub-Saharan Africa. It does not cover funding allocated via global accounts or programs that are not disaggregated by country or region in publicly available budget materials. Over the past two decades, Africa has seen an increase in U.S. aid, receiving 37% of State Department- and USAID-administered aid obligations in FY2018. Aid to Africa grew significantly during the 2000s, particularly for initiatives like PEPFAR. Despite fluctuations in aid allocations during the Obama and Trump administrations, Africa has consistently received around $7.0 billion annually. The United States provides significant aid to African countries, with a focus on health programs such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, nutrition, and maternal and child health. Aid also aims to promote economic growth, food security, governance, and security. Additional funding is channeled through multilateral bodies like the World Bank. Debates continue on the value and design of assistance programs in Africa, with proponents citing national interests and humanitarian values, while critics raise concerns. U.S. aid to Africa addresses development, governance, and security challenges, totaling $7.1 billion. Debates on aid effectiveness and responsibility for providing aid to the region persist. In FY2019, State Department and USAID assistance for Africa totaled $7.1 billion, with health assistance comprising 75% of U.S. aid. HIV/AIDS programs received the majority of funding, with significant support from PEPFAR. Malaria prevention and treatment programs were the second-largest category of health assistance, mainly provided through the USAID-led PMI targeting 24 African countries. The United States provides significant assistance to Africa, with a focus on health programs such as HIV/AIDS and malaria prevention through initiatives like the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI). Additionally, U.S. support extends to economic growth in Africa, particularly through agricultural development programs aimed at improving productivity and market access. The U.S. has also been actively involved in global health security efforts, including responding to Ebola outbreaks in West Africa and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The United States provides significant assistance to Africa, focusing on health programs like HIV/AIDS and malaria prevention. U.S. support also extends to economic growth through agricultural development programs aimed at improving productivity and market access. Nearly 60% of U.S. agricultural assistance to Africa in FY2019 benefitted eight African focus countries under Feed the Future (FTF), a USAID-led initiative supporting agricultural development to reduce food insecurity and enhance economic growth. The Global Food Security Act of 2016 endorses a similar approach to U.S. agricultural and food assistance. Since the early 2000s, USAID has focused on economic policy reforms, microenterprise strengthening, and infrastructure development in Africa. They support trade and investment hubs to expand U.S.-Africa trade, including through the AGOA program. USAID also leads initiatives like Power Africa to improve electricity access and Prosper Africa for trade and investment coordination. Power Africa aims to build power generation facilities capable of producing 30,000 megawatts of new power and establish 60 million new power connections by 2030. The initiative involves various U.S. federal entities, including USAID, MCC, DFC, Ex-Im Bank, TDA, and several government departments. The Electrify Africa Act of 2015 supports electrification in Africa. Additionally, the State Department administers programs to build the capacity of African militaries and law enforcement agencies to counter security threats and combat transnational crime. The State Department administers security assistance programs in African countries through the Peacekeeping Operations (PKO) account, which supports peacekeeping capacity-building, counterterrorism, maritime security, and security sector reform. Funding for these programs is appropriated by Congress in annual SFOPS appropriations. The PKO account funds U.S. assessed contributions to U.N. peacekeeping budgets, including support for operations in Africa such as UNSOS in Somalia. It also supports counterterrorism programs like TSCTP and PREACT. The NADR account funds counterterrorism training and capacity-building programs, while INCLE funds efforts to combat transnational crime and strengthen the rule of law in Africa. The International Military Education and Training (IMET) program offers training for foreign military personnel to build military-to-military relationships, promote respect for human rights, and strengthen civilian control of the military. The United States provides grants through the Foreign Military Financing (FMF) account to help countries purchase defense articles and services. USAID implements programs focused on conflict prevention, mitigation, and resolution, aiming to prevent mass atrocities, support post-conflict transitions, and counter violent extremism. Congress appropriates funding for economic assistance programs, not security assistance. The State Department and USAID administer programs for Democracy, Human Rights, and Governance (DRG) to enhance democratic institutions, improve government accountability, and strengthen the rule of law. Activities include supporting electoral institutions, training political parties and civil society organizations, promoting accountable governance, anti-corruption efforts, and legal aid for human rights defenders. U.S. education programs aim to improve access to quality education, learning outcomes, and support youth transitions into the workforce. USAID supports education programs to improve learning outcomes and youth transitions into the workforce, including initiatives for marginalized students. The Young African Leaders Initiative (YALI) offers training and mentorship for African leaders. Additionally, USAID provides environmental assistance programs focusing on biodiversity conservation, climate change, wildlife crime, and natural resource management in Africa. In recent years, the largest allocation of regional environmental assistance in Africa has been for the Central Africa Regional Program for the Environment (CARPE), focusing on conservation, sustainable resource use, and climate change mitigation in the Congo Basin rainforest. Congress has shown interest in international conservation initiatives and efforts to curb wildlife trafficking and environmental crime in Africa. U.S. development, security, and health assistance to African countries via global programs are not broken out by region or country in public budget documents. The United States administers humanitarian aid to Africa under various authorities, including emergency assistance for designated humanitarian crises in countries like Burkina Faso, CAR, DRC, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, and the Lake Chad Basin. Certain security assistance programs for African countries have also received significant funding in recent years, raising challenges for congressional oversight. USAID-administered Food for Peace (FFP) assistance under Title II of the Food for Peace Act primarily provides U.S. in-kind food commodities to African countries. USAID-administered International Disaster Assistance (IDA) funds food and nonfood humanitarian assistance, including the Emergency Food Security Program (EFSP) for market-based food assistance. State Department-administered Migration and Refugees Assistance (MRA) provides aid for refugees and vulnerable migrants in Africa. Other federal departments and agencies also manage or support aid programs in the region. Other U.S. federal entities, such as the Departments of Agriculture, Energy, Justice, Commerce, Homeland Security, and the Treasury, along with the Department of Defense, are involved in administering assistance to Africa. The Department of Defense implements security assistance programs and engages in security cooperation with foreign partner militaries and internal security entities. In the FY2017 NDAA, Congress expanded the \"global train and equip\" authority under Section 333, allowing DOD to provide training and equipment to foreign military and security forces to counter terrorism, drug trafficking, and transnational crime. Funding data for DOD security cooperation programs in Africa is not publicly available, making it difficult to estimate assistance amounts. Kenya, Uganda, Niger, Chad, Somalia, and Cameroon have been top recipients of DOD global train and equip assistance. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) supports development compacts in developing countries that address constraints to growth. MCC has funded 32 compacts or threshold programs in 22 African countries since its inception. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) has supported 32 compacts or threshold programs in 22 African countries with roughly $8.0 billion in funding. Some compacts were suspended or terminated due to performance issues, such as in Madagascar, Mali, Tanzania, and Ghana. The MCC focuses on grassroots-level assistance programs in agriculture, economic development, youth engagement, health, and education through American volunteers in local communities abroad. The Peace Corps focuses on agriculture, economic development, youth engagement, health, and education in sub-Saharan Africa. Recent conflict-related suspensions occurred in Mali and Burkina Faso. Operations in Kenya resumed in 2019 after a security concern suspension in 2014. All Peace Corps activities were halted globally in March 2020 due to COVID-19. The African Development Foundation (USADF) is a federally funded nonprofit corporation created in 1980 to support development in Africa. The USADF, established in 1980, provides grants up to $250,000 for small-scale economic growth projects in Africa, focusing on agriculture, micro-enterprise development, and community resilience. It targets marginalized communities, women, and youth, often in fragile or post-conflict countries. The Trump Administration's policy goals for Africa include expanding trade, countering conflict, and imposing stricter conditions on assistance. The Trump Administration's policy goals for Africa include countering \"great power competitors\" like China and Russia, promoting youth development, strengthening investment climates, boosting economic growth, trade, democracy, good governance, and improving health outcomes. The Administration has expressed skepticism of U.S. foreign aid globally and to certain African countries, pledging to curtail aid to corrupt governments. The Trump Administration pledged in 2018 to reduce aid to corrupt African governments and prioritize assistance to democratically governed states. This commitment has not been revoked since Bolton's departure in 2019. The Administration has maintained various aid initiatives for Africa and launched Prosper Africa, a trade and investment program focused on the continent. The Trump Administration has proposed changes to U.S. assistance to Africa, including a reduction in aid and changes to humanitarian assistance delivery. This could impact U.S. aid to African countries. The Trump Administration has proposed consolidating humanitarian assistance accounts and merging bilateral economic assistance accounts to improve efficiency. Additionally, they have not requested Foreign Military Financing for African countries, which could impact U.S. aid to Africa. The Trump Administration has not requested Foreign Military Financing for African countries, except for Djibouti. They have proposed eliminating the USADF and creating a grants office within USAID. Congress has maintained funding for USADF at $33 million for FY2020. The Administration's FY2021 budget request includes $5.2 billion in aid for Africa. The budget request includes $5.2 billion in aid for Africa, an increase from FY2020 but 28% below FY2019 allocations. Funding for Africa would sharply decline across major accounts, including Global Health Programs, PKO, INCLE, and IMET. Non-health development assistance would see the largest decline, with ESDF for Africa down 48% from FY2019 levels. The request includes $75 million in ESDF for Prosper Africa. Proposed decreases in U.S. funding for U.N. peacekeeping missions in Africa could impact stability and humanitarian operations. The FY2021 budget request for Africa includes significant cuts to U.S. assistance across all major sectors, raising concerns over potential ramifications for U.S. influence and partnerships abroad. The proposed reductions in funding for U.N. peacekeeping missions in Africa could impact stability and humanitarian operations, with implications for countering the influence of geostrategic competitors in the region. China's growing influence in Africa is highlighted, with concerns raised over the proposed $75 million funding for trade and investment initiatives. Despite the Administration's pledge to cut aid to non-democratic countries, top proposed recipients include nations with poor governance records. Cuts to economic assistance could impact U.S. democracy and governance programs in the region. Congress may need to consider these issues when authorizing funding for U.S. foreign aid programs in Africa. Members of Congress debate the balance and scale of U.S. assistance to Africa, questioning if funding levels align with U.S. interests in the region. Concerns have been raised over the dominance of health programs in aid allocation, with calls for more support in areas like governance and conflict mitigation. The Trump Administration's proposals to reduce aid to Africa have faced pushback from some lawmakers, citing potential risks. Some Members of Congress are concerned about proposed cuts in U.S. assistance to Africa, citing risks to national security and foreign policy goals. The lack of transparency in aid allocation makes it difficult to determine exact funding figures. Other countries like China, Russia, India, Turkey, and Arab Gulf states are increasing their roles in the region. The State Department's ForeignAssistance.gov provides data on obligations and disbursements but does not track committed funding against enacted levels, posing challenges for congressional oversight. Gaps in region- and country-level assistance data may be due to efforts to maintain flexibility in U.S. assistance programs. Congress has not imposed consistent reporting requirements across foreign aid programs, with DOD having more stringent reporting requirements than the State Department for security assistance. Public budget documents may include some security assistance breakouts. Public budget documents may include country- and program-level breakouts of security assistance, but some funds like the Global Peace Operations Initiative (GPOI) are not reflected. Lack of data on U.S. assistance to African countries may hinder evaluation efforts. Policymakers may discuss how U.S. aid supports African governments in addressing development, security, and governance challenges, with most aid going to non-government actors. Channeling aid through nongovernment actors is preferred in countries where the state is unable to meet the population's needs. Experts debate whether this method equips recipient governments adequately. Congress has placed conditions on U.S. assistance to countries that fail to meet certain standards. In FY2020, several African governments face aid restrictions for failing to meet standards related to religious freedom and the use of child soldiers. Eritrea is designated as a \"Country of Particular Concern\" under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, while countries like DRC, Mali, Somalia, South Sudan, and Sudan are subject to potential security assistance restrictions under the Child Soldiers Prevention Act. President Trump waived certain restrictions for DRC and Mali in October 2019. President Trump waived restrictions for DRC, Mali, Somalia, and South Sudan under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. Aid restrictions were also imposed on countries like Burundi, Comoros, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, The Gambia, Mauritania, and South Sudan in FY2020. Some African countries face aid restrictions for various reasons such as military coups, support for terrorism, or debt arrears. The executive branch does not have the authority to waive restrictions on aid to governments that come to power through a military coup. Congress has imposed restrictions on aid to specific African countries like Sudan and Zimbabwe. The \"Leahy Laws\" limit security assistance to foreign units or personnel involved in human rights violations. Congress also restricts certain security assistance to prevent unintended use, such as prohibiting funds for tear gas. The provision of U.S. foreign assistance, including security aid, may have unintended consequences, such as prolonging civil conflict or strengthening abusive security forces in African countries like Chad, Cameroon, Nigeria, and Uganda. Critics question whether providing certain forms of aid jeopardizes U.S. policy goals related to democracy and human rights. The provision of U.S. security assistance in Africa may have unintended consequences, such as strengthening abusive security forces or hindering U.S. influence on democracy and governance issues. Proponents argue that programs like military professionalization and human rights training can improve security sector governance and civil-military relations. Congress has not adopted the Administration's proposed cuts to aid for Africa, with funding remaining around $7 billion per year. Members may consider various issues as they debate the FY2021 Department of State appropriations. Members may consider issues such as the economic, humanitarian, and health-related shocks of the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa, political transitions in Sudan and Ethiopia, conflicts and humanitarian crises in various African countries, repressive governance in top recipients of U.S. assistance in Africa, conditions on U.S. foreign assistance, and U.S.-Africa trade and investment issues. The curr_chunk discusses U.S.-Africa trade, investment issues, and foreign powers' involvement in Africa, such as China and Russia. It also mentions the implications of such engagement for U.S. national security and policy interests."
