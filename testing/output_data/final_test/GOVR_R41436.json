    "content": "Medicare is a federal insurance program established in 1965 under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide health insurance to individuals 65 and older, as well as permanently disabled individuals under 65. Eligibility for premium-free Part A of Medicare is based on paying Medicare payroll taxes for at least 40 quarters, being at least 65 years old, and being a citizen or permanent resident of the United States. Part A covers hospital services, skilled nursing facility services, home health visits, and hospice services. Medicare consists of different parts: Part A covers hospital services, skilled nursing facility services, home health visits, and hospice services. Part B includes physician services, laboratory services, durable medical equipment, and outpatient hospital services. Part C, known as Medicare Advantage, offers private plan options for those enrolled in Parts A and B. Part D provides optional prescription drug coverage. Medicare serves one in six Americans, with 52.3 million beneficiaries in 2013, costing $583 billion. It accounts for 20% of national health spending and 3.5% of GDP. Since 1965, the Medicare program has undergone significant changes, including modifications to provider reimbursements, incentives to improve care quality and efficiency, and enhanced benefits. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act established the Independent Payment Advisory Board to recommend reducing Medicare spending when costs exceed target growth rates. Annual Medicare price updates are now tied to economy-wide productivity growth. The legislation did not make changes to the physician sustainable growth rate payment system, leading to potential reductions in physician payment rates. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established procedures to reduce the federal budget deficit, including automatic spending reductions triggered by the failure of the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to propose legislation. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 delayed these reductions, while the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 extended the deadline. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 extended sequestration for mandatory spending through FY2023, and an amended version of S. 25 extended it through FY2024. Medicare sequestration began in April 2013 and will continue through March 2025, with benefit-related payments subject to a 2% reduction. The Medicare program's benefit structure remains mostly unchanged, but benefit-related payments are being reduced by 2% due to sequestration. Some non-benefit related expenses face higher reductions, such as administrative and operational spending at 7.3% in 2014. Medicare's financial operations are managed through two trust funds - the Hospital Insurance (HI) trust fund for Part A and the Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) trust fund for Parts B and D. The Medicare program is funded through the Hospital Insurance (HI) trust fund for Part A and the Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) trust fund for Parts B and D. Payments for beneficiaries in Medicare Advantage (Part C) are made from these trust funds. HI is funded by payroll taxes, while SMI is funded through general revenue transfers and premiums. The HI trust fund covers inpatient hospital services, skilled nursing facility services, home health services, and hospice care. The HI portion of Medicare is designed to be self-supporting and financed through dedicated sources of income. The Hospital Insurance (HI) trust fund for Medicare is primarily funded by payroll taxes paid by employees and employers, with no upper limit on earnings subject to the tax. Additional income comes from premiums paid by voluntary enrollees, federal income taxes on Social Security benefits, and interest on federal securities. The HI trust fund is self-supporting and dedicated to covering inpatient hospital services, skilled nursing facility services, home health services, and hospice care. The HI trust fund for Medicare is funded by payroll taxes, premiums, federal income taxes on Social Security benefits, and interest on federal securities. The trust fund serves as an accounting mechanism to track income and assets for Part A benefits. Government receives Medicare revenues and credits income to the trust fund with special issue interest-bearing securities. Payments for Part A benefits are made from the general treasury, deleting corresponding securities from the trust fund. Surpluses in the trust fund are not reserved for future benefits, but are bookkeeping entries. The HI trust fund for Medicare is funded by various sources including payroll taxes, premiums, and federal income taxes. Surpluses in the trust fund are not reserved for future benefits but are bookkeeping entries indicating how much Medicare has lent to the Treasury. The Treasury Department is authorized to make payments for Medicare Part A services as long as the HI trust fund has a balance. There are no provisions in the Social Security Act for what would happen if the trust fund were to become insolvent. The HI trust fund for Medicare is funded by payroll taxes and adjusted periodically by Congress to maintain financial adequacy. Part B and Part D benefits are paid for out of the SMI trust fund, relying on general tax revenues and beneficiary premiums. Contributions into the SMI trust fund are updated annually to ensure funding. The SMI trust fund for Medicare is funded by general tax revenues and beneficiary premiums, with contributions updated annually to ensure financial balance. Medicare Part B is financed mostly by federal general revenues, and beneficiary premiums cover 25% of program costs for the aged. Additional revenues from an annual fee on certain manufacturers of branded prescription drugs are credited to the Part B account. In 2014, most Medicare Part B enrollees pay a monthly premium of $104.90, with high-income enrollees paying higher premiums since 2007. The income thresholds for determining higher premium rates will be frozen at 2010 levels through 2019 due to a provision in ACA. This freeze is expected to increase revenue for the SMI trust fund. Medicare Part D is financed through beneficiary premiums, federal general revenues, and transfers from states known as \"clawback payments.\" In 2014, Medicare Part D is financed through beneficiary premiums, federal general revenues, and transfers from states known as \"clawback payments.\" Premiums for Part D cover 25.5% of standard benefit costs, with recipients of low-income subsidies not required to pay premiums. The Medicare Part D program costs in 2013 were mainly covered by beneficiary premiums, with high-income enrollees required to pay higher premiums. The Medicare Board of Trustees oversees the financial operations of the trust funds, with members including the Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of Health and Human Services, Secretary of Labor, Commissioner of Social Security, and two public members nominated by the President. The Medicare Trustees report to Congress annually on trust fund operations, with financial projections made by CMS actuaries based on key variables like CPI, fertility rate, and life expectancy. Three forecasts are included in the report, ranging from pessimistic to optimistic, with the intermediate projections being the most cited. The Trustees review and update assumptions annually based on new data and trends. The 2014 Medicare Trustees report projected physician payments to remain at current levels through 2015, increasing by 0.6% annually until 2023. The report warned that estimates based on other current-law assumptions may not be realistic. The actuaries of CMS conducted a separate analysis providing projections based on an \"illustrative alternative\" to current law. The alternative estimates assume economy-wide productivity adjustments mandated by ACA until 2019, phased out from 2020 to 2034, and no implementation of IPAB recommendations for cost reductions. In CY 2013, Medicare served 52.3 million beneficiaries at a total cost of $583 billion. HI trust fund had total income of $251.1 billion in CY 2013. In CY2013, total income to the HI trust fund was $251.1 billion, with payroll taxes accounting for $220.8 billion. The HI program paid out $266.2 billion, mostly for benefit costs, leading to a reduction in the trust fund balance. The SMI trust fund brought in $324.7 billion in revenue and expended $316.8 billion. In 2013, the SMI trust fund had total income of $324.7 billion and expenditures of $316.8 billion. General revenues accounted for 72.9% of income, premiums for 22.5%, and interest and other income for 2.4%. Part B had income of $255.0 billion, with general revenues making up 72.9%, premiums 24.7%, and interest and other income 2.4%. Part D had income of $69.7 billion, with general revenues at 73.2%, premiums at 14.2%, and state transfers at 12.6%. Total Medicare expenditures are projected to increase at an average annual rate of 6.8% over the next 10 years, reaching close to $1.1 trillion in 2023. This growth reflects the expected increase in the number of Medicare beneficiaries, utilization of services per beneficiary, and prices of services. The growth rate also considers ACA changes affecting cost growth rates. Administrative expenses for the Part D program in 2013 accounted for about 0.6% of total expenditures. The HI trust fund's financial adequacy is determined by comparing assets to expected costs, with the fund projected to be inadequately financed over the next 10 years. Total Medicare expenditures are expected to increase by 6.8% annually, reaching nearly $1.1 trillion in 2023, driven by factors like the number of beneficiaries and service prices. The HI trust fund's financial adequacy is projected to be insufficient over the next 10 years, with expenditures exceeding income since 2008. Despite revenue growth outpacing expenses from 2011 to 2013, income did not match expenditures due to rising Medicare enrollment and provider payment updates. Income is expected to outpace expenses from 2014 to 2017, aided by economic recovery, a higher HI payroll tax for high-income enrollees, and benefit spending reductions mandated by BCA. Over the next 10 years, HI income is projected to grow by 5.9% annually, while expenditures are expected to increase by 5.3% per year. The HI trust fund is forecasted to run a slight surplus from 2015 to 2022, but expenditures are expected to surpass income after that period. Medicare Part B costs have been rising rapidly, exceeding GDP growth by 3.5 percentage points annually over the past five years. If Congress overrides physician payment reductions, Part B growth is projected to average 5.7% annually over the next five years. Medicare Part B growth rate is projected to average 5.7% annually over the next five years, but if physician payment cuts go into effect, growth will slow to 4.9%. Part D expenditures are expected to increase by 9.9% annually through 2018 due to higher drug costs and more enrollees. The 2014 Trustees report projects that the Medicare HI trust fund will become insolvent in 2030, four years later than previously estimated. This improvement is attributed to lower expenditures in 2013 and reduced assumptions of Part A services utilization. Expenditures for Medicare HI began exceeding tax income in 2004, with deficits covered by trust fund assets. Despite projected surpluses in 2015-2022, expenditures are expected to exceed income again in 2030 when the trust fund assets are depleted. The Medicare trust fund is projected to be depleted in 2030, leading to a shortfall in covering Part A expenditures. Without action to increase revenue or decrease expenses, Congress may need to appropriate additional funding to ensure full and timely payments to providers. The impact of ACA productivity adjustments on expenditures is modest in the short term, with the trust fund exhaustion date estimated to be 2029. Beyond 2023, actual dollar figures are not provided due to challenges in making meaningful comparisons over time. The Medicare program's financial soundness is assessed using measures like comparing income and costs, determining unfunded liabilities, and comparing benefit costs with GDP. Trustees caution that these estimates provide indications of trust fund conditions but financial outcomes are uncertain. The financial soundness of the Medicare program is evaluated by comparing income and costs, assessing unfunded liabilities, and comparing benefit costs with GDP. Trust fund conditions are indicated by comparing income rate to cost rate, based on taxable payroll, without distortions from inflation. This helps determine the nation's future earnings needed to cover program commitments. Cost rates for the Medicare program have generally increased over time, reflecting higher medical care costs and the number of beneficiaries. Fluctuations in cost rates have been influenced by legislation and economic performance. From 2008 to 2011, cost rates increased annually due to lower taxable payroll from the recession. The 2012 cost rates for Medicare decreased to 3.60%, and further decreased to 3.55% in 2013. The 2014 Trustees report predicts a continued decline in cost rates through 2017 due to economic recovery and changes from the ACA. However, long-term projections show expenditures increasing to 5.57% of taxable payroll by 2085, mainly due to the aging population and rising healthcare costs. The HI income rate is expected to gradually increase from 3.28% in 2013 to 4.26% in 2085, with a projected HI cost rate of 8.75% under an alternative scenario. The income rate for high-income individuals is not indexed to inflation, leading to more workers facing higher tax rates over time. Income from taxing Social Security benefits is expected to rise as the number of recipients increases. By 2030, non-interest income is projected to cover 85% of HI expenditures, decreasing to 75% by 2045. The growth of the cost rate is expected to slow down after 2045 due to ACA reductions in provider payments. The 2014 Trustees report estimates a HI deficit of 1.31% of taxable payroll at the end of the 75-year period, which could increase to 4.64% under an alternative scenario without ACA productivity adjustments. The actuarial balance of the HI trust fund is the difference between current-law income rates and cost rates over the next 75 years to meet funding needs. The 2014 Trustees report estimates a HI deficit of 1.31% of taxable payroll at the end of the 75-year period. The actuarial balance of the HI trust fund is -0.87%, indicating a shortfall in meeting funding needs. This means the income rate would need to increase by 0.87% of taxable payroll over the next 75 years to reach actuarial balance. If the Medicare program does not make changes to increase funding or reduce spending by 2030, a 1.21% increase in the standard payroll tax will be necessary. The unfunded obligation measures the shortfall between expected costs and projected income, currently at 1.92% of taxable payroll if productivity adjustments cannot be sustained in the long run. The unfunded obligation of the HI trust fund is $3.6 trillion over the next 75 years, representing the amount needed to make the program financially sound. This estimate understates the full magnitude of obligations as it only reflects taxes paid by future workers, not their expected benefits. Since 2004, the Trustees report has included a measure of unfunded obligations that extends indefinitely. Extended projections can help indicate if the HI financial imbalance would improve or worsen beyond the 75-year period. Under current assumptions, the HI program is projected to have a deficit of $1.9 trillion over the infinite horizon, 0.1% of GDP. The SMI account is expected to be adequately financed with unfunded obligations considered to be $0. However, estimated SMI expenditures of $33.6 trillion over the next 75 years will exceed revenues, requiring general fund transfers of $24.7 trillion to keep the trust fund balanced. Part B expenditures are estimated at $43.0 trillion through the infinite horizon, with 26% financed by beneficiary premiums and a fraction by drug fees, while 74% will be covered by general revenues. The estimated present value of Part D expenditures through the infinite horizon is $19.4 trillion, with 73% funded by general revenues. Medicare costs are expected to rise relative to GDP due to increasing health service costs and utilization rates. Rising benefit expenditures are anticipated as more people become eligible for Medicare. Medicare benefit expenditures are projected to grow significantly, with costs expected to increase from 3.5% of GDP in 2013 to 5.3% in 2035 and 6.9% in 2088 under current law. Alternative projections show costs reaching 8.4% of GDP in 2088. General revenues and beneficiary premiums will play a larger role in financing the program over the next 75 years, with general revenue transfers and beneficiary premiums projected to increase. Payroll taxes and taxation of benefits are expected to contribute less to Medicare income over time. The share of Medicare benefit expenditures is projected to increase from 3.5% of GDP in 2013 to 6.9% in 2088 under current law. General revenues and beneficiary premiums will play a larger role in financing the program, with concerns over the reliance on general revenues in the future. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 required an expanded analysis in the Trustees report. The Medicare Trustees report, as mandated by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, includes an analysis of Medicare expenditures and revenues. If general revenue financing exceeds 45% of total Medicare outlays for two consecutive years, a \"Medicare funding warning\" is triggered, requiring the President to submit a legislative proposal. Despite excess general revenue funding determinations in reports from 2006 to 2013, no specific legislation has been enacted in response. In the 2014 report, the Trustees project that general revenues will not exceed the threshold. The Trustees project that general revenues will not exceed 45% of total Medicare outlays within the next 7 fiscal years (FY2014-FY2020) and did not issue a funding warning. They estimate that dedicated funding and outlays will exceed 45% starting in FY2024, reaching 55% by 2043, and remaining at that level through 2088. Proponents believe the 45% threshold serves as an early warning system for fiscal responsibility, while opponents argue it doesn't account for changes in outpatient services or the impact of the Part D program on general revenue increases. The annual Medicare Trustees reports focus on the financial status of the Medicare HI and SMI trust funds, using trust fund accounting methods to determine if revenue sources are sufficient for expected expenditures. Unified budget accounting methods examine total money flow regardless of revenue source. The expected shortfall in payroll taxes for future HI expenses and rapid growth are key concerns. The shortfall in payroll taxes for future HI expenses and the rapid growth of SMI, funded mainly by general revenues, highlight the need to consider Medicare expenditures in the federal budget. Over the next 75 years, HI revenues are projected to fall short by $3.8 trillion in present value terms. This includes the HI deficit of $3.6 trillion and trust fund assets of approximately $0.2 trillion as of January 1, 2014. The Medicare Trustees estimate that income taxes needed to fund SMI will increase from 13.8% in 2014 to 30.6% in 2080. The ACA aims to reduce Medicare spending growth without changing benefits or financing structure. Medicare is primarily funded through mandatory spending with no limits on spending, except for certain constraints in HI financing. The ACA aims to reduce Medicare spending growth without changing benefits or financing structure. Medicare expenditures are expected to be less than under prior law, but spending is not limited to those amounts. Actual benefit spending could be greater or less than projections depending on various factors. Medicare spending is still expected to increase in the future, just not as quickly as projected under prior law. The expected reduction in future Medicare spending mainly means that the federal government and Medicare beneficiaries are expected to spend less on Medicare benefits. The government and Medicare beneficiaries are projected to spend less on Medicare benefits than before. Various measures describe the financial status of Medicare, with concerns about its impact on federal deficits in the long run due to factors like the aging population and healthcare spending growth. The aging population, growth in healthcare spending, and federal subsidies for health insurance are expected to increase government spending on Social Security and healthcare programs, leading to larger budget deficits and a rise in federal debt. Forecasting long-term health and economic indicators is challenging, with uncertainties such as the possibility of medical technology advancements or changes in consumer preferences impacting future healthcare spending. Changes in healthcare policies, economic conditions, and population aging can significantly impact future Medicare costs. There are no simple solutions to address the rapid growth in healthcare costs. Medicare, as an entitlement program, must cover all necessary benefits for enrollees with no limits on overall spending. Policy options to control Medicare spending will need to be considered. Policy options to restrain the growth of Medicare spending include reducing the federal share through increased beneficiary premiums, changing eligibility criteria, and reducing provider payments. On the revenue side, options may include modifying Medicare payroll taxes or imposing new fees. Other proposals aim to reduce overall U.S. healthcare spending by addressing medical errors, unnecessary care, and fraud. The challenge for policy makers is to slow Medicare spending growth, establish fair contributions from beneficiaries and taxpayers, and ensure access to healthcare services. Prompt action is needed to address financial challenges, with options including increased beneficiary premiums, changing eligibility criteria, and modifying payroll taxes. Solutions should be enacted soon for flexibility and gradual implementation.
