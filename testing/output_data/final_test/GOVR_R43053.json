    "content": "After more than two years of social unrest and economic stagnation following the 2011 popular uprising, the government of Egypt is facing serious economic pressures that could lead to collapse and violence. The IMF is negotiating a $4.8 billion loan for structural reforms, with potential for additional financial assistance. The Obama Administration is urging President Mohammed Morsi to reach out to the opposition for political support to quickly secure the IMF deal and stabilize the economy. Egyptian leaders are concerned about the political ramifications of required IMF reforms, which could be politically unpopular. Congress is closely monitoring Egypt's commitment to democratic principles and peace with Israel, as well as the negotiations with the IMF. U.S. funds for debt relief to Egypt are tied to economic reforms under the IMF program, and there is proposed legislation to link bilateral economic assistance to IMF programs and reforms. Congress may pass legislation to shape U.S. policy towards Egypt at the IMF. This report provides an overview of the economic situation in post-revolution Egypt, negotiations with the IMF, and the controversial nature of an IMF program in Egypt. It also discusses the relationship between an IMF program for Egypt and U.S. foreign policy goals in the region, as well as legislation tying U.S. bilateral economic assistance to Egypt to an IMF program. Economic conditions in Egypt have worsened since the 2011 revolution, leading to a polarized political climate. Both military and civilian authorities have failed to restore confidence in the economy, with insecurity and lack of investment hindering progress. The Islamist-led government and opposition blame each other for the economic downturn, raising concerns about potential street violence due to economic shocks. Egypt's economy was strong before the political changes, growing at an average of 5% annually between 2000 and 2010. Between 2000 and 2010, Egypt's economy grew at an average rate of 5% per year. Structural reforms implemented by the government, such as tariff reductions and privatization, aimed to enhance the business environment and attract foreign investment. These reforms led to a significant increase in foreign direct investment, reaching 9.3% of GDP in 2006. Despite the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, Egypt's economy remained relatively resilient due to limited exposure to risky financial products and government policies. Egypt's economy grew at an average rate of 5% per year between 2000 and 2010, driven by structural reforms and increased foreign direct investment. However, average Egyptians did not benefit significantly from the growth, with high unemployment and poverty rates. The government also faced challenges with large budget deficits and high public debt, prompting recommendations from the IMF for fiscal consolidation and reforms. The IMF warned about the need for continued reforms to improve the business environment and reduce public debt, which stood at 73% of GDP in 2010. Inflation had also risen steadily from 2.8% in 2000 to 11.7% in 2008. The revolution in Egypt in the 2000s led to economic challenges, including a decline in tourism revenue and investor confidence, resulting in low economic growth and high unemployment rates. The military regime in Egypt stepped aside in mid-2012, leading to a widening budget deficit and increased public debt. The Morsi government hesitated to cut fuel subsidies and focused on social spending to maintain political support. The reliance on domestic markets to finance the deficit strained government finances, while political uncertainty and capital outflows caused pressure on the Egyptian pound to depreciate. The Egyptian central bank has been selling foreign exchange reserves to manage a gradual depreciation of the Egyptian pound, which has fallen from $34 billion in 2010 to $12 billion in 2012. This has raised concerns about the risk of running out of reserves and triggering a currency crisis. The central bank has also raised interest rates to stabilize the pound, but this may hinder the government's growth objectives in the short term. A weaker local currency reduces the purchasing power of Egyptian households as imported goods become more expensive. Egypt faces economic challenges including slowing growth, rising unemployment, dwindling foreign exchange reserves, and a growing budget deficit. The IMF can help stabilize the economy and advance reform efforts through providing short-term loans for continuous access to affordable financing. IMF loans are contingent upon the implementation of economic reforms negotiated between the government and the IMF. Egyptian authorities have been in negotiations with the IMF for economic reforms since political changes began in Egypt. Two tentative agreements were reached in 2011 and 2012, but no final agreement has been implemented due to reluctance to commit to potentially unpopular reforms. Fuel subsidies are a major concern as they are seen as inefficient and regressive, yet serve as a financial safety net for many Egyptians. Other Arab countries in transition, such as Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia, and Yemen, are also facing similar pressures from the IMF for economic reforms. The IMF's lending policies in Egypt are hindered by the lack of adequate conditionality commitments and ongoing political concerns. Egyptian authorities are seeking financial assistance from other countries like Libya and Qatar, but this may only provide temporary relief without addressing underlying structural challenges. The military-controlled Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) was negotiating with the IMF in 2011, led by Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi. The military-led Supreme Council of the Armed Forces in Egypt, under Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, rejected a $3.2 billion IMF loan in 2011 due to concerns about foreign debt burden. Economists noted that the initial IMF agreement had less stringent conditions compared to later proposals, as economic conditions worsened in Egypt. The Muslim Brotherhood supported the rejection as a sign of Egyptian sovereignty, while not ruling out future multilateral lending. The Egyptian government rejected a $3.2 billion IMF loan in 2011 to maintain sovereignty and avoid foreign debt burden. The decision was supported by the Muslim Brotherhood to signal a new policy of balancing international financing without political and economic conditions, aiming for independence and self-reliance. This move would reshape Egypt's relationship with the IMF and World Bank towards stability, development, and utilizing local resources. The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party gained control after the 2011-2012 elections, leading to partial governance amidst an economic crisis. They refused IMF support unless a new government was formed. Saudi Arabia deposited $1 billion in March 2012. In March 2012, Saudi Arabia deposited $1 billion in Egypt's central bank, easing pressure on the government to secure IMF financing. Egypt also received financial assistance from Qatar. Mohammed Morsi, a former Brotherhood leader, became president and took over executive authority from the SCAF. A $4.8 billion loan program was agreed upon with the IMF in November 2012, expected to unlock funds from other donors. The government received a $14.5 billion financing package, including funds from the IMF, with favorable terms. Plans included reducing spending by cutting energy subsidies and transitioning to a value-added tax. Subsidies on 95-octane petrol were lifted in November 2012. The IMF was expected to request fiscal reforms to improve the country's financial situation. In December 2012, public outcry erupted over proposed tax increases in Egypt, leading to the government postponing the program until after parliamentary elections. With the economic situation still unstable in spring 2013, it seemed unlikely that the government could wait for IMF assistance until after the elections, which were delayed due to judicial review of the electoral law. President Morsi attempted to replace judges he believed were obstructing his plans. President Morsi's attempt to replace judges obstructing his agenda led to a deteriorating trust between him and his opponents. In March 2013, the IMF suggested Egypt could qualify for emergency short-term financing of $700 million to prevent economic collapse, with fewer conditions than standard loans. This support could have provided short-term cash for the government to navigate through elections. President Morsi's rejection of emergency financing from the IMF was seen as an attempt to pressure the Fund into providing a loan. Critics like Steven Cook warned against Egypt's arrogant approach in securing aid, emphasizing the need for cooperation with donors. In contrast, Morsi argued that Egypt had met requirements for a longer-term IMF program and had implemented reform measures in early 2013. President Morsi implemented reforms in early 2013, including the elimination of energy subsidies for industrial firms, price increases for wheat, and a progressive property tax. Plans for universal health care and raising minimum tax exemptions were also announced. These reforms faced political challenges, such as bakeries threatening to shut down over bread subsidy changes. The Obama Administration expressed concerns about Egypt's economic and political conditions, urging cooperation with the IMF. The Obama Administration is concerned about Egypt's direction and has been working hard to push for government-opposition dialogue and IMF agreement to improve the economy. Egypt received financial support from Libya and Qatar in April 2013. Analysts debate whether this support could delay an IMF program or kickstart a broader financial assistance plan. Talks with the IMF were ongoing by mid-April. Egypt's latest talks with the IMF ended without an agreement in mid-April. The IMF acknowledged Egypt's efforts to address energy subsidies and expects further actions to tackle fiscal deficits. Fuel subsidies spending increased by 40% due to the declining Egyptian pound. Stopgap funding from Qatar and Libya may help Egypt until later in the year. Some economists predict Egypt could avoid a fiscal crisis until late 2013. Former finance minister Samir Radwan commented on the government's actions. Former finance minister Samir Radwan criticized the Morsi government for not being serious about an IMF deal. U.S. officials are frustrated by Egypt's inability to reach a deal. Secretary Kerry expressed uncertainty about Egypt's future, emphasizing the need for important reforms to secure IMF funding. Many Egyptians have a negative view of the IMF due to its association with autocratic rule under the Mubarak regime and belief that IMF programs led to unemployment, poverty, inequality, and corruption. Older Egyptians from middle and lower classes especially distrust the IMF, linking reductions in their standard of living and political freedoms to IMF-mandated government spending cuts. The IMF's lack of credibility in Egypt has hindered new leaders from implementing its mandated reforms due to popular opposition and concerns about potential economic and social losses. The extent of anti-IMF sentiment in Egypt is difficult to determine currently. Most Egyptians are not blaming foreign lenders for their poor economy yet, but there is opposition to Egyptian dealings with the IMF. Small-scale protests have occurred outside the Egyptian stock exchange, with protestors calling IMF support \"economic colonialism.\" Islamists, including hard-line Salafists, have reservations due to Islamic law banning interest on loans. Egyptian leftists, led by Hamdeen Sabahi, have been vocal opponents of IMF credit. A poll in August 2012 showed that only two-thirds of Egyptians were aware of the IMF loan. During an IMF delegation visit to Egypt in mid-April 2013, fund representatives met with opposition figures and political parties, including Amr Moussa, Amr Hamzawy, Mohamed ElBaradei, the Wafd party, and Hamdeen Sabahi. Political figures raised demands for transparency in government-IMF negotiations and expressed concerns about the impact of IMF-mandated reforms on citizens. The Obama Administration supported IMF involvement in Egypt to promote economic reforms, stabilize the economy, and facilitate democratic transition. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew expressed support for reaching a deal with the IMF in April 2013. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew supported an IMF loan to Egypt in April 2013, stating it would benefit the United States. Secretary of State John Kerry urged President Morsi to implement reforms for an IMF agreement to secure Egypt's economic future. The United States expressed willingness to assist further in reaching an agreement with the IMF. The United States supports Egypt in reaching an agreement with the IMF, which will require efforts from the Egyptian government and broad support for reform. There is debate in Washington over using the IMF deal as an opportunity to influence Egypt's government towards policies aligned with U.S. interests and values. U.S. support for Egypt at the IMF is debated due to concerns about President Morsi consolidating power at the expense of non-Islamist forces. Analysts urge the Obama Administration to signal that this behavior is unacceptable to avoid setbacks for democracy in post-Mubarak Egypt. Egypt experts criticize the U.S. for repeating past mistakes of coddling authoritarian leaders like Mubarak and warn against doing the same with Morsi. The United States is advised to use all available options, including military and economic aid, to influence Egypt's direction. The United States needs to use military aid, economic aid, and influence with international lenders to persuade Morsi to compromise on political and human rights issues. Some argue against pushing Egypt too hard in negotiations with the IMF, citing Egypt's importance in global and regional security. U.S. security interests in Egypt include access to the Suez Canal, the peace treaty with Israel, and military cooperation. Egypt's peace treaty with Israel and military cooperation with the U.S. are key factors in negotiations with the IMF. Pressure on President Morsi could lead to seeking aid from non-Western sources like Saudi Arabia, Libya, and Qatar. It is uncertain if Gulf countries support an IMF program for Egypt and what conditions would be attached to financial assistance from neighboring countries. Congress reflects differing views on this issue. Some lawmakers in Congress may oppose IMF support for Egypt due to concerns about reforms and conditions on loans, while others worry about the risk of economic collapse if tough conditions are imposed. Congress aims to influence U.S. policy towards Egypt at the IMF. Congress has legislative tools to influence U.S. policy towards Egypt at the IMF, including passing mandates that impact the actions of the U.S. Executive Director. These mandates can direct U.S. representatives to advocate for certain policies, vote on programs, and require reports on IMF issues. Congress has the power to influence U.S. policy towards Egypt at the IMF by passing legislation that directs the actions of the U.S. Executive Director, including advocating for specific policies and voting on programs. Lawmakers may also use IMF conditions as benchmarks for providing bilateral economic aid to Egypt, with concerns about the stringency of these conditions. According to Egyptian economist Ashraf Swelam, the IMF program for Egypt has been continuously watered down since 2011. U.S. debt relief is linked to an IMF program, and there is legislation in Congress tying U.S. bilateral assistance to an IMF agreement. Egypt has submitted a Letter of Intent and Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies to the IMF for critical economic reforms. Failure to reach an agreement with the IMF could result in less U.S.-Egyptian cooperation on economic matters. Secretary of State Kerry questioned the level of U.S. influence on Egypt. Secretary of State Kerry discussed the financial aid provided to Egypt, mentioning Qatar's $2 billion contribution, Libya's $2 billion loan, and ongoing negotiations with the IMF for $4.8 billion. Kerry emphasized the importance of assisting countries in need. The U.S. officials may be cautious about non-IMF aid for Egypt from countries like Qatar, but they may see it as necessary to maintain friendly relations with Egyptian opposition. Some policymakers believe that non-IMF lending could help stabilize Egypt's finances temporarily, but it's uncertain if President Morsi's government can rely on this indefinitely. President Morsi's government can receive non-IMF stop-gap lending indefinitely."
