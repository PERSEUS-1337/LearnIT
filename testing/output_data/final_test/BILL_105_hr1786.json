The Congress findings state that the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni activists in 1995 by the Government of Nigeria disregarded legal standards, despite international pleas for clemency. The United Nations urged Nigeria to release the bodies of the Ogoni Nine for proper burial and compensate their families. General Abacha's announcement in 1995 to return Nigeria to civilian democratic rule was met with skepticism due to the ongoing arrest and conviction of individuals for speaking against the government, including former President General Olusegun Obasanjo. The international community pressured Abacha to address human rights violations, such as the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni activists, which disregarded legal standards. The June 12, 1993 presidential election in Nigeria was expected to bring back democratic civilian rule, but General Babangida annulled the election, preventing the return to civilian rule. Nigeria's diverse population of 90 million people across 250 ethnic groups was eager for a democratic transition. The June 12, 1993 presidential election in Nigeria saw Chief M.K.O. Abiola leading in 20 out of 30 states before the annulment, leading to civil unrest and over 100 deaths. General Sani Abacha took power on November 17, 1993, establishing an unelected Provisional Ruling Council. Chief M.K.O. Abiola, the elected democratic leader of Nigeria, was imprisoned by General Sani Abacha, who established an unelected Provisional Ruling Council. The political and economic conditions in Nigeria worsened under Abacha's rule, leading to calls for the rapid return of democratic and civilian governance. The Nigerian people have rejected military rule and are advocating for the preservation of the nation's unity. On May 15, 1994, the National Democratic Coalition in Nigeria called for the military government to step down in favor of the winner of the June 12, 1993 election. The United States emphasizes the importance of human rights, due process, and civilian rule in Nigeria, stating that it cannot overlook the denial of democratic civilian rule by the Provisional Ruling Council. The lack of support from Nigerian authorities on drug trafficking issues has led to the United States penalizing Nigeria for not addressing the narcotics problem, endangering vulnerable youth. Reports of corruption and scams in the Nigerian Government, along with a lack of cooperation, undermine Nigeria's credibility internationally and embarrass law-abiding Nigerian Americans. Nigeria's leadership role in Africa is also at stake. Nigeria's leadership role in Africa, especially in peacekeeping, is at risk due to its failure to rejoin the democratic world community. The country's suspension from the Commonwealth and calls for sanctions from African nations like South Africa highlight the need for Nigeria to move towards democracy to safeguard its people's lives. SEC. 3. DECLARATIONS OF POLICY. Nigeria needs to move towards democracy to safeguard its people's lives. The Congress supports Nigerian people's commitment to unity and democracy, especially after the June 12, 1993, presidential election. More actions are needed to restore full civilian and democratic rule in Nigeria. Sanctions should be implemented in coordination with the international community and the United Nations. The Congress supports Nigeria's democracy and unity, emphasizing the need for more actions to achieve full civilian rule. It calls for reallocating US foreign assistance to prioritize democracy building and rule of law promotion through NGOs in Nigeria.

Additionally, a prohibition on new investments in Nigeria, including the energy sector, will take effect 45 days after the enactment of this Act. The President, through the Secretary of the Treasury, will freeze assets using the authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The International Emergency Economic Powers Act allows for blocking assets of Nigerian nationals hindering democracy.

The Secretary of Transportation will be directed not to permit US air carriers to operate between the US and Nigeria. The Secretary of State will terminate any air transport agreements within 10 days of the enactment of the Act. The State will terminate any air transport agreement between the US and Nigeria, leading to a prohibition on Nigerian aircraft from engaging in air transportation with the US. Additionally, the Secretary of Transportation will prohibit US aircraft from taking off or landing in Nigeria if owned or controlled by Nigerian entities. The President has the authority to waive prohibitions on air transportation if it is deemed important to the national interest of the United States. Definitions for \"aircraft\", \"air transportation\", and \"foreign air carrier\" are provided in the Federal Aviation Act of 1958. The President can waive sanctions under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 if it is in the national interest. The President can instruct the US Representative to the UN to push for resolutions that promote cooperation on sanctions. SEC. 5. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS. The Congress believes the US should follow FIFA's example by excluding Nigerian teams from US sporting events. The President should assess Nigerian progress towards democracy before issuing visas for the 2000 Olympic Games in Australia. SEC. 6. REPORT. The President must report to Congress every 3 months on Nigeria's progress towards democracy and human rights. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines \"international financial institutions\" to include various organizations like the International Monetary Fund. It also defines a \"national of the United States\" as a citizen or lawful resident, including businesses. The term \"new investment\" refers to a commitment or contribution of funds, loans, or extensions of credit, excluding reinvestment of profits or contributions of money in Nigerian entities. (i) contributions of money or assets necessary for a Nigerian entity to operate economically without expanding its operations, defined as a corporation, partnership, or other business entity in Nigeria, or a branch, office, agency, or sole proprietorship in Nigeria of a person from outside the country."
