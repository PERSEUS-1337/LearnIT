    "content": "The Joint Cargo Aircraft (JCA) is a small, intra-theater airlifter being procured by the Army and Air Force. Small airlifters have filled niche roles for the Department of Defense (DOD) over the past several decades, flying missions to deliver time-sensitive cargo, transport important personnel, evacuate casualties, and resupply austere operating locations. During the Vietnam War, the Air Force flew C-123 Providers while the Army used C-7 Caribous for intra-theater airlift. Ownership of C-7 transferred to the Air Force in 1966, but they continued to fly them attached to Army units. The Air Force retired both the C-7 and C-123 after Vietnam due to funding scarcity. In the 1980s, the Air Force bought 18 C-23 Sherpas for supply transport between European bases. After the Cold War, six Sherpas were transferred to the Army before 40 more were acquired and assigned mostly to Army National Guard units. In 2004, the DOD began considering options to meet Army requirements for intra-theater airlift. The Army's Future Cargo Aircraft (FCA) program gained DOD approval in March 2005 with plans for an initial purchase of 33 FCAs to replace aging C-23s, C-26 Metroliners, and some C-12 Hurons. The FCA was intended to reduce reliance on ground convoys in Iraq and Afghanistan and decrease the heavy workload of Army transport helicopters. There is a persistent need for small tactical airlifters for homeland defense and disaster relief. The Army's Future Cargo Aircraft (FCA) program aimed to reduce reliance on ground convoys in Iraq and Afghanistan and ease the workload of Army helicopters. A rift between the Army and Air Force over FCA led to the development of the Light Cargo Aircraft (LCA) by the Air Force. The FCA and LCA programs were merged into the Joint Cargo Aircraft (JCA) program in 2005, with the Army leading the initiative. In 2006, an agreement was signed to jointly develop strategies for the JCA, with industry teams competing to provide aircraft. In 2006, industry teams competed to provide aircraft for the Joint Cargo Aircraft (JCA) program. The C-27J, C-295, CN-235, and C-130J were the aircraft offered. Lockheed Martin protested the elimination of the C-130J from the competition. L-3 Communications was awarded a $2.04 billion contract to build up to 78 C-27Js after winning the JCA competition in June 2007. The Army and Air Force had differences in their approaches to the intra-theater airlift mission. The Army's approach to the Joint Cargo Aircraft (JCA) program focuses on using it for direct support of ground operations by providing on-demand transport of time-sensitive cargo and personnel to forward deployed units. This approach was validated by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council in 2005, with updates made in 2007 to reflect the need for more airlift of time-critical cargo. The Joint Cargo Aircraft (JCA) program was approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council in 2005 for direct support of ground operations, with updates in 2007 for more airlift of time-critical cargo. The optimal airlift fleet should be diverse to meet serious threats and avoid specialization that hinders critical missions. The Air Force is responsible for organizing, training, and equipping for airlift, viewing JCA as providing general support for all users. The Air Force allocates aircraft to users based on priorities set by Joint Force Commanders for efficient use. A 2007 Rand study found C-27s to be a complement to other intra-theater platforms but less cost-effective than C-130Js. Further studies are requested on cost-effective missions for the C-27, comparisons to precision airdrop systems, and recapitalizing CH-47s and/or C-23s. Tactical airlift requirements are part of the Mobility mission. The Air Force allocates aircraft based on priorities set by Joint Force Commanders. A 2007 Rand study found C-27s to be less cost-effective than C-130Js. Further studies are requested on cost-effective missions for the C-27 and recapitalizing CH-47s and/or C-23s. JCA critics suggest diverting funds to procure larger tactical airlift models like C-130s and C-17s. The Army's helicopter modernization program may require a larger budget, and the services are pursuing a Joint Heavy Lift program to replace large-helicopter fleets. The precision airdrop system combines cargo platforms, steerable parachutes, and GPS receivers for accurate airdrops from high altitudes. Some Members question splitting tactical airlift between the Army and Air Force, while others support it. The Army argues for ownership of tactical airlifters for responsiveness in unforeseen contingencies. Critics see this as creating \"two air forces\" inefficiently. The Joint Cargo Aircraft (JCA) is seen by some as maintaining the status quo in roles and missions. The debate revolves around the command and control of Army transport helicopters for time-sensitive missions, with some advocating for all Joint Cargo Aircraft to be under Air Force control due to their established command structure. Army commanders argue for the ability to procure and use efficient vehicles for sustaining soldiers in Joint Operating Areas. The Army proposes making its aircraft available to a common-user airlift pool when not needed for direct support, but it is unclear if they are committed to the necessary command and control systems. Critics question the Air Force's long-term commitment to direct support, noting the retirement of tactical airlift aircraft without replacement. General Norton Schwartz questioned if the Air Force is willing to support the Army in the Joint Cargo Aircraft debate. The President requested funding for C-27Js for the Army and Air Force, but the Air Force's advance procurement and RDT&E funds were cut by House authorizers and appropriators. Concerns were raised about the lack of analysis justifying the Air Force's procurement of Joint Cargo Aircraft. The President requested $157 million for Army procurement and $42.3 million for Air Force RDT&E. House authorizers supported the request but stipulated that DOD could not obligate funds until requirements analysis was complete. Senate authorizers transferred funds from the Army to the Air Force's procurement account and questioned the Army's need for an organic fixed-wing airlift fleet. The 2008 Defense Authorization Act restored Army procurement funds but directed DOD to conduct a roles and missions review. Appropriators supported the President's request for procurement but cut funding for RDT&E as an \"unjustified request.\" Senate appropriators expressed a desire for additional analyses of intra-theater airlift requirements. The President requested funds for JCA lead procurement. The President requested $4.9 million for JCA lead procurement, which was fully supported by both authorizers and appropriators."
