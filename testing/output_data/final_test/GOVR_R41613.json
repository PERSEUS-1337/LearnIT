Additionally, on January 2, 2013, he signed bills related to biofuel credits and a maritime environmental program focusing on marine technologies and controlling aquatic invasive species. On December 20, 2012, President Obama signed P.L. 112-213 (H.R. 2838), which included provisions clarifying restrictions on American Fisheries Act vessels, creating a maritime environmental and technical assistance program for research on controlling aquatic invasive species, and amending the Marine Debris Research, Prevention, and Reduction Act. The Senate concurred with the House-amended H.R. 2838 on December 12, 2012, which included provisions related to defining severe marine debris events, authorizing foreign citizens in the U.S. distant water tuna fleet, and giving distant water tuna vessels in the western Pacific Ocean the option of using Guam as their port of call. This legislation aimed to address the increasing use of marine resources and proposed changes in environmental protection and sustainable resource management. The Obama Administration released final recommendations from its Ocean Policy Task Force in response to concerns about declines in marine resources and fragmented approaches to resource protection. Increasing pressures from economic activity and habitat loss are key issues, requiring Congress to balance diverse interests and consider altering laws for sustainable management of marine resources. The Obama Administration released final recommendations from its Ocean Policy Task Force to address declines in marine resources and fragmented resource protection. Congress is considering altering laws to promote sustainable management of fishery and marine resources, including the reauthorization of key laws governing fisheries, aquaculture, and marine mammals. The Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act are among the primary laws in focus. Before 1950, the federal government had limited involvement in marine fisheries, focusing on international treaties and interstate conflicts. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Latin American nations extended marine jurisdictions, leading to disputes over access to coastal waters. Foreign fishing vessels began entering U.S. offshore waters in the 1950s and 1960s to exploit seafood resources. In the 1950s and 1960s, foreign vessels exploited seafood resources in U.S. offshore waters, leading to concerns about overfishing. This prompted the U.S. to enact the Fishery Conservation and Management Act in 1976, extending marine fishery management to 200 miles of U.S. coasts. The Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 extended marine fishery management to 200 miles of U.S. coasts. President Reagan proclaimed a 200-mile exclusive economic zone in 1983, establishing a new regional management system prioritizing domestic enterprise. The National Marine Fisheries Service and eight Regional Fishery Management Councils were established to manage fishing rights. The regional fishery management councils, along with the National Marine Fisheries Service, develop and implement fishery management plans for various fish and shellfish resources. These plans are submitted to the Secretary of Commerce for approval and are implemented through regulations published in the Federal Register. Over 40 fishery management plans have been created, some for individual species and others for larger species assemblages. Many plans have been amended over time. The FCMA amendments led to a decrease in foreign catch allocations in federal offshore waters, with foreign catch declining to zero since 1992. Domestic offshore catch in federal EEZ waters increased significantly, reaching over 6.3 billion pounds in 1986-1988. Annual landings remained around 6 billion pounds until 2006 when Bering Sea pollock stocks started to decline. In 2011, U.S. commercial fishermen landed 7.9 billion pounds of edible fish and shellfish, valued at over $5.1 billion. U.S. imports of processed seafood products totaled 5.3 billion pounds, worth $16.6 billion. Consumers spent $85.9 billion on seafood, with $57.7 billion spent in restaurants. Marine recreational anglers caught 345 million fish, retaining about 201 million. In 2011, recreational anglers caught an estimated 345 million fish, retaining about 201 million pounds. A nationwide survey estimated that anglers spent over $41.8 billion on their sport. NMFS reported on the status of fish stocks, finding that 14% were subject to overfishing and 21% were overfished in 2011. This marked an improvement from previous years. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2006 addressed issues such as appointing and training regional council members, setting deadlines to end overfishing by 2011, and rebuilding depleted fisheries. The Fish Stock Sustainability Index showed progress in curbing overfishing from 2005 to 2012. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2006 aimed to end overfishing by 2011 and rebuild depleted fisheries. It also focused on considering economic and social impacts in fishery management, improving research programs and data collection, protecting deep sea corals and bottom habitat, implementing ecosystem-based management, promoting new gear technologies to reduce bycatch, establishing national guidelines for fishing quota programs, modifying regional council procedures, strengthening the role of science in decision-making, and authorizing appropriations for federal fishery management through FY2013. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2006 aimed to end overfishing by 2011 and rebuild depleted fisheries. Implementation activities included a report to Congress on controlling illegal fishing activities and new requirements for annual catch limits. The 112th Congress considered measures related to MSFCMA, including prohibiting new limited-access privilege programs for certain fisheries. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2006 aimed to end overfishing by 2011 and rebuild depleted fisheries. Congressional activities in 2011 included oversight hearings on MSFCMA success, NMFS enforcement actions, and NOAA's fishery science impact on jobs. The House Committee on Natural Resources held oversight field hearings in various locations to review fishery management plans and scientific basis for fisheries restrictions. Bills introduced in the 112th Congress addressed issues such as providing additional resources for research and monitoring priorities and reimbursing fishermen for legal fees. S. 1304 and S. 1312 aimed to reimburse fishermen for legal fees related to improper fines and establish a fisheries investment fund for regulatory compliance costs. H.R. 2610 proposed reforms to payment procedures from the Asset Forfeiture Fund, while H.R. 1646 sought to amend MSFCMA with various provisions including peer review of scientific recommendations and criteria for fishery closures. The House Committee on Natural Resources held hearings on various bills amending MSFCMA on December 1, 2011.

Additionally, H.R. 2838 included a provision requiring a report on the need for additional Coast Guard capability. The House Committee on Natural Resources held hearings on bills amending MSFCMA on December 1, 2011. H.R. 2838 included a provision for assessing the need for additional Coast Guard capability in high latitude regions, including for fisheries enforcement. On December 1, 2011, the House Committee on Natural Resources held hearings on various bills related to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSFCMA). The bills included provisions for Internet access to Regional Fishery Management Council meetings, fishing capacity reduction loans, and adding Rhode Island and New York to fishery management councils. Additionally, there were proposals to require annual fishery impact statements to evaluate management actions on fishing communities. Management of steelhead trout and salmon in U.S. Pacific coastal rivers and lakes is complex due to their migration patterns across state and national boundaries. Factors affecting their abundance include hydropower dams, harvests, habitat modification, and hatcheries. The Northwest Power and Conservation Council plays a key role in the Columbia River Basin. The Northwest Power and Conservation Council leads efforts in the Columbia River Basin to protect salmon habitat and provide affordable electric power. Federal agencies and utilities have invested millions in dam improvements, habitat enhancement, and water purchases to boost salmon survival. State governments and tribal councils are increasingly involved in salmon management. Endangered species listings have been made for declining salmon populations in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California. In 2006, a settlement agreement resolved a long-standing legal dispute over the operation of Friant Dam in California, which had impacted salmon in the San Joaquin River. The agreement addresses salmon restoration in the San Joaquin River affected by Friant Dam in California. It includes river channel improvements and water flow for Chinook salmon while minimizing water supply losses to Friant Division contractors. Congressional authorization was granted through P.L. 111-11. In 2010, agreements were made for the Klamath River Basin. The 112th Congress discussed Pacific salmon measures, including pesticide consultations under the Endangered Species Act. President Obama signed P.L. 112-55 (H.R. 2112) into law on November 18, 2011.

Aquaculture involves farming fish in marine pens or through ocean ranching. The U.N. FAO considers aquaculture as one of the fastest-growing food production activities, with production increasing significantly over the years. Wild fish populations have remained static, leading to a reliance on aquaculture for future fish production for human consumption. The U.N. FAO considers aquaculture as one of the fastest-growing food production activities, with production increasing significantly over the years. In 2006, FAO estimated that 47% of all fish consumed by humans came from aquaculture. FAO predicts that world aquaculture production could exceed 130 million metric tons by 2030, more than double the current wild fish harvest for human consumption. U.S. aquaculture, until recently and with a few exceptions, has been considered a minor industry. The U.S. Department of Commerce's Fisheries of the United States \u2014 2011 reported that in 2011 U.S. aquaculture production reached 753 million pounds with sales of $1,282 million. Catfish accounted for 478 million pounds and sales of $375 million while crawfish contributed 116 million pounds and sales of $177 million. The domestic aquaculture industry faces strong competition from imports of foreign aquacultural products, from the domestic poultry and livestock industries, and from wild harvests. The National Aquaculture Act of 1980 aims to coordinate federal programs and support research in the aquaculture industry. NOAA and the Department of Commerce released policies to address concerns about aquaculture development in the EEZ. Legislation to promote offshore aquaculture was introduced in the 110th Congress but not considered. The Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council approved a plan in 2009. In 2009, the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council approved a plan to regulate aquaculture in federal waters.

Various bills aimed to support aquaculture small businesses through tax credits and grants, while also addressing regulatory processes for wildlife and fish processing property financing. Additionally, the transfer of PacifiCorps Iron Gate Hatchery facilities to California was included in the Klamath Settlement. The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) was enacted in 1972 to address high dolphin mortality in the tuna purse-seine fishery. Critics argue it is scientifically irrational, but supporters highlight its role in promoting research and understanding of marine life. The MMPA established a moratorium on taking marine mammals in U.S. waters and importing marine mammals or products into the United States, protecting them from harm. The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) was enacted in 1972 to protect marine mammals from harm, including clubbing, mutilation, and capture. It authorized permits for certain purposes like scientific research. The Secretary of Commerce manages cetaceans and pinnipeds, while the Secretary of the Interior manages other species. The MMPA also established the Marine Mammal Commission (MMC) and its Committee of Scientific Advisors on Marine Mammals. The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) shifted marine mammal management authority to the federal government from states. It allows for management authority to be returned to states that adopt conservation programs consistent with the MMPA. Permits may be issued for scientific research or to enhance the survival of marine mammal species. The MMPA also allows for waivers of the moratorium on taking for specific purposes. The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) allows U.S. citizens to obtain authorization for taking small numbers of marine mammals incidental to activities like offshore oil and gas exploration, with monitoring requirements. The moratorium on taking does not apply to Native Americans in Alaska for subsistence or creating authentic handicrafts. The MMPA also authorizes taking marine mammals incidental to commercial fishing operations. The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) governs the taking of marine mammals incidental to activities like offshore oil and gas exploration. The tuna fishery was initially excluded from incidental take regimes and is governed by separate provisions. The MMPA was substantially amended in 1997 and 2003 to provide exemptions for \"national defense\" activities and military readiness activities. The Navy's use of mid-frequency sonar and its effects on marine mammals have been controversial. The MMPA was reauthorized in 1994, with authorization for appropriations expiring in 1999. The 1994 amendments to the Marine Mammal Protection Act indefinitely authorized incidental taking of marine mammals in commercial fishing operations and required assessment of marine mammal stocks in U.S. waters. It also included provisions for developing take-reduction plans for stocks impacted by commercial fisheries and studying pinniped-fishery interactions. A 2008 Government Accountability Office study found limitations in information available to accurately determine which marine mammal stocks meet statutory requirements for establishing take reduction teams. The Marine Mammal Protection Act amendments in 1994 allowed incidental taking of marine mammals in commercial fishing and required assessment of marine mammal stocks. However, there are limitations in data accuracy for 39 out of 113 marine mammal stocks, hindering their strategic status determination. NMFS faces funding constraints for data collection, and 14 marine mammal stocks lack take reduction teams despite significant interactions with commercial fisheries. Legislation in the 112th Congress addressed MMPA issues, including importation of polar bear trophies and fisheries restrictions for Steller sea lions. Legislation in the 112th Congress addressed MMPA issues, including importation of polar bear trophies taken in sport hunts in Canada. H.R. 991, H.R. 4089, S. 1066, and S. 3525 aimed to allow imports of polar bear trophies taken before the species was listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Hearings and reports were conducted on these bills, with the House passing some measures. Additionally, there were proposals to amend the MMPA to delete enforcement authority under the Lacey Act for polar bear management. The 112th Congress addressed MMPA issues, including permits for sea lion \"lethal taking\" to reduce predation on Columbia River salmon. H.R. 3069 and H.R. 2578 were passed by the House, amending offshore drilling operations under the MMPA. H.R. 909 / H.R. 3302 aimed to declare compliance with the Draft Proposed OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Program 2010-2015. The 112th Congress addressed MMPA issues, including permits for sea lion \"lethal taking\" to reduce predation on Columbia River salmon. H.R. 3069 and H.R. 2578 were passed by the House, amending offshore drilling operations under the MMPA. H.R. 909 / H.R. 3302 aimed to declare compliance with the Draft Proposed OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Program 2010-2015. Program 2010-2015 to be fully compliant with MMPA; hearings were held on H.R. 909 and bills like S. 52, S. 1453, H.R. 2714, and H.R. 4301 were introduced to amend MMPA regulations. The 112th Congress addressed MMPA issues, including permits for sea lion \"lethal taking\" to reduce predation on Columbia River salmon. Legislation introduced in the 112th Congress aimed to amend MMPA regulations, such as H.R. 2714 directing NOAA and FWS to coordinate federal permits for oil and gas projects, H.R. 594 establishing a jobs creation grant program for marine mammal research, H.R. 332 requiring federal defense agencies to comply with environmental laws, and S. 1402 amending MMPA penalties. Other bills like S. 203 and H.R. 3757 focused on oil spill prevention and response research by NOAA. Section 106 of H.R. 3757 directs NOAA to research oil spill prevention and response in Arctic waters, including impacts on marine mammals. It also amends the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 to provide funding for marine species rescue. Section 224 of H.R. 501 / H.R. 1870 amends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act regarding impacts on marine mammals. S. 2147 / S. 2154 establishes an Arctic Ocean Research Program for monitoring Arctic marine mammals. S. 1991 establishes a National Endowment for the Oceans. S. 3262 and H.R. 5898 amend the Whaling Convention Act. H.R. 5898 would have amended the Whaling Convention Act to authorize aboriginal subsistence whaling and set catch limits for bowhead whales. H.Res. 714 emphasized U.S. leadership in whale conservation and opposition to commercial whaling. H.R. 6145 authorized preservation assistance for the New Bedford Whaling National Historical Park. H.R. 4043 established special management areas for southern sea otters during military activities. The House passed H.R. 4310 in May 2012, which included language from H.R. 4043 regarding southern sea otters. The Senate later passed a version of H.R. 4310 without the sea otter language. H.R. 39 aimed to delist the polar bear as a threatened species. Various sections of different bills would have repealed exchange programs for Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and their historical whaling partners. The House Committee on Education and the Workforce reported H.R. 1891 in support of National Marine Awareness Day. Appropriations are crucial for federal fisheries management, with funding for NMFS programs provided within NOAA's OR&F Account. NMFS employs over 2,800 scientists and analysts for marine programs. NMFS employs over 2,800 scientists and skilled workers to implement its programs. Appropriations issues in the 112th Congress included funding levels for disasters, salmon habitat restoration, and endangered salmon stocks. The Administration's FY2013 budget proposed an increase in funding for NMFS in NOAA's OR&F account, offset by a reduction in the Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund. The Senate proposed an increase in NMFS funding by $26.3 million, while the House proposed a decrease by $32.4 million for NOAA's OR&F account in FY2013. The House passed H.R. 5326 with amendments, which includes provisions to prohibit funding for certain programs. The Senate proposed an increase in NMFS funding by $26.3 million, while the House proposed a decrease by $32.4 million for NOAA's OR&F account in FY2013. The House passed H.R. 5326 with amendments, which includes provisions to prohibit funding for certain programs. The FY2013 budget includes funding for various programs within the FWS budget, such as National Fish Hatchery operations, aquatic invasive species programs, and marine mammal programs. These programs employ about 800 individuals across different facilities. The Administration's FY2013 budget request proposes a decrease in funding for FWS's Fisheries and Aquatic Resource Conservation line item, with reductions mainly affecting National Fish Hatchery operations. The House Committee on Appropriations reported a bill proposing further cuts to FWS funding for FY2013. A continuing resolution provided funding through March 27, 2013, at FY2012 levels. The Marine Mammal Commission is an independent agency of the executive branch. The Marine Mammal Commission (MMC) is an independent agency established under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. It provides oversight and recommendations on domestic and international marine mammal topics. The FY2013 budget request for the MMC is $3.1 million, a 1.9% increase from FY2012 funding. The Senate Committee on Appropriations and the Administration recommend the same amount, while the House Committee on Appropriations suggests $3.0 million, 1.8% less than FY2012 funding. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $3.0 million for the Marine Mammal Commission in FY2013, which was 1.8% less than the Administration's request. H.R. 5326 was passed by the House on May 10, 2012, and a continuing resolution provided funding through March 27, 2013 at the FY2012 level."
