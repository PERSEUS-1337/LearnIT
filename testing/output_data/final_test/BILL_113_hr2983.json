    "content": "The Act titled \"Safe Hydration is an American Right in Energy Development Act of 2013\" requires testing of underground drinking water sources in connection with hydraulic fracturing operations. The Safe Drinking Water Act is amended to prohibit underground injection of fluids for hydraulic fracturing operations related to oil, gas, or geothermal production unless testing and data reporting are conducted in accordance with section 1421A. The Safe Drinking Water Act prohibits underground injection of fluids for hydraulic fracturing operations unless testing of underground drinking water sources is conducted in accordance with section 1421A. Regulations for State underground injection control programs require testing of underground sources of drinking water before commencing hydraulic fracturing operations for oil, gas, or geothermal production activities. Testing must be conducted at least once every 6 months after the initial injection. The regulations mandate testing of underground sources of drinking water before starting hydraulic fracturing operations. Testing is required at least once every 6 months after the initial injection, and at least once every 12 months during the 5-year period following the end of hydraulic fracturing operations. Additionally, for sites with no active underground injection but where it has occurred previously, testing is required before renewing injection and at least once every 6 months after renewal. The regulations require testing of underground sources of drinking water before and during hydraulic fracturing operations. Testing is needed at least once every 6 months after initial injection and once every 12 months for 5 years after operations end. For sites with previous injection activities, testing is required before renewal and every 6 months after. The regulations mandate testing of underground sources of drinking water before and during hydraulic fracturing operations. Testing is required every 6 months post initial injection and annually for 5 years after operations cease. Exceptions apply if no accessible underground drinking water source is within a one-mile radius of the site. Testing must cover all accessible underground drinking water sources within a half-mile radius of the operations site. The regulations require testing of underground drinking water sources before and during hydraulic fracturing operations. Testing must be done by EPA-certified laboratories and include analysis for hazardous substances. The Administrator will maintain a database of reported results for public access. The Administrator will maintain a publicly accessible database of reported results for hydraulic fracturing operations, searchable by zip code. The term 'accessible underground source of drinking water' is defined as a source that can be reasonably accessed.
