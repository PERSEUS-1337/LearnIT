The \"Rocky Mountain FIRES Act\" acknowledges the role of insects in shaping the forest ecology and the increased wildfire danger due to factors like fire suppression policies on Federal land. The \"Rocky Mountain FIRES Act\" recognizes factors contributing to severe wildfires on Federal land, including dense vegetation from reduced timber harvesting, drought weakening trees, and population growth near recreational areas. The Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 aimed to reduce fuel volume. The \"Rocky Mountain FIRES Act\" aims to reduce the risk of severe wildfires in the Rocky Mountain region caused by bark beetle infestations. It seeks to expedite responses from the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior to address this increased risk. The \"Rocky Mountain FIRES Act\" addresses widespread infestations of bark beetles and other insects on federal land in the Rocky Mountain region. The Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 is amended to include a definition for \"insect emergency area\" in the Rocky Mountain region, addressing widespread infestations of bark beetles and other insects on federal land. The Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 is amended to prioritize hazardous fuel reduction in the Rocky Mountain region, defining it as including Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming. The Secretary must allocate at least 70 percent of funds for hazardous fuel reduction projects in the Rocky Mountain region, prioritizing projects in the wildland-urban interface and areas near municipal water supply systems. The Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 is amended to include alternative analysis processes for hazardous fuel reduction projects in community wildfire protection plans, specifically in insect-emergency areas. The Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 is amended to include alternative analysis processes for hazardous fuel reduction projects in community wildfire protection plans, specifically in insect-emergency areas. SEC. 107 addresses actions relating to insect-emergency areas. The Secretary has the authority to designate insect-emergency areas based on observation of infestations, either on their own initiative or in response to a request from a State agency or political subdivision. The Secretary must approve or deny a request within 90 days. The Secretary can delegate authority to designate insect-emergency areas on National Forest System land only to a Regional Forester. Before making a determination, consultation with relevant agencies and officials, as well as public notice and comment, is required. Authorized hazardous fuel reduction projects in insect-emergency areas may be categorically excluded. Insect-emergency areas can be excluded from environmental impact statements and assessments under the National Environmental Policy Act if the project involves land identified for hazardous-fuel reduction in a wildfire protection plan. Decision to exclude must follow regulations, and stewardship projects are also included. The Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1999 allows hazardous fuel reduction projects in insect-emergency areas to last up to 15 years. The Secretary can relocate Forest Service personnel for silvicultural assessments in response to insect emergencies. Funds from the Mineral Leasing Act can be used for hazardous fuel reduction projects in insect emergency areas. The table of contents for the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 is amended by removing items related to sections 107 and 108 and inserting new content. SEC. 4. Community wildfire protection plan development assistance for at-risk communities in the Rocky Mountain region. Authorization of appropriations. The Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 is amended to provide planning assistance grants to at-risk communities in the Rocky Mountain region for wildfire protection plans. Funding of $5,000,000 from the Mineral Leasing Act is allocated for this purpose. The Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 allocates $5,000,000 annually from the Mineral Leasing Act for wildfire protection planning grants in the Rocky Mountain region. SEC. 5 amends the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act to include funding for fire prevention programs, including community wildfire protection plans. SEC. 6 introduces a Biomass Commercial Utilization Grant Program under the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003. The Secretary may provide annual grants to facilities using biomass for electricity, heat, transportation fuel, wood-based products, or commercial purposes. Priority is given to applications from those purchasing biomass from insect-emergency areas for fuel reduction projects. The Secretary may provide grants to facilities using biomass for various purposes, including fuel reduction projects. Grant funds can be used to purchase biomass, and the Secretary has the authority to support biomass fuel use. $10,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2007 to 2010 for this purpose. \"Establishment of central collection points for biomass utilization.\" The Secretary shall establish collection points for vegetative material from hazardous fuel reduction projects, subject to safe transportation and property owner consent. The Secretary will establish collection points for vegetative material from hazardous fuel reduction projects on non-government property with owner consent. The material can be sold, donated, or given to those who agree to remove it from the collection point. The Secretary will establish central collection points for vegetative material from hazardous fuel reduction projects on non-government property with owner consent."
