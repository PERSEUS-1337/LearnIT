The implementation of these benefits has been complex due to confusion and controversy over social policy and economic equity issues. The Supreme Court ruling in 1981 (McCarty v. McCarty) stated that former spouses of military members could not be awarded any share of retirement pay in divorce settlements in community property states due to federal law limitations. This decision addressed inconsistencies among states and criticisms of unfairness in the system. The Supreme Court ruling in 1981 (McCarty v. McCarty) prohibited the division of military retired pay in divorce settlements, suggesting that Congress may consider changing the law to provide more protection for former spouses of retired servicemembers. The Supreme Court ruling in 1981 (McCarty v. McCarty) prohibited the division of military retired pay in divorce settlements, prompting Congress to enact the Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act in September 1982. This act allows state courts to treat disposable military retired pay as divisible property, enables direct payments to former spouses, enforces alimony and child support, and provides provisions for military members or retired members. The Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act (USFSPA) allows military members to designate a former spouse as a beneficiary under the military Survivor Benefit Plan and defines eligibility for medical care benefits and commissary privileges. State courts can consider disposable military retired pay as divisible property in divorce settlements and establish procedures for direct payment to former spouses. Under the USFSPA, state courts can order the division of disposable retired pay in divorce settlements. The military department secretary can make direct payments to former spouses through DFAS. Eligibility for direct payment is required for former spouses. The USFSPA allows state courts to divide military retired pay in divorce settlements. DFAS manages these payments, with eligibility requiring at least 10 years of marriage and military service. The court-ordered division of retired pay must be included in the divorce settlement. The USFSPA does not affect alimony or child support obligations, and payments to former spouses must begin within 90 days of a valid court order. The USFSPA allows state courts to divide military retired pay in divorce settlements. Payments to former spouses must begin within 90 days of a valid court order. The amount of court-ordered retired pay is limited to 50% of disposable retired pay, or up to 65% if other provisions for garnishment exist. Payment orders are handled on a first-come, first-serve basis when the servicemember has multiple former spouses. The total amount paid out to ex-spouses cannot exceed 65% of disposable retired pay. The USFSPA limits direct payment to former spouses to 65% of disposable retired pay. Conflicting court orders are resolved by sending the lesser amount to the former spouse, retaining up to 50% of the difference, and allocating the retained amount according to the USFSPA. Military retired pay cannot be considered in a divorce settlement unless the court has jurisdiction over the servicemember. The USFSPA allows divorced spouses of military members to receive benefits from the DOD Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP), providing financial protection for surviving dependents. SBP coverage was extended to personnel who die while serving on active duty, starting from September 10, 2001. Changes to SBP coverage can only be made after the initial agreement if both parties consent. Changes to SBP coverage can be made after the initial agreement only if both parties agree. Retired pay is reduced to provide for survivor benefits. Former spouses can be named as beneficiaries for divorces before November 14, 1986, and courts can order SBP protection for divorces after that date. The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) statute was amended to allow coverage for a subsequent spouse if the former spouse dies. The USFSPA and subsequent amendments also authorized military benefits for certain un-remarried former spouses of military members or retirees. Eligibility depends on years of marriage and service. Eligibility for military benefits for un-remarried former spouses depends on years of marriage and service by the member. The 20/20/20 restriction, enacted in 1982, required a 20-year marriage and 20 years of military service for benefits, excluding some former spouses who almost met the criteria. Legislation enacted in 1984 established benefit eligibility provisions for former spouses who do not meet the 20/20/20 restriction. It provided full eligibility for medical care for former spouses whose marriage and service overlapped by 15 years or more, but less than 20 years. Additionally, a transitional medical care program was offered for former spouses who met the 20/20/15 restriction. The 1984 legislation established benefit eligibility provisions for former spouses not meeting the 20/20/20 restriction. It provided full medical care eligibility for those with marriages overlapping 15 years but less than 20 years. Transitional care was offered for those meeting the 20/20/15 restriction. Legislation enacted in 1988 limited transitional care to one year. Former spouses not meeting the 20/20/15 restriction could be covered under a private health care plan with premium payments determined by the court in the divorce settlement. The USFSPA provision, effective from June 26, 1981, did not apply to cases finalized before that date. Changes to court orders finalized before the McCarty decision should not be recognized if made after McCarty but before the effective date of the new title X. The applicability of the USFSPA to reopened cases remained ambiguous. The USFSPA provision, effective from June 26, 1981, did not apply to cases finalized before that date. Congress has control over federal compensation and benefits related to domestic relations law. Some former spouses may be ineligible for direct payment from the military services if their pre-McCarty divorces are reopened. Despite congressional language, some states continued to reopen pre-McCarty divorces for a division of retired pay. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1991 limited state courts' ability to consider retired pay in pre-McCarty divorces. Some state courts, like those in California, have reopened cases to award a share of retired pay despite Congress stating this was not intended. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1991 limited state courts' ability to consider retired pay in pre-McCarty divorces, despite some state courts reopening cases to award a share of retired pay. This action is inconsistent with the notion that a final decree of divorce represents a final disposition of the marital estate. Section 555 prohibits treating retired or retainer pay as property in any proceeding to divide such pay if a final decree of divorce was issued before the McCarty decision and did not treat retired pay as property of the member and spouse. This provision applies to judgments issued before or after the Act's enactment date. The implementation of the USFSPA has been confusing and frustrating due to inconsistent application of the law, especially regarding direct pay provisions and the definition of disposable pay for retired military personnel. Changes in other laws have further complicated the division of retired pay. A 1984 report by the GAO highlighted early implementation issues related to inconsistent language in court orders. In recent years, Congress addressed the issue of military retired pay for retirees qualifying for VA disability compensation. Provisions against \"dual compensation\" have been in place since 1891, preventing concurrent receipt of military retired pay and VA disability benefits. Military retired pay is offset by VA disability benefits for those eligible for both. VA disability benefits can offset military retired pay dollar for dollar. Retirees can receive both retired pay and disability benefits, with the disability benefits being tax-free. The definition of disposable retired pay for USFSPA excludes VA disability benefits. Prior to 2004, retirees could choose to waive retired pay equal to their disability benefit amount. The Combat-Related Special Compensation (CRSC) and Concurrent Retirement and Disability Program (CRDP) are programs that allow eligible servicemembers to receive both retired pay and certain disability compensation. CRSC is for combat-related disabilities with a VA rating of at least 10%, while CRDP is for service-connected disabilities rated at least 50% by the VA with 20 years of qualifying military service. CRDP was fully implemented in 2014 after a 10-year phase-in period. During the CRDP phase-in period, eligible retirees saw their retired pay increase, affecting former spouses who received a percentage of the retired pay. However, retired servicemembers with less than a 50% disability rating are not eligible for CRDP and must waive retired pay to receive VA disability pay, potentially reducing the amount a former spouse can claim in a divorce. The Supreme Court ruling in May 2017 stated that veterans cannot be ordered to make additional payments to former spouses for disability pay. This decision could negatively impact former spouses who rely on spousal support, especially those who had paused their careers to care for a disabled spouse. If a retired servicemember is eligible for CRSC, their disposable retired pay could be offset, leaving the former spouse with no pay to divide. CRSC payments are retroactive to January 1, 2003, potentially affecting the financial situation of former spouses. The CRDP and CRSC changes may lead to legal challenges in settled divorces, with calls for legislative action. The FY2014 NDAA considered protecting payments to former spouses before a servicemember's CRSC election, but this provision was not included in the final version. Military retired pay division could be affected by statutes on \"dual compensation\" for retired military members. Statutes on \"dual compensation\" for retired military members employed by the federal government as civilians capped or reduced retired pay based on their status as regular or reserve officers. The first category applied to retired regular officers, limiting their annual retired pay to a certain amount plus 50% of the remainder. In 1999, Congress repealed \"dual compensation\" restrictions for retired military members employed by the federal government, allowing them to receive their full military retired pay. This change affected retirees who were first employed by the federal civil service after January 11, 1979, and had their combined civil service pay and military retired pay capped to prevent it from exceeding a certain level. This cap led to reductions in military retired pay, impacting former spouses who were awarded a percentage share of the retiree's pay. The repeal of \"dual compensation\" restrictions in 1999 allowed retired military members employed by the federal government to receive their full military retired pay. This change affected retirees who were first employed by the federal civil service after January 11, 1979, and had their combined civil service pay and military retired pay capped. The repeal had an impact on benefits available to former spouses in divorce property settlements involving retired pay division. Military retirees receive benefits from two independent systems: military retired pay and Social Security. Federal civilian employees hired before January 1, 1984, are not covered by Social Security based on their civil service employment, but may receive benefits earned during other periods of covered employment. Various laws allow for crediting military service towards civil service retirement benefits and may require a reduction in civil service retirement benefits. The reduction of civil service retirement benefits may be required when a retiree becomes eligible for Social Security payments at age 62 without making a deposit for post-1956 military service. Retroactive deposits into the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund can eliminate recomputations at age 62 for those with military service credited to civilian retirement systems. Military retirees have options regarding military retired pay, Social Security, and civil service annuity, which can impact total income received by both the retiree and their divorced spouse from federal retirement systems. The retiree's income could be affected by decisions regarding military retired pay, civil service annuity, and Social Security benefits based on military service. Options include receiving three separate retirement benefits or waiving military retired pay for a civil service pension based on total federal service. Spouses and former spouses of deceased military retirees may also be eligible for Social Security survivor benefits. When a military retiree reaches age 62, their years of military service no longer count towards their civil service annuity, leading to a reduction in benefits known as \"Catch 62.\" One option to avoid this reduction is to make a lump sum deposit into the CSRDF. This option allows the retiree to receive both civil service retirement and Social Security benefits without a reduction in the civil service pension at age 62. Section 306 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1982 allows federal civilian employees with prior military service to avoid the reduction in their civil service annuity at age 62 by making a deposit into the retirement fund. This option is available for military retirees who elect to waive receipt of military retired pay to credit their military service towards federal civil service retirement. Annuities are not affected by \"Catch 62\" as military service is not credited towards civil service retirement. If a military retiree waives their military retired pay to credit their service towards a civil service pension, issues arise in dividing military retired pay under the USFSPA. Prior to 1996, waiving military retired pay reduced it to zero, preventing direct payments to the divorced spouse. This deprived the former spouse of court-awarded retired pay. The federal civil service pension could be divided, but neither the retiree nor the ex-spouse would receive military retired pay once the retiree began collecting civil service benefits. In 1996, Congress approved language allowing former spouses to receive payments based on military retired pay division if the retiree waived military pay for a civil service pension. This change was effective from January 1, 1997. The impact of USFSPA on military retirees and former spouses is complex, especially in the \"Catch 62\" situation. The decision to make a lump-sum payment into the CSRDF to avoid a reduction in civil service retirement benefits at age 62 is solely the federal civilian employee's responsibility. The decision to make a lump-sum payment into the CSRDF to avoid a reduction in civil service retirement benefits at age 62 is solely the federal civilian employee's responsibility, regardless of marital status. Retirees can benefit from making this deposit, potentially helping the retiree and former spouse. If a military retiree's ex-spouse is entitled to a share of the retiree's civil service pension, the ex-spouse can receive this share without incurring the cost of the deposit. Liabilities and benefits should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis for divorced military retirees employed as civilian federal employees. The downsizing of the Armed Forces post-Cold War led to various retirement options for military members, potentially impacting former spouses. Future retired pay as divisible property in court may be affected by these options, despite members not actually retiring due to the drawdown. Since the downsizing of the Armed Forces post-Cold War, retirement options for military members have varied, potentially affecting former spouses. The potential amount available under these programs may be less than under longevity retirement, and challenges to the implementation of the USFSPA have been addressed by the courts and through law amendments. Inequities in the law remain for many military retirees and their spouses, leading to calls for further review, revision, or repeal of USFSPA provisions. Military retired and retainer pay is often compared to civilian pay. Military retired pay is often compared to civilian pensions in divorce cases. Advocates argue for its division as divisible property, while opponents believe it is qualitatively different from pensions. The Department of Defense states that military retired pay is for establishing a retirement system and ensuring career service in the armed forces. The military retired pay is compared to civilian pensions in divorce cases. Advocates argue for its division as divisible property, while opponents believe it is different. The Department of Defense states that military retired pay ensures career service in the armed forces by providing competitive career options, promotion opportunities, economic security after retirement, and a pool of experienced personnel for recall during emergencies. Military members retire at a younger age compared to civilian pension beneficiaries. These provisions aim to keep the military force \"young and vigorous.\" The fourth purpose of military retirement benefits is to differentiate them from civilian pensions. Military retirees receive retired pay as compensation for reduced service and remain subject to recall and restrictions. Civilian pensions are based on benefits earned during employment, while military retirement benefits aim to keep the force \"young and vigorous.\" The military retirement system provides defined pensions for qualified members, with recent changes allowing for government matching contributions to retirement accounts. The new blended retirement system (BRS) will still allow courts to award up to 50% of retired pay to former spouses. Under the new blended retirement system (BRS), servicemembers will still receive a defined benefit once eligible for retired pay and be vested in government contributions to their TSP accounts after two years of service. TSP funds can be divided in a divorce settlement without limitation on the percentage awarded to a former spouse. The TSP will honor court orders for future payments if the present value of the payee's entitlement can be calculated. Servicemembers with over 12 years of service and National Guardsmen/Reservists with less than 4,320 points could opt into the new retirement system, potentially affecting divorce settlements finalized before January 1, 2018. Opting in could reduce the value of defined annuity and impact former spouse's payments. Those under the new system may receive continuation pay between 8 to 12 years of service, which could be divisible in a divorce. The new law allows servicemembers to choose a lump sum payment of retired pay at retirement instead of a monthly annuity. It is unclear if a court order in a divorce settlement can mandate this choice. Congress may need to consider treating the contributory portion of military retirement differently under USFSPA. Regular military retired pay is based on pay grade and years of service at retirement, not vested until 20 years of service. Divisible retired pay in divorce cases was previously calculated based on years of service at retirement. The USFSPA raised concerns about the division of retired pay at the time of retirement, rather than at the time of divorce, creating inequities for servicemembers and subsequent spouses. Dr. Lawrence J. Korb highlighted the potential unfairness of diverting up to 50% of a servicemember's retired pay without considering pay increases from the date of divorce to retirement. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2017, signed by President Obama, requires divisible retired pay to be calculated based on the member's pay grade and years of service at the time of the court order. Some argue this will add complexity to legal processes, while others support the frozen accrued benefit method as the most equitable approach. Some military retiree advocacy groups argue that the absence of a remarriage clause in federal statutory requirements for former spouses' benefits is inconsistent with other federal retiree programs. There is potential for multiple payments to a single individual, where a former spouse could receive payments from multiple servicemembers. Proposed changes to terminate payments upon remarriage have not been enacted. Since 1982, the nature of military families has changed with increased female representation, allowance of benefits for same-sex spouses, and a rise in dual-service marriages. Dual-service marriages now make up 12.3% of all active duty marriages, with over half of married females in the Marine Corps and Air Force married to other military members. Approximately 8.1% of active duty members' spouses are male. Frequent moves, deployments, and hardships persist for military families. Some civilian spouses of military members face challenges due to frequent moves and deployments. Female military spouses have lower employment rates and earnings compared to civilians. Approximately 41% of active duty military spouses work outside the home. However, some civilian spouses may have equal or higher earning potential. Dual military couples may not conform to traditional family management roles. For example, one spouse may support the other through graduate school after leaving the service. After a civilian spouse supports their partner through graduate school, they may divorce after 10 years of marriage. The military spouse continues their career until retirement, receiving military retired pay. The former spouse may receive up to 50% of the retired pay under USFSPA, while keeping their civilian pension. Arguments about primary responsibility for child care and household management during the marriage may arise. The USFSPA aims for equitable treatment of military benefits in divorce cases, but inconsistent definitions and application have hindered this goal. New laws unrelated to USFSPA may also impact the fair division of military benefits in divorce settlements."
