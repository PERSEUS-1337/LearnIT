    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"At-Birth Abandoned Infants Assistance Amendments of 1993\". The findings are also included in the Act. The Congress finds that thousands of infants in the United States are abandoned shortly after birth, leading to a lack of bonding with parents which is crucial for healthy development. The Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services recommends legislation to facilitate placing drug-exposed infants in foster care and adoptive homes. Current legal rules and agency policies make it challenging to terminate parental rights of abandoned infants, hindering their adoption. The welfare of infants abandoned shortly after birth is a societal concern, with a need for expedited procedures for child welfare cases involving drug abuse. The legislation should expedite the adoption of infants abandoned shortly after birth to ensure they are placed with suitable parents quickly. The purpose of this Act is to expedite the adoption process for infants abandoned at birth by appointing preadoptive parents to provide a loving home and initiate legal proceedings for adoption. State courts will make the final decision considering the rights of all parties involved. SEC. 4. ADOPTION BY PREADOPTIVE PARENTS OF CERTAIN ABANDONED INFANTS. Amends Title 1 of the Abandoned Infants Assistance Act of 1988 to require certain state laws as a condition of project grants. The Secretary may only grant funds to public or nonprofit entities in states with laws requiring prompt placement of abandoned infants with preadoptive parents. Designated abandoned infant placed with preadoptive parents can petition courts for expedited hearing to terminate parental rights and become adoptive parents. Courts cannot infer negatively based on petitioner's foster parent status. If preadoptive parents fail to petition within 90 days, the State takes action. During the 90-day period, the State must revoke the former preadoptive parents' designation and find new preadoptive parents for the abandoned infant. If no action is taken within 90 days, the State will intervene. The designated abandoned infant is defined as an infant under 18 months old who is abandoned within the first 6 months after birth. State laws enacted for this purpose should not conflict with existing laws regarding child abandonment. This amendment does not apply to children who turn 18 months old before the enactment of this Act. The effective date for the designated abandoned infant law is specified in Section 5. The amendments made by this Act apply to grants under the Abandoned Infants Assistance Act of 1988 for fiscal years after enactment. Delay is allowed if State legislation is needed for a project to meet grant conditions. The Act applies to grants under the Abandoned Infants Assistance Act of 1988 for fiscal years after enactment, allowing for delays if State legislation is required. Each year of a 2-year legislative session is considered a separate regular session of the State legislature."
