    "content": "The \"Conservation Security Act of 1999\" establishes the Conservation Security Program under the Food Security Act of 1985. This program aims to promote conservation practices among farmers. The Conservation Security Program established by the Secretary aims to assist farmers in promoting conservation practices such as soil, water, and wildlife habitat protection. To be eligible, farmers must submit a resource security plan or livestock nutrient management plan for approval. The Conservation Security Program requires farmers to submit a resource security plan or livestock nutrient management plan for approval. Owners or operators with over 1,000 animal units are not eligible for a contract specifying compliance with a livestock nutrient management plan. The resource security plan must identify resources to be secured and describe conservation practices to be implemented on the land. The livestock nutrient management plan required under the Conservation Security Program must manage manure and organic byproducts to protect air, water, and soil quality, in addition to complying with other terms set by the Secretary. The Secretary may require additional terms in resource security plans. Plans must align with state and local conservation priorities. Three classes of eligible conservation practices will be established. Certain practices will be included in one of the classes. The Secretary will establish three classes of conservation practices, including those listed in the National Handbook of Conservation Practices and any other practices deemed appropriate. Class I conservation practices will include residue management, nutrient management, and environmentally sound grazing. The Secretary will establish three classes of conservation practices, including Class II practices like comprehensive nutrient management, pesticide management, partial field conservation practices, intensive grazing, and wildlife habitat measures. Class III practices will include Class I and Class II practices, along with additional conservation measures. The Secretary will enter into a contract with the owner or operator specifying the land subject to the contract and the conservation practices to be carried out, including livestock nutrient management plans. The contract for a livestock nutrient management plan lasts 3-5 years and can be renewed for additional 5-year periods. The Secretary may require modifications if changes to the farming operation interfere with the conservation program. Under a contract entered into under subsection (e), an owner or operator of a farm or ranch must agree to any necessary modifications to the resource security plan or livestock nutrient management plan determined by the Secretary for the conservation security program. Compliance with the terms and conditions of the plans and the contract is required during the contract term. The operator of a farm or ranch must agree to implement approved resource security or livestock nutrient management plans, keep required records, avoid activities that undermine the conservation program, and forego payments from other conservation programs for the contracted land. The Secretary is responsible for overseeing the resource security plans. The Secretary is responsible for overseeing resource security plans, which involve making annual rental payments to owners or operators based on the type of land and conservation practices used. The Secretary oversees resource security plans, making annual rental payments based on land type and conservation practices. Rental rates vary depending on the conservation practices used, such as Class II and Class III practices. Livestock nutrient management plans also receive annual rental payments under contracts.
