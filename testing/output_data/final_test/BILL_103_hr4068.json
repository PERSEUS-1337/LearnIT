    "content": "The \"California Forest Ecosystems Health Act\" includes sections on short title, findings, definitions, ecosystem management plans, implementation process, research program, and miscellaneous requirements. The Act aims to address the health of National Forest System lands in California. The Congress acknowledges the degradation of forest structure and health in California's National Forest System lands due to recent management policies. They believe that the Forest Service can use ecosystem management to restore the health and vigor of these lands, recognizing that ecosystems are constantly changing. The National Forest System lands in California provide various resources and benefits to the people of the United States. Ecosystem management aims to balance outdoor recreation, range, timber, watershed, fish, and wildlife needs while protecting soil and air quality and promoting forest research. These lands house unique forest ecosystems globally. The National Forest System lands in California house unique forest ecosystems like giant sequoias, coastal redwoods, and bristlecone pines. Destructive forest fires classified as \"intense\" have been occurring in unprecedented numbers, posing a threat to forest health and human safety. The Forest Service can reduce the frequency of these fires through ecosystem management, improving forest vigor and visitor safety by considering the needs of all species and their interactions with humans. The management of forest ecosystems in California must balance conservation needs with human activities. Sound management options must be socially acceptable, ecologically sustainable, scientifically sound, legally responsible, and economically viable. Management practices in local ecosystems can impact demand for commodity outputs globally. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" is a concise statement defining key terms or concepts within a document or legislation. It is important for providing clarity and understanding of the content that follows. For purposes of this Act, \"adaptive management\" refers to the experimental application of scientifically derived decisions to improve future management. \"Ecosystem\" is defined as a community of organisms and their environment functioning as a unit. \"Ecosystem management\" integrates ecological, economic, and social factors to meet biological and human needs through diverse, healthy ecosystems. The curr_chunk defines terms related to ecosystem management on National Forest System lands in California, including ecosystem management plans, National Forest System, seral stages, Secretary, and stand. The curr_chunk discusses the concept of \"vigor\" in forest ecosystems, referring to the health of tree stands and their ability to protect themselves from pests and natural disasters. SEC. 4. ECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT PLANS FOR NATIONAL FOREST SYSTEM LANDS IN CALIFORNIA. The Secretary of Agriculture must develop and implement ecosystem management plans for National Forest System lands in California, incorporating any existing statutory provisions for special management areas. Ecosystem management plans for National Forest System lands in California must enhance renewable natural resources' health, protect soil, air, and water resources, and improve forest ecosystems towards desired conditions. This includes creating a variety of wildlife habitats and designing forest seral stages accordingly. The ecosystem management plans for National Forest System lands in California aim to enhance renewable natural resources' health, protect soil, air, and water resources, and improve forest ecosystems towards desired conditions. This involves designing forest seral stages to meet the needs of species, minimize wildfire risk, maintain stand health, and support the economic well-being of communities. The ecosystem management plans for National Forest System lands in California focus on enhancing renewable natural resources' health, protecting soil, air, and water resources, and improving forest ecosystems towards desired conditions. This includes concentrating management activities on the condition of renewable resources, emphasizing tangible management results over procedural standards, and considering historical conditions before European settlement. Management on National Forest System lands in California aims to promote desired forest conditions by avoiding the allocation of specific land tracts for ecosystem management, considering habitat needs across a broad landscape, harmonizing multiple uses, and using adaptive management for resource decision-making. Management under ecosystem management plans on National Forest System lands aims to consider the entire landscape, benefit renewable resources and human resources, design projects for multiresource benefits, promote desired forest conditions, and achieve maximum project efficiency. Ecosystem management plans specify minimum acres for activities in National Forest System units to establish desired forest conditions. In cases of natural disasters, the Secretary may adjust the schedule for forest treatment to allow for restoration activities. Ecosystem management plans are developed with public input, particularly from local communities affected by the plans. Consultation with interested parties continues during plan evaluation and modification. The process for full implementation of ecosystem management plans is outlined in Section 5. The Secretary will progressively implement ecosystem management plans for National Forest System lands over a five-year period starting from January 1, 1995, with full application by January 1, 2000. Each year, the plans will be expanded to contiguous areas as necessary. The Secretary may modify ecosystem management plans to incorporate lessons learned and new information through adaptive management. Plans will be updated based on research, projects, and monitoring findings to achieve specified principles. Regulations for plan modifications will be issued within the first two years of the implementation period. Resource plans and permits for National Forest System lands covered by an ecosystem management plan must be consistent with the plan, even if it is modified. Supplemental documents under the National Environmental Policy Act must be prepared for existing resource plans and permits upon adoption or modification of the ecosystem management plan. Any revisions to existing plans must align with the supplemental document findings. Any revisions to permits, contracts, and other instruments must align with supplemental document findings and be agreed upon by all parties involved. The Secretary is required to implement a research and monitoring program as part of ecosystem management plans to measure the effects of management regimes. Monitoring must be sufficient to measure resource responses and guide future management decisions. The Secretary must increase the use of certified professional practitioners for field work on National Forest System lands covered by ecosystem management plans. Accountability procedures must be developed to measure and report to Congress annually on work achieved with appropriated funds. The procedures must be in place within the first two years of the specified period to ensure work is accomplished as planned. The Secretary will develop budgets for each management unit of the National Forest System based on estimated benefits from ecosystem management activities. Managers will have flexibility to achieve objectives within budgets, with detailed explanations of expenditures and resource benefits required."
