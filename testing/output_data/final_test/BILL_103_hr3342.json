    "content": "Establishment of toll free number pilot program. The Secretary of Commerce will establish a 3-year toll-free number pilot program to help consumers identify products made in America. Manufacturers must provide fees for the program to operate at no cost to the Federal Government. The program will be announced in the Federal Register, and a contract will be entered into for its establishment and operation. The toll-free number pilot program, funded by fees collected under section 2(c), will inform consumers if products are registered as made in America or equivalent. Registration does not imply government endorsement, product investigation by the Secretary, or 100% US content. SEC. 2. REGISTRATION. The Secretary of Commerce will propose a regulation for manufacturers to voluntarily register products as made in America, establish a fee to cover registration costs, create a toll-free number pilot program, and gather input from the private sector on interest in product registration. The Secretary of Commerce will propose regulations for manufacturers to register products under specific terms and conditions. If deemed necessary based on feedback, the Secretary will implement a toll-free number pilot program and product registration. Manufacturers will be subject to a registration fee to cover costs, which should not exceed the cost of registering their products. The registration fee for manufacturers should not exceed the cost of registering their products and providing necessary information. Fees collected will be credited to the Secretary of Commerce's account for salaries and expenses, available until expended. Fees imposed under paragraph (1) must be collected annually as specified in appropriation Acts and used only for costs outlined in paragraph (2). SEC. 3. PENALTY.\n\nManufacturers registering non-American products under section 2 face a civil penalty of up to $7500 and cannot sell the product to the Federal Government. SEC. 4. DEFINITION.\n\nFor purposes of this Act, \"made in America or the equivalent thereof\" refers to products that are either unmanufactured end products mined or produced in the United States, or end products manufactured in the United States with 90 percent or more of their components' value coming from the U.S. The term \"product\" applies to items with a retail value of $250 or more. SEC. 5. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.\n\nThis Act and regulations under section 2 do not affect the Federal Trade Commission Act or its rules on the use of \"made in America\" labels on products in commerce."
