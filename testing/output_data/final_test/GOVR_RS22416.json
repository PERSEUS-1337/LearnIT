    "content": "Historically, crime control was primarily handled by local and state governments, but as crime increased, the federal government began providing support through grant programs like the Byrne Formula Grant and LLEBG. In 2005, these programs were combined into the JAG program to assist state and local law enforcement in controlling domestic crime. This report provides background information on the JAG program. The JAG program was formed by combining the Byrne Formula Grant and LLEBG programs to provide federal assistance to state and local governments for criminal justice programs. The Byrne Formula Grant program, authorized in 1988, awarded funds to states for personnel, equipment, training, and other resources to combat crime. The Byrne Formula Grant and LLEBG programs provided federal assistance to state and local governments for criminal justice programs, including adjudication, detention, and rehabilitation of offenders. Grant funds could also be used for victim assistance. The LLEBG program aimed to combat crime and increase public safety by funding police officers or crime prevention programs. The Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005 combined the Byrne Grant with other programs. The Byrne Formula Grant and LLEBG programs were combined into the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program (JAG) by the Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005. JAG funds are allocated based on a state's population and reported violent crimes, with half of the allocation based on population share and the other half on violent crime statistics. The JAG program allocates funds to states based on their population and reported violent crimes. Each state is guaranteed a minimum allocation of 0.25% of the total amount appropriated. States with initial allocations below the minimum receive the minimum amount, while those above receive the minimum plus a share of the remaining funds based on population and crime data. The JAG program allocates funds to states based on population and reported violent crimes. 40% of the state's allocation is awarded to units of local government based on their proportion of violent crimes. Units of local government eligible for direct allocation must receive $10,000 or more. The remaining funds are administered by the state, distributed to state police departments and units of local government not eligible for direct awards. The JAG program, similar to the Byrne Formula Grant program, requires states to pass through a percentage of funds directly awarded to them. The pass-through percentage is based on state expenditures on criminal justice. The Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005 consolidated program purpose areas under the JAG program, allowing flexibility for states and local governments to address local needs. JAG funds can be used for various initiatives, training, equipment, and support. The JAG program provides technical assistance, training, equipment, supplies, and support for various criminal justice programs. Funding for JAG has averaged $440 million per fiscal year since FY2005, with a general downward trend in providing assistance to state and local law enforcement. The Byrne Formula Grant, LLEBG, and JAG programs receive funding to support state and local law enforcement. Funding for JAG has been below the authorized amount of $1.095 billion per fiscal year, with the highest appropriation being $546 million in FY2009, representing 50% of the authorized amount."
