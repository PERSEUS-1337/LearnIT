    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Fort Stanton and Rio Bonito Corridor Vegetation Management Act\". Congress finds that the lands surrounding Fort Stanton, New Mexico, contain historic and natural resources that require special management by the Bureau of Land Management. The adjudication process for grazing preferences has not been conducted on acquired lands, and vegetation sales contracts could benefit renewable forage resource management. Management is needed to maintain and enhance forage and natural resources in the area. Grazing animal management under vegetation sales contracts requires more resources than the current grazing preference system on public lands. Disputes over land descriptions along the Rio Bonito in Lincoln County, New Mexico, require legal remedies from the Bureau of Land Management. SEC. 3.
