    "content": "The \"Physician Availability Act of 1997\" requires physician availability in acute care hospitals. The \"Physician Availability Act of 1997\" mandates that covered hospitals must have a qualified physician available 24/7 for inpatient care. Covered hospitals are defined as subsection (d) hospitals with participation agreements under specific sections of the Social Security Act. The \"Physician Availability Act of 1997\" requires covered hospitals to have a qualified physician available at all times for inpatient care. Covered hospitals exclude federal facilities and small hospitals with fewer than 100 licensed beds. A physician is defined as a doctor of medicine or osteopathy authorized to practice medicine and surgery in the hospital, while a qualified physician is one whose credentials have been verified. The Physician Availability Act of 1997 mandates that hospitals must have a verified physician available at all times for inpatient care, excluding federal facilities and small hospitals. A physician is considered available if physically present in the hospital, not in the emergency room, and primarily attending to inpatients. The Physician Availability Act of 1997 requires hospitals to have a verified physician available for inpatient care at all times, excluding federal facilities and small hospitals. If a hospital violates this requirement, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will issue a warning and monitor compliance. Subsequent violations will result in further action by the Secretary. If a hospital violates the Physician Availability Act, they may face a civil money penalty of up to $100,000 and must submit a remedial plan to prevent future violations. The Social Security Act provisions apply to these penalties. Subsequent violations will lead to further penalties by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. If a hospital knowingly violates the Physician Availability Act, the Secretary may disqualify them from Medicare and Medicaid programs and federal funding until compliance is assured. Failure to submit a required remedial plan may result in further penalties. If a hospital fails to comply with the Physician Availability Act or does not implement a required remedial plan, the Secretary can suspend funding under Medicare, Medicaid, and federal grants until assurances of compliance are provided. This section will be effective six months after the enactment of the Act."
