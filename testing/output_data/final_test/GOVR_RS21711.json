    "content": "Many individuals are turning to online pharmacies for prescription drugs, while more physicians are using the Internet and email in their practice. This technology offers cost savings, convenience, accessibility, and improved privacy and communication for both doctors and patients. However, some online pharmacies, known as \"rogue sites,\" engage in illegal practices like selling unapproved or counterfeit drugs or dispensing drugs without a prescription. Online pharmacies allow patients to obtain prescriptions through online questionnaires reviewed by doctors, despite potential risks. Regulation of online pharmacies involves federal laws by the FDA and DEA, ensuring safety and legality of prescription drugs. The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) establishes sanctions for unlawful possession, manufacturing, distribution, or importation of controlled substances. State boards regulate pharmacy practice and medical boards oversee medicine practice, with laws varying by state. The CSA aims to allow legal distribution of controlled substances for medical use while preventing illegal diversion. It covers drugs with high abuse potential like heroin and cocaine, as well as those with lesser abuse potential. The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) regulates drugs with high abuse potential like heroin and cocaine, as well as prescription drugs with lesser abuse potential. Some prescription painkillers are regulated under the CSA due to their potential for abuse and physical dependence. Internet pharmacies have been dispensing large quantities of addictive substances, leading to instances of addiction, overdose, and death. The federal government is prosecuting doctors for illegal distribution of controlled substances due to online prescriptions without proper examination. Penalties under the CSA include fines, forfeiture, and imprisonment. The FDA regulates prescription drugs under the FFDCA, which requires valid prescriptions for dispensing. State laws define valid prescriptions under pharmacy laws. Certain activities, like prescribing drugs without an in-person examination, may be illegal in one state but ambiguous in another due to varying state definitions of valid prescriptions. Congress has considered legislation to establish a federal definition of a valid prescription to address concerns about rogue online pharmacies. This legislation may include proposals for a single federal standard for prescriptions or requirements for online pharmacies to disclose information about themselves and the doctors approving prescriptions. Congress has also explored limiting rogue sites' business practices, such as restricting their ability to advertise on search engines or accept credit card payments. Google no longer accepts advertising from unlicenced pharmacies and prohibits the use of certain controlled substances as keywords for search purposes. Placing limits on search engines, credit card companies, and shipping entities may be one way to control illicit sales by foreign online pharmacies. Online prescription drug sales raise legal questions involving drug importation. The FFDCA prohibits anyone other than the U.S. manufacturer from importing. The FFDCA prohibits drug importation of prescription drugs originally manufactured in the U.S. Online pharmacies selling drugs from foreign countries violate the FFDCA. The CSA prohibits unapproved importation of controlled substances. State boards of pharmacy regulate pharmacy practice, with some federal oversight from the FDA. State boards of pharmacy have regulatory authority over pharmacies within the state and those dispensing drugs across state lines. State pharmacy laws vary, with some addressing online prescription validity. Critics suggest a federal definition for valid prescriptions and national industry standards are being promoted. The National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP) promotes uniform national standards for the pharmacy industry through programs like Verified Internet Pharmacy Practice Sites (VIPPS) to ensure online pharmacies are legitimate and safe. The NABP warns against buying prescription drugs online without a valid prescription and in-person examination. Canadian pharmacies may be certified under the VIPPS program but cannot export drugs to the U.S. The practice of medicine is regulated by state medical boards to protect consumers. The regulation of physicians is primarily done by state medical boards, which have the authority to discipline doctors for violating state laws. However, the strength and effectiveness of these laws vary widely between states. The FSMB has specific guidelines for online pharmacies and doctors prescribing drugs over the Internet. FSMB guidelines emphasize the importance of in-person evaluations before online treatment. Online pharmacies are recognized but caution is advised against prescribing based solely on online consultations. Doctors prescribing online should be licensed in all patient states for oversight by respective medical boards. These professional standards are not legally enforceable without state laws. The legal framework for regulating online pharmacies and doctors is a patchwork of federal and state laws. Some doctors and pharmacies exploit gaps to prescribe dangerous drugs, leading to proposed solutions by legislators and interest groups."
