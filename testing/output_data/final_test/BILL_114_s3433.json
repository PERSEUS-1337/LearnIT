The Act defines \"applied research\" as research to gain knowledge for meeting specific needs and advancing practice, and \"basic research\" as research for fundamental knowledge without specific application. The curr_chunk defines terms related to the Department of Labor, including Chief Evaluation Officer, Department, dissemination, and evidence-based research standards. The curr_chunk defines evidence-based research standards as rigorous, systematic, and objective methodology to obtain reliable knowledge relevant to Department programs. The curr_chunk discusses the criteria for evidence-based research standards, including reliable data collection methods and the presentation of detailed study methods for replication. The term \"Office\" refers to the Office of Labor Evaluation and Research. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of terms related to labor and scientifically valid evaluation criteria. It emphasizes adherence to high research standards, examining program impacts, and analyzing achieved results. The curr_chunk focuses on scientifically valid research criteria for evaluating program impacts, emphasizing experimental designs and strong causal inferences. It includes applied and basic research meeting evidence-based standards. The curr_chunk defines terms related to technical assistance in accordance with evidence-based research standards. The curr_chunk establishes the Office of Labor Evaluation and Research. The Office of Labor Evaluation and Research is established in the Department, headed by a Chief Evaluation Officer. Its mission is to coordinate and implement evaluation and research programs related to labor issues, collaborating with other agencies to ensure evidence-based standards are met. The Chief Evaluation Officer is appointed by the Secretary based on substantial knowledge and expertise in the Office's functions. The Chief Evaluation Officer oversees evaluations, research, and policymaking activities that meet evidence-based standards.
