    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Hospital Payment Improvement and Equity Act of 2006\" and includes an appeals process for hospital wage index classification. The \"Hospital Payment Improvement and Equity Act of 2006\" establishes a process for hospitals to appeal their wage index classification and select a different area within the state for reclassification. Appeals must be filed by February 15, 2007, and will be heard by the Medicare Geographic Reclassification Review Board. The Medicare Geographic Reclassification Review Board's decision is final with no further review. Qualifying hospitals can be reclassified to a selected area for a 3-year period. Special rules apply to qualifying hospitals within 3 miles driving distance. The hospital can choose to be reclassified to the nearest Metropolitan Statistical Area where other qualifying hospitals have been reclassified. Special rules apply to competitively disadvantaged hospitals in single-hospital MSAs surrounded by rural counties. If a hospital in a single-hospital MSA surrounded by rural counties meets specific requirements, it will be deemed a qualifying hospital and reclassified to the closest urban area in the same state that is part of a Combined Statistical Area. The requirements include being the only hospital in its urban area. The hospital in an urban area seeks reclassification to the closest urban area in the same state, part of a Combined Statistical Area. Certain provisions of the Social Security Act do not apply to appeals under this section. If a qualifying hospital wins an appeal, it will be reclassified to the closest urban area. The wage index reclassification for qualifying hospitals does not affect other hospitals or areas and is not budget neutral. A qualifying hospital is defined as a subsection (d) hospital that does not qualify for a change in wage index classification based on distance or commuting requirements and meets other criteria such as quality. The Secretary may modify wage comparison guidelines under section 1886(d)(10)(D) of the Social Security Act for this section. The term \"wage index classification\" refers to the geographic area used to adjust DRG prospective payment rates. A special rule applies to rehabilitation hospitals and units for discharges during a specific 3-year period starting from April 1, 2007. During a 3-year period starting from April 1, 2007, payments under section 1886(j) of the Social Security Act to qualifying rehabilitation facilities are based on their location in a specific Metropolitan Statistical Area. A qualifying rehabilitation facility is defined as one located in an area where all subsection (d) hospitals have been reclassified to another Metropolitan Statistical Area. The Metropolitan Statistical Area for qualifying rehabilitation facilities is determined based on the reclassification of subsection (d) hospitals within the same area."
