    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Native Act to Transform Imagery in Various Environments.\" It includes findings related to the Act. The Congress recognizes the unique historical and legal relationship with American Indian and Alaska Native people, with 564 federally recognized Indian tribes in the US. Indian tribes have the responsibility for lands, people, and education within their jurisdiction, including providing adequate educational facilities for their students. Indian schools should be eligible for funding under this Act to discontinue the use of offensive names and symbols that are disrespectful to Native Americans. Over 1,200 schools nationwide use such offensive names, which often become mascots at athletic events. Federal funding should be available to assist schools in ending the use of these offensive terms. Indian schools can receive funding to stop using offensive names and symbols on equipment and apparel, including team jerseys, signs, stationery, walls, fields, and gymnasium floors. Indian schools can receive grants to eliminate offensive names and symbols on equipment and apparel. Grants may be provided to eligible schools by the Secretary of Education to help them stop using derogatory or discriminatory names or depictions as team names, mascots, or nicknames. The grants must be used for replacing uniforms or materials with the offensive names or depictions. The Secretary of Education may provide grants to eligible schools to remove derogatory or discriminatory names or depictions. Grants can be used for altering facilities and for school construction or renovation. Before granting funds, the Secretary must consult with Indian tribes. To apply for a grant under this section, an applicant must submit an application with required information as determined by the Secretary. The Secretary is required to consult with Indian tribes regarding the grant. The Committee on Indian Relations is established. The Committee on Indian Relations, established within the Department of Education, is tasked with identifying derogatory school names or depictions, informing schools using such names, and assisting in grant-making under this Act. The Committee on Indian Relations assists the Secretary in making grants and provides cultural proficiency training at schools to address derogatory names or depictions. The Committee has a Director appointed by the Secretary in consultation with tribal governments and may appoint staff as needed. The Committee will terminate at the end of fiscal year 2015. SEC. 5 of the Act prohibits derogatory or discriminatory names and depictions, listing specific names like Indians, Redskins, Braves, and Chiefs.
