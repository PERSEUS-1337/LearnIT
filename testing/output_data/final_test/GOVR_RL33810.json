    "content": "Hyperlinking, in-line linking, caching, framing, and thumbnails on the Internet present challenges for courts in determining their relation to a copyright holder's rights. The issue is whether internet activities can constitute copyright infringement or fall under fair use. Search engines play a key role in this, with courts previously ruling in favor of fair use for displaying thumbnail images. Recent cases have also considered caching, linking, and display by search engines. In recent cases, courts have addressed Internet search engine practices such as caching, linking, and displaying thumbnails in relation to copyright infringement. The Ninth Circuit found in Field v. Google that displaying cached images did not infringe copyright, and in Perfect 10 v. Amazon.com Inc., they ruled that using thumbnail images, in-line linking, and framing were noninfringing. Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corp. is a significant case where the court discussed fair use rights and a copyright holder's exclusive rights in the context of a visual search engine. Arriba developed a program to crawl the Internet for images, download full-sized copies onto its server, and generate thumbnails. The search engine displayed thumbnail images on a \"Results\" page, allowing users to view full-sized images by double-clicking. Initially, full-sized images were displayed through in-line linking, but later, thumbnails were accompanied by a. From July 1999 to August 2000, Arriba's search engine displayed thumbnails with \"Source\" and \"Details\" links. Clicking \"Details\" showed the thumbnail and a link to the original site, while clicking \"Source\" opened two windows with the full-sized image and the original webpage. This framing technique led to a copyright infringement lawsuit by Kelly, as Arriba copied 35 of Kelly's photos into its database. Currently, clicking a thumbnail directs users to the original site via an \"out line\" link. Kelly sued Arriba for copyright infringement over the use of thumbnails and in-line links. The district court found Arriba's use of thumbnails and full-sized images to be fair use. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the fair use of thumbnails but reversed the decision on in-line display of larger images. The court ruled that Kelly owned the copyright to the images and Arriba copied them. The court ruled in favor of Kelly in the copyright infringement case against Arriba for using images without permission. The fair use exception was considered, weighing factors such as the purpose of use, nature of the work, amount used, and impact on the market. The court found that the thumbnails used by Arriba were transformative and served a different function than the original images, weighing in favor of fair use. The nature of the copyrighted work slightly favored Kelly, while the amount used did not favor either party. The court found that the use of thumbnails by Arriba was transformative and did not harm the market for the original images, leading to a fair use decision. Google sought damages and relief against Google for allowing users to access cached images. The court explained Google's automated process of crawling the internet, analyzing web pages, and storing them in a temporary cache for indexing. Google displays Web pages in search results with titles, snippets, and URLs. Users can access cached versions of pages stored in Google's system. The court highlighted industry-wide mechanisms for accessing cached pages. The court emphasized industry-wide mechanisms for website owners to communicate with search engines, such as \"meta-tags\" and \"no-archive\" tags to prevent cached links. Despite questionable motives, the court discussed copyright infringement claims against Google for copying copyrighted web pages. The court found that Google had an implied license to display the copyrighted work due to the lack of meta-tags instructing the search engine not to cache the pages. Google also successfully argued for defenses such as estoppel in the copyright infringement case. The court found that Google had an implied license to display the copyrighted work due to the lack of meta-tags instructing the search engine not to cache. Google successfully argued for defenses like estoppel in the copyright infringement case. The court also concluded that Google's use of the cached material met the criteria for fair use, as it served an archival function for users to access content when the original page was unavailable. The court found that Google's display of entire web pages in its cached links serves transformative and socially valuable purposes, citing legal precedents where copying an entire work is considered fair use. Despite the plaintiff's argument that Google's activity could undercut potential licensing fees, the court found no evidence of harm to the market value of the copyrighted work. The court found that Google operates in good faith by honoring industry-wide protocols for caching links. The court also held that Google is protected by the safe harbor provision of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. In Perfect 10 v. Amazon.com, the Ninth Circuit revisited issues from a previous case involving Google and Amazon.com. Perfect 10 sought to prevent Google from displaying thumbnail images and both Google and Amazon from linking to infringing websites. The district court found in-line linking and framing to be non-infringing uses of protected content, therefore not enjoining Google from linking to third-party websites with infringing images. The court ruled against Perfect 10 in its claim against Google for linking to images, but did issue a preliminary injunction against Google for displaying thumbnail versions of the images. The court of appeals upheld the ruling on linking and framing but reversed the decision on the use of thumbnail images, deeming it fair use. The case was remanded to the district court for further consideration of contributory copyright infringement and DMCA immunity. In Perfect 10 v. Google, a district court considered the issue of thumbnails in the context of copyright infringement. Perfect 10, an adult magazine publisher, sued Google for displaying thumbnail copies of its copyrighted photos and linking to third-party websites hosting infringing images. The court addressed direct, contributory, and vicarious copyright infringement claims, highlighting the clash between IP rights and internet technology. The district court in Perfect 10 v. Google addressed the clash between IP rights and internet technology, specifically regarding the display of copyrighted images on search engines. The court found that Google's in-line linking and framing of full-size images from third-party websites was not infringing, but displaying thumbnail images was likely infringing. The key issue was whether linking or framing constitutes a \"display\" for copyright purposes. The court in Perfect 10 v. Google examined the issue of whether linking or framing constitutes a \"display\" for copyright purposes. Two theories were presented: the \"server\" test by Google and the \"incorporation\" test by P10. The server test defines a display as serving content over the web, while the incorporation test considers a visual perspective on when a display occurs. The court in Perfect 10 v. Google examined whether in-line linking constitutes a \"display\" for copyright purposes. The court adopted the \"server\" test over the \"incorporation\" test, stating that in-line linking does not itself \"display\" the content for copyright purposes. This decision was based on the technological appropriateness of the server test and how content travels. The court in Perfect 10 v. Google adopted the \"server\" test over the \"incorporation\" test for in-line linking. The server test is seen as technologically appropriate and does not invite infringing activities by search engines. It aims to prevent search engines from being held directly liable for hosting infringing content. The court reasoned that the server test maintains a delicate balance between encouraging creative works and disseminating information on the internet. Google's use of thumbnail images was found to be not a fair use as it was deemed commercial, leading to increased user traffic and advertising revenue. This decision was based on the court's analysis of statutory fair use criteria. Google's use of thumbnails was found to be commercial as it generated revenue through an ad sharing program with third-party websites hosting infringing images. The court determined that while Google's use was transformative, it also superseded the original purpose by allowing users to download images directly, impacting the market for reduced-size images. Google's use of thumbnails from Google allowed users to download images directly, impacting the market for reduced-size images. The court found that Google's use was transformative and did not harm the market for full-size images, but it did harm the potential market for sales of reduced-size images to cell phone users. The court also rejected allegations of contributory and vicarious copyright infringement. The court of appeals affirmed that linking and framing images did not violate copyright holder's rights. While some users may be confused by framing, the Copyright Act does not protect against consumer confusion. Cached webpages are stored on the website publisher's computer, not Google's. The appellate court ruled that the burden of proving fair use in a copyright infringement case lies with the defendant. Google had to demonstrate fair use once Perfect 10 showed likelihood of success in overcoming the defense. The appellate court ruled that the burden of proving fair use in a copyright infringement case lies with the defendant, shifting the burden to Google to demonstrate fair use once Perfect 10 showed likelihood of success. The court of appeals disagreed with the district court's analysis on fair use, emphasizing the transformative nature of a search engine's display as an electronic reference tool. A search engine transforms images into pointers directing users to information, providing social benefit by creating a new electronic reference tool. The court found search engines to be more transformative than parody, as they offer a new use for original works. Google's profit from AdSense did not outweigh the public interest value of transformative use. The court found that Google's use of thumbnails was transformative and more significant than any superseding use or minor commercial aspects. The court disagreed with the district court's conclusion that this factor weighed in favor of Perfect 10. Additionally, the court rejected the argument regarding the effect of Google's use on the market for the sale of full-sized images. The court rejected the argument that market harm can be presumed for commercial use of images. Transformative use outweighed potential harm to the market for thumbnails, leading to vacating of the preliminary injunction. The automatic caching of full-sized images was deemed transformative and fair use, with minimal impact on the owner's rights and significant public benefit. The court of appeals focused on Google's potential secondary liability for copyright infringement, specifically contributory and vicarious infringement. Third-party websites were found posting infringing copies of images, leading to a reconsideration of Google's liability. The Supreme Court's definition of contributory and vicarious infringement was applied in this case. The Ninth Circuit held that a computer system operator can be contributorily liable for copyright infringement if they have actual knowledge of infringing material and can take measures to prevent it but continue to provide access to infringing works. Google was found to substantially assist websites in distributing infringing copies worldwide and enabling users to access them. Google could be held contributorily liable for copyright infringement if it had knowledge of infringing material on its search engine, could prevent further damage, and failed to do so. The court found that Perfect 10 did not show Google had the legal right to stop direct infringement by third-party websites. Search engines like Google are often defendants in online copyright infringement cases due to their vital role in Internet connectivity. The DMCA provides a safe harbor for Internet service providers acting as passive conduits for third-party content, raising complex liability issues. The district court was directed to consider Google's eligibility for DMCA limitations on liability. The function of search engines is expanding with the growth of Internet offerings in various formats. Search engines play a crucial role in enabling users to post and find content online. Commercial search engines benefit from the traffic they generate. Courts are applying traditional copyright principles to the Internet, considering factors like functionality and architecture. In a case like Kelly, the Ninth Circuit found displaying thumbnail images as a search tool to be transformative and fair, but reserved judgment on in-line linking and framing. In Perfect 10, the Ninth Circuit reaffirmed fair use analysis derived from Kelly, stating that in-line linking and framing were not displays for copyright purposes. The court also considered thumbnail displays in the context of search engines displaying infringing images and deriving advertising revenue. The court in Perfect 10 case reaffirmed fair use analysis regarding in-line linking and framing not being displays for copyright purposes. It also acknowledged the social utility of online indexing and balancing conflicts between useful functions and emerging markets for content owners."
