The MHS, which includes Defense Department hospitals and clinics, aims to maintain the health of military personnel for their missions and be prepared for wartime healthcare delivery. Serving over 9.4 million beneficiaries, the MHS is one of the largest health systems in the U.S. Its primary mission is to ensure the health and wellness of military personnel and provide healthcare during wartime. The Military Health System (MHS) provides medical and dental care to uniformed services members and their dependents, supports medical readiness of armed forces, conducts medical research, and offers humanitarian assistance during military operations. Health care is delivered through Department of Defense facilities or civilian providers. The MHS operates 681 facilities and employs over 63,000 civilians and 84,000 military personnel. The Military Health System (MHS) provides medical and dental care to uniformed services members, retirees, and their dependents through TRICARE programs, including TRICARE for Life, TRICARE Young Adult, TRICARE Reserve Select, and TRICARE Retired Reserve. Additional benefits such as pharmacy, dental, and vision plans are available to certain beneficiaries based on sponsor's duty status and location. The MHS is administered by five primary DOD organizations. The Military Health System (MHS) is administered by five primary DOD organizations: Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs (ASD(HA)), Defense Health Agency (DHA), Army Medical Command (MEDCOM), Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED), and Air Force Medical Service (AFMS). Each entity has distinct responsibilities in executing the primary mission of the MHS. A governance structure has been established to facilitate decision-making, maintain oversight, and coordinate health programs and services. The MHSER advises DOD leadership on strategic issues and is comprised of senior leaders including the USD(P&R) as Chair. The SMMAC is the highest governing body in the MHS, providing guidance on operational issues. The SMMAC is the highest governing body in the MHS, advising the ASD(HA) on enterprise-level guidance and operational issues. The MDAG ensures coordination with MHS strategy and is comprised of senior military health leaders. The Medical Business Operations Group (MBOG) and the Manpower and Personnel Operations Group (MPOG) are part of the MHS structure, providing resource management and human resources support, respectively. The chairmanship rotates among members, ensuring collaboration and oversight in sustaining and improving the MHS. The MPOG supports centralized policy execution and guidance for human resources in the MHS. The eMSM Leadership Group consists of Market Managers from six geographic MHS markets, providing a forum for discussing issues and opportunities. The ASD(HA) is advised by the Policy Advisory Council (PAC). The DHA, supported by the Policy Advisory Council (PAC), manages TRICARE, the Defense Health Program, and the Medicare Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund. It focuses on medical readiness for the Armed Forces and oversees shared services within the MHS. The DHA Director leads the organization, exercises management responsibility for shared services, functions, and activities of the MHS, and supports the effective execution of the DOD medical mission. Responsibilities of administering and managing MTFs were transferred to the DHA as directed by the National Defense Authorization Act. The first wave of MTFs transferred include Womack Army Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, 81st Medical Group, 4th Medical Group, and 43rd Medical Squadron. The transfer of responsibilities for administering and managing Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) to the Defense Health Agency (DHA) must be completed by September 30, 2021. The military service medical departments will focus on other statutory responsibilities after this date, such as medical readiness and providing personnel to support combatant commander requirements. The DHA Director leads the organization and supports the effective execution of the DOD medical mission. The ASD(HA) prepares and submits a unified medical budget that includes resources for medical activities within DOD. The budget covers fixed MTFs, real property maintenance, environmental compliance, base operations support, health care delivery, and medical personnel. Funding for combat support medical units/activities is the responsibility of combatant or military service commands. Unified medical budget funding is traditionally appropriated through the defense appropriations bill. The bill provides funding for Defense Health Program, including Operation and Maintenance, Procurement, and Research, Development, Test and Evaluation. Military medical personnel and TRICARE for Life payments are funded under the Military Personnel title, while medical military construction is funded under the Department of Defense title. Transfers from the MERHCF to reimburse TRICARE for services to Medicare eligible retirees are mandated, and war-related military health care costs are funded through supplemental appropriations bills. Additional resources come from third-party collections authorized by 10 U.S.C. \u00a71097b(b). The Trump Administration's FY2019 unified medical budget request totals $50.6 billion, including $33.7 billion for the DHP, $8.9 billion for MILPERS, $0.4 billion for medical MILCON, and $7.5 billion for accrual payments to the MERHCF. The MERHCF covers Medicare-eligible beneficiaries, regardless of age, and was established by the Floyd D. Spence NDAA for FY2001. The DOD Medicare-Eligible Retiree Health Care Board of Actuaries oversees the MERHCF, which has assets of over $239.3 billion to cover future expenses. The Board reports annually to the Secretary of Defense and every four years to the President and Congress on the fund's status. The ASD(HA) manages the operational oversight of the MERHCF, while the Defense Finance and Accounting Service provides accounting and investment services. TRICARE is a health insurance program with various benefit plans and options for beneficiaries based on their relationship to a sponsor, sponsor's duty status, and geographic location. It originated from the Dependents Medical Care Act of 1956. The Dependents Medical Care Act of 1956 allowed members, retirees, and dependents to seek care at Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). In 1966, the Military Medical Benefits Amendments permitted the Department of Defense (DOD) to contract with civilian health providers for non-hospital-based care for eligible dependents and retirees. This led to the establishment of the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS), later renamed TRICARE in 1994. TRICARE is overseen by two regional offices and administered through managed care support contracts. TRICARE is overseen by two regional offices and administered through managed care support contracts. The TRICARE East regional contractor is Humana Military, overseeing the East Region which includes multiple states. The TRICARE West region is overseen by HealthNet Federal Services, with contracts re-competed in 2015 and operational as T-2017 in 2017. Health care delivery began under these contracts on January 1, 2018. TRICARE Overseas Program Office administers TRICARE outside the U.S. Eligibility is determined by the uniformed services and recorded in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System. TRICARE beneficiaries are categorized as sponsors and dependents, with eligibility recorded in DEERS. TRICARE Prime is a managed health care option similar to an HMO, with a primary care provider managing overall health care and facilitating referrals to specialists. Referrals are generally required for specialty care visits. TRICARE Prime is a managed health care option similar to an HMO, with enrollees receiving first priority for appointments at MTFs and paying less out of pocket. Active duty servicemembers are required to use TRICARE Prime, while others must pay an annual enrollment fee. TRICARE Prime is only offered in designated Prime Service Areas near MTFs and former military locations. TRICARE Select is a self-managed, preferred provider option. TRICARE Select is a self-managed, preferred provider option available worldwide for eligible beneficiaries. It allows greater flexibility in managing healthcare without requiring a referral for specialty care. Enrollees can use non-network civilian providers at a higher cost and may need prior authorization for certain services. TRICARE Select features an annual enrollment fee, deductibles, and fixed co-pays for network providers or a percentage of the allowable charge for non-network providers. Eligible beneficiaries residing outside the US can still enroll in TRICARE Select. Beneficiaries residing outside the US can enroll in TRICARE Select, but network provider availability may be limited by location. TRICARE Reserve Select (TRS) is a premium-based health plan for Selected Reserve members and their families, with similar benefits and costs to TRICARE Select. Members pay 28% of the program cost. TRICARE Retired Reserve (TRR) is a premium-based health plan for qualified retired National Guard and Reserve members under 60 and their eligible family members. It was authorized under Section 705 of the NDAA for FY2010. Unlike TRICARE Select, there is no government subsidy for TRR, so members must pay the full cost of premiums and an additional administrative fee. For CY2019, monthly premiums are $42.83 for member-only and $218.01 for member and family coverage. Upon reaching the age of 60, retired Reserve Component members and their eligible family members become eligible to purchase TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select. TRICARE Young Adult (TYA) allows unmarried children up to age 26 to purchase individual coverage. Unlike TRICARE Select, there is no government subsidy for TYA, and a separate premium is charged. The law requires payment of monthly premiums for TRICARE Young Adult (TYA) Prime and Select. TRICARE for Life (TFL) serves as supplemental coverage for Medicare-eligible military retirees, functioning as a secondary payer to Medicare. TFL covers out-of-pocket costs for Medicare and TRICARE services. Beneficiaries must enroll in and pay for Medicare Part B to participate in TFL, with limited cost-sharing and no enrollment charge. TRICARE-eligible beneficiaries entitled to Medicare Part A but decline Part B lose TRICARE benefits. Enrollment in Medicare Part B can be done later with penalties. TRICARE health plan enrollment during open enrollment or after a Qualifying Life Event. DOD directed creation of integrated pharmacy benefits program. The DOD pharmacy benefits program ensures availability of pharmaceutical agents through MTF pharmacies, TRICARE retail pharmacies, and the TRICARE Mail Order Program. ESI administers the TRICARE pharmacy programs since 2003. ESI administers the TRICARE pharmacy programs, maintaining a national network of pharmacies and processing claims for beneficiaries at no additional cost. The program follows the Uniform Formulary, selecting drugs based on clinical and cost effectiveness. A Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee updates the formulary, with input from a Beneficiary Advisory Panel. The Beneficiary Advisory Panel (BAP) reviews and comments on formulary recommendations before they are approved by the DHA Director. The BAP includes representatives from various organizations and contractors involved in the TRICARE pharmacy program. TRICARE beneficiaries can fill prescriptions at Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) without a copayment, and MTFs are required to stock a subset of the Uniform Formulary. The DHA's Pharmacy Operations Division collaborates with DSCP and VA in developing contracting strategies for national pharmaceutical initiatives. TRICARE beneficiaries can also fill prescriptions at retail pharmacies. TRICARE beneficiaries can fill prescriptions at retail pharmacies, including a national network maintained by ESI. Beneficiaries may also use non-network pharmacies but must pay upfront and file a claim for reimbursement. DOD requires generic drugs when available, with brand-name drugs dispensed only after clinical assessment and approval by ESI. TRICARE beneficiaries can arrange for home delivery of prescription drugs through ESI, with lower prices than retail pharmacies. Use of home delivery increased by 23% from FY2013 to FY2017 due to education campaigns, copayment adjustments, and a pilot program. Copayment amounts were adjusted in the NDAA for FY2018. The copayment amounts for 2018 to 2027 are codified in 10 U.S.C. \u00a71074g(a) and listed in Table 4. After 2027, the Secretary of Defense can adjust cost sharing amounts for pharmaceutical agents and prescription dispensing. The Extended Care Health Option (ECHO) program provides supplemental health care and non-medical services for military families with special needs, covering services to reduce the disabling effects of qualifying conditions. The ECHO program offers benefits for infants or toddlers with neuromuscular developmental conditions or other qualifying conditions. There are three categories of ECHO benefits: general services, ECHO Home Health Care, and applied behavioral analysis for autism spectrum disorder. Dependents of active duty servicemembers enrolled in a TRICARE health plan are eligible for ECHO. Eligible dependents of active duty servicemembers enrolled in a TRICARE health plan can register for the ECHO program if they have a qualifying physical or mental disability. There are no costs to register, but monthly cost shares apply when using the benefit, capped at $36,000 per beneficiary per fiscal year. Respite care under EHHC is not included in the cap. Annual service and supply costs exceeding the cap are the responsibility of the beneficiary. The TRICARE program assigns priorities for care in Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Active-duty servicemembers have the highest priority, followed by their enrolled family members, retirees, and other eligible persons. Military retirees and their dependents do not have an entitlement to MTF care but may receive it on a space-available basis. MTF commanders can grant exceptions to the priority system. MTF commanders can grant exceptions to priority groups for care, including cases required by law or DOD policy. Access to care standards were established in 1995 to ensure timely care for TRICARE Prime beneficiaries. This includes offering appointments for Urgent/Acute Care within 24 hours and Routine Care within a 30-minute drive-time. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) does not directly impact TRICARE administration, health care benefits, eligibility, or cost to beneficiaries. Access standards for TRICARE Prime beneficiaries include timely appointments for Routine Care, Well-Patient Visit/Preventative Care, Specialty Care, and limited office wait times. Beneficiaries must also have 24/7 access to their primary care manager or designee by telephone. The ACA opened a special Medicare Part B enrollment window for certain individuals to gain eligibility for TFL. It waived the late enrollment penalty for military retirees, spouses, and dependent children eligible for TRICARE and Medicare Part A. DOD utilizes reimbursement methods similar to Medicare for inpatient and outpatient care. The TRICARE program aligns payment levels with Medicare's fee schedule for health care services, with exceptions granted by DOD when necessary for adequate access to care. Reimbursement for inpatient care at civilian hospitals follows the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system, using the same coding scheme as Medicare. Rates for each DRG are determined by DOD and updated annually, similar to CMS calculations. TRICARE reimburses hospital-based outpatient services using the TRICARE outpatient prospective payment system (OPPS), similar to Medicare's program. Services are categorized into Ambulatory Payment Classification (APC) groups with assigned reimbursement rates. DOD publishes quarterly updates for APC rates, consistent with CMS. Other outpatient services in non-hospital settings are reimbursed using the allowable charge method. TRICARE regulates civilian health care provider billing, limiting charges to 115% of DOD fee schedule rates. Reimbursement is based on CMAC rates or billed charges, with exceptions for excessive balance billing. Congress has expanded health benefits for Reserve Component members based on duty status. Some military personnel and retirees believe they were promised \"free medical care for life\" at enlistment, but this was not based on laws or regulations. In 1993, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs clarified that there is no entitlement to free medical care for life. Some military personnel and retirees believe they were promised \"free medical care for life\" at enlistment, but federal courts have clarified that current statutes or regulations do not grant such a right. In Sebastian v. U.S., the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that unconditional lifetime free medical care was not authorized as an inducement to joining or continuing in the armed forces. The Retirees argue that a specific section gave them the right to free medical care, but this was not agreed upon. The 1922 Manual of the Medical Department of the United States Navy provided guidelines for hospital care but did not grant Navy officers free unconditional lifetime medical care. Retirees do not have a legal right to the health care they claim was promised at enlistment. The courts have clarified that there is no enduring and broad right to unconditional free lifetime medical care for military personnel. In 2002, an appeal of Schism v. U.S. held that a legal right to free health care for life does not exist due to lack of authority from Congress. The Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program (CDMRP) is a congressional appropriation for biomedical research in specified health matters, funded separately from the President's budget request. In FY2019, 67% ($1.47 billion) of the Defense Health Program's RDT&E appropriation was for the CDMRP, administered by the USAMRMC for awarding competitive grants. Members of Congress can request funding for medical research through the annual defense appropriations process. The Department of Defense prohibits the use of funds for abortions except in specific circumstances. Live animals are only used for training when no alternatives are available, such as in pre-deployment training for medical personnel."
