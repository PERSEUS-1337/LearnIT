President Johan Schrijver highlights the challenges faced by exporters and export insurance providers during the financial crisis. The Berne Union members are facing challenges due to tight liquidity and a sharp decline in global trade volume. Risk concerns have shifted to developed economies, the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, and political instability in the Middle East. Members expect economic growth to slow in 2012, putting pressure on export credit agencies. Concerns are raised about banks' ability to fund trade and investment amidst regulatory changes and funding challenges. Any further deterioration in bank capacity for trade finance could have serious consequences for global trade and economic recovery. Berne Union members are advocating for the availability of export credits and trade insurance to support global trade.

The U.S. government indirectly influences the Union through oversight of member agencies like the U.S. Export-Import Bank and the Overseas. The U.S. government has oversight responsibility for the U.S. Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, which provide information on export credit finance and foreign investment. U.S. private sector firms in the Berne Union look to Congress for support in these areas, especially due to increased risks from terrorist activities. The United States plays a leading role in international trade, finance, and investment due to its vast economic and security interests. Congress plays a crucial role in resolving issues that impact important U.S. interests in international trade and finance markets."
