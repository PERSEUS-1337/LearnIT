Congress finds that the Corps of Engineers investigated the Columbia River and identified sites for power production, including the Grand Coulee Dam location. They recommended power development by local authorities or private utilities under the Federal Power Act. Licensees must compensate Indian tribes for land use under the Act. In August 1933, the Columbia Basin Commission received a permit for water power development at the Grand Coulee site. In the mid-1930s, the Federal Government federalized the Grand Coulee Dam project and began construction. The government recognized compensable interests of the Spokane Tribe and the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation in the project. In 1940, Congress granted the United States all rights of Indian tribes in land of the Spokane Tribe and Colville Indian Reservations for the Grand Coulee Dam project, leading to the extinguishment of a salmon fishery and inundation of land with loss of potential power sites identified by the Spokane Tribe. In 1940, Congress granted the United States rights to land of the Spokane Tribe and Colville Indian Reservations for the Grand Coulee Dam project. The Secretary of the Interior determined compensation for the land and rights-of-way. In 1994, after years of litigation, Congress ratified an agreement between the United States and the tribes. In 1994, Congress ratified an agreement between the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation and the United States for damages and annual payments of $15,250,000 in perpetuity, based on revenues from the Grand Coulee Dam project. Legal opinions and studies recognized this agreement. The Spokane Tribe faced similar damages as the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation but was unable to bring a civil action due to a 5-year statute of limitations. The Bureau of Indian Affairs' failure to fulfill its advisory responsibilities contributed to the Spokane Tribe's inability to seek damages before the Indian Claims Commission. The Spokane Tribe faced damages due to the construction of the Grand Coulee Dam project, resulting in the loss of the salmon fishery, hydropower sites, and revenues. The Commissioner of Indian Affairs imposed improper requirements on claims attorneys, causing delays in retaining counsel and investigating potential claims. The Spokane Tribe suffered damages from the Grand Coulee Dam project, losing salmon fisheries, hydropower sites, and revenues. Over 39% of the land used for the project belonged to the Spokane Tribe, leading to ongoing financial losses recognized by the Federal Government. The Act aims to provide fair compensation to the Spokane Tribe for losses incurred due to the Grand Coulee Dam project, similar to the compensation provided to the Colville Reservation. SEC. 4.

USE AND TREATMENT OF SETTLEMENT FUNDS. Transfer of Funds to Spokane Tribe:\nWithin 60 days of receiving a resolution from the Spokane Business Council, the Secretary of the Treasury must transfer settlement funds to the Council. If not all funds are transferred initially, subsequent requests can be made for additional transfers. The settlement funds received by the Spokane Business Council will be divided, with 25% reserved for general benefit to all members of the Spokane Tribe and 75% used for various programs. Annual payments can be used or invested by the tribe in the same manner as other governmental funds. The Spokane Tribe will have full control over the settlement funds received, without needing approval from the Secretary of the Treasury or the Secretary of the Interior. They will also not be under trust responsibility for the investment, supervision, administration, or expenditure of the funds after transfer. After the settlement funds are transferred to the Spokane Tribe, they will be treated as tribal governmental funds and subject to an annual audit. SEC. 7. REPAYMENT CREDIT.

The deduction exceeding interest on debt for the generation function will be allocated to other interest payments. Any excess deduction will be credited against other payments to the Treasury. SEC. 8. Payment by the Administrator under section 5 satisfies the Spokane Tribe's claim to a fair share of hydropower revenues from the Grand Coulee Dam project. SEC. 9.
