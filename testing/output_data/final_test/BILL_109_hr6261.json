    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Mercury Reclamation Act of 2006\". It includes findings related to mercury reclamation. Mercury is a bioaccumulative toxin found in air, water, and soil, posing a health threat. Communities have suffered from accidental and intentional mercury releases, leading to harmful exposure and costly remediation. A National Academy of Sciences report highlights the risk of adverse neurodevelopmental effects in over 60,000 children annually due to methyl mercury exposure in utero. Current Federal hazardous waste regulations allow land disposal of highly contaminated mercury wastes without treatment, despite studies showing this is not protective of human health and the environment. In 2003, over 26,000,000 pounds of mercury wastes disposed of in landfills did not meet EPA treatment standards. The EPA does not know how millions of pounds of mercury wastes are treated before land disposal. The Government Accountability Office found that states and landfill operators misidentify highly contaminated mercury wastes as \"debris\", allowing them to be landfilled without proper testing or reclamation. Current Federal laws do not provide the necessary information to track mercury-containing items from generation to disposal, leading to environmental pollution and health risks from mercury exposure. The improper management of mercury-containing wastes leads to environmental pollution and health risks from mercury exposure. Despite the benefits of using mercury-based compact fluorescent lighting for energy conservation, less than twenty-five percent of mercury-containing lamps are recycled annually, resulting in the release of mercury from over one-half billion lamps disposed of in solid waste without any recovery. The Federal government should develop programs to increase the collection and recycling of mercury-containing lighting devices to achieve energy conservation and environmental protection goals. Current laws and regulations allow discarded mercury items to escape regulation, leading to improper disposal of significant waste. Improved tracking of mercury-containing wastes is crucial to ensure proper disposal and recovery of mercury, preventing environmental harm. SEC. 3. MERCURY WASTE PACKAGING, TRACKING AND STORAGE. Amendment of Solid Waste Disposal Act to include new section on mercury waste management. The Administrator and the Secretary of Transportation will review and update regulations on storage, transportation, tracking, and packaging of mercury-bearing solid waste to protect public health and the environment. New regulations will address deficiencies in current rules within 18 months of the Mercury Reclamation Act of 2006. The regulations under this section aim to track the generation, treatment, and disposal of mercury wastes, holding waste generators and facilities accountable for proper identification and documentation of mercury wastes. This includes ensuring proper treatment and disposal of devices containing mercury before disposal. Tracking requirements for mercury-bearing waste include whether the shipment is intended for mercury reclamation and justifying if not. Standards for widely generated wastes aim to improve tracking without burdening waste collection and transportation. Packaging standards are based on current reviews. The Administrator will establish packaging standards for mercury-bearing waste shipments to prevent mercury release during transportation and storage. Household waste is exempt from tracking and packaging standards until received by a disposal facility. Enforcement for violations will follow the same provisions as section 3008. The table of contents for subtitle D is amended to include new provisions for enforcement of violations similar to section 3008. \"Sec. 4012. Mercury waste packaging, tracking, and storage. The Solid Waste Disposal Act is amended to include a new section on mercury device recycling.\" Effective 60 days after enactment, anyone generating solid waste with mercury-containing devices must ensure proper treatment for mercury reclamation or transfer waste to a responsible party. Household waste is exempt from these requirements. Regulations will be established by the Administrator to enforce this subsection. The Administrator will develop a voluntary compliance program to collect mercury-containing items exempted from solid waste regulations. State and local governments retain authority for mercury waste reclamation. State Programs: States can adopt programs for reclaiming mercury from solid waste, which exempts them from certain federal requirements. Enforcement for violations of these requirements will follow existing provisions. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will reassess the 100 kg/month exemption for small quantity generators of mercury-containing wastes to determine if it is protective of public health and the environment. Additionally, there is a requirement for mercury reclamation from hazardous mercury wastes. The Solid Waste Disposal Act is amended to require the recovery of mercury from hazardous waste containing concentrations equal to or exceeding 260 mg/kg before land disposal. The Administrator may limit the organic content and use of mercury recovery technologies for certain wastes. The Solid Waste Disposal Act is amended to mandate mercury recovery from hazardous waste with concentrations of 260 mg/kg or higher before disposal. Regulations may allow variances and exceptions for using mercury recovery technologies based on feasibility, and treatment standards will be updated to include the latest mercury recovery technologies. Funding for mercury programs is addressed in Section 6. Section 2007 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act is amended to authorize funding of up to $50,000,000 annually for mercury programs, including inventory preparation, promoting mercury recovery, and enforcing federal regulations. The Solid Waste Disposal Act is amended to authorize funding for mercury programs, including enforcement of federal regulations, grants to states, and promoting mercury lamp take back programs. SEC. 7. ANNUAL REPORT. The Administrator must provide Congress with an annual report on the progress of regulatory actions, mercury device recycling efforts, grants awarded, and administration costs under this Act. The Administrator and State officials must provide a joint summary on the coordination and communication progress in implementing the Act, along with recommendations for improving its administration."
