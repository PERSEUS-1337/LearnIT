    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Hawaii Invasive Species Prevention Act\". The Hawaiian islands' uniqueness lies in their isolation, diverse topography, and evolution of species found nowhere else due to natural colonization. However, human activities threaten this isolation and native biota. The introduction of non-native species to the Hawaiian islands has led to the extinction of native species, destruction of forests, and significant economic losses for the State of Hawaii. Over 5,000 non-native plants and animals have become established in the past 200 years, impacting ecosystems and agriculture. The introduction of non-native species to Hawaii has resulted in millions of dollars in crop losses. Invasive species like Miconia calvescens and the brown tree snake threaten the state's tropical forests, watersheds, and native bird populations, posing risks to public health, agriculture, and power infrastructure. The risk of invasive species like the brown tree snake causing power outages is a concern in Hawaii. Despite efforts by Congress to control the brown tree snake, other invasive species such as fire ants and West Nile Virus continue to threaten the state, highlighting the inadequacy of current federal regulations to prevent further harm. The text chunk discusses the definitions related to the topic. The Act defines terms related to diseases, introductions, and invasive species, including their potential economic, environmental, and health impacts. The Act defines terms related to diseases, introductions, and invasive species, including their potential economic, environmental, and health impacts. The term \"Secretary concerned\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior or Agriculture. The term \"Secretaries\" includes both the Secretary of the Interior and Agriculture. \"Species\" is defined as a group of organisms with physical and genetic similarity, interbreeding only among themselves. STATEMENT OF POLICY REGARDING FEDERAL OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO PREVENTING THE INTRODUCTION OF INVASIVE SPECIES IN HAWAII. The sense of Congress and United States policy emphasize the need for improved control of invasive species and diseases in Hawaii. Federal agencies are prohibited from actions that could introduce or spread invasive species, with a focus on prevention efforts. Federal agencies in Hawaii must consider invasive species and disease issues when planning activities to prevent accidental introduction. Legal mechanisms are in place to control the introduction and spread of invasive species or diseases in Hawaii. The Secretaries will impose a quarantine on Hawaii to prevent invasive species and diseases, utilizing various legal authorities. Quarantine protocols will be established through rulemaking within two years of the Act's enactment. The Secretaries will issue rules for post-arrival quarantine protocols for items traveling to Hawaii. Funding will come from existing Department of Agriculture and Department of the Interior funds. The protocols must be federally funded before implementation. The system for enforcing State and local laws in Hawaii regarding invasive species or diseases can only be implemented when funds are appropriated or a means of financing is designated. Federal officials can assist in enforcing these laws, and cooperation with various government agencies is required. The Secretaries will establish an expedited process for Hawaii to seek approval for additional prohibitions on invasive species. Hawaii can also impose emergency restrictions for up to two years pending approval. The Secretaries will establish an expedited process for Hawaii to seek approval for additional prohibitions on invasive species. Hawaii can also impose emergency restrictions for up to two years pending approval. The Secretaries shall use funds available for the operation of the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior to carry out this subsection. Authorization of appropriations is granted to the Secretary concerned for fiscal years 2007 through 2011 to carry out the Act."
