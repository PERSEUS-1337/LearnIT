    "content": "In 1987, Congress amended the Clean Water Act to establish state revolving loan funds (SRFs) for water pollution abatement projects. The SRFs were jointly funded by the federal government and states, with loans to be repaid cyclically. Construction work with SRF assistance was mandated to follow Davis-Bacon Act prevailing wage requirements. By the mid-1990s, it was expected that federal funding for wastewater treatment facilities would pass through SRFs on a revolving basis, eliminating the need for further federal appropriations. In the mid-1990s, federal funding for wastewater treatment facilities was expected to pass through state revolving loan funds (SRFs) on a revolving basis. Despite no additional authorizing legislation after 1987, Clean Water Act appropriations continued, leading to debates over federal requirements like the Davis-Bacon provision. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ruled in 1995 that Davis-Bacon no longer applied to CWA/SRF projects, but reversed this decision in the spring of 2000. The EPA initially ruled in 1995 that Davis-Bacon no longer applied to CWA/SRF projects, but reversed this decision in the spring of 2000. The effective date for Davis-Bacon coverage was set back to the fall of 2001, leading to regulatory complexities and unresolved conflicts. The report focuses on the intersection of two statutes and the evolution of the Davis-Bacon provision of the Clean Water Act, posing questions about the development and resolution of the dispute. In 1948, Congress enacted the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, which later evolved into the Clean Water Act, initiating a program for restoring America's water resources. The act started with modest mandates and gradually expanded with federal aid to states and local governments. Amendments in 1972 and 1987 further refined the program. The resolution of the Davis-Bacon prevailing wage provisions in public works projects could have broader implications, with Congress exploring innovative funding mechanisms. In 1987, Congress made changes to the Davis-Bacon Act to promote stability in the construction industry and protect workers. The coverage threshold was reduced to $2,000, and the scope extended to include public buildings and works involving federal funding. Conflict arose between federal and state responsibilities, leading to legislation in 1956 (P.L. 84-660) addressing the issue. In 1956, Congress passed legislation (P.L. 84-660) providing grants of up to $50 million annually for 10 years for sewage-treatment plant construction. President Eisenhower initially signed the bill but later urged for the program's abolition, stating that water pollution is a local issue best handled by state and local governments. President Kennedy reversed this policy in 1961, calling for increased federal assistance for waste treatment facilities. Federal assistance for construction of waste treatment facilities was provided through new CWA legislation in 1961. The Davis-Bacon Act ensured that laborers and mechanics on these projects were paid fair wages. Representative John Blatnik explained that similar provisions already existed for other projects funded by the federal government. The municipal wastewater pollution abatement program involved a partnership between the federal government and state or local entities. Davis-Bacon coverage was a standard practice for projects of this nature. Davis-Bacon coverage was not contentious during the 1961 legislation process. Representative James Wright emphasized the importance of paying prevailing wages. The concept was supported by Labor Secretary Arthur Goldberg and organized labor, despite opposition from the Chamber of Commerce. The focus of debate shifted to technical and fiscal aspects of pollution control, with Davis-Bacon not being a major issue in the final conference report. Congress accepted the premise that federal funding for pollution abatement projects should include Davis-Bacon coverage. Amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act in the 1960s and 1970s retained the Davis-Bacon requirement and \"anti-kickback\" provisions. Davis-Bacon was not a major issue in the context of pollution abatement legislation during this time. Stable funding for wastewater treatment facilities remained a challenge in the 1980s as Congress grappled with policy issues. In 1981, federal contributions for pollution abatement were reduced, shifting the burden to non-federal entities. Jack Ravan proposed phasing out federal construction grants by FY1989. Jack Ravan proposed the total phasing-out of federal construction grants by the end of FY1989, suggesting devolution to state funding. State revolving funds (SRFs) were considered as an option, with questions on local control. Ravan recommended a gradual phase-out of existing requirements, allowing states flexibility in fund utilization. Robert Perry of the Water Pollution Control Federation urged treating moneys used and paid back to a fund as State revenues, removing the requirement to treat them as Federal funds indefinitely. Different versions of the CWA amendments were passed by the House and Senate in 1985 without labor standards being a major issue. The legislation remained dormant until spring 1986 when conferees began negotiating the pending proposals (S. 1128, H.R. 8) which indicated a shift towards relying on State Revolving Funds (SRFs) for construction of treatment facilities. The conference report in October 1986 included a section outlining specific requirements for the legislation. The legislation included a 10-paragraph section titled \"SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS\" for treatment works constructed before fiscal year 1995 with capitalization grants. It specified that the Davis-Bacon provision would apply in the same manner as to treatment works under title II. The House and Senate approved the report, but it was pocket vetoed by President Reagan. Members of the 100th Congress discussed transitioning from Federal to State funding for water infrastructure projects, with concerns about maintaining necessary funding levels. The federal phase-out of funding for State Revolving Funds (SRFs) raised questions about the future requirements and restrictions on fund usage. Representative Arlan Stangeland highlighted the importance of federal seed money in establishing SRFs and the need to clarify how funds could be used as they are repaid into the fund. As federal funding for State Revolving Funds (SRFs) was phased out, questions arose about future fund usage restrictions. Representative Arlan Stangeland emphasized the need for clarity on fund utilization as repayments were made. Despite Congress approving legislation, President Reagan vetoed it in January 1987, citing concerns about the Federal deficit and the responsibility of State and local governments for sewage treatment facilities. In February 1987, Congress overrode President Reagan's veto, passing H.R. 1 as P.L. 100-4. The legislation phased out federal grants for State Revolving Funds (SRFs) and introduced the SRF loan program. Despite assumptions that federal appropriations for SRFs would end after 1994, the federal government's involvement would continue due to the SRFs being federally created and capitalized. Differences in language between the vetoed bill and the new statute (P.L. 100-4) regarding Davis-Bacon Act (DBA) coverage were noted. The new statute (P.L. 100-4) phased out federal grants for State Revolving Funds and introduced the SRF loan program. Differences in language regarding Davis-Bacon Act coverage were noted between the vetoed bill and P.L. 100-4. Senator George Mitchell explained the measure in the Senate, but the language was not incorporated into the proposed legislation. P.L. 100-4 states that treatment works funded before fiscal year 1995 must meet specific requirements, including the Davis-Bacon provision. The statute (P.L. 100-4) introduced the SRF loan program, phasing out federal grants for State Revolving Funds. It included 16 specific requirements, such as the Davis-Bacon provision, for treatment works funded before fiscal year 1995. However, there was ambiguity regarding the continuation of Davis-Bacon Act coverage for the SRF program after FY1995. Congress did not address this issue, leaving uncertainties about the future application of Davis-Bacon requirements to recycled funds. Congress did not address the ambiguity surrounding the continuation of Davis-Bacon Act coverage for the SRF program after FY1995. Questions arose about whether the Davis-Bacon requirement would be dropped once the SRFs were in place, and how funding disaggregation would affect coverage. The issue of coverage being associated with each contract or subcontract, and the distinction between covered and non-covered funding, remained unresolved. The debate over Davis-Bacon Act coverage for the SRF program continued into the late 1980s and early 1990s. Despite the termination of Title II federal grants in 1994, federal financial involvement persisted through a revolving loan fund. The issue of coverage for construction grants and the first use doctrine remained unresolved, with questions about the applicability of DBA in the absence of specific policies from Congress. Senator Daniel Moynihan noted the end of the grant program in 1994 but highlighted ongoing financial support beyond that date. The shift towards a policy change was evident by 1991. In 1991, Senators Baucus and Chafee introduced legislation for oversight of federal financial involvement in the SRF program. The proposal aimed to extend the federal role in SRFs until 1998 and address concerns about wetlands, CSOs, and non-point source pollution. Hearings on the legislation began in the spring of 1991. The Bush Administration and EPA Administrator William Reilly acknowledged the need for municipal pollution abatement due to wetlands, CSOs, and non-point source pollution. Rising costs of abatement were a concern, with states and municipalities struggling to meet federal requirements. Interest groups called for more federal funding for pollution abatement, as the federal government faced challenges in transitioning to independent and self-sustaining SRFs. Calls for increased federal funding and flexibility in pollution abatement were made, with appeals to reduce federal control and administrative burdens. Senator Chafee highlighted the impending end of federal funding in 1994 and urged a reconsideration of this decision. Senator Chafee urged continued federal support for State revolving loan funds to maintain current levels of funding. The Baucus/Chafee bill aimed to create new categorical grant programs under the SRF umbrella, but faced opposition from state authorities wanting flexibility in addressing priorities. EPA Administrator Reilly could not definitively address SRF funding due to the lack of a firm policy from the Bush Administration. Reilly was unable to definitively address the issue of sustained and comprehensive CWA/SRF funding. The Baucus/Chafee bill was not advanced, leaving the SRF structure in place until FY1995. Congress continued to review CWA-related proposals, with mixed opinions on the wage requirement. GAO assessments found ambiguity and little hard evidence on the impact of Title II requirements. The EPA and GAO reports found ambiguity and little hard evidence on the impact of Title II requirements, particularly the Davis-Bacon provision. States preferred to be exempt from these requirements, as they believed it reduced the program's attractiveness to communities receiving SRF loans. The EPA study highlighted that the locally prevailing wage could increase the cost of public construction, but also noted that the DBA requirement varied based on local conditions and state laws. The 1987 authorization of the Clean Water Act/SRF program was set to expire in October 1994, prompting a high priority for reauthorization. Senators Chafee and Baucus introduced S. 1114 to extend the program, increase federal funding, and allow states more flexibility, while keeping the DBA requirement. Hearings before the Senate Clean Water Subcommittee showed a general consensus on the need for federal support, with mixed responses from witnesses. Witnesses offered mixed responses on the continued need for federal support for the Clean Water Act/SRF program. Ronald Marino of Smith Barney raised the issue of first use and recycled funding, suggesting that mandates like Davis-Bacon could be eliminated when loans are repaid. Some witnesses supported GAO assertions that small communities could benefit from exemptions, including from the Davis-Bacon Act. Senator Baucus introduced a bill (S. 2093) in May 1994, which was reported from the Committee on Environment and Public Works, deferring the transfer of full financing responsibility from federal to state for municipal pollution abatement. Labor standards were not a major issue in the 1700 pages of testimony. The committee proposed extending federal funding for the successful SRF program until the year 2000, with modifications to increase state flexibility in managing loan funds. Senator Robert Smith suggested repealing certain administrative requirements of the 1987 legislation. The committee voted to report the bill with modifications to increase state flexibility in managing loan funds. Senator Robert Smith proposed repealing the Davis-Bacon requirement under the CWA, but his amendment was defeated. Senator Harris Wofford's amendment confirming the applicability of the Davis-Bacon Act to all State loans under the SRF was approved. The bill as reported was clear on Davis-Bacon's applicability under the SRFs. The committee's majority intended that CWA projects funded through SRFs should be Davis-Bacon covered, with no exceptions for small jurisdictions. Wetlands preservation was a contentious issue during the 103rd Congress. During the 103rd Congress, wetlands preservation was a difficult issue to resolve as reauthorization legislation for the Clean Water Act stalled. Despite the lack of reauthorization, funds were still appropriated for CWA projects and State Revolving Funds (SRFs). Construction of abatement facilities continued, but there was disagreement on whether normal administrative requirements of the CWA should remain in place. In 1995, party control shifted in the House, leading to extended hearings on water resources and the environment. In 1995, extended hearings on CWA reauthorization and new legislation (H.R. 961) were held by the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment, chaired by Shuster. Concerns were raised by CIFA and ABC about the costly Title II requirements, including the Davis-Bacon Act, which they argued increased construction costs. They pressed for federal funding support but elimination of federally-imposed administrative requirements. The discussion during the hearings focused on the repeal of the Davis-Bacon Act and the need to improve water infrastructure. Representatives expressed support for repealing Davis-Bacon, while the National Society of Professional Engineers urged Congress to eliminate administrative requirements under the Clean Water Act. Section 602 of H.R. 961 aimed to remove certain administrative requirements for grant recipients. H.R. 961 amended the Clean Water Act by removing administrative requirements for grant recipients and extending to applicants who receive SRF capitalization grant loans. The legislation passed in the House but died in the Senate. There was ambiguity regarding the Davis-Bacon provision, with conflicting interpretations on its enforcement. Davis-Bacon enforcement can be complex and time-consuming, requiring someone to challenge its application through appeals and potentially the courts. Organized labor generally supports prevailing wage requirements, while some employers may try to avoid or oppose Davis-Bacon. Federal agencies, aiming to reduce labor costs, may align with contractors in this regard. Different agencies within an Administration may have varying views on prevailing wage requirements. In the case of DBA and SRF projects, there are differing perspectives among agencies on prevailing wage requirements. Congress faced a stalemate with non-DBA issues, leading to no immediate CWA authorizations beyond 1994. Changes in Congress and the White House may result in new policies at DOL and EPA. Michael Cook of EPA highlighted confusion regarding the applicability of \"equivalency requirements\" to SRFs in a memorandum. Cook emphasized compliance with statutory requirements for publicly-owned treatment works projects. The Act requires publicly-owned treatment works projects funded before October 1, 1994, with capitalization grants to comply with statutory requirements. Projects starting after that date are exempt. Michael Cook of EPA explained complexities, stating that projects with commitments before 1994 may need to meet equivalency requirements. However, projects initiated after 1994 with capitalization grants do not need to meet these requirements. The Cook memorandum did not fully clarify the confusion. The Cook memorandum did not fully clarify confusion about DBA applicability for CWA/SRF projects. In January 1997, EPA's Region III sought advice from DOL in Philadelphia regarding DBA coverage for CWA projects. EPA's regional office was prepared to remind states that DBA coverage had ceased and DOL would no longer enforce compliance. EPA asked DOL to review their proposed policy statement for accuracy. The EPA draft addressed the application of the Davis-Bacon Act to CWA/SRF projects, stating that federal enforcement is inappropriate when compliance is not federally mandated. This sparked renewed interest in the issue, leading to discussions between EPA and DOL. Georgine from AFL-CIO raised concerns about the labor standards provisions of the CWA, specifically referencing Sections 513 and 602(b)(6). The EPA draft addressed the Davis-Bacon Act's application to CWA/SRF projects, sparking discussions between EPA and DOL. Georgine from AFL-CIO raised concerns about labor standards provisions in the CWA, referencing Sections 513 and 602(b)(6). Congress failed to repeal Davis-Bacon requirements in the Clean Water Act, leaving the applicability of Section 513 unchanged. EPA cannot manipulate the plain language of the Act. Georgine's letter was sent to EPA Administrator Carol Browner and BCTD member unions. DOL forwarded the letter to EPA. In October 1998, EPA's Michael Cook responded to concerns raised by AFL-CIO's Georgine regarding the application of the Davis-Bacon Act to CWA/SRF projects. Cook emphasized that the Act applies to federally assisted construction projects only if required by the legislation authorizing the assistance, with a time limitation for projects constructed before fiscal year 1995. Cook reviewed arguments made in the Georgine letter and concluded that Davis-Bacon coverage for CWA/SRF projects ended by fiscal year 1995. EPA believed Davis-Bacon should not apply to projects after October 1994, but the issue was not fully resolved. BCTD sought a ruling affirming DBA coverage, leading to a policy shift by EPA in the early 2000s. In early 2000, there was a policy shift by EPA regarding Davis-Bacon provisions for treatment works projects receiving CWSRF assistance. EPA proposed a settlement agreement with Building Trades to ensure compliance with Davis-Bacon provisions in exchange for withdrawing challenges and refraining from future challenges. Once Building Trades agreed, EPA would begin the administrative process to implement the agreement. EPA proposed a settlement agreement with Building Trades to ensure compliance with Davis-Bacon provisions for treatment works projects receiving CWSRF assistance. The agreement would be implemented after consultations with state and local officials and public comments. EPA reserved the right to withdraw from the settlement if necessary. The notice outlined the agreement and called for comments, stating that the Davis-Bacon Act's prevailing wage rate requirements would be applied prospectively. The EPA reviewed a dispute regarding the application of Davis-Bacon Act requirements to grants for treatment works under the CWA. They concluded that CWA section 513 imposes an ongoing obligation on the Agency to ensure compliance with prevailing wage rate requirements for construction projects. The Agency also stated that prevailing wage rate requirements should continue to apply to treatment works construction in the CWSRF program. The \"Proposed Settlement Agreement\" addressed the application of Davis-Bacon Act requirements to SRF projects under the CWA. Questions arose regarding the distinction between Section 513 and Section 602(b)(6), the intent behind phrases like capitalization grants, and EPA's selective enforcement of provisions. The EPA's actions regarding the application of Davis-Bacon Act requirements to SRF projects under the CWA were questioned. The settlement agreement allowed EPA to opt out based on testimony and comments, with the Building Trades' only recourse being to request a ruling from the DOL. Despite previous conclusions, EPA now stated that the DBA does apply, contradicting Cook's findings. The EPA's obligation under section 602(b)(6) was questioned regarding the application of prevailing wage rate requirements to federally-assisted construction projects in the CWSRF program. Public comments on the proposed settlement were divided, with some supporting and others opposing it. Testimony came from various groups, including the BCTD, contractor associations, state agencies, and Members of Congress. The settlement's basis on law or policy was debated during the process. Several Members of Congress presented their views on the application of the Davis-Bacon Act to clean water infrastructure projects funded through the SRFs. Representative Shuster raised legal concerns about the EPA's authority to implement this proposal, suggesting that new legislation would be needed. William Goodling and other Republican committee members called upon the EPA to reverse its plan. Several Members of Congress criticized the proposed settlement to apply the Davis-Bacon Act to clean water infrastructure projects funded through the SRFs, stating it violates Congress's intent and would increase project costs. The Associated General Contractors urged the EPA to withdraw the settlement, arguing it exceeds the agency's authority. Several Members of Congress and industry representatives criticized the EPA's proposal to apply the Davis-Bacon Act to clean water infrastructure projects funded through State Revolving Funds (SRFs). They argued that it goes against Congress's intent, increases project costs, and exceeds the agency's authority. Isokait and Maresca Jr. both raised concerns about the EPA's actions, stating that the agency is overstepping its statutory authority and trying to legislate through executive fiat. The EPA's proposal to apply the Davis-Bacon Act to clean water infrastructure projects funded through State Revolving Funds has faced criticism from Members of Congress and industry representatives. They argue that it goes against Congress's intent, increases project costs, and exceeds the agency's authority. The Administration's decision to impose Davis-Bacon requirements on treatment works after FY1994 was questioned by various stakeholders, including the Association of State and Interstate Water Pollution Control Administrators. Congress has been aware that the Davis-Bacon Act was not being applied to clean water infrastructure projects funded through State Revolving Funds. Some argue that imposing DBA requirements is unnecessary as local construction workers already receive wages exceeding Davis-Bacon Prevailing Rates. There is debate over whether federal funds are directly funding construction or indirectly providing capital for SRFs to make loans for specific projects. Commenters suggest setting back the effective date of the settlement to allow for further discussion. The BCTD urged for a delay in the effective date to notify loan recipients and re-train personnel. They understood that Davis-Bacon prevailing wage requirements would apply to SRF projects funded by capitalization grants under the Clean Water Act. The BCTD raised concerns about the Section 602(b)(6) DBA requirement and the dispute over the application of Section 513 to laborers and mechanics on treatment works funded under the Clean Water Act. They argued that Section 513 should apply to all laborers and mechanics, not just those funded by the EPA. The BCTD questioned EPA's interpretation of the Davis-Bacon Act (DBA) in relation to laborers and mechanics on Clean Water Act projects. They argued that Section 513 should apply to all workers, not just those funded by the EPA. The BCTD speculated on potential back pay liability if prevailing wages were not paid on CWA projects. EPA eventually reversed its position, acknowledging a continuing obligation to ensure DBA compliance. EPA's final settlement agreement with the BCTD, published in the Federal Register on January 25, 2001, ensures that Davis-Bacon Act requirements apply to Clean Water Act grants for treatment works. The settlement, effective July 1, 2001, commits EPA to apply prevailing wage rate requirements in the Clean Water State Revolving Fund program. In exchange, the Building Trades agree not to pursue further action on this matter. The Federal Register notice reviewed the controversy surrounding the reimposition of Davis-Bacon Act requirements for Clean Water Act grants. The legal basis for this decision was deemed sound, stating that prevailing wage rates should apply to federally-assisted construction projects. While this may increase costs for some recipients, the EPA emphasized that state prevailing wage rate laws cannot replace CWA section 513 requirements. The settlement between EPA and the Building and Construction Trades Department included a provision for the union to reinstitute its request for ruling before the DOL if EPA failed to meet its obligations. Interest groups were divided on the settlement, with the trade union movement supporting it while industry, represented by the Associated Builders and Contractors, protested that it violated the Clean Water Act. Despite the disagreement, both sides agreed to work towards reauthorization of the CWA. The 107th Congress prioritized expanding federal drinking water and wastewater revolving funds. EPA's concern was wastewater infrastructure funding. The Davis-Bacon Act, passed in 1931, aimed to stabilize construction wages during the Depression. EPA delayed mandating Davis-Bacon coverage on SRF-assisted projects multiple times. The Davis-Bacon Act, passed in 1931 during the Depression, has been subject to ongoing debate and litigation. Organized labor supports the act, while others view it as a political litmus test. Congressional debate over the act has been intermittent since the 1950s, with arguments for and against vigorously pursued. The Davis-Bacon Act has been a subject of debate and litigation since the 1930s. Prevailing wage coverage was added to the Clean Water Act in 1961, and DBA became part of the CWA/SRF loan program in 1987. After 1994, the future of SRF authorizations remains uncertain. Congress recognized the need for further federal funding for SRFs, leading to various proposals being considered. Several proposals were considered for the SRF program, but were not enacted due to contentious issues like wetlands. Congress continued to fund the program through appropriations, with DBA coverage provided as long as federal funding was received. The 1987 authorization could be interpreted to mean that projects constructed after 1995 would not be DBA-covered, but it could also be argued that Congress intended to continue the program through appropriations, maintaining administrative provisions like Davis-Bacon. The Davis-Bacon Act provisions, including coverage for Clean Water Act projects, were set to continue until Congress intervened in 1994. The act requires prevailing wage rates in construction contracts exceeding $2,000 involving the United States or D.C. The determination of prevailing wages is left to the Secretary of Labor, with the EPA Administrator ensuring laborer protections. The Davis-Bacon Act requires prevailing wage rates in construction contracts involving the United States or D.C., with the Secretary of Labor determining the rates. The EPA Administrator ensures laborer protections. Federally assisted programs may make recipients de facto agents of the federal government, with federally funded State Revolving Funds (SRFs) being established and funded largely by the federal government. The State Revolving Funds (SRFs) were designed to be ongoing programs funded largely by the federal government. Even without new authorizations, the program continues to operate, and it could be argued that the federal government remains involved. This is implicit in the EPA agreement to enforce the Davis-Bacon Act requirements \"prospectively\" and \"in the same manner as they applied before October 1, 1994.\" The State Revolving Funds (SRFs) create an intermediary between federal funding and loan recipients. The issue of federal presence in local abatement projects is disputed, particularly regarding Davis-Bacon Act requirements for SRF-funded projects. EPA's changing positions on Davis-Bacon application have led to policy dilemmas. The EPA's changing positions on Davis-Bacon Act requirements for State Revolving Fund (SRF) projects have led to policy dilemmas. The Department of Labor's role in enforcing DBA standards prior to 1994 and its potential discontinuation in 1995 are questioned. The authorization for funding of SRFs has been a contentious issue in Congress, with conflicts such as coverage under the Davis-Bacon Act causing bills to fail. In the 110th Congress, consideration of clean water bills began in the House with a focus on investment in clean water infrastructures. The issue of Davis-Bacon Act was essential in the proceedings, with discussions on allowing more operating flexibility for states. J. Kevin Ward from CIFA emphasized the need for states to be accountable for federal dollars while avoiding excessive mandates that could stifle innovation. In the 110th Congress, discussions focused on clean water infrastructure investment and the need for states to have flexibility without stifling innovation. Specific program changes were proposed for CWSRF reauthorization, with concerns raised about prevailing wage requirements under the Davis-Bacon Act. Representative James Oberstar introduced H.R. for consideration. In January 2007, Representative James Oberstar introduced H.R. 720, the \"Water Quality Financing Act of 2007,\" which faced controversy over the Davis-Bacon provision. Despite challenges, the bill was approved by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure with the provision intact. The bill H.R. 720, the \"Water Quality Financing Act of 2007,\" was approved by the full committee with the Davis-Bacon provision intact. The bill included two provisions related to Davis-Bacon, with Section 513 requiring prevailing wages for laborers and mechanics on treatment works. A new provision, Section 602(b)(17), extended Davis-Bacon requirements to construction projects funded by state revolving loan funds or section 205(m) of the Act. The bill H.R. 720, the \"Water Quality Financing Act of 2007,\" included provisions requiring prevailing wages for construction projects funded by state revolving loan funds or section 205(m) of the Act. The amendment authorizes the application of prevailing wage requirements to construction projects with financial assistance from the state revolving fund, regardless of the source of assistance. The Committee continues its practice of ensuring Davis-Bacon application where Federal funds are provided for construction. The Federal capitalization grant is the main revenue source for state revolving funds. The committee discussed the benefits of applying the Davis-Bacon Act to Clean Water SRFs, citing improved worker productivity and cost savings. Representative John Mica and others opposed the mandate, stating it was a step backward despite being beneficial for clean water projects. The \"Water Quality Financing Act of 2007\" was debated in the House, with a focus on the Davis-Bacon Act's prevailing wage requirements. Representative Pete Sessions raised concerns about the act adding to the cost of public construction and disproportionately affecting small, rural, and disadvantaged communities. He criticized the act as discriminatory towards small and minority-owned firms, stating that they struggle to afford the higher wages required by Davis-Bacon contracts. Representative Pete Sessions criticized the \"Water Quality Financing Act of 2007\" for benefiting big labor bosses at the expense of others. He objected to applying Davis-Bacon regulations to non-Federal funds, arguing it hinders local budgets from funding essential projects. Sessions urged opposition to the rule, citing concerns about fiscal responsibility, small businesses, States' rights, and environmental harm. Representative Kathy Castor responded to criticism of the legislation, emphasizing the importance of the Davis-Bacon Provisions in supporting workers across America. She defended the prevailing wage requirements for federally funded construction projects as a long-standing tradition in Congress. Representative Kathy Castor defended the Davis-Bacon Provisions, stating that they attract skilled workers, increase productivity, and reduce costs for projects. She argued that the prevailing wage requirements protect local communities and ensure projects are completed on time and under budget. During discussions on H.R. 720, some Members debated amendments to limit the expansion of Davis-Bacon. The Davis-Bacon Act provisions were debated in the House, with concerns raised about compliance in rural and lower-income communities. The Baker/King amendment to exclude Davis-Bacon from the Water Quality Financing Act was defeated in a roll-call vote. The bill was then sent to the Senate for further consideration. The bill H.R. 720 was adopted in the House and sent to the Senate on March 12, 2007. It was referred to the Committee on Environment and Public Works where it remains without further action reported."
