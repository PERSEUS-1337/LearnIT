The Act may be cited as the \"Cancer Care Planning and Communications Act of 2018.\" Congress finds disparities in access to cancer care, with low-income and ethnic minority populations facing challenges in receiving adequate treatment despite advancements in therapies. Individuals with cancer often lack access to a comprehensive cancer care system that includes shared decision-making and coordination of care. Cancer survivors may suffer from under-diagnosis and under-treatment of symptoms and side effects, impacting their health, well-being, and quality of life. Shared decision-making and coordination of treatment options are often not utilized by individuals with cancer. Quality cancer care should incorporate access to psychosocial services, symptom management, shared decision-making for survivors, and follow-up care. The Institute of Medicine report outlined the elements of quality care. Quality Cancer Care includes initial treatment recommendations, treatment planning, access to resources, clinical trials, service coordination, and psychosocial support. The Institute of Medicine recommended these elements in their report on cancer survivorship. The Institute of Medicine and the Commission on Cancer recommend providing cancer patients with a comprehensive care summary and survivorship plan after completing treatment. However, cancer care professionals face challenges in developing these plans, especially for elderly Medicare beneficiaries. Addressing cancer care inadequacies through Medicare reforms will benefit millions of elderly Medicare beneficiaries by providing routine access to cancer care plans and survivorship care plans. Important payment and delivery reforms, such as the Oncology Care Model, are already being tested in the Medicare program to improve care coordination. Alternative payment models like the Oncology Care Model offer access to cancer care planning for Medicare beneficiaries receiving care in oncology practices. Medicare reforms aim to improve cancer care by providing access to care plans and coordination services for beneficiaries in the Oncology Care Model. Payment changes will support shared decision-making and enhance care for cancer patients from diagnosis to end of life. The Medicare reforms aim to enhance cancer care by offering access to well-planned and well-coordinated care recommended by the Institute of Medicine/National Academy of Medicine, which is preferred by cancer patients nationwide. The Medicare reforms include coverage for cancer care planning and coordination services, aligning with recommendations from the Institute of Medicine/National Academy of Medicine to improve cancer care for patients. The Medicare reforms now cover cancer care planning and coordination services, which involve developing a treatment plan that assesses the individual's diagnosis, health status, treatment needs, and engages them in a shared decision-making process. The plan details all aspects of care, including curative treatment, symptom management, and palliative care. The Medicare reforms cover cancer care planning services, including developing a treatment plan that considers diagnosis, health status, and treatment needs. The plan includes curative treatment, symptom management, and palliative care, provided in a culturally and linguistically appropriate manner according to Secretary's standards. Treatment plans are revised as needed for individuals. The Medicare reforms cover cancer care planning services, including developing a treatment plan that considers diagnosis, health status, and treatment needs. Treatment plans are revised as necessary for individuals, accounting for changes in condition, treatment preferences, and elements of care. Follow-up survivorship care plans are developed for individuals who have completed primary cancer treatment. The cancer care planning services include assessing diagnosis, health status, treatment needs, and psychosocial needs. It involves shared decision-making, describes primary treatment elements, provides recommendations for subsequent care, and is given to the individual in person or in written form promptly after primary treatment completion. The cancer care planning services involve developing a follow-up cancer care plan for individuals, which may need revision based on changes in their condition, diagnosis, preferences, or care plan. The plan should be culturally and linguistically appropriate and meet standards set by the Secretary. The Secretary will establish standards for revising cancer treatment plans and follow-up survivorship care plans, considering changes in the individual's condition or treatment intent. Standards will also cover communication of the plan to the individual, in consultation with relevant organizations. The shared decision-making process involves considering diagnosis, treatment options, medical evidence, risks, benefits, and individual preferences to develop a treatment plan. Amendments to the Social Security Act include payment rates under the physician fee schedule. The amendment to the physician fee schedule sets the payment rate for cancer care planning services equal to transitional care management services. The effective date for these changes is the first day of the first calendar year after the enactment of the Act."
