    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Balanced Economic and Environmental Priorities Act of 1994\" and includes provisions for economic impact analyses. Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 is amended to include an Economic Impact Analysis requirement for any designation, regulation, or recovery plan. The analysis must show that the benefits outweigh the costs, and an economic impact statement must be published. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 now includes a requirement for an Economic Impact Analysis for any critical habitat designation, protective regulation, or recovery plan. The analysis must assess the economic consequences, including job losses or diminishments, of implementing and enforcing these measures. The Economic Impact Analysis required by the Endangered Species Act of 1973 evaluates the economic consequences of implementing and enforcing critical habitat designations, protective regulations, or recovery plans. This includes assessing job losses, diminishments in property value, and impacts on tax revenues for the Federal Government and State/local governments. The Economic Impact Analysis under the Endangered Species Act evaluates the effects of critical habitat designations, regulations, or recovery plans on government outlays, including payments, unemployment compensation, aid programs, and Medicaid. It also considers the impact on the competitive position of businesses and industries affected by the actions. The Secretary of Commerce will analyze the economic and ecological impacts of preventing species extinction, as well as any other relevant effects. Based on this analysis, the Secretary will determine if the costs of implementing regulations outweigh the benefits. LIMITATION OF ECONOMIC LOSSES CAUSED BY LISTING SPECIES AS ENDANGERED OR THREATENED; COMPENSATION. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is amended to limit economic losses for persons affected by the listing of endangered or threatened species. The Secretary is required to compensate individuals for any economic loss, including property value diminishment and job loss, resulting from the listing. The Secretary will issue regulations for obtaining payments for economic losses, including job loss. Any denial of payment can be appealed in Federal court. Interventions are allowed to assist in issuing payments. SEC. 4. CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL REQUIRED FOR ADDITIONS TO ENDANGERED SPECIES LIST. An addition of a species to the list of threatened or endangered species must be approved by Congress before becoming effective. This applies to additions made after the enactment of this Act. The effective date for the amendments made by sections 2 and 3 is January 1, 1986. The Secretary of the Interior must review species added to the endangered species list after January 1, 1986, within one year of the enactment of this Act. Economic impact analyses and statements must be prepared for each added species, and a list of critical habitat designations, regulations, and recovery plans affected by the amendments must be published. Compensation for losses incurred due to species being added to the endangered species list between January 1, 1986, and the enactment of this Act is prohibited, except for losses from the implementation of critical habitat designations, regulations, and recovery plans not included in the list."
