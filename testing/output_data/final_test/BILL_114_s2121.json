    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Preserving American Access to Information Act\". The 1994 Joint Security Commission and the Public Interest Declassification Board have both expressed concerns about the classification system, stating that it has grown out of control and is not trusted to protect or release information effectively. The 2012 report highlights the exponential growth of classified information being created annually, surpassing the amount declassified in the previous seventeen years. Without significant improvements in the declassification process, the backlog of classified records awaiting declassification will increase, leading to a decline in public access to the nation's history. The National Declassification Center will be enhanced. The President will enhance the National Declassification Center's authority and capacity to facilitate a government-wide declassification strategy. Federal agencies must review and declassify records within eighteen months, with a possible extension to two years with approval. The President will enhance the National Declassification Center's authority and capacity to facilitate a government-wide declassification strategy, including requiring Federal agencies to share their declassification guidance with other agencies and the National Declassification Center. The Director of the National Declassification Center will consult with the advisory panel and the public. Consultations will occur regularly and concurrently with panel meetings. Federal agencies must identify historically valuable records during classification for preservation and timely access post-declassification. SEC. 6. REPORTS ON PILOT PROGRAMS FOR IMPROVING DECLASSIFICATION PROCESSES. The Public Interest Declassification Board will submit reports to Congress on pilot programs to improve declassification capabilities of federal agencies. Emphasis will be on assessing current technologies and practices, including commercial off-the-shelf technologies and best practices from the private sector. The Public Interest Declassification Board will review declassification procedures for Congress-controlled information and make recommendations for improvement. SEC. 8. REPORTS. Federal agencies must submit a report to Congress within a year of this Act's enactment. The report should assess the feasibility of a two-tiered classification system and the declassification of Formerly Restricted Data (FRD) records."
