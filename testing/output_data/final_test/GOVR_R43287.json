It was signed in 1961 after years of negotiations following flooding events. The Treaty included additional storage in Canada through the construction of four dams, providing flood control, hydropower, and other benefits downstream. In exchange, the US agreed to cash payments and hydropower benefits for Canada. The Columbia River Treaty (CRT) began in 1964 with lump-sum cash payments and hydropower benefits for Canada. It has no specific end date, but either nation can terminate most provisions starting in September 2024 with 10 years' notice. The U.S. Entity recommended modifications in 2013, and if not terminated or modified, most provisions will continue except for flood control operations ending in 2024. The Columbia River Treaty (CRT) is set to transition to \"called-upon\" operations in 2024, with varying perspectives on its future. Some suggest altering the Treaty to include guarantees for tribal resources and fisheries flows, while others propose adjusting the Canadian Entitlement for more equitable sharing of hydropower benefits. Canada insists on maintaining the Canadian Entitlement for the Treaty to continue post-2024. The U.S. Entity recommended continuing the Treaty with modifications, and the State Department has finalized negotiating parameters. The Canadian recommendation, finalized in March 2013, favored continuing the Columbia River Treaty with modifications within the Treaty framework. The executive branch, specifically the State Department, is responsible for negotiations related to the CRT. The Senate has the power to approve treaties negotiated by the executive branch with a two-thirds vote. Changes to the CRT may or may not trigger a Senate vote, but the Senate may choose to review any changes. Both houses of Congress may also weigh in on Treaty review activities by the U.S. Entity through their oversight powers. The Columbia River Basin, spanning parts of the northwestern United States and southwestern Canada, is unique due to its high annual runoff and extreme flow variation. With the second-largest average flows in the US, the basin drains approximately 259,500 square miles and plays a significant role in the Columbia River Treaty review process. The Columbia River Basin has high average flows, with 60% occurring in May, June, and July. Canada's portion of the basin contributes significantly to the annual runoff volume. The Columbia River is the largest hydropower-producing river system in the US, with federal dams dating back to 1932. The Federal Columbia River Power System markets power from federal dams in the basin. The Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS) is managed by the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) and consists of dams on the main stem of the river in the US. These dams are primarily run-of-the-river for hydropower, flood control, and navigation. The basin is important habitat for various fish species, including economically significant ones like steelhead trout and salmon. It also provides habitat for threatened and endangered species. The Columbia River basin supports various uses such as navigation, irrigation, recreation, and water supply. Federal dams with navigation locks allow for barge traffic, and irrigation is crucial in eastern Washington, northeastern Oregon, and southern Idaho. Basin waters are also diverted for other water supply purposes and recreational activities. Management of basin water supplies is of interest to all users. The negotiation and ratification of the Columbia River Treaty (CRT) were prompted by the 1948 Vanport flood, leading to discussions between the United States and Canada. Initially, the US proposed building Libby Dam in Montana, which Canada opposed. The International Joint Commission (IJC) recommended a compromise involving upriver storage in Canada to regulate Columbia River flows for flood control and hydropower generation. The Columbia River Treaty (CRT) was signed in 1961 but fully ratified in 1964, regulating flows on the Columbia River for flood control and hydropower generation. The Treaty involved the construction of dams in both the US and Canada, increasing reservoir storage for flood protection and power benefits in the basin. The Columbia River Treaty (CRT) signed in 1961 provided new flood protection and power benefits in the basin. The United States gained operational benefits with flexible storage and reliable operations in Canada for flood control and hydropower generation. Canada receives lump-sum payments for flood control benefits and a portion of annual hydropower benefits from the operation of Canadian Treaty storage. The United States paid Canada $64.4 million for flood control benefits from Canadian Treaty storage. Canada also receives half of the increase in downstream hydropower generated at U.S. dams, known as the \"Canadian Entitlement.\" This electricity was initially sold to U.S. utilities for $254 million over 30 years. Currently, the U.S. delivers the Canadian Entitlement to Canada through BPA's Northern Intertie, valued between $229 million and $335 million annually. The declining populations of salmon and steelhead in the Columbia and Snake Rivers led to listings under the Endangered Species Act in 1991, resulting in habitat improvements and mitigation actions. The Columbia River Treaty has no specific end date, and most provisions would continue indefinitely without action. Termination of most provisions can occur starting in September 2024. The Columbia River Treaty can be terminated with a 10-year notice starting in September 2024. If not terminated, flood control operations will end in 2024, transitioning to \"called-upon\" operations where the US can request changes from Canada. The United States would pay for operating costs and economic losses in Canada due to changes in the Columbia River Treaty. The U.S. Entity conducted studies with input from a sovereign review team to develop recommendations on the future of the Treaty. The review process involved regional representatives, tribal governments, federal agencies, and stakeholder outreach for additional input. Technical studies were conducted in three iterations focusing on the physical effects of system operations. The U.S. Entity conducted three iterations of technical studies focusing on the physical effects of system operations, including scenarios on hydropower production and effects on fish and wildlife habitat. The final Regional Recommendation, delivered in December 2013, suggested modifying the Columbia River Treaty post-2024 based on study results and stakeholder feedback. The U.S. Entity recommended modifying the Columbia River Treaty post-2024 based on study results and stakeholder feedback. The State Department will make final decisions on changes in the national interest and conduct negotiations with Canada. The U.S. Entity suggests modernizing the Treaty for a more resilient ecosystem while maintaining flood risk and hydropower benefits. The U.S. Entity recommended modifications to the Columbia River Treaty post-2024, including providing stream flows for fish populations, minimizing adverse effects on tribal resources, rebalancing power benefits, and implementing flood risk management. Negotiations with Canada are suggested to address these changes. The U.S. Entity recommended modifications to the Columbia River Treaty post-2024, including stream flows for fish populations, tribal resource protection, power benefit rebalancing, and flood risk management. Negotiations with Canada began in 2018 and have had six rounds so far, with the next round scheduled for June 2019 in Washington, DC. The U.S. negotiating position is guided by the U.S. Entity's Regional Recommendation. The U.S. negotiating position for the Columbia River Treaty is guided by the U.S. Entity's Regional Recommendation, which includes participation from various government departments. Town halls and community meetings have been held to discuss the negotiations with the public. The Regional Recommendation reflects input from stakeholders but does not represent the final U.S. approach. The State Department will determine the final approach to the Treaty review. The U.S. Entity's studies recommend modernizing the Columbia River Treaty for more equitable benefits. BC suggests continuing the Treaty with modifications. The final U.S. approach to Treaty review will be handled by the State Department. Without the Columbia River Treaty (CRT), Canada could operate its dams for its own benefit, potentially impacting U.S. hydropower generation and species. Terminating the Treaty could result in financial benefits for the United States but reduced benefits for Canada. Despite studies recommending modernization for equitable benefits, the U.S. Entity has not recommended termination. The U.S. Entity recommends modifying the Columbia River Treaty, including a \"rebalanced\" Canadian Entitlement and assurances for ecosystem improvements. Stakeholders have debated handling the Canadian Entitlement, incorporating flows for fisheries, and future flood management operations. Power interests have contested the Canadian Entitlement's status. The final Regional Recommendation calls for a \"rebalancing.\" Power interests have criticized the lack of specifics in the final Regional Recommendation for the Columbia River Treaty, calling for a \"rebalancing\" of the Canadian Entitlement to ensure more equitable sharing of hydropower benefits between countries. They argue that the current Entitlement deprives U.S. power customers of low-cost power, leading to increased electricity rates in the Northwest. The 1964 Columbia River Treaty did not include fisheries or ecosystem flows, leading to controversy during the current Treaty review. The U.S. Entity has recommended incorporating ecosystem flows and including a federal fisheries representative in the new Treaty. Tribal and environmental groups support including provisions for ecosystem-based functions in the Treaty. Some argue for adding ecosystem function as a third purpose in the Columbia River Treaty, alongside hydropower production and flood risk management. This change would require operational adjustments to increase flows for fisheries in spring and summer months. Some stakeholders support adding ecosystem function as a third purpose in the Columbia River Treaty, which would involve increasing flows for fisheries in spring and summer. However, some power interests, including some BPA customers, oppose this idea, believing it prioritizes ecosystem flows too much. Stakeholders argue that ecosystem flows are already prioritized in both countries through operational changes since the Treaty's ratification, benefiting fisheries with increased storage and mitigation efforts for salmon and steelhead listed under the ESA. Some stakeholders express concern over potential contradictions between maintaining existing hydropower operations under the Columbia River Treaty and increasing spring and summer flows for fisheries. They believe further operational changes could harm the Northwest economy and ratepayers. Another area of concern is the future approach to \"called-upon\" flood control operations, with suggestions for a coordinated operation plan and defining \"reasonable compensation\" for Canada. During the Columbia River Treaty review process, stakeholders are debating who will pay for U.S. benefits and the circumstances under which these operations would be necessary. The federal government is being urged to cover the costs, while the U.S. Entity is focused on estimating flood risk and operational needs, leading to disagreements with Canada. These details need to be defined in ongoing negotiations or future operating plans. Canada, represented by the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade, and Development, has the constitutional authority to negotiate international treaties. The Province of British Columbia (BC) has been primarily engaged in the Columbia River Treaty review process, initiating studies in 2011. In March 2013, BC decided to continue the Treaty while seeking improvements within the existing framework. BC's principles include specific requirements for flood control operations and a belief that the Canadian Entitlement does not fully benefit the United States and British Columbia. The United States and British Columbia have differing views on the impacts of the Columbia River Treaty. British Columbia disagrees with some of the U.S. Entity's findings, arguing that the U.S. benefits more from the treaty. Canada also disagrees with recommendations on flood control, hydropower, and ecosystem flows. Canada disagrees with the U.S. Entity's projections on flood control benefits and operations under the Columbia River Treaty, arguing that smaller U.S. reservoirs can provide flood storage before called-upon Canadian storage is required. Canada argues that new operations under the Columbia River Treaty may result in forgone benefits for the United States, including hydropower generation and fisheries. The Canadian Entity estimates that called-upon operations could lead to $40 million to $150 million per year in lost benefits for the U.S. In contrast, the U.S. Entity has projected costs of $4 million to $34 million per request for flood control, but has not anticipated the same level of losses to U.S. generating capacity. Canada also believes that the Canadian Entitlement is more equitable than previously suggested by the U.S. Entity. The Canadian Entity argues that the Columbia River Treaty should remain in place as it provides more benefits to the United States than previously suggested. They believe that terminating the Treaty would result in decreased revenues for Canada and constrain U.S. hydropower benefits. The U.S. Entity projects significant revenue gains for the United States if the Treaty is terminated, mainly due to the end of the Canadian Entitlement. The President, through the National Security Council, determines the negotiating position on the CRT. The National Security Council determines the negotiating position on the Columbia River Treaty (CRT), and the State Department conducts negotiations. The Senate has the power to approve treaties with a two-thirds vote. If modifications are made to the Treaty, the Senate would review and approve them through a resolution of ratification. The branch submits Treaty modifications to the Senate for review. The House and Senate have oversight roles in Treaty review. The Northwest delegation expressed concerns about the slow review process and urged negotiations with Canada. In 2017, a bipartisan group requested prompt commencement of CRT negotiations from President Trump."
