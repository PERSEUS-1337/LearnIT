    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Shaken Baby Syndrome Prevention Act\" and includes findings related to the prevention of this syndrome. The Congress finds incidents of child abuse, including Shaken Baby Syndrome cases like Cynthia Gibbs and George Lithco, emphasizing the need for prevention. The National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System reported that nearly 900,000 children in the US were victims of abuse and neglect in 2002, with almost 4 children dying each day. Children aged 1 year or younger accounted for 41.2% of fatalities, and children aged 4 years or younger accounted for 76.1%. Abusive head trauma, such as Shaken Baby Syndrome, is the leading cause of death for physically abused children, resulting in severe consequences like vision loss, brain damage, paralysis, seizures, or death. Shaken Baby Syndrome can lead to brain damage, paralysis, seizures, or death in infants. A 2003 report estimated that in the US, 300 children die each year from this syndrome, with many cases resulting in severe disabilities. Medical professionals believe many cases go undiagnosed. The syndrome can result in over $1,000,000 in medical costs for caring for a disabled child in the first few years of life. Prevention programs and education are effective in reducing cases of Shaken Baby Syndrome. The Upstate New York SBS Prevention Project saw a 47% decrease in shaking and head injuries in infants. Education programs raise awareness about the dangers of shaking young children. Education programs are effective in raising awareness about Shaken Baby Syndrome among various professionals and caregivers. Efforts to prevent the syndrome are supported by organizations across the United States. SEC. 3. EDUCATION AND AWARENESS CAMPAIGN. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will develop an ongoing public information campaign to educate the public, especially new parents and caregivers, about the dangers of shaking infants and young children under 5 years old. The program will include educational materials in various formats and public service announcements. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish biannual meetings with advocacy groups, parenting support communities, organizations involved in child protection, and other relevant agencies to prevent Shaken Baby Syndrome. Support for Parents of Surviving Children: The Secretary of Health and Human Services, along with relevant organizations and advocacy groups, will provide effective support for parents of children who suffer serious brain injuries from shaking, especially during the immediate aftermath when support is crucial. Authorization of appropriations for this Act includes $5,000,000 for fiscal year 2007."
