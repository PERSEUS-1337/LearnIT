Amendments are being made to the United States Insular Possession Program regarding the verification of wages paid to workers in the insular possessions for the production of watch movements and watches. Amendments to the United States Insular Possession Program involve verifying wages paid for watch production in insular possessions, including the quantity and value of watches produced and imported into the US.Certificates are issued to producers for the applicable amount. The United States Insular Possession Program calculates the amount payable to producers based on 90% of creditable wages for the first 300,000 units, a declining percentage for units between 300,000 and 750,000, and duties on watches imported into the US. The United States Insular Possession Program calculates payments to producers based on creditable wages for imported watches, watch movements, and jewelry under specific duty rates.Certificates issued under the program allow for refunds of duties on imported goods. The United States Insular Possession Program allows for refunds of duties on imported goods, with the Secretary of the Treasury authorizing refunds if there is an insufficient level of duties collected. The certificate holder can elect to receive payment directly from the Treasury Department, minus administrative costs. The Secretary of the Treasury determines the value of the certificate, with deductions for duty refunds and a discount of up to 2%. Direct payments are made under Treasury regulations with minimal documentation required. Recipients must certify that funds will be reinvested or used to support employment in the Virgin Islands. The Treasury Secretary is authorized to make the payments. The Secretary of the Treasury can make payments from duties collected on watches, watch movements, parts, or jewelry if necessary. Additional U.S. Note 3 to chapter 71 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule is amended to remove the 750,000 unit limitation for articles of jewelry. The U.S. Note 3 to chapter 71 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule is amended to exempt jewelry assembled in certain territories from certain provisions.
