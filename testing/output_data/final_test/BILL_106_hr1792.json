    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Bipartisan Rural Law Enforcement Crime-Fighting Scholarship Act\". The Congress acknowledges the similarity between urban and rural illegal gang organizations and drug trafficking systems. Urban law enforcement agencies use modern technology and tactics to combat crime, while rural agencies may benefit from firsthand observation programs to improve community efforts. The curr_chunk discusses firsthand observations of strategies and technologies used by law enforcement agencies to combat gangs, illegal drug trafficking, and create safer communities. Establishment of the Rural Law Enforcement Crime-Fighting Scholarship Program. The Attorney General will establish a rural law enforcement scholarship program to provide grants for rural law enforcement agencies to observe advanced strategies and technologies used by Federal and urban law enforcement agencies in fighting gangs, illegal drug trafficking, and creating safer communities. Before grants are awarded, Federal and urban law enforcement agencies willing to participate will be identified. The Attorney General will publish a list of urban and Federal agencies for rural law enforcement observation opportunities. Grant amounts will be determined based on costs, with a maximum award of $2,500 for individual agencies and $7,500 for consortiums. Selected officers must meet participation requirements. Officers selected for a rural law enforcement scholarship can participate in an observation opportunity for up to 1 month. Only one officer per rural law enforcement agency or consortium can take part. The grant can cover travel, lodging, and other expenses for participating officers. SEC. 4. ELIGIBILITY AND SELECTION. To be eligible for a grant under this Act, a rural law enforcement agency must submit an application to the Secretary. Grant recipients are selected based on criteria including the extent of violent crime, drug trafficking, and other indicators of crime in the area served by the agency. The Memorial State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Programs focus on providing law enforcement officers with knowledge and skills that can be utilized in the rural areas they serve. The Attorney General must submit a report to Congress within 3 years of this Act's enactment on the success of rural law enforcement agencies in implementing strategies or technology from the rural law enforcement scholarship program. The Act defines terms such as \"consortium of law enforcement agencies,\" \"law enforcement officer,\" \"metropolitan statistical area,\" and \"rural law enforcement agency.\" A rural law enforcement agency serves a city, town, township, borough, or village. The Act defines terms related to law enforcement agencies, including \"rural law enforcement agency\" which serves areas outside metropolitan statistical areas with less than 10,000 residents or counties with less than 80,000 residents. Authorization of appropriations for the Act is set at $12,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2000 to 2005."
