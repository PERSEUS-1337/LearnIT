    "content": "Foreign nationals can be admitted to the United States temporarily or permanently. Permanent residents are known as immigrants or legal permanent residents (LPRs), while temporary visitors are called nonimmigrants. Nonimmigrants include tourists, students, diplomats, workers, entertainers, media representatives, business personnel, and crew members on foreign vessels. These visa categories are commonly referred to by letter and numeral, such as B-2 for tourists, E-2 for treaty investors, F-1 for foreign students, and H-1B for professional workers. The L-1 visa is for international executives, managers, or those with specialized knowledge, established in 1970 to address difficulties faced by multinational corporations in transferring top personnel to the US. Immediate family members are admitted on L-2 visas. The L-1 visa was established in 1970 for international executives, managers, or those with specialized knowledge. Congress made changes in 1990, including time limits for L visas and allowing L visa holders to petition for LPR status. The 107th Congress reduced the required work time for L-1 visa holders. The 107th Congress reduced the required work time for L-1 visa holders from one year to six months and allowed spouses of L-1 nonimmigrants to work in the U.S. The 108th Congress enacted provisions in the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2005 that made certain aliens ineligible for L visa status if they work for an employer other than the petitioning employer or its affiliate in a capacity involving specialized knowledge. The 108th Congress enacted provisions in the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2005 that made certain aliens ineligible for L visa status if they work for an employer other than the petitioning employer or its affiliate in a capacity involving specialized knowledge. Additionally, a fraud prevention and detection fee of $500 was imposed on H-1B and L petitioners. The number of L visas issued has increased significantly over the past 25 years, with India sending the most intracompany transfers in FY2005. In FY2005, India sent the most intracompany transfers with almost two-thirds of L visas issued. Great Britain and Japan followed with 10.5% and 9.8% of L visas respectively. The top 10 countries accounted for 74.9% of all L visas issued. Canadians do not need L visas to enter the US. The number of L nonimmigrants entering the US has grown significantly over the past 24 years. The number of L nonimmigrants entering the US has grown significantly over the past 24 years, with a sixfold increase from 65,044 in FY1981 to 456,583 in FY2004. The analysis shows a 400% increase in L-1 visa holders from 63,180 in FY1990 to 314,484 in FY2004. L visa holders now travel abroad more frequently than a decade ago. A firm must file an I-129 petition with USCIS for an L-1 nonimmigrant to enter the US. The USCIS in the DHS allows employers to file blanket petitions for L nonimmigrants. Once approved, the alien applies for a visa with the DOS Bureau of Consular Affairs. The alien must meet specific job qualifications and have been employed by the firm for at least six months in the preceding three years. The alien must be in an executive, managerial, or specialized knowledge capacity for the L visa. The INA does not require firms to meet labor market tests for L visa intracompany transfers into the United States. Employers must demonstrate that U.S. workers are not adversely affected when sponsoring LPRs or hiring foreign workers. This is done through petitions with USCIS, ETA, and DOL. L visa holders in the U.S. are generally required to pay. L visa holders working in the United States are required to pay federal income taxes, Social Security, and Medicare taxes. Tax treaties may override resident alien tax rules in certain cases. There is debate over bringing foreign managers and specialized personnel to the U.S. when qualified U.S. personnel are available. Some argue that L-1 visas should be limited to top-level executives of multinational firms to prevent unfair advantage over U.S.-owned businesses. Supporters of current law believe it is essential for multinational firms to assign top personnel to U.S. facilities without delays. Concerns are raised that burdensome regulations may deter multinational firms from doing business in the United States. Some firms may find it burdensome to do business in the United States due to restrictions on L visas. Critics mention that some employers are exploiting loopholes in the H-1B visa system by exaggerating the skills of foreign workers to qualify for L visas. Some firms exploit loopholes in the H-1B visa system to qualify for L visas, allowing them to outsource workers. Advocates warn that L visas are replacing H-1B visas for IT positions, leading to a potential increase in L admissions. Supporters argue that intracompany transfers are essential and should not be subject to labor market tests, as it could hinder corporate flexibility and control. Labor attestation for L visas could make business in the US more costly, potentially leading to job outsourcing. Critics of current law on L visas are concerned that free trade agreements retain the current language on L visas, which could prevent the United States from making statutory changes to L visas and other temporary business and worker nonimmigrant categories. Proponents of these trade agreements argue that they are simply reflecting the importance of intracompany transfers without labor market tests or numerical limits. The House and Senate passed legislation implementing trade agreements with Chile and Singapore in 2003, similar to NAFTA's immigration provisions for intracompany transferees. NAFTA requires temporary entry for business persons with managerial or special knowledge roles. The L visa for intracompany transferees involves special knowledge and requires one year of foreign work experience. Trade agreements like GATS and FTAs have specific definitions for intracompany transferees, raising concerns about constraints on Congress in revising immigration laws. The L visa allows for the transfer of managers, executives, and workers with specialized knowledge, but there are concerns about the difficulty in verifying the true intentions of firms and the broad definition of specialized knowledge leading to almost all petitions being approved. The DHS Office of the Inspector General identified potential vulnerabilities and abuses in the L-1 visa. Adjudicators often approve almost all L-1 visa petitions without evaluating the foreign operation's substantiality. The visa is commonly used by computer and IT outsourcing firms, with many workers coming from India. DHS OIG made recommendations in a 2006 report to address these issues. In a 2006 report, DHS OIG recommended establishing procedures for overseas verification of pending H and L petitions, exploring the assistance of ICE Visa Security Officers abroad, and seeking legislative clarification on manager, executive, and specialized knowledge concepts. H.R. 2154 aimed to prevent the outsourcing of L-1 visa holders by requiring employers to file applications stating they will not place nonimmigrants with other firms. H.R. 2154 aims to prohibit outsourcing of L-1 visa holders by requiring employers to submit applications attesting to various conditions, similar to H-1B visa requirements. The USA Jobs Protection Act of 2003 proposed changes to L visa laws, including adding labor attestation requirements, lay-off protections for US workers, restrictions on outsourcing L-1 visa holders, DOL authority to investigate complaints, and the ability to assess a fee for application processing. Specifically, it required employers to file an application with DOL stating they made efforts to recruit before petitioning for specialized knowledge L-1 visas. The L-1 Visa (Intracompany Transferee) Reform Act of 2003 aimed to amend the INA for L-1 visa holders, requiring control and supervision by the petitioning employer. Senator Saxby Chambliss introduced the legislation, which also proposed changes to H-1B visas and reduced the total time L visa holders could stay in the US. The Save American Jobs Through L Visa Reform Act of 2004 aimed to restrict L visas, eliminating \"specialized knowledge\" as a basis for obtaining the visa and imposing a cap of 35,000 visas annually. It also proposed removing L nonimmigrants from classes not presumed to be immigrants under \u00c2\u00a7214(b). Representative Lamar Smith introduced the American Workforce Improvement and Jobs Protection Act. Lamar Smith introduced H.R. 4166, the American Workforce Improvement and Jobs Protection Act, which aimed to impose a fraud prevention fee on H-1B or L petitioners, restrict L visa eligibility for aliens with specialized knowledge working for unaffiliated employers, and eliminate the reduction in continuous employment requirement for L visa applicants under blanket petitions. H.R. 4166 introduced in 2004 aimed to reform L visa eligibility, with provisions later incorporated into P.L. 108-447. It stated that aliens are ineligible for an L visa if they are controlled by an unaffiliated employer or if their placement is essentially for labor hire rather than for providing a product or service. The Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act includes a fraud prevention fee for H-1B and L visa petitioners, with the fee divided among DHS, DOS, and DOL. It also revises L visa requirements, adding new criteria for applicants working in new facilities. The USA Jobs Protection Act of 2005 (H.R. 3322) aims to add labor attestation requirements to the L visa, enact lay-off protections for U.S. workers, restrict outsourcing of L-1 visa holders, and give DOL authority to investigate complaints. It would also require employers to file an application with DOL before petitioning for specialized knowledge provision of the L-1 visa. The L-1 Nonimmigrant Reform Act (H.R. 3381) introduced by Representative Rosa DeLauro would require employers of L-1 visa holders to submit labor condition applications attesting to offering comparable wages, no adverse effects on other workers, no layoffs of U.S. workers, and no outsourcing of L visa holders. It would also give the Department of Labor authority to investigate complaints against firms. The bill H.R. 3381 aims to regulate firms hiring L visa holders by establishing fines for violators, setting a 35,000 annual visa limit, and requiring L-1 workers to have a bachelor's degree in their field. Additionally, H.R. 3648 proposes extra fees of $1,500 for employers filing L visa applications and petitions. H.R. 3648, part of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, included provisions to raise the minimum fee for L-1 visas by $750. The Senate passed S. 1932 with these provisions as Title VIII. The conference report on S. 1932, renamed the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, was reported on December 19. The House agreed to the conference report on December 19. The House agreed to the conference report on H.R. 3648 by a vote of 212-206. The Senate removed extraneous matter from the legislation and returned the amended measure to the House by a vote of 51-50."
