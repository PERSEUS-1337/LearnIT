    "content": "The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, signed by the President in 2006, aims to reform sex offender registration standards, introduce amendments to federal criminal law, and create grant programs for prevention and law enforcement. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, signed in 2006, includes grant programs for prevention and law enforcement, as well as the creation of the National Child Abuse Registry. It also revises the nation-wide sex offender registration system. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, signed in 2006, revises the nation-wide sex offender registration system by preserving the basis structure of the earlier law, expanding upon it, and making more specific matters that were previously left to individual state choice. The Walsh Act anticipates that states and other jurisdictions may require three years or more to fully implement its modifications, with the new requirements becoming effective upon implementation. The Supreme Court has upheld two state sex offender statutes, rejecting constitutional challenges in cases such as Connecticut Department of Public Safety v. Doe and Smith v. Doe. The Court ruled that the statutes were civil and nonpunitive, not violating ex post facto laws. Challenges regarding due process and dangerousness of offenders have also been dismissed by other courts. The class of offenders required to register under the statute has been expanded to include those previously convicted of various offenses. Offenders must register in each state or territory where they live, work, or attend school, with five classes of qualifying offenses outlined. The class of offenders required to register under the statute has been expanded to include those previously convicted of various offenses, with five classes of qualifying offenses outlined, including kidnaping of a minor, false imprisonment of a minor, solicitation of a minor, possession of child pornography, and other sexual offenses against a minor. The registration requirements for offenders have been expanded to include various offenses, with specific qualifying offenses outlined. The definition of \"sexual act\" and \"sexual contact\" is not provided in the act, but is consistently defined elsewhere in the United States Code. The expanded registration requirements for offenders include various offenses, with a focus on sexual acts and contacts defined as intentional touching with intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse sexual desire. This class of federal offenses covers violations of state, local, tribal, foreign, military, and potentially D.C. and territorial laws. The class of federal offenses triggering registration requirements includes various sexual offenses such as sex trafficking, sexual abuse, exploitation of children, child pornography, and illicit sexual purposes. The federal offenses that trigger registration requirements include transportation for illicit sexual purposes, coercing travel for illicit sexual purposes, travel involving illicit sexual activity with a child, filing false statements concerning an alien for illicit sexual purposes, and interstate transmission of information about a child relating to illicit sexual activity. Military offenses designated by the Secretary of Defense also qualify, such as rape, forcible sodomy, conduct unbecoming an officer involving sexually violent offenses or crimes against minors, and indecent assault. The offenses that trigger registration requirements include indecent assault, assault with intent to commit rape or sodomy, indecent act with a minor, pornography involving a minor, and conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline. This also includes attempts or conspiracies to commit these offenses. The registration requirements for qualifying offenses are limited to instances where the offender is convicted of attempt or conspiracy. Conviction for a qualifying foreign offense may not necessitate registration if due process requirements are not met. Consensual sex offenses may not require registration under certain circumstances, and juvenile delinquency adjudications do not count as qualifying convictions. The registration requirements for qualifying offenses are limited to instances where the offender is convicted of attempt or conspiracy. Juvenile delinquency adjudications do not constitute qualifying convictions unless the offender is 14 years of age or older at the time of the misconduct and the misconduct adjudicated is comparable to aggravated sexual assault. There are no specific limitations on registration based on overturned, sealed, or expunged convictions. The Attorney General is authorized to promulgate rules of applicability for those required to register. The registration requirements for qualifying offenses include providing license plate numbers, vehicle descriptions, physical description, current photograph, fingerprints, palm prints, DNA sample, criminal record, and other information as required by the Attorney General. Offenders must register before release from incarceration or within three days of sentencing if not imprisoned. Those released or sentenced without imprisonment before the act's effective date must comply with registration requirements. Registrants must notify jurisdictions of any changes in their information within three days. The frequency of appearance for new photographs and verification depends on their offender status. Tier III offenders must appear at least every three months. Tier II offenders must reappear every six months and include those with felony convictions for specific federal sex offenses or generic sex offenses. These offenses include sex trafficking, coercing or enticing a child for illicit sexual activity, interstate transportation of a child for illicit purposes, and abusive sexual contact. Tier II offenders must maintain their registration for 25 years, while Tier III offenders must register for life, with the possibility of reducing it to 25 years under certain conditions. Tier I offenders, on the other hand, must register for 15 years, which can be reduced to 10 years if they meet specific requirements. The act requires sex offenders to maintain registration for life, with the possibility of reducing it to 25 years if certain conditions are met. Registration information must be publicly available online, but certain details like the victim's identity and unconvicted arrests must be excluded. Individual jurisdictions can choose what information to include for Tier I offenders, with the Attorney General overseeing the National Sex Offender Registry. The Attorney General is directed to maintain a National Sex Offender Registry and ensure timely forwarding of registration information to jurisdictions. The Dru Sjodin National Sex Offender Public Website provides online access to sex offender registries of states, territories, and jurisdictions. Participation in the Megan Nicole Kanka and Alexandra Nicole Zapp Communication Notification Program requires updated registration information to be provided to various entities within five days. The National Child Protection Act requires the Attorney General to develop uniform sex offender registries, establish a grant program for states, and assist in locating registrants after disasters. The SMART Office within the Justice Department is responsible for administering the registration and notification process. The Attorney General administers the sex offender registration standards and grant program. Noncompliant jurisdictions risk losing Byrne program funds. Failure to register is a federal crime for certain offenders. Offenders convicted of federal qualifying offenses, traveling in interstate or Indian country, face up to 10 years in prison. Additional penalties of 5-30 years apply for crimes of violence. Offenders may also face supervised release for at least five years or life. Foreign nationals are deportable upon conviction. Failure to register as a sex offender for specified crimes results in revocation of supervised release and a minimum five-year prison sentence. The Attorney General is authorized to use resources to locate and apprehend sex offenders who fail to register. An annual report to Congress is required on prosecution for failure to register, efforts to track down non-compliant offenders, and compliance with registration requirements. A task force will study risk-based classification of sex offenders, and effectiveness of reducing recidivism among them will be examined and reported on. The National Institute of Justice has been given five years to study and make recommendations to Congress for the reduction of sex offenses against children and improving the sex offender registration system. Section 636 instructs the Government Accountability Office to study the feasibility of a nationwide requirement for sharing sex offender registration information with motor vehicle authorities. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act focuses on child protection and safety by creating new federal crimes, enhancing penalties for existing crimes, and amending federal criminal procedure. The new federal crimes include murder in the course of federal sex offenses, Internet date rape drug trafficking, kidnaping using interstate facilities, child abuse in Indian country, production of obscene material, obscenity or pornography in Internet source codes, and child exploitation enterprises. Penalty increases are also included for serious violent crimes against children. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act focuses on child protection and safety by creating new federal crimes and amending federal criminal procedure. The new federal crimes include serious violent crimes against children, coercion or enticement of a child for illicit sexual purposes, interstate transportation of a child for illicit sexual purposes, sexual abuse in a federal prison, aggravated sexual abuse of a child, abusive sexual contact with a child, sexual exploitation of a child, traffic in child exploitive material, traffic in child pornography, use of a misleading Internet domain name to induce a child, overseas production of child exploitive or pornographic material, sex trafficking, failure to report child abuse, and false statements relating to child or sexual offenses. The criminal procedure changes related to crimes against children include random searches of sex offenders, expanded DNA collection for federal charges, elimination of statute of limitations for sexual crimes, participation of state crime victims in federal habeas proceedings, study of marital privileges in abuse cases, preventive detention in cases involving minor victims or firearms, compensation for guardians ad litem, government control of evidence in pornography cases, and forfeiture procedures in obscenity, exploitation, and pornography cases. Section 210 of federal law allows random searches of sex offender registrants as a condition of their supervised release or probation, raising Fourth Amendment concerns. The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, but there are exceptions, such as upheld random searches by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has upheld random searches of individuals on parole or probation, emphasizing that Fourth Amendment compliance hinges on reasonableness. The Court considers the balance between an individual's privacy rights and the government's interests when determining the legality of a search. In previous cases, the Court has supported suspicion-based, warrantless searches in certain circumstances. Parolees and probationers have reduced expectations of privacy, with parolees having fewer expectations than probationers. Acceptance of suspicionless searches as a condition of parole diminishes privacy expectations. The government's interest in reducing recidivism among probationers and parolees is considered substantial by the Court. The Court found that promoting reintegration and positive citizenship among probationers and parolees justifies privacy intrusions not tolerated under the Fourth Amendment. The special needs doctrine and consent exceptions present challenges in this context. The Court has been reluctant to recognize exceptions to the general rule of individualized suspicion for government authorities pursuing crime control ends. However, there are circumstances where the Court has overcome this reluctance, such as with consent for parole and probation conditions. Unlike parole or probation, supervised release is imposed rather than accepted, and the conditions are discretionary. Section 210 amends federal law to require consent for DNA sample collection as a mandatory condition of federal probation and supervised release. Fourth Amendment challenges to DNA sample collection have generally been unsuccessful in lower federal courts, with different approaches taken by courts. Section 210 amends federal law to allow warrantless searches for sex offenders on probation or supervised release. The distinction between probation officers and other law enforcement officers reflects different modes of analysis for random searches. The Court has approved random searches in certain cases for special needs analysis and reasonable suspicion. The Court approved random searches in school and drug cases for special administrative needs. The DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act authorized DNA collection from individuals convicted of federal qualifying offenses. Samples are provided to the FBI for analysis and inclusion in CODIS. The DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act authorized DNA collection from individuals arrested or convicted of federal offenses, expanding the Attorney General's authority to collect samples from those facing charges or convicted of any federal offense. This includes individuals arrested under US laws or detained under US laws, regardless of the basis for arrest or detention. The DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act expanded the Attorney General's authority to collect DNA samples from individuals arrested or convicted of federal offenses, including those facing charges or convicted of any federal offense. The term \"facing charges\" is not clearly defined, but it may refer to individuals released on bail under pre-trial supervision. The act does not amend the expungement provision for qualifying offenses, allowing records of individuals with overturned convictions for serious offenses to be expunged. Women and the Walsh amendments of the 109th Congress have not yet been the subject of decided case law. Academicians have differing views on the constitutionality of arrestee DNA sampling practices. Lower courts have generally rejected constitutional challenges to DNA collection statutes, especially post-conviction. However, defendants with overturned convictions and arrestees not prosecuted may have a stronger expectation of privacy compared to inmates, parolees, and those on supervised release. It remains to be seen how courts will weigh this difference. The statute of limitations for federal crimes varies, with no limit for capital offenses, terrorism crimes, or certain child-related offenses. Section 211 eliminates the statute of limitations for specific federal crimes involving kidnapping, sexual abuse, exploitation, illicit sexual purposes, and sex trafficking. It is unclear if this applies retroactively. The elimination of the statute of limitations for specific federal crimes under Section 211 may not apply retroactively. Victims of federal crimes have limited statutory rights to notice, attendance, and participation in judicial proceedings. Victims of state crimes also have similar rights in state judicial proceedings. Section 212 grants victims of state crimes attendance and participation rights in federal habeas corpus proceedings related to the state crime they were victimized by. The rights granted to victims of state crimes in federal habeas proceedings include the right to be heard, free from delay, and treated with dignity and respect. These rights are enforceable through writs of mandamus, but do not impose obligations on federal executive branch officials. Notably, there is no right to notification of the time or place of the proceedings, and victims may have the right to argue their points. The rights granted to victims of state crimes in federal habeas proceedings include the right to be heard, free from delay, and treated with dignity and respect. Victims may have the right to argue their points of law raised in the proceedings, with no right to attendance or participation for families of child victims unless the child is deceased or incapacitated. Evidentiary questions in federal criminal cases may pose challenges in understanding the rationale behind certain features of victims' rights. The Federal Rules of Evidence govern evidentiary questions in federal criminal cases, with federal privileges based on common law principles. Two marital privileges are recognized: one for confidential communications between spouses and another allowing one spouse to refuse to testify against the other. Exceptions exist for crimes committed within the marital relationship. Section 214 directs the Committee on Rules, Practice, Procedure and Evidence of the Judicial Conference to study the necessity of establishing an exception to spousal privileges in cases involving a crime against a child. About a third of states allow involuntary civil commitment of sex offenders based on future risk. In some states, involuntary civil commitment can be used for individuals deemed dangerous to themselves or others, including sex offenders. The Supreme Court has addressed concerns about using civil commitment as a substitute for criminal trials for sex offenders. The Court upheld a Kansas statute requiring a finding of dangerousness before involuntary confinement. The Kansas statute requires evidence of past sexual violent behavior and a present mental condition creating a likelihood of future violent conduct for involuntary commitment. Dangerousness alone is not enough for commitment; there must be proof of a mental illness or abnormality. This ensures confinement is limited to those with a volitional impairment making them uncontrollably dangerous. The Kansas statute requires evidence of past sexual violent behavior and a present mental condition creating a likelihood of future violent conduct for involuntary commitment. It narrows the class of persons eligible for confinement to those who are unable to control their dangerousness. The United States Supreme Court clarified that there must be proof of serious difficulty in controlling behavior for civil commitment. The government must show proof of serious difficulty in controlling behavior for civil commitment of dangerous sexual offenders with mental abnormalities, distinguishing them from typical recidivists. Different courts have varied opinions on the standard of control needed to satisfy due process for sexual predator civil commitment statutes. The federal civil commitment procedure for sexual offenders requires clear and convincing evidence that the individual is a sexually dangerous person, defined as someone who has engaged in sexually violent conduct or child molestation and would have difficulty refraining from such behavior if released due to a serious mental illness or disorder. Section 301 also establishes a grant program to assist states in implementing these measures. Section 301 establishes a grant program to assist states in establishing civil commitment programs for sexually dangerous persons. Bail conditions for federal offenses aim to ensure appearance at judicial proceedings and community safety, with specific restrictions for offenses involving children. The curr_chunk lists federal offenses related to child exploitation, including sex trafficking, sexual abuse, child pornography, and illicit sexual activities with children. Federal law allows for preventive detention upon the prosecution's motion for individuals charged with violent crimes, serious federal offenses, nonviolent crimes involving a child victim, failure to register as a sex offender, or similar offenses. If released before trial, the individual may be subject to electronic monitoring, restrictions on personal activities, instructions to avoid contact with victims, reporting to authorities, curfew, and prohibition on possessing dangerous items. Section 216(3) expands the scope of crimes that warrant preventive detention to include offenses involving a child victim, failure to register as a sex offender, or possession of a firearm or dangerous weapon. This overturns previous court decisions that did not consider simple possession of a firearm as a crime of violence for preventive detention purposes. The revised provision now includes consideration of whether the offense involves a minor, federal terrorism, or is a crime of violence. The revised provision now includes consideration of whether the offense involves a minor, federal terrorism, or is a crime of violence, such as offenses with a controlled substance, firearm, explosive, or destructive device. Special consideration is given to federal crimes of terrorism not just those carrying a 10-year sentence, including offenses with less than a 10-year penalty like destruction of federal property under $1000 or threats and involuntary manslaughter. Federal law allows courts to appoint guardians ad litem to protect children who witness or are victims of a crime. Section 507 of the law authorizes federal courts to provide compensation and expenses for guardians ad litem appointed to protect child victims of crimes. Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires prosecutors to provide defendants with access to materials seized in child pornography cases that are relevant to the defense. Section 504 mandates that material constituting child pornography must be retained. Section 504 mandates that material constituting child pornography must remain in the care of the prosecution or court. Defense requests for copies can be denied if the prosecution makes the material reasonably available for inspection. Confiscation of property related to obscenity or child exploitation is allowed by the United States. Confiscation can be done through criminal prosecution (criminal forfeiture) or civil proceedings (civil forfeiture) where the property is treated as the defendant. Civil forfeiture does not require conviction of the property owner, only a statutory nexus to the crime. Law enforcement agencies involved in confiscation often share in the proceeds. Federal law allows for criminal forfeiture of obscene material and property used in obscenity violations. The obscenity statute outlines procedures for forfeiture related to obscenity violations, adopting controlled substance procedures and civil forfeiture provisions. It also modifies forfeiture provisions for crimes of sexual exploitation of children, replacing individual criminal and civil procedures with generic procedures from Chapter 46 and the controlled substance statute. The Mann Act violations are excluded from exploitation-related forfeiture sections. The Mann Act includes criminal and civil forfeiture provisions for violations. It allows for forfeiture of property used in sexual abuse crimes. The death penalty for federal murder is limited to specific aggravating offenses, including murder during certain federal crimes like treason and kidnapping. Section 206(a)(4) adds murder during sexual offenses to the list of aggravating federal felonies. Section 206(a)(3) of Title 18 of the United States Code expands the list of federal crimes that can result in a capital offense to include murder committed during sexual abuse crimes. This includes offenses such as sex trafficking, sexual exploitation of children, and transportation for illicit sexual purposes. Additionally, drugs and controlled substances are regulated and penalized based on their type and schedule. The distribution of \"date rape drugs\" is punishable by imprisonment for up to 20 years. Unlawful use of the Internet to distribute certain substances is also punishable by imprisonment for up to 20 years. Federal kidnapping jurisdiction has been expanded to include various criminal acts. Federal kidnapping jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. 1201 includes transporting a person across state lines or using interstate commerce in the commission of the offense. This jurisdiction also covers kidnapping within U.S. special aircraft or maritime jurisdiction, involving federal officers, employees, or foreign dignitaries. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act expanded federal jurisdiction to cover crimes committed by Indians against other Indians or persons within Indian country. This includes felony violations of federal sexual abuse law, incest, assault resulting in serious injury, assault upon a child, and felony child abuse or neglect. These crimes are defined by state law when not specified by federal law. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act expanded federal jurisdiction to cover crimes committed by Indians against other Indians or persons within Indian country, including felony violations of federal sexual abuse law, incest, assault resulting in serious injury, assault upon a child, and felony child abuse or neglect. The new federal law also criminalizes the production of obscene material for commercial purposes, use of misleading Internet domain names to deceive children into viewing pornography, and inclusion of deceptive content in Internet source codes to induce individuals to view pornography. Section 701 of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act outlaws child exploitation enterprises involving multiple persons committing federal felonies related to sexual offenses against children. Offenders face imprisonment for a minimum of 20 years or life. Predicate offenses include kidnapping, sex trafficking of children, aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, and sexual abuse of a ward or child. The listed statutes cover various forms of sexual abuse, exploitation, and trafficking involving children, including abusive sexual contact, selling or buying children, distributing child pornography, and coercing travel for illicit sexual purposes. Section 202 establishes new sentencing ranges for federal crimes of violence involving child victims, including murder, kidnaping, maiming, or aggravated assault. Minimum terms of imprisonment range from 10 years to life depending on the offense. The new provision in Section 202 establishes new sentencing ranges for federal crimes of violence involving child victims, converting certain federal murder statutes into capital offenses when the victim is a child and the misconduct involves intentional killing or reckless fatal violence. This includes offenses such as murder resulting from fraud involving aircraft and spacecraft parts, murder in the course of an animal terrorism offense, murder resulting from the use or possession of variola virus, and murder in the course of other specified offenses. The new provision in Section 202 establishes new sentencing ranges for federal crimes of violence involving child victims, converting certain federal murder statutes into capital offenses when the victim is a child and the misconduct involves intentional killing or reckless fatal violence. This includes offenses such as murder resulting from the use or possession of variola virus, murder in the course of restricting access to abortion clinics, murder resulting from health care fraud, murder resulting from consumer product tampering, and other specified offenses. Penalty increases attributable to the new statute may appear less dramatic in the case of kidnaping and maiming. The new Section 3559(f) imposes harsher penalties for federal crimes like kidnaping and maiming, with kidnaping punishable by imprisonment for any term of years or for life, and maiming punishable by imprisonment for not more than 20 years. The impact of this new provision on federal assault law is uncertain, as there are many federal assault statutes with varying penalties, some of which may not involve children as victims. The new Section 3559(f) imposes harsher penalties for federal crimes like kidnaping and maiming, with kidnaping punishable by imprisonment for any term of years or for life, and maiming punishable by imprisonment for not more than 20 years. It leaves undefined the range of dangerous weapons that may trigger its application, including ordinary objects like shoes and belts. This section replaces penalties for federal assault statutes when a child is victimized, with imprisonment for not less than 10 years or for life. The act increases penalties for several child offenses, including a 10-year term of imprisonment for individuals who commit subsequent felony violations involving a child. The offenses include kidnaping, obscene visual representation of sexual child abuse, transfer of obscene material to children, sex trafficking of children, aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, sexual abuse of a ward or child, and abusive sexual contact. The act includes various offenses related to child abuse, such as sexual exploitation, transportation for illicit sexual purposes, and interstate transmission of information about a child. It also establishes grant programs for child and community safety, including mentoring grants for Big Brothers Big Sisters of America. The organization is required to provide progress reports to the Administrator of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention twice a year. The National Police Athletic League Youth Enrichment Act established a grant program for the Police Athletic League with appropriations authorized at $16 million annually through FY2005. Subtitle VI-B reauthorizes appropriations at the same levels for fiscal years 2006 through 2010 and empowers the Attorney General to provide grants for electronic monitoring devices for sex offenders with appropriations of $5 million per year from 2007 onwards. Section 623 establishes a grant program for entities assisting in treatment of juvenile sex offenders or enforcing sex offender registration. Appropriations are authorized for FY2007 through FY2009. Section 624 allows grants for prosecution of cases cleared due to DNA backlog elimination with appropriations for FY2007 through FY2011. Section 625 creates a grant program for law enforcement agencies combating child sexual abuse. Authorized appropriations are provided. Section 626 authorizes grants for a national organization to run a crime prevention media campaign with appropriations of $7 million (FY2007), $8 million (FY2008), $9 million (FY2009), and $10 million (FY2010). Section 627 allows grants for fingerprinting children with appropriations totaling $20 million through FY2011. Section 628 authorizes grants for RAINN to operate a sexual assault hotline with $3 million per year for FY2007-2010. The text authorizes appropriations for child safety grant programs and the Jessica Lunsford Address Verification Grant Program. It includes provisions to prevent and prosecute child victimization, such as broadening access to criminal records, creating a national child abuse registry, and expanding recordkeeping requirements for those in the production of sexually explicit material. The text authorizes appropriations for child safety grant programs and the Jessica Lunsford Address Verification Grant Program. It includes provisions to prevent and prosecute child victimization, such as broadening access to criminal records, creating a national child abuse registry, and expanding recordkeeping requirements for those in the business of producing sexually explicit material. Additionally, it immunizes officials from civil liability for activities involving sexual offender registration and directs the Department of Justice to establish and maintain child protective activities. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is directed to establish a registry of substantiated instances of child abuse or neglect, only accessible to entities obligated to protect children against abuse and neglect. The FBI maintains criminal information databases for law enforcement purposes. The system is primarily used for law enforcement purposes and background checks. Section 151 directs the FBI to make national criminal information databases available to child protective service agencies and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Section 152 expands background check requirements for states receiving Title IV-E payments for foster care and adoption assistance. Section 152 expands background check requirements for states receiving Title IV-E payments for foster care and adoption assistance. It mandates fingerprint criminal record checks using the FBI's databases for all prospective foster and adoptive parents, regardless of receiving assistance. States must also check child abuse and neglect registries in previous states of residence, honor reciprocal registry requests, and prevent unauthorized dissemination of information. Section 152(b) phases out the ability to opt out of criminal records checks by October 1, 2008. Section 153 of the legislation allows for fingerprint-based background checks on prospective foster and adoptive parents, as well as employees of schools and in child abuse investigations. Law enforcement agencies are prohibited from imposing waiting periods for missing person reports. Section 154 prohibits removal from the system based solely on the age of the missing person. Producers of sexually explicit material must maintain records to ensure they are not using children as subjects. The Attorney General has authority to issue implementing regulations regarding the verification of performers in sexually explicit material. Enforcement of the regulations was initially halted due to concerns over reaching secondary producers and the implications of a Supreme Court case. Section 502 amends the law to clarify that it applies to secondary producers and digitally created explicit material. Section 2257 and Section 503 mandate recording keeping for producers of sexually explicit material involving human performers. Section 707 increased the minimum damages for child victims of federal sexual offenses to $150,000. Section 707 increased the minimum damages for child victims of federal sexual offenses to $150,000. The offenses include various violations related to sexual abuse, exploitation, child pornography, and illicit sexual purposes. Additionally, electronic service providers are required to report evidence of child pornography to law enforcement authorities. The Cyber Tip Line of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children allows service providers immunity for reporting child pornography to law enforcement. Section 130 of the act provides civil and criminal immunity for the Center and its affiliates, similar to the PROTECT Act. Section 131 grants civil immunity for government officers involved in the sexual offender registration system. It is unclear if this immunity shields the Center from federal and state liability. The act includes provisions for immunity for government officers and the Department of Justice in child protection efforts, such as Project Safe Childhood. This project coordinates efforts to investigate and prosecute Internet crimes against children at federal, state, local, and tribal levels. Section 145 of the act instructs the Attorney General to expand efforts to prevent Internet misuse by sex offenders, including training for law enforcement officials and involving the computer industry. Section 622 authorizes the Bureau of Prisons to establish sex offender monitoring programs, while Section 629 allows the Attorney General to develop public initiatives with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Section 632 of the act instructs the Marshals Service to establish a Fugitive Safe Surrender program in designated cities for capturing fugitives, with appropriations of $3 million (FY2007), $5 million (FY2008), and $8 million (FY2009). Section 704 directs the Attorney General to increase prosecutors dedicated to child sexual exploitation cases, subject to appropriations. Section 705 calls for an increase in computer forensic examiners for investigating sexual crimes. The act calls for an increase in computer forensic examiners dedicated to investigating sexual crimes involving children, with a minimum of 30 examiners for the Department of Justice and 15 for the Department of Homeland Security."
