    "content": "SECTION 1. PARKING PRIVILEGES FOR CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES. Section 1 introduces parking privileges for individuals with disabilities, stating that each State must extend the same parking privileges to qualified motor vehicles from other States as it does to those designated within its own laws. A qualified motor vehicle is defined as one designated for transporting an individual with a disability that limits their ability to walk. The text discusses withholding funds from states that do not comply with regulations regarding parking privileges for individuals with disabilities. The Secretary can withhold 5% of funds in the first year and 10% in subsequent years if noncompliance continues. The text discusses withholding funds from states for noncompliance with disability parking regulations. Funds withheld before September 30, 1997, will remain available for apportionment to the State until the end of the fiscal year. The funds authorized under different sections will remain available until the end of specific fiscal years. The funds authorized under this section shall remain available until the end of the 3rd fiscal year following the fiscal year for which they are authorized. No funds withheld after September 30, 1997, shall be available for apportionment to the State. If the State and its political subdivisions are in compliance with the requirements, the withheld funds will be apportioned to the State. The Secretary shall apportion withheld funds to the State the day after the period ends. Apportioned funds remain available for expenditure until the end of the succeeding fiscal year. Funds apportioned under specific sections shall remain available until the end of the 3rd fiscal year. Unobligated funds shall lapse or be made available for projects. Noncompliance results in withheld funds being apportioned to the State the day after the period ends. If a State or its political subdivision is not compliant with subsection (a)(1), funds will lapse or be made available for projects. Definitions for \"motor vehicle\" and \"State\" are provided. A conforming amendment is made to the analysis for chapter 1 of title 23, United States Code. Parking privileges for individuals with disabilities are addressed in section 161."
