    "content": "The \"Camera Accountability Maintenance and Transparency in Policing Act of 2015\" or the \"CAM TIP Act of 2015\" establishes grants for body-worn cameras for law enforcement officers under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. Grants can be used for acquisition, operation, and maintenance of body-worn cameras by States, local governments, and Indian tribes. The grants awarded under SEC. 3032 are distributed directly to the State, local government, or Indian tribe for the program described in SEC. 3033. The program described in this section requires law enforcement officers to use body-worn cameras and includes policies on when to wear, activate, and deactivate them, protecting civil liberties, limiting use of recordings, and setting standards for camera placement on officers. The policies for body-worn cameras include guidelines for accurate narrative collection, recording storage, availability to the public, victims, and law enforcement, as well as training for officers on camera management. Funds under this part are allocated to local governments with fewer than 100,000 residents, with any remaining funds distributed to other qualifying applicants. The federal share of program costs cannot exceed 50%, and the non-federal share can be in cash or in-kind. The Attorney General will conduct a study on the cost of purchasing and using body-worn cameras by law enforcement agencies, including gun-mounted cameras. A report with the study results must be submitted to Congress within 180 days. Additionally, a task force on community policing and body camera accountability will be established. A task force will be established in the Department of Justice to provide recommendations on community policing, including accountability and transparency practices. The task force will include representatives from civil rights organizations, law enforcement, and community policing experts. They will develop body-worn camera training protocols and study the impact of citizen review boards on investigating police misconduct cases. The task force established by the Department of Justice will conduct a survey to evaluate the effectiveness of body camera policies in investigating police misconduct cases, with findings to be reported to Congress within a year of implementation. The Comptroller General of the United States will submit a report to Congress within 90 days on the Pentagon's 1033 program, detailing equipment distribution, value, officer training, and equipment usage in jurisdictions."
