    "content": "The \"Civil Defense Accountability Act of 2018\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. Congress finds that on January 13, 2018, a false ballistic missile alert was sent to Hawaii residents, causing trauma. The National Security Strategy highlighted North Korea's potential threat with missiles and weapons. Due to the heightened threat level of conflict with North Korea, the State of Hawaii has implemented monthly outdoor warning siren system tests for the first time since the end of the Cold War. North Korean ballistic missiles could reach Hawaii approximately 20 minutes after launch, posing a significant risk to the homeland. The Missile Defense Agency warns of the increasing availability of sophisticated ballistic missile technology to countries hostile to the U.S. and its allies, raising the threat level. The increasing threat of advanced technologies falling into the hands of hostile non-state groups is a concern. SEC. 3. REPORT REGARDING BALLISTIC MISSILE CIVIL DEFENSE NOTIFICATION PROTOCOLS. The Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the FCC and Homeland Security, must submit a report to Congress within 90 days on current notification protocols for ballistic missile threats, including assessments of notifications required by law. The report must cover notifications after a threat is identified, communications during a threat, and warnings to Federal, State entities, and the public, in unclassified form with a possible classified annex. SEC. 4. CIVIL DEFENSE EMERGENCY BEST PRACTICES. The Secretary of Homeland Security will conduct a study to identify best practices of States regarding civil defense emergencies, including communication plans, resident communication, education, and security plans. The Secretary of Homeland Security will conduct a study on civil defense emergencies, including contingency plans for aid delivery in States, with a report due to Congress within 180 days. The Secretary of Homeland Security will conduct a study on civil defense emergencies, including deficiencies in State practices, best practices, public instruction methods, outreach plans, and report in unclassified form with a possible classified annex within 270 days. After the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security will share the unclassified parts of the report with each State's chief executive. SEC. 5. Incident reports on the ballistic missile false alarm on January 13, 2018 will be shared with each State's chief executive. Within 60 days of the Act's enactment, key officials must submit an unclassified report to Congress on the actions taken by their respective departments or agencies regarding the ballistic missile false alarm in Hawaii on January 13, 2018. The report should include recommendations for corrective actions to prevent future false alarms. Key officials must also publish the unclassified portion of the report on their department or agency's website. The term \"key official\" in this section includes the Secretary of Defense, the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the Director of the Federal Communications Commission. SEC. 6. PUBLIC HEALTH RECOMMENDATIONS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must submit a report to Congress and online regarding the readiness of the Department and healthcare providers to respond to biological, chemical, radiological, or nuclear attacks within 180 days of this Act. The report will include assessments of current readiness and recommendations for improvement. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will develop a public outreach program with State and local governments based on recommendations in a report. Grants for emergency preparedness programs will consider the report's recommendations. The term \"State\" in this Act refers to the various States of the United States, the District of Columbia, and any U.S. territory, commonwealth, or possession."
