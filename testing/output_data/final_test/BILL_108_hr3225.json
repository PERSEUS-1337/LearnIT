    "content": "The Small Business Tax Flexibility Act of 2003 allows qualified small businesses to elect a taxable year ending in a month from April to November. A qualified small business can choose a taxable year ending in April through November or an equivalent annual period. The election must be made by the due date for the first taxable year and remains effective until terminated. An entity's election to terminate can occur if it fails the gross receipts test, no longer qualifies as an S corporation, or decides to terminate. Upon termination, the entity must determine its taxable year using another permissible method. If an election termination results in a short taxable year, net profits are included in income over 4 taxable years, while net losses are deductible in the first taxable year after termination. The term 'qualified small business' refers to an entity that has an election under section 1362(a) in effect for the first taxable year and conducts an active trade or business as a start-up business. The term 'start-up business' is defined as an entity where no more than 75 percent is owned by someone who previously conducted a similar trade within the past year. The term 'required taxable year' is defined in section 444(e). The term 'required taxable year' is defined in section 444(e) as the Secretary prescribes rules to eliminate abuse through tiered structures. Section 444(a)(1) is amended to include section 444A. The table of sections is updated accordingly. Section 444A allows qualified small businesses to choose a taxable year ending between April and November. The amendments apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2003."
