    "content": "The United States has increased funding for global TB programs, with a focus on joint HIV/TB initiatives. President Obama's Global Health Initiative prioritizes fighting TB. Global TB programs received funding increases in FY2009, FY2010, and FY2012. TB is an infectious disease spread through the air, primarily affecting the lungs. Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease spread through the air, primarily affecting the lungs but can also impact other organs. It is transmitted when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks, or spits, and another person inhales the infected air. Individuals with TB can have latent or active disease, with active TB being contagious and potentially fatal if left untreated. The World Health Organization estimates that about one-third of the global population are carriers of TB, with an estimated 12 million people living with active TB in 2010. In 2010, there were an estimated 8.8 million new cases of TB worldwide, including roughly 1.1 million new TB patients who were also infected with HIV. Global TB mortality has fallen by more than one-third since 1990 levels. Multidrug-Resistant TB (MDR-TB) is resistant to the two most powerful first-line TB drugs and significantly challenges TB control efforts. Multidrug-Resistant TB (MDR-TB) is more difficult to cure and may lead to high TB-related death rates. It is caused by poor treatment adherence or incorrect drug usage. In 2010, there were an estimated 650,000 cases of MDR-TB among the world's 12 million prevalent TB cases. Extensively Drug-Resistant TB (XDR-TB) is resistant to fluoroquinolones and at least one injectable second-line drug, making it harder to diagnose and treat. XDR-TB is often fatal in low-resource settings and likely under-diagnosed due to weak laboratory capacity. In 2010, TB cases were prevalent in Asia, Africa, Eastern Mediterranean, Europe, and the Americas. Twenty-two high-burden countries accounted for 81% of all TB cases, with India, China, South Africa, Indonesia, and Pakistan having the highest number of new cases. MDR-TB levels varied across regions, with stable rates in the Americas and decreasing rates in some regions. TB is curable through short-term chemotherapy. TB is curable through short-term chemotherapy. The WHO developed the DOTS strategy for TB detection and treatment, which includes key components like sustained political commitment and direct observation during treatment. The WHO developed the DOTS strategy for TB detection and treatment, including key components like sustained political commitment and direct observation during treatment. In areas with moderate to high levels of MDR-TB, WHO recommends DOTS-Plus, which includes guidance on the appropriate use of second-line TB drugs. WHO's \"Global Plan to Stop TB\" sets global targets for TB control, with updated plans released in 2006 and 2010. The Stop TB Strategy focuses on using DOTS to diagnose and treat TB, with six key areas of focus. The WHO's DOTS strategy for TB treatment has been widely adopted, with a 99% treatment rate in DOTS programs by 2007. Prevention includes preventative therapy for high-risk individuals and a TB vaccine called BCG, which has inconsistent success. President Bill Clinton signed the Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act of 2000, authorizing $60 million for global TB programs. The act required coordination between USAID, WHO, CDC, and NIH to control TB, with targets set for detecting and curing TB cases. President George W. Bush later signed the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003, allocating $15 billion for global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria efforts. The Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act of 2000 authorized $60 million for global TB programs, with targets set for detecting and curing TB cases. The United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 allocated $15 billion for global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria efforts, prioritizing DOTS coverage and treatment of MDR-TB. The Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde U.S. Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 increased the budget for global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria efforts to $48 billion from FY2008 through FY2013. It authorized $4 billion for TB programs over five years and set goals to halve the TB death and disease burden, detect 70% of infectious TB cases, and treat 85% of detected cases. The 1990 baseline set goals to detect 70% of infectious TB cases and treat 85% of detected cases in countries with USAID TB programs. USAID began its TB program in 1998 and has expanded to include more ambitious goals. President Obama has prioritized TB as a key global health issue and announced the Global Health Initiative in 2009 to develop a comprehensive U.S. global health strategy over six years. The Global Health Initiative (GHI) prioritizes TB as one of its six focus areas to maximize health impact per dollar spent. In response to congressional requirements, a joint U.S. government Tuberculosis Strategy was released in March 2010 to advance the goals of the GHI. The U.S. Tuberculosis Strategy outlines key targets for the U.S. TB response from 2009 to 2014, including treating 2.6 million new infectious TB cases using DOTS by 2014 and diagnosing and treating at least 57,200 new MDR-TB cases by 2014. The Strategy focuses on providing assistance for accelerated detection and treatment of TB in selected countries based on prevalence rates and other factors. The U.S. Tuberculosis Strategy aims to treat 2.6 million new TB cases and 57,200 MDR-TB cases by 2014. Key factors for success include political commitment, financial need, and managerial feasibility. U.S. agencies like USAID and OGAC implement programs to control the global spread of TB. USAID supports the Stop TB Strategy in over 40 countries, while OGAC coordinates efforts with PEPFAR for TB-HIV co-infection interventions. OGAC leads the U.S. response to HIV/TB co-infection through programs like HIV testing for TB patients and TB screening for persons with HIV/AIDS. CDC provides technical support on epidemiology, surveillance, and TB care approaches. NIH supports international research on TB, drug resistance, and HIV/TB co-infection. Funding for global TB efforts increased slowly from FY2004 through FY2007, with significant rises in FY2008 in response to a public health scare. Appropriation amounts have fluctuated since then. Funding for global TB efforts increased slowly from FY2004 through FY2007, with significant rises in FY2008 in response to a public health scare. The United States supports global TB efforts through contributions to the Global Fund, the largest single contributor to the Fund. International funding for TB is a small proportion of global TB spending, with the Global Fund providing 84% of all international TB funding in 2011. Domestic government spending is expected to account for 87% of all financing for global TB. The United States collaborates with various partners to combat TB, including national governments, NGOs, and the private sector. Congress authorizes contributions to WHO and the Global Fund for global TB efforts. WHO shapes the global health research agenda and provides technical support for TB activities through the Stop TB Partnership. The Stop TB Partnership, established in 1998, works to eliminate TB through a network of international organizations, donor governments, and private sector NGOs. The Global Drug Facility (GDF) provides technical assistance and procurement of anti-TB drugs at reduced prices. The Green Light Committee (GLC) was created by WHO in 2000. The Green Light Committee (GLC) was established by WHO in 2000 to support countries in fighting MDR-TB. It includes various organizations like the CDC, International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases, and WHO. GLC reviews requests for second-line TB treatments and approves programs to purchase drugs at discounted prices through a pooled procurement mechanism. The Global Fund, a public-private partnership established in 2002, provides significant financial support for global responses to HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria, with the United States being the largest contributor. The Global Fund has committed over $22.6 billion in grants in 150 countries since it was established, providing significant financial support for global responses to HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. In 2009, the Global Fund provided 65% of all international funding for TB efforts in high-burden countries, and in 2011 it is expected to provide 84% of all international funding. The Global Fund announced the postponement of its 11th round of funding due to limited resources. The 112th Congress will face issues regarding the U.S. response to global TB, including funding allocation and TB/HIV co-infection challenges. Rates of TB testing among HIV patients and provision of antiretroviral therapy (ART) to co-infected individuals are low, hindering TB control in high HIV prevalence areas. Advocates urge increased U.S. support for TB/HIV services through PEPFAR and setting specific targets for TB/HIV co-infection. Multidrug-Resistant TB (MDR-TB) and Extensively Drug-Resistant TB (XDR-TB) pose challenges with limited resources for diagnosis and treatment. Debate continues on addressing drug-resistant TB effectively. Experts are debating how to address drug-resistant TB, with a focus on MDR-TB in countries with limited resources. Current tools for TB prevention, diagnosis, and treatment are outdated and often ineffective, leading to calls for increased support for the development of new vaccines, diagnostics, and drugs. Funding for TB research should prioritize new tools for diagnosing and treating MDR-TB, XDR-TB, and TB/HIV co-infection."
