NATO shifted its focus to defense and deterrence in Europe, aiming to maintain its military superiority and stay ahead of political and technological changes. The alliance faces conventional and hybrid challenges, with a need to address new threats related to the diffusion of technology. NATO is facing hybrid challenges and potential new threats related to technological diffusion. Policymakers are concerned about NATO's eroding technological edge and urge the alliance to address risks and opportunities associated with technological change. NATO may need to rely more on agility and innovation in the future. This report analyzes how NATO is responding to the evolving technology landscape and its impact on defense spending and U.S. defense strategy. The curr_chunk discusses the role of Congress in supporting NATO's adaptation to changing technology, including promoting defense innovation and a stronger military presence in Europe. Congress has historically influenced U.S. NATO policy and agenda, including during the Cold War and post-Cold War era. The focus is on NATO's response to strategic competition for technological superiority and innovation, with a need to foster NATO's capacity for innovation in light of technological change. The NATO Observer Group was revived by a group of Senators in February 2018 to focus on emerging challenges such as burden-sharing, defense spending, and military capabilities. Congress has strong relationships with NATO allies and can help anticipate technology use for Euro-Atlantic security. The 2014 Wales Summit highlighted Russia's annexation of Crimea as a fundamental challenge to NATO. Russia's aggression in Crimea and Eastern Europe poses a fundamental challenge to the vision of a peaceful and united Europe. NATO has accused Russia of reckless behavior, including support for separatists in Ukraine, military presence in Moldova and Georgia, election meddling, and involvement in the war in Syria. Russia has modernized its military, invested in emerging technologies, and developed sophisticated capabilities in cyber, space, and long-range missiles. Russia's military modernization includes cyber, space, and long-range missile capabilities, posing a threat to NATO's dominance. Technologies on NATO's southern flank also reshape the threat environment, with concerns about conventional weapons, cybersecurity, and terrorism. Syria and Libya remain unstable, with governance and resource constraints threatening security. The Mediterranean is a transit hub for refugees, migrants, and organized crime. China and Russia challenge Western actors in the region, empowering nonstate groups. Transnational threats like terrorism are a priority for European allies, with defense spending trends shifting globally. Military expenditure has significantly increased in China and Russia, impacting NATO's technology environment. Military expenditure in Europe has been declining since the end of the Cold War, leading to downsizing of European militaries and readiness challenges. However, in 2014 European NATO allies recognized the need to increase defense spending and investments, pledging to halt the decline and move towards strengthening their defense capabilities. At the Wales Summit, NATO allies pledged to increase defense spending to 2% of GDP, with 20% dedicated to equipment and R&D over 10 years. The \"Defense Investment Pledge\" aims to boost defense input and political will. Since 2014, allies have raised defense spending annually. By 2024, 15 allies are expected to meet spending targets and 22 to meet investment targets. NATO can help coordinate and channel additional funds strategically for efficiency and effectiveness. Rapid technological advancements in AI, machine learning, biotechnology, and materials science are adding uncertainty to NATO's spending decisions. The National Intelligence Council warns that AI and automation could disrupt industries faster than economies can adapt, while technologies to attack critical infrastructure are becoming more accessible. International competition for technology and innovation is increasing among the United States, China, and Russia. The United States, China, and Russia are engaged in strategic competition in dual-use technologies, with different advantages in investment strategies, R&D, and leveraging commercial industry for defense. NATO faces challenges in identifying relevant technology breakthroughs as international competition grows. UK, France, and Germany prioritize advancing technology in their defense strategies. The UK's Strategic Defense and Security Review (SDSR) emphasizes technology as a key driver of security priorities, focusing on cybersecurity, resilience, space utilization, and increasing dependence on networked technology. The 2017 French Strategic Review on Defense and National Security (SRDNS) also recognizes technology as a security challenge, highlighting the diffusion of technology enabling nonstate actors to export military know-how. Germany's 2016 defense white book highlights cyber challenges and threats to supply, communications, trade, and energy security. The German government's defense white book highlights cyber challenges and threats to supply, communications, trade, and energy security. NATO is also concerned about the pace of technological change and the diffusion of technology, with Allied Command Transformation (ACT) leading efforts to address future capability needs and align S&T investment priorities for allies. The 2017 Strategic Foresight Report by ACT outlines five global technology trends and their implications for NATO. U.S. policymakers have long been concerned about disruptive technologies, particularly from China and Russia, prompting a focus on modernization and innovation in defense strategy. The United States policymakers were increasingly concerned about China's and Russia's military modernization programs and the spread of disruptive technologies to nonstate armed groups. This led to a debate on defense innovation known as the \"Third Offset Strategy\" in 2014. The Department of Defense launched the Defense Innovation Initiative in response to concerns about China's and Russia's military modernization programs and disruptive technologies. The initiative aims to sustain U.S. military superiority through innovation and adaptability in defense operations. Past successes in countering adversaries through technology development were referenced, highlighting the importance of government and industry investments in defense innovation. The Defense Innovation Initiative was launched by the Department of Defense to counter Soviet conventional advantages and secure U.S. competitive advantage. It focused on developing new technologies, finding efficiencies, and introducing reforms in leadership development, R&D planning, war-gaming, and operational concepts. Between 2014 and 2016, the Third Offset Strategy gained traction in U.S. defense circles as officials were concerned about Russia and China developing \"battle networks\" that could rival those of the United States. To restore the U.S. advantage, DOD officials sharpened their focus on strategic innovation and efficiency in business practices. The U.S. focused on technology to restore its global power projection advantage. DOD invested in AI, deep-learning, human-machine collaboration, and cyber-hardened weapons. The Strategic Capabilities Office repurposed technologies, and the Defense Innovation Board provided private sector advice. The Defense Innovation Unit Experimental linked entrepreneurs with DOD problems. The Trump Administration's strategy aims to transform defense planning by organizing networks for collaboration between start-up companies, civilian corporations, and government officials to identify suitable acquisition projects. The National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy emphasize restoring U.S. operational advantage, accessing commercial innovation, and enhancing agility and lethality in military units. The DOD continues to pursue defense innovation for greater lethality and a robust national security innovation base. DIUx has transitioned pilot contracts into production, and new concepts are being pushed to field capabilities faster. The U.S. architects of the Third Offset Strategy envisioned collaboration with allies, but the strategy is not well understood among them. Defense innovation strategies raise questions for the U.S. and its allies about their expectations of each other. The United States and its allies are prompted to collaborate on technology development and defense innovation. Concerns arise about interoperability, NATO's reliance on U.S. technology, and the impact of technology on the U.S. military presence in Europe. NATO faces challenges from state rivals and nonstate actors with disruptive technologies, making its networks vulnerable to competitors. NATO allies are increasingly aware of the importance of agility, resilience, and innovation in the face of challenges from disruptive technologies. Technology advancements could reduce NATO's reliance on allies for certain capabilities, such as ground surveillance, and offer affordable intelligence capabilities. Technology could provide NATO with affordable, open-source intelligence capabilities, reducing reliance on member states. However, it could also create division as some allies are hesitant to share sensitive technologies like cybersecurity. NATO officials are working to integrate these technologies into structures and assess their use in contingencies. Increased defense spending in Europe may lead to more funding for R&D and capabilities development, with a NATO debate on defense innovation helping to prioritize and enhance interoperability. Defense innovation in Europe is crucial for managing risk and enhancing interoperability across the Atlantic. Rising operational costs for European militaries necessitate the development of cost-effective tools to counter asymmetric threats. Failure to pursue a technology-driven defense strategy could reduce interoperability with the United States, leading to trade-offs between buying technology from the US and investing in European R&D. This could impact European autonomy and transatlantic industry. NATO has successfully responded to new challenges through strategic and organizational change, with member states steering the alliance through crisis situations. NATO institutions also play a role in facilitating their own transformation, with the Science and Technology Organization leading on S&T issues. The organization includes the Office of the Chief Scientist and the Collaboration Support Office in Paris, linking thousands of scientists and engineers. The Office of the Chief Scientist in Paris connects scientists and engineers, shapes commercial strategies for NATO technologies, and ensures they meet NATO standards. The Center for Maritime Research and Experimentation focuses on research and technology development for the maritime domain. NATO's Defense Investment Division in Brussels advises allies on defense procurement, interoperability, and industry standards. The division oversees the Conference of National Armaments Directors (CNAD) for armaments cooperation, supported by the NATO Industrial Advisory Group (NIAG) for industry insights. Discussions on defense innovation have increased within the CNAD, with allies like the United States, UK, and Canada having innovation strategies. The NATO Parliamentary Assembly, along with allies like the United States, UK, Canada, and the Netherlands, are actively sharing best practices on innovation strategies. However, some allies lack the necessary resources to contribute effectively. The Science and Technology Committee of the Assembly has highlighted NATO's diminishing technological advantage and the impact of the Internet of Things on NATO. The Chief Scientist pointed out that NATO's edge has eroded due to the growth in commercial R&D, particularly in the cyber domain. The NATO Science and Technology Committee emphasizes the need for innovation in the cyber domain to address daily challenges. They plan reports on defense innovation, cybersecurity, and the dark web's implications for terrorism. The NATO Defense Planning Process translates political ambition into capability requirements for member states. The NATO Defense Planning Process (NDPP) derives capability requirements from guidance, translating them into targets apportioned to member states through a consensus decision-making process. While allies participate voluntarily, they are not sanctioned for missing targets. The NDPP aims to deliver NATO requirements without compromising national sovereignty over defense planning, praised for protecting sovereignty but criticized for not filling capability shortfalls. NATO institutions use the NDPP to harmonize planning and address capability gaps, with NATO's ACT producing Strategic Foresight Analysis Reports to create a shared perspective on future environments. NATO's ACT has a futures team collaborating with STO scientists to inform defense planning and future force needs. Extending the NDPP's planning horizon could help steer national decision-making towards NATO requirements. Strategic foresight work at ACT is influencing STO products. The STO, supported by NATO's ACT, is shaping NATO capabilities by identifying priority S&T areas for investments. The STO plans to update NATO's Science and Technology Strategy and publish long-term requirements under the NDPP. NATO is also developing an in-house capacity for innovation through the NATO Innovation Hub (IH) in Norfolk, VA, to support projects through open innovation. The NATO Innovation Hub (IH), housed under ACT, collaborates with public-private partnerships across member states like the UK, Germany, and the US to design solutions for NATO problems. ACT integrates technologies into concepts development, education, and training, but emphasizes the need for a shared understanding of the environment and operational objectives. Some NATO officials are concerned about the lack of attention to strategic foresight, S&T priorities, and innovation at NATO Headquarters. Some officials argue that NATO Headquarters has not given enough attention to strategic foresight, S&T priorities, and innovation. This lack of focus is attributed to the alliance's concentration on immediate challenges in NATO's south and east, as well as national delegations' concerns about sovereignty in defense. European states historically prioritized national self-sufficiency in defense, but some are now recognizing the need for collaboration. Some European governments are increasing defense budgets and seeking practical cooperation with partners to address limited budgets and inefficiencies. The UK and France are balancing national capabilities with joint development and off-the-shelf purchases. The US, UK, France, and Germany account for 85% of NATO's defense spending and share security assessments. NATO member states, including the UK, are focused on defense innovation and strategic interests. Limited resources lead to a focus on short-term priorities like operations and readiness. European nations are in the early stages of developing national strategies for defense innovation and R&D. The UK government launched a Defense Innovation Initiative in 2016 to maintain military technological edge, promote defense R&D, and engage commercial centers of innovation. This initiative aimed to transform the defense enterprise through organizational and cultural changes, reverse underinvestment in R&D, improve government-industry relationships, and engage small to medium-sized enterprises effectively. The UK government launched a Defense Innovation Initiative in 2016 to transform the defense enterprise and engage small to medium-sized enterprises effectively. The strategy includes an Innovation and Research InSight Unit, a Defence and Security Accelerator organization, and an Innovation Fund of around \u00a3800 million over ten years. British defense analysts highlight the need to protect UK assets and maintain interoperability with U.S. military forces. However, they also note that the strategy faces limitations and has not been a high priority for the UK Ministry of Defence. The UK Ministry of Defence's Defense Innovation Initiative faces limitations and has not been a high priority. The \u00a3800 million fund represents just 1% of the expected UK procurement budget for the decade, posing challenges in ensuring meaningful spending. Implementation relies on leveraging commercial R&D and working with industry. Brexit negotiations have divided UK political parties, leading to political and economic uncertainty that could impact UK defense. The UK government is conducting a National Security Capabilities Review and will publish the Modernizing Defense Program in 2018 to adapt British defense strategy in response to Brexit-related uncertainty. The upcoming review will focus on leveraging technology and capabilities to maintain the credibility of the UK armed forces. President Macron's government has also outlined a new national defense strategy to balance national independence and power projection in a changing security environment. France's Strategic Review on Defense and National Security, published in October 2017, emphasizes the need for military agility, investments in space, cybersecurity, and electronic warfare capabilities. It calls for organizational and cultural changes at the Ministry of Armed Forces to access private sector innovation. The Review sets the foundation for the Military Programming Law for 2019-2025, reflecting France's ambition for defense innovation. The French Strategic Review on Defense and National Security highlights the importance of military agility and investments in space, cybersecurity, and electronic warfare capabilities. The Military Programming Law for 2019-2025 aims to support French SMEs and research labs working on sensitive technologies, increase funding for research and development, and allocate resources for future armament programs. The Ministry of Armed Forces is planning reforms to enhance access to digital innovation and commercial industry. The focus is on equipping the military for short-term priorities and replacing aging platforms. France's defense innovation priorities include replacing aging platforms and addressing A2AD threats. It aims to strengthen operational advantage, protect its industrial base, and maintain global market share. Public concerns about terrorism and migration have taken precedence, leading to a high operational tempo that strains the French armed forces. Equipment, maintenance, and support for current operations remain a short-term priority. Germany's defense strategy outlined in the 2016 White Book emphasizes making substantial contributions to European security, building resilience, and addressing eroding conventional deterrence capabilities. The government is aware of the importance of defense R&D and commercially developed technologies for defense superiority. Germany's industrial capacity allows for significant contributions to defense innovation, with a competitive industry established in U.S. supply chains. Germany's competitive industry in U.S. supply chains generates high-tech capabilities and revenue for innovation. Leading in critical defense technologies in Europe, Germany excels in autonomous vehicles, software, manufacturing, and aerospace. The country has also advanced in defensive cybercapabilities through initiatives like the Cyber Innovation Hub, focusing on disruptive technologies and digital products. The 2015 defense industry strategy emphasizes R&D funding, defining national enabling technologies, and increasing cooperation with European partners. German politics and public opinion will shape Germany's contributions to a defense innovation agenda. There is a deep-seated concern in the German public consciousness about defense research potentially undermining peace, leading to a disconnect between civilian and defense research. Germany faces a tension between civilian and defense research, with the Defense Ministry emphasizing the importance of defense research while the Ministry of Education and Research opposes closer links. Analysts expect Germany to focus on addressing national readiness shortfalls and preparing for contingencies in Eastern Europe. Budget increases are committed, with personnel costs expected to remain high. Chancellor Merkel's potential decision to increase defense spending would be seen as an innovation in European and transatlantic defense and security. NATO faces challenges in coordinating defense innovation strategies among allies, securing resources, balancing short-term priorities with future preparations, preserving interoperability, harmonizing defense planning processes, and utilizing allies' diversity for more effective cooperation. NATO relies on knowledge-sharing, setting agendas, establishing priorities, and promoting multinational cooperation to address these obstacles. Since the Cold War, the United States and its NATO allies have focused on defense spending and investment to maintain military technological superiority. Government-led innovation in technology and innovation has supported economic success, but the shift towards \"consumption markets\" has led to new challenges such as cost pressures and limited budgets. Long-term government funding for defense and civilian R&D is crucial for dual-use technology development. NATO allies have been increasing defense spending since 2014, facing challenges like cost pressures and international competition. Despite limited budgets, NATO can leverage strengths like high-performing universities and dynamic economies to access innovative ideas. European governments, however, are constrained by budget limitations for defense R&D, unlike the US Third Offset Strategy. NATO's efforts to build relationships with technology companies face challenges due to limited budgets, bureaucratic processes, and a risk-averse culture. Recent decisions to reverse downsizing include establishing new military command centers focusing on maritime security, troop movements, and contingency planning for Eastern and Southern Europe. During the Cold War, a capabilities gap emerged between the US and most European nations in NATO, impacting post-Cold War operations like in Kosovo. The capabilities gap between the US and European NATO allies has affected post-Cold War operations, with concerns around burden-sharing and dependence on US technology. Despite efforts to increase defense budgets, European allies are unlikely to close the gap with the US due to historical spending patterns and strategic culture. The Trump Administration continues to prioritize transatlantic burden-sharing. The technology gap between the US and European NATO allies could deepen if the US pursues a technology-driven strategy faster than its allies. This could challenge NATO interoperability, especially in scenarios requiring rapid decision-making and troop movements. NATO officials are working on integrating national technologies into NATO networks to address this issue. The EU's Global Strategy in 2016 reignited ambitions for European strategic autonomy, leading to questions about the relationship between EU and NATO structures. A Joint Declaration in 2016 outlined 42 actions for cooperation between the EU and NATO in areas such as countering hybrid threats, cybersecurity, defense capabilities, industry, research, and capacity building. Implementation is ongoing, but the strategic relationship between NATO and the EU remains uncertain. The EU and NATO are still figuring out their strategic relationship, especially regarding the EU's aspiration for autonomy and its reliance on NATO for defense. Both institutions aim to strengthen defense industry and research cooperation in Europe and across the Atlantic, but they have different priorities and tools for fostering collaboration. The EU has the European Defense Agency and unique legal and financial mechanisms to promote defense-industrial cooperation and innovation. The EU has launched initiatives like the European Defense Fund and Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) to promote defense-industrial cooperation and capabilities development. The Coordinated Annual Review on Defense addresses capability shortfalls and fosters cooperation within the EU. These initiatives have sparked debate in Brussels. The EU's defense initiatives have sparked debate in Brussels about prioritization, governance, and the role of third-party countries and companies in EU projects. NATO and the EU need to coordinate their initiatives, while European allies must decide which institution offers a better platform for cooperation on S&T issues and innovation. NATO member states prioritize capabilities that address their security needs, with the U.S. focusing on defense innovation driven by Chinese and Russian military modernization. Many European allies accept U.S. assessments of global security, but differ on views of China's rise. France and Germany focus on managing Chinese investments, while NATO allies are divided on Russia as a conventional or hybrid challenge. Efforts to communicate Euro-Atlantic security face challenges, with concerns of a transatlantic rift and a \"wearing down\" of collective identity in NATO. European leaders are facing pressure to address immediate security challenges such as Russia, Ukraine, refugees, migration, and terrorism. Short-term priorities take precedence in Europe, but discussions on technology and future warfare are starting to emerge in national governments and NATO institutions. However, there is a need for strategic level discussions in the North Atlantic Council to achieve a common understanding of the threat environment and shared vision for addressing security challenges. NATO may need political leadership from major allies to drive change and foster cohesion. Congress faces questions on the role of the United States in helping allies utilize increased defense spending effectively and capitalize on technology and innovation investments. Congress has historically shaped U.S. NATO policy and influenced burden-sharing debates. The NATO Parliamentary Assembly and Transatlantic Policy Network facilitate transatlantic dialogue among legislators. In February 2018, Senators reconstituted the NATO Observer Group to strengthen congressional relations with NATO. Congress supports defense innovation by authorizing funding for R&D and mandating DOD reform. Questions arise on whether DOD efforts should include a NATO component or framework for allied participation. Congress is considering the role of European innovation in U.S. military renewal and the potential for increased defense spending by European allies to support their firms and autonomy. Questions arise about balancing technology exports and imports with Europe, revising export controls, and facilitating joint R&D. Congress also seeks to help allies invest more effectively in R&D and procurement to enhance global commercial investments in defense and security. Innovation is crucial for defense and security, with government and commercial actors contributing to different parts of the innovation cycle. Congress is exploring ways to expand NATO's access to technology stakeholders and considering the risks and opportunities of closer collaboration with partners like the US, UK, Australia, and Canada. The role of Congress in expanding NATO's access to commercial technology and innovation is being questioned, with a focus on whether to pursue this agenda with a small group of allies or at the NATO level. Europeans feel pressure from Washington to take more responsibility for their security and manage crises in their neighborhood. U.S. dissatisfaction with EU initiatives that could impact American markets is a concern. Congress may need to align its messaging to NATO and the EU."
