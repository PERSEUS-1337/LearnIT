    "content": "The \"Reduce Unnecessary Spending Act of 2010\" creates a fast-track procedure for the President to submit rescission requests to Congress for an up-or-down vote without amendment. Part C of the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 is amended to include rules and definitions for expedited consideration of proposed rescissions. The \"Reduce Unnecessary Spending Act of 2010\" amends Part C of the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 to establish a fast-track procedure for the President to submit rescission requests to Congress for expedited consideration. Key terms and definitions related to budget authority, entitlement laws, and session days are clarified in the legislation. The \"Reduce Unnecessary Spending Act of 2010\" amends the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 to establish a fast-track procedure for the President to submit rescission requests to Congress. Key terms like funding, rescind, and withhold are defined in the legislation. Prior to the obligation, administrative or preparatory actions are taken in the implementation of budget laws. \"Timing and packaging of rescission requests are outlined in SEC. 1023.\" The President must propose funding rescissions to Congress within 45 days of enactment, following specific procedures outlined in SEC. 1023. Each legislation can have one package of rescissions, applicable only to that legislation, with OMB transmitting the request to the appropriate congressional body. Transmittal messages must be made publicly available. After specific legislative actions, the President can propose up to two packages of funding rescissions within 45 days. Each package must not contain the same rescission, and if multiple funding amounts under one subcommittee's jurisdiction are requested for rescission, they must be included in the same package. \"Requests to rescind funding can be proposed by the President in up to two packages within 45 days, with each package containing different rescissions. If multiple funding amounts under one subcommittee's jurisdiction are requested for rescission, they must be included in the same package.\" The transmittal message for each request to rescind funding must specify the dollar amount, agency, program details, remaining funding, and reasons for the request. OMB must assign a number to each request and provide legislative language solely for the rescission of funding. No other changes to existing laws or additional appropriations are to be included. \"Grants of and limitations on presidential authority are outlined in Section 1025.\" The President can temporarily withhold funding under this part, with OMB authorized to do so. The President can only use these procedures once per funding bill. OMB must release withheld funding when the President decides it no longer serves the purpose of the rescission request. The President can withhold funding under this part, with OMB authorized to do so for 25 calendar days in which the House of Representatives or Senate has been in session, or until the funding can no longer be fully utilized before its expiration. \"Congressional consideration of rescission requests under SEC. 1026.\" The House of Representatives prepares a bill to rescind requested amounts when receiving a package of expedited rescission requests. The bill includes each numbered rescission request from the Presidential package, except those deemed unnecessary by the House Budget Committee Chairman after consultation with relevant committees and agencies. The House of Representatives introduces bills for expedited rescissions, with the majority or minority leader responsible for introducing each bill within 4 days of session. The bill is then referred to the House committee of jurisdiction and a copy is sent to the Senate committee. The House committee of jurisdiction must report the bill referred to it within 5 days of session without amendment. If not reported, the bill will be automatically discharged and placed on the calendar for consideration. After reporting, a motion to proceed to consider the bill in the House can be made. A Member must announce the motion to proceed to consider a bill in the House during a designated time by the Speaker. If no time is designated, after 3 days, any Member can make the motion. The motion must be made before the House disposes of a prior motion on the same bill. The motion is considered without further discussion, and a reconsideration motion is not allowed within 5 days. The bill shall be removed from the calendar if 5 calendar days of legislative session have passed since it was reported or discharged. A bill consisting of rescissions shall be considered as read in the House, with all points of order waived except for those containing unauthorized language. If a point of order is sustained, the offending rescissions are automatically removed from the bill. The House bill enacting a package of rescissions will be sent to the Senate for consideration. The Senate committee of jurisdiction must report on the bill within 3 days of session, and if not reported, the committee will be automatically discharged. The Senate committee must report on the bill within a 3-day period, or it will be automatically discharged from further consideration. After that, any Senator can move to proceed with the bill for debate, with a limit of 10 hours for debate and 1 hour for any debatable motions or appeals. The Senate committee must report on the bill within a 3-day period, or it will be automatically discharged from further consideration. Any Senator can move to proceed with the bill for debate, with a limit of 10 hours for debate and 1 hour for debatable motions or appeals. Limit debate on the bill is not debatable, and motions to amend or recommit the bill are not in order. The Senate cannot employ certain procedures while considering a bill approved by the House enacting rescissions if they include matter not requested by the President. Section 1(b) of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 is amended by replacing items related to part C of title 10 with new items. The Impoundment Control Act of 1974 is amended to include expedited consideration of proposed rescissions, definitions, timing of requests, presidential authority limitations, and congressional consideration. Technical and conforming amendments are made regarding temporary withholding and rulemaking. Part C of the Act will expire on December 31, 2014. SEC. 1002 of the Impoundment Control Act states that rescinded funds shall revert to the original fund, unless specified otherwise. SEC. 1003 ensures that if parts B or C are found unconstitutional, the remaining provisions will still be in effect."
