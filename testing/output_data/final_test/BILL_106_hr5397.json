    "content": "The \"Veterans Commemoration Act of 2000\" may be cited as the short title. The Congress acknowledges its obligation to veterans and recognizes the unique service provided by the Disabled American Veterans' transportation program. It supports voluntary fundraising for veterans' hospital transportation and values the importance of Executive Order Numbered 5398 signed by President Herbert Hoover in 1930. The Congress supports authorizing coins to commemorate veterans' service and fund transportation to VA hospitals. The Secretary of the Treasury will mint $1 silver coins to honor veterans, with specific size, weight, and composition requirements. These coins will be legal tender and considered numismatic items. The coins will be sourced from designated bullion sources. The Secretary can obtain silver for minting coins from various sources, including stockpiles established under the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act. The design of the coins is also specified. The design of coins minted under this Act must symbolize the service of veterans of the Armed Forces of the United States. Each coin must include a value designation, the year \"2005\", and inscriptions of \"Liberty\", \"In God We Trust\", \"United States of America\", and \"E Pluribus Unum\". The design will be chosen by the Secretary in consultation with the Disabled American Veterans and the Commission of Fine Arts, and reviewed by the Citizens Commemorative Coin Advisory Committee. SEC. 6. ISSUANCE OF COINS.\n\nCoins minted under this Act shall be issued in uncirculated and proof qualities at a single designated facility starting January 1, 2005, with minting authority ending on December 31, 2005. SEC. 7. SALE OF COINS.\n\nThe coins issued under this Act will be sold by the Secretary at a price equal to the face value of the coins, the surcharge provided in section 8(a), and the cost of designing and issuing the coins. Bulk sales will be offered at a discount, and prepaid orders will be accepted with a reasonable discount on sale prices. SEC. 8. SURCHARGES.\n\nAll sales of coins minted under this Act will include a $10 surcharge. The surcharges will be promptly paid to the Disabled American Veterans to fund transportation for veterans to and from VA hospitals. The organization will be subject to audit requirements."
