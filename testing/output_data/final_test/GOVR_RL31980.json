    "content": "Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution states that the President appoints officers with the Senate's advice and consent. The confirmation process allows the Senate to review nominees' qualifications, influence policy, and delay confirmations to assert influence. Senate confirmation is required for various government officials, with military appointments being the most common. The Senate considers thousands of nominations each Congress, including military and civilian appointments. Many are confirmed routinely, but close scrutiny is allowed when necessary. The process facilitates quick action on government positions. The Senate considers thousands of nominations each Congress, including military and civilian appointments, allowing for close scrutiny when necessary. Judicial nominations, especially for the Supreme Court, undergo greater scrutiny due to lifetime appointments. Nominees for policymaking positions are examined more closely and have a slightly lower confirmation rate. The Senate confirms a high percentage of nominations, with most being non-policy positions and of less interest to the Senate. The Senate plays a significant role in confirming executive branch nominations, with the President having wide latitude in selecting Cabinet members and high-ranking officials. Senators are often consulted during the nomination process, especially those from the nominee's home state, committee leaders, and party leaders. This consultation process aims to ensure a smooth and fast confirmation process. The Senate has a custom of \"senatorial courtesy\" where they consider home-state Senators' opposition to federal appointments. Senators have raised concerns about the confirmation process, especially when the Senate is controlled by the President's party. This has led to changes in the confirmation process. Since 2011, the Senate has made changes to the confirmation process, including the numbering and referral of nominations to committees. Nominations are typically sent in writing by the President and read on the Senate floor before being referred to committees, unless otherwise ordered. Some nominations may not be referred unless requested by a Senator. Nominations in the Senate will not be referred unless requested by a Senator. They are listed in the Executive Calendar under \"Privileged Nominations\" until the committee receives the nominee's information. After 10 days, the nomination is moved to the \"Nominations\" section for further consideration. Any Senator can request a nomination to be referred to the appropriate committee at any time. The Senate allows Senators to request nominations to be referred to the appropriate committee, which is done by the presiding officer or the executive clerk's office. Nominations are typically referred to committees based on the Senate's rules and precedents, with executive department nominations going to relevant committees and judicial branch nominations falling under the Judiciary Committee's jurisdiction. The number of nominations referred to committees varies. The Senate refers nominations to various committees based on jurisdiction. The Committee on Armed Services handles military appointments, the Judiciary Committee oversees judicial nominations, and the Foreign Relations Committee considers diplomatic appointments. Nominations may be jointly or sequentially referred to multiple committees based on jurisdictional claims. The Senate committees have written rules for considering nominations, including requirements for information from nominees like biographical resumes and financial statements. Timetables are often included for the minimum time between committee actions. The Senate committees have written rules for considering nominations, including timetables outlining the minimum layover required between committee actions. These rules may mandate delays between steps of the process and allow for waivers by majority vote or unanimous consent. Committees often gather and review information about nominees before formal hearings. Congressional committees rely on FBI investigations for information, with reports shared with the White House and Senators with authorization. Practices vary among committees, with some rarely requesting FBI materials. Nominees must complete a financial disclosure report certified by relevant agencies and the Office of Government Ethics. Committee staff typically do not review FBI materials. The financial disclosure forms of nominees are reviewed by relevant committees, along with opinion letters from ethics officers and the Director of the Office of Government Ethics. Committees may conduct their own information-gathering exercises and some require nominees to complete questionnaires. The Committee on the Judiciary sends \"blue slips\" to Senators from a nominee's home state to gauge support for the nomination. The Committee on Rules and Administration handles nominations and conducts investigations with FBI or GAO assistance. Nominees may meet with committee staff and Senators, addressing substantive matters. Meetings serve to acquaint nominees with Members and staff, discussing financial disclosure and conflicts of interest. Approximately half of civilian appointees are confirmed without a hearing. The likelihood of hearings for nominations varies with the importance of the position and the workload of the committee. Committees like Judiciary do not usually hold hearings for certain nominations, while others like Agriculture and Energy typically do. Hearings can vary in length and nature, with nominees often testifying and sometimes other witnesses invited to testify as well. Nomination hearings can vary in nature and length, with nominees and sometimes other witnesses testifying. Senators may ask questions about policy views, qualifications, and conflicts of interest. Nominees may be asked to respond to questions in writing before and after the hearing. The hearings are typically open to the public unless closed by a majority vote. Nomination hearings are open to the public unless closed by a majority vote. Witness testimony may be available online and through commercial services. Committees may print hearings, with no rule requiring it. The number of Senators needed for a quorum varies. Committees considering a nomination can report favorably, unfavorably, without recommendation, or take no action. Reporting favorably is more common, especially for policymaking positions. Committees may report a nomination favorably, subject to the nominee's commitment to testify. They can also report a nomination without recommendation to allow a Senate vote. The timing of the vote varies, usually not on the same day as the hearing. A majority of the committee members must be present to make a recommendation on a nomination. The Senate committee requires a majority quorum to recommend a nomination, which is usually done without a formal report on the Senate floor. The nomination paperwork is filed by committee staff and printed in the Congressional Record. The Senate cannot vote on a nomination the same day it is reported, except by unanimous consent. Discharging a committee from considering an unreported nomination by unanimous consent is common. Discharging a committee from considering an unreported nomination by unanimous consent allows the full Senate to consider it. This process, supported by the committee, simplifies the procedure. While rare, a motion or resolution can also be used to discharge a committee, but it requires several steps and may involve a cloture process. The cloture process may be necessary to discharge a committee in the Senate, requiring the support of three-fifths of the Senators. Nominations are listed on the Executive Calendar separately from legislative business, and are considered in executive session with their own rules of procedure. The majority leader schedules the consideration of nominations on the Calendar. The nomination process in the Senate involves nominations being listed on the Executive Calendar with basic information about the nominee and the office. The Executive Calendar also includes unanimous consent agreements related to executive business. The Executive Calendar contains unanimous consent agreements for executive business, distributed to Senate offices and available online. Business on the calendar includes nominations and treaties, discussed in executive sessions. Executive sessions were closed until 1929 but are now open unless the Senate orders otherwise. Sessions typically start in legislative session and move to executive session by unanimous consent. The Senate conducts executive sessions for nominations and treaties, which can be initiated at any time and are not debatable. All business related to nominations must be done in executive session, with motions often made \"as if in executive session.\" A standing order allows the Senate to receive nominations even on non-session days. The majority leader typically determines when these sessions occur. The majority leader plays a key role in determining when nominations are considered in the Senate. Nominations must be on the Calendar for at least one day before they can be taken up for consideration. Executive sessions are used for nomination discussions, and motions to go into executive session are not debatable. When the Senate considers nominations, the majority leader determines the timing. Nominations must be on the Calendar for a day before discussion in executive session. To call up a nomination, a motion to proceed to executive session is made, which is not debatable. If the Senate is already in executive session, the Leader will move to enter legislative session first, then executive session for the nomination. These motions are decided by a simple majority and typically approved by voice vote. The question before the Senate during a nomination is whether to advise and consent. The Senate considers nominations by voting to advise and consent. A majority vote is needed to approve a nomination. Senators can move to reconsider a vote within two days. The Secretary of the Senate attests to the confirmation or disapproval and transmits it to the White House. Many nominations are approved by unanimous consent. Nominations in the Senate are typically approved by unanimous consent, with routine nominations grouped together for efficiency. Higher-level positions may require more consideration, leading to debate and the possibility of a cloture motion to end discussion. Senators from the nominee's state may speak on their behalf. Rule XXII allows for debate closure with a cloture motion signed by at least 16 Senators. The cloture motion can be used to bring a debate on a pending nomination to a close in the Senate. It can only be moved on a question that is currently before the Senate, typically in executive session. The Senate does not vote on the cloture motion until the second day after it is presented, and one hour after it \"ripens,\" the presiding officer can present it for a vote during an executive session. In April 2017, the Senate reinterpreted Rule XXII to allow cloture to be invoked on all nominations by a majority of Senators voting, including Supreme Court justice nominations. This expanded previous actions taken in November 2013, which changed the cloture vote requirement to a majority for nominations except to the Supreme Court. After cloture is invoked on nominations, there can be a maximum of two hours of post-cloture consideration, except for nominations to the highest executive branch positions, Supreme Court, or U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which have a 30-hour maximum. The time spent considering the nomination must be during Senate floor time with the question pending, not during recess or adjournment. Time spent on other business by unanimous consent does not count against the post-cloture time limit. A hold in the Senate is a request by a Senator to delay action on a nomination or bill. Holds are not mentioned in Senate rules but are enforced through party leaders' agenda decisions. Senators use holds to review nominations, consult with nominees, or gain concessions from the executive branch. The Senate traditions of mutual deference are connected to holds, which are requests to delay action on nominations or bills. The recent precedents reducing cloture thresholds and time could impact the practice of holds. With cloture now easier to invoke, Senators may still seek unanimous consent to quickly approve nominations. The Senate reinterpreted Senate Rule XXII on April 3, 2019, reducing postcloture time for most nominations to 2 hours. This decision was made by reversing two rulings by the Presiding Officer, allowing for quicker approval of nominations. It is unusual for the Senate to reverse a decision by the Presiding Officer, but any Senator can attempt to do so through an appeal, which is typically decided by majority vote. The Senate reinterpreted Senate Rule XXII on April 3, 2019, reducing postcloture time for most nominations to 2 hours by reversing two rulings by the Presiding Officer. Appeals are typically decided by majority vote, but in this case, the appeal was raised after cloture had been invoked, leading to a vote without debate. The Senate voted to uphold the position of the Majority Leader, impacting the nominations process. The Senate reinterpreted Senate Rule XXII on April 3, 2019, reducing post-cloture time for most nominations to 2 hours. This change impacted the nominations process by decreasing the time between a cloture vote and a confirmation vote. Senators typically debated the nomination post-cloture but often entered into unanimous consent agreements to affect when the vote would occur. The cloture rule allowed for up to 30 hours of consideration, but the Senate would often agree to vote on the nomination a day later. The Senate's reinterpretation of Rule XXII on April 3, 2019, reduced post-cloture time for most nominations to 2 hours, affecting the nominations process by shortening the time between cloture and confirmation votes. Negotiations for voting times on nominations are now influenced by this rule change, with the Majority and Minority Leaders having priority in speaking post-cloture for a maximum of one hour each. The recent reinterpretation of Rule XXII in the Senate has shortened post-cloture time for most nominations to 2 hours, impacting the nominations process. The Majority and Minority Leaders now have priority in speaking post-cloture for a maximum of one hour each. This rule change may affect how often the Senate relies on the cloture process to approve nominations. If nominations are not confirmed or rejected, they are returned to the President at the end of a session or when the Senate adjourns for more than 30 days. The Senate can waive the rule for considering nominees by unanimous consent, allowing nominations to remain in status quo between sessions. The President can make recess appointments to temporarily fill vacancies without Senate confirmation, as granted by the Constitution. Recess appointments are made by the President to temporarily fill vacancies without Senate confirmation, which can sometimes lead to controversy and inter-branch conflict. Additionally, when a recess appointment is made for a previously nominated individual, a new nomination is usually submitted to comply with a provision of law affecting the pay of recess appointees."
