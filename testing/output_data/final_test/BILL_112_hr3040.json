    "content": "The \"Native American Indian Education Act of 2011\" ensures Federal funding for colleges to waive tuition charges for Native American Indian students, including those who are not residents of the State where the college is located. Congress acknowledges the valuable role of Native American-serving nontribal college institutions in providing educational opportunities to Native American Indian students, some of which offer tuition-free education with state support. The tuition waiver benefits provided by these colleges and states today exceed the original grant of land and facilities. The financial burden of providing tuition-free education to Native American students is no longer equitably shared among states and colleges. Native student tuition waiver benefits are at risk of being terminated due to severe budget constraints. State relief is sought from federal mandate. The Secretary of Education will pay eligible colleges the tuition charges for non-resident Indian students enrolled in the college, as mandated by Federal statute. Eligible colleges must be four-year Native American-serving nontribal institutions providing tuition-free education to Native American Indian students. The college received land and facilities from the United States. The amount paid to any college for each fiscal year cannot exceed the tuition charges for non-resident Indian students. Payments received by a college are considered reimbursement from the State and fulfill Federal mandates to admit Indian students tuition-free. This Act does not relieve any State from reimbursing a college for each academic year. The college must reimburse tuition charges for Indian students, both residents and non-residents, for each academic year. The term \"Indian students\" includes \"Indian pupils\" as defined in Federal statutes mandating tuition-free education for Native American Indian students. The college must reimburse tuition charges for Indian students in fulfillment of a condition under which it received its original grant of land and facilities from the United States. Funding is authorized to be appropriated as necessary for this purpose. SEC. 5. OFFSET.\n\n$15,000,000 in unobligated funds are rescinded from appropriated discretionary funds. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will determine the accounts and amounts for the rescission within 60 days. Exceptions include funds from the Department of Defense, Veterans Affairs, and Education."
