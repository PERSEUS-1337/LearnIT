    "content": "The International Dolphin Conservation Act Amendments of 1995, also known as the Marine Mammal Protection Act, aims to protect marine mammals. The Act aims to support the International Dolphin Conservation Program, strengthen embargo provisions, authorize US tuna fishing vessels in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, and ensure a sustainable tuna fishery while protecting marine mammal populations. The Act aims to strengthen international efforts to reduce dolphin mortality and protect marine mammal populations. Title III of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 is amended to focus on the International Dolphin Conservation Program. The amendment includes findings and policies related to dolphin conservation efforts. The Congress finds that efforts by tuna fishermen have reduced incidental mortality to dolphins in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. Support for the International Dolphin Conservation Program is crucial to maintaining low levels of dolphin mortality and eventually eliminating it. United States tuna fishing vessels have been leaders in developing methods to reduce dolphin mortalities. The United States supports reducing dolphin mortalities in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean and allows its tuna fishing vessels to participate in the region in line with the International Dolphin Conservation Program. The Secretary has the authority to issue regulations for incidental taking of marine mammals during purse seine fishing for yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, aiming to reduce mortality to insignificant levels. Consultations with relevant authorities are required. Additionally, there are provisions for observers in the region. SEC. 303 states that vessels engaged in commercial purse seine fishing for yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean must carry an observer certified by the Secretary or the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission. SEC. 304 outlines prohibitions, penalties, and civil forfeitures. Prohibitions under this title include violating regulations, refusing authorized officers to board for inspections, assaulting or interfering with officers, and intentionally setting purse seine nets on marine mammals during tuna fishing in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. In accordance with the International Dolphin Conservation Program, penalties for violations include civil penalties under section 105(a) for certain offenses and criminal penalties under section 105(b) for others. Vessels and fish involved in prohibited acts may be subject to civil forfeitures to the United States. The table of contents in the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 is amended by removing items related to title III and adding new content. The Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 is amended to include Title III on the International Dolphin Conservation Program, which covers findings, policy, authority of the Secretary, observers, prohibitions, penalties, and civil forfeitures. Definitions are also updated to include the International Dolphin Conservation Program as an international agreement administered by the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission or an equivalent successor program. Embargo provisions are amended as well. Section 101(a)(2)(B) (16 U.S.C. 1371(a)(2)(B)) is amended to require exporting nations of yellowfin tuna harvested in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean to provide evidence of participation in the International Dolphin Conservation Program. This participation must ensure that dolphin mortality levels are within acceptable limits set by the program. The biological removal level for affected stocks must be monitored, fishing vessels of exporting nations need 100% observer coverage approved by the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission. The government must authorize release of information for participation in the International Dolphin Conservation Program and comply with scientific research requests. Responsible officials must administer these requirements. Responsible officials administering the International Dolphin Conservation Program have not found any fishing vessel of the exporting nation failing to participate in the program. Miscellaneous amendments are made to various sections of Title I, including changes to marine mammal regulations and exceptions for commercial purse seine fishing. Additionally, a new subsection is added regarding the application of the Act to citizens on foreign vessels. The Tuna Conventions Act of 1950 is amended to exempt US citizens on foreign fishing vessels participating in the International Dolphin Conservation Program from certain provisions. The Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act (16 U.S.C. 1385) is repealed, but this does not affect marine mammal protection laws such as the Driftnet Impact Monitoring, Assessment, and Control Act of 1987 (16 U.S.C. 1822 note) or the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.)."
