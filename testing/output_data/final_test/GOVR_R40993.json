    "content": "President Ronald Reagan signed Executive Order 12549 on February 18, 1986, to address fraud and abuse in Federal programs. The order covered grants, agreements, loans, and guarantees, excluding federal procurement programs. The Office of Management and Budget was tasked with issuing guidelines for implementation, including criteria for debarment and suspension. Executive departments and agencies were directed to issue regulations consistent with OMB's guidelines. The OMB guidelines, issued in 1987, are applicable to individual grantees through agency regulations. OMB's government-wide guidance for debarment and suspension in federal grant programs is found at 2 C.F.R. Part 180. Grantees must refer to the specific rules in the individual agency's regulations. The OMB guidelines provide rules for debarment and suspension in federal grant programs, applying to individuals, corporations, partnerships, and government entities involved in covered transactions. Agency officials with authority over these transactions are also subject to the guidelines. Covered transactions include nonprocurement transactions of any type. Nonprocurement transactions, excluding procurement contracts, such as grants and cooperative agreements, are considered \"covered transactions\" for debarment and suspension rules. Some nonprocurement transactions, like direct awards to foreign entities or public international organizations, federal employment, and certain emergency-related transactions, are not covered. Additionally, permits for public health or safety and benefits from ordinary government operations are exempt. The guidelines for debarment and suspension rules cover some procurement contracts awarded by non-Federal participants in nonprocurement transactions, with distinctions between \"primary tier\" and \"lower tier\" transactions. Agencies may debar a person for activities such as fraud or criminal offenses related to agreements. The guidelines for debarment and suspension cover various offenses including fraud, antitrust violations, embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, and obstruction of justice. Offenses indicating a lack of business integrity or honesty can lead to debarment. The guidelines for debarment and suspension cover various offenses including fraud, antitrust violations, embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, and obstruction of justice. An agency official must make two determinations in order to suspend a person based on violations such as doing business with an ineligible person, failure to pay debts, violations of the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988, or any other serious cause affecting present responsibility. The OMB guidelines outline procedures for debarment or suspension actions, which begin with an agency receiving information about a cause for debarment or suspension. The agency investigates, and the debarment or suspension official decides whether to take action, notifying the person or relevant parties accordingly. A debarment action is initiated when a debarring official sends a written Notice of Proposed Debarment to the person, stating reasons for proposing debarment and informing them of the federal government's procedures for debarment. The notice of proposed debarment outlines the governmentwide effects and provides an opportunity for the person to contest the proposed debarment within 30 days by submitting specific facts and relevant information to the debarring official. Debarment proceedings may result in further legal action if information is not truthfully disclosed. The proceedings do not follow formal rules of evidence or procedure, but may include fact-finding under certain conditions. The burden of proof lies with the federal agency to show cause for debarment. The federal agency has the burden of proof to establish cause for debarment by a preponderance of evidence. If the basis is a conviction or civil judgment, the agency has met its burden. The person must then demonstrate present responsibility to avoid debarment. Debarment decisions consider the seriousness of the person's actions, mitigating/aggravating factors, and potential harm. The OMB guidelines for debarment consider harm, frequency of incidents, prior history of wrongdoing, involvement, and acceptance of responsibility. A debarring official must issue a decision within 45 days based on the official record. The decision includes whether the person is debarred, reasons for debarment, time period, and effectiveness for covered transactions. The debarment is effective for \"covered transactions and contracts subject to Federal Acquisition Regulations\" in the Executive Branch. A person can request reconsideration in writing with supporting documentation. The debarring official may change the decision based on new evidence, reversal of conviction, or other reasons. Debarments should not exceed three years but can be longer based on circumstances. Extensions may be granted to protect the public interest. The decision must follow procedures and not solely rely on previous facts. Upon determining a cause for suspension, the suspending official immediately signs a decision to suspend a person based on indictment, conviction, or other evidence of irregularities. A Notice of Suspension is then promptly sent to the suspended person, outlining the reasons for suspension without disclosing the government's evidence. The suspension is temporary pending completion of an investigation or legal proceedings. To contest the suspension, the person must provide information and arguments to the suspending official within 30 days. Failure to disclose information truthfully may result in further legal action. Suspension actions are informal, allowing for fact-finding under certain conditions. Suspension actions are informal and allow for fact-finding under certain conditions. A suspending official must make a decision within 45 days of closing the official record. Generally, a suspension lasts for 12 months, but it may continue until legal or debarment proceedings are over. Both agencies and persons must verify they are not entering a covered transaction with an excluded or disqualified person. Agencies and persons must verify they are not entering a covered transaction with an excluded or disqualified person. This can be done by checking the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS) for information on nonprocurement and procurement debarments and suspensions. A federal agency may grant exceptions for excluded persons to participate in covered transactions. Both \"primary tier participants\" and \"lower tier participants\" must disclose exclusions before entering a covered transaction. Failure to disclose may result in suspension or debarment. If a person is excluded by a federal agency, they may not participate in covered transactions or act as a principal in those transactions. Debarment or suspension applies to all organizational elements unless specified otherwise. Exceptions may be granted by an agency. Exclusion under OMB Guidelines affects eligibility for federal procurement transactions governed by the FAR. The FAR excludes individuals from federal procurement transactions, making them ineligible for nonprocurement covered transactions as well. The Defund ACORN Act limits certain organizations from entering into federal agreements or receiving federal funds if indicted for campaign finance violations or other specified offenses. The Defund ACORN Act restricts organizations from receiving federal funds if they have filed fraudulent forms or employed individuals indicted for election-related violations. ACORN and its affiliates were initially barred from funding but this was later deemed unconstitutional. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 prohibits funds to ACORN and its affiliates. Debarment and suspension in federal grant programs, including DOT grants under ARRA, were discussed in a House hearing on March 18, 2010."
