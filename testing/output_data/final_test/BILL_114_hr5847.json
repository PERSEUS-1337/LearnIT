Congress acknowledges the peaceful leadership and dedication of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr. in promoting civil rights and social justice. Gandhi worked for India's liberation from British rule, while King fought against segregation and racial injustice. The Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial in Washington, DC opened to the public on August 22, 2011. The newest National Memorial in Washington, DC pays tribute to Dr. King's contributions to world peace through nonviolent social change.

In 2009, a congressional delegation visited India to commemorate King's pilgrimage and study Gandhi's life, emphasizing the need for peaceful conflict resolution.
