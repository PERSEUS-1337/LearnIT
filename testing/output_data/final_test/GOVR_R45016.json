    "content": "The Rohingya, a Sunni Muslim minority in northern Rakhine State, are facing crises due to attacks by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army and a clearance operation by Burma's security forces. Over 600,000 Rohingya have been displaced to makeshift camps in Bangladesh, creating humanitarian crises in both countries. Burma's policies towards the Rohingya pose challenges for their voluntary return. Burma's laws and policies have deprived most Rohingya of their human rights, including citizenship. Many displaced Rohingya may not return unless safety is ensured, laws are changed, and rights restored. If conditions in Burma are unsuitable, international community may need to consider other assistance like longer-term accommodation in Bangladesh camps. Allegations of severe human rights abuses have led to claims of crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing. The ongoing violence in Rakhine State, fueled by vigilantes, has led to allegations of human rights abuses, including possible crimes against humanity. This presents a challenge for Burma and the international community to investigate and hold those responsible accountable. The displacement of Rohingya and alleged violence by Burmese security forces have also raised concerns about the radicalization of both Rohingya and Buddhist Rakhine populations. Some Rohingya may join ARSA or other extremist groups, while some Rakhine may join armed organizations or form militias. The Trump Administration responded by denouncing ARSA attacks, providing humanitarian aid, and imposing restrictions on relations with the Burmese military. The United States announced new restrictions on relations with the Burmese military in response to the Rohingya crisis, focusing on solving problems rather than punishing individuals. Congress may consider appropriate actions to address the crises, including humanitarian assistance in Bangladesh and Rakhine State, repatriation of displaced Rohingya, and rectifying discriminatory laws in Burma. The importance of rectifying Burma's discriminatory laws for Rohingya repatriation and reconciliation, investigating human rights abuses, and addressing the risk of radicalization in Rakhine and Rohingya. The United States should take measures to pressure Burma to amend discriminatory laws, support investigations into human rights abuses, and assist in countering radicalization efforts. The United States should assist Bangladesh and Burma in countering radicalization efforts among ethnic communities, particularly the Rohingya minority. Questions arise about potential destabilization in the region, domestic political tensions in Bangladesh, and U.S. policy towards Burma, including the reinstatement of sanctions to promote changes in government behavior. On November 2, 2017, bills were introduced in the House and Senate to address the Rohingya crises and reformulate U.S. policy towards Burma. The BURMA Act and Burma Human Rights and Freedom Act would impose sanctions on Burmese military leaders and provide humanitarian assistance. The Rights and Freedom Act of 2017 allocated $104 million for humanitarian aid to Rohingya victims of the Burmese military's ethnic cleansing campaign in Rakhine State. Following an attack by ARSA members and Rohingya supporters on security facilities, the Burmese military launched a clearance operation, displacing over 600,000 Rohingya into Bangladesh. The crisis in Rakhine State began with an attack by ARSA on border outposts, leading to the displacement of Rohingya and other ethnic groups. Rakhine State is located in western Burma, bordering Bangladesh, with a population of 3.2 million. The Rakhine and Rohingya are the largest ethnic groups in the region. The Rohingya, a Sunni Muslim community, are the next largest ethnic group in Rakhine State, with an estimated population of 1.0-1.1 million. The Rakhine population is around 2 million. Most Rohingya reside in northern Rakhine, while the Rakhine are the majority in central and southern Rakhine. The Rohingya claim ancestry in the region since the 9th century and were Burmese citizens until the military coup of 1962, after which discrimination and persecution began. The Burmese leaders implemented discriminatory policies against the Rohingya, conducting military campaigns to expel them from Burma. In 1978, General Ne Win's military operation forced 200,000-250,000 Rohingya into Bangladesh. The 1982 Citizenship Law revoked Rohingya citizenship, with the government claiming they are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. This narrative dates back to British rule and continues to present day. Interethnic violence in Rakhine State between the Rakhine majority and Rohingya minority has led to deaths, displacement, and tensions. Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh, while others are internally displaced in camps in Rakhine State. Organizations report that 94% of the over 600,000 displaced people in Bangladesh are Rohingya, with a smaller number of ethnic Hindu and Rakhine among them. Approximately 54% are children, 4% are elderly, and the remaining 42% are adult refugees, with roughly 52% being women. Concerns have been raised about the whereabouts of \"missing men\" of military age. The total number of displaced individuals in Bangladesh, mostly Rohingya, is estimated to be between 700,000 to over 900,000. U.N. Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres described the situation as the world's fastest-developing refugee emergency and a humanitarian nightmare. The number of displaced people in Burma's Rakhine State and Bangladesh is uncertain due to limited access and fluid situation. Up to 20,000 people tried to cross the border daily, but faced obstacles like fencing and landmines. Lack of transport and cost also hindered their movement. Bangladesh has kept its borders open, but both countries are not parties to refugee conventions. Information on IDPs in Rakhine State is scarce due to media restrictions by Burmese security forces. Tens of thousands of people have been displaced internally in Rakhine State, with some living with relatives or in schools and monasteries. Around 27,000 IDPs from various ethnic groups have moved within the state since August 25, 2017. Concerns are raised about the lack of basic needs for Rohingya who remain in Burma, potentially forcing them to flee. On October 2, 2017, the Burmese government allowed a guided tour for diplomats, U.N. officials, and local media in northern Rakhine State. The Burmese government allowed diplomats, U.N. officials, and media to tour northern Rakhine State. Discussions focused on the situation and humanitarian access for displaced individuals. The government is leading the humanitarian response with support from the Red Cross Movement. The Red Cross Movement, including IFRC and MRCS, is providing humanitarian assistance in Rakhine State. Access to northern Rakhine is restricted, hindering aid delivery. International aid groups are urging the Burmese government to allow unfettered access. Efforts to transport supplies to the affected area face obstacles from Rakhine protesters. Bangladesh, with limited capacity, struggles to accommodate the newly displaced Rohingya. The humanitarian situation in Bangladesh is dire as approximately 600,000 newly displaced Rohingya are struggling to find shelter. The existing refugee camps near Cox's Bazar are overflowing, prompting the establishment of new spontaneous settlements due to severe overcrowding. Bangladesh has started biometric registration of Rohingya with the assistance of UNHCR to address the crisis. Many recently displaced Rohingya in Bangladesh are living in open settlements, facing significant gaps in basic assistance. There is a critical need to scale up health, water, and sanitation interventions to prevent disease outbreaks. A new 3,000-acre camp at Kutupalong is being established to accommodate 800,000 people, in addition to existing official camps near Cox's Bazar. The Ministry of Disaster and Relief Management will coordinate with humanitarian partners to install basic facilities in the new \"mega camp.\" Bangladesh is considering relocating Rohingya to Thengar Char, an island in the Bay of Bengal. The island is near Jaliyar Char, where work has begun to accommodate Rohingya. The experience of Bangladeshi refugees fleeing to India in 1971 informs their perspective on the Rohingya crisis. Bangladesh's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs views the Rohingya issue as a security concern. Foreign Affairs Minister Mohammed Shahriar Alam emphasized that the Rohingya crisis is both a security and humanitarian issue for Bangladesh. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina outlined a five-point policy at the United Nations, calling for an end to violence in Rakhine State, protection of all civilians in Myanmar, and the safe return of displaced Rohingya to their homes. Bangladesh will not allow ARSA to establish a base in the country. Bangladesh urges Myanmar to repatriate displaced Rohingya and calls for international assistance in caring for them until they can return. Bangladesh rejects using the 1992 MoU for repatriation, citing changed circumstances, and favors UN involvement in discussions on Rohingya return to Myanmar. Bangladesh is nearing its limit in supporting displaced Rohingya, planning to fence the border with Burma and barring NGOs from assisting. Prime Minister Hasina urges the Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference to pressure Burma to stop Rohingya persecution. U.N. entities and international NGOs are providing critical humanitarian aid. International NGOs are providing critical humanitarian assistance to those fleeing Burma, including food, water, sanitation, health care, and shelter. Vaccination campaigns are ongoing for measles, rubella, polio, and cholera. Overcrowding is a major issue, and efforts are being made to address protection concerns such as human trafficking risks. Prior to August 25, 2017, access for humanitarian aid in Burma was limited by the government and military. Since then, access has improved, but challenges remain in reaching affected areas. Access for humanitarian organizations in northern Rakhine State has been restricted since August 25, 2017. The United Nations and humanitarian partners launched Myanmar's 2017 Humanitarian Response Plan for $150 million in December 2016. Funding appeals have changed, with a preliminary response plan requesting $77 million in September 2017. In September 2017, UNOCHA and partners revised the Joint Response Plan for Burma and Bangladesh, increasing funding to $434 million to assist 1.2 million people, including Rohingya refugees. As of October 16, 2017, $106 million (24%) had been committed. A pledging conference raised $360 million on October 23, 2017. U.S. humanitarian policy in Burma focuses on access and protection concerns. In FY2016, the United States allocated over $50 million in humanitarian aid for Burma, with an additional $32 million announced in 2017 for displaced people in Bangladesh and Rakhine State. This is in addition to $63 million provided since October 2016. Since October 2016, the United States has provided over $63 million in humanitarian assistance for vulnerable communities displaced in and from Burma. The Trump Administration's policy on humanitarian aid to Burma is unknown, and the amount for FY2018 is undetermined. Key U.S. agencies providing aid include USAID, OFDA, FFP, and the State Department's PRM. An estimated 700,000 to over 900,000 displaced Rohingya are in camps in Bangladesh, with thousands more in other South and Southeast Asian nations. Over 1 million Rohingya may want to return to northern Burma. Aung San Suu Kyi wants Rohingya repatriation managed according to a 1992 agreement, but Bangladesh disagrees and calls for UN involvement. Conditions for Rohingya return to Burma must be acceptable for over 1 million potential returnees. The Burmese government requires evidence of prior residence for Rohingya to return, potentially limiting their eligibility. Discriminatory policies, such as denial of citizenship, have left many Rohingya stateless. In 2015, Rohingya were denied suffrage and representation, education, employment, and faced restrictions on movement, marriage, religious conversion, and procreation due to their stateless status. In 2015, Burma passed laws targeting Muslims, including the Rohingya, restricting marriage, pregnancy spacing, and cohabitation. Aung San Suu Kyi formed a commission in response to 2016 attacks, cautioning against a militarized response for peace in Rakhine State. The commission's recommendations include promoting economic development in Rakhine State, aligning Burma's Citizenship Law with international standards for Rohingya citizenship, and resettling IDPs. A committee has been appointed to implement these recommendations, but lacks Rohingya representation. Burma's security forces have been accused of serious violations by various organizations. Burma's security forces have been accused of serious human rights abuses, including ethnic cleansing, crimes against humanity, and possibly genocide. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein reported on security forces burning Rohingya villages and extrajudicial killings. Myanmar's refusal to grant access to human rights investigators has worsened the situation. The current situation in Myanmar appears to be a textbook example of ethnic cleansing, with allegations of serious human rights abuses by the Tatmadaw. Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh claim Tatmadaw soldiers killed civilians, raped women, and burned down villages. Medical teams treating the Rohingya report gunshot wounds and signs of sexual assault. A BBC reporter witnessed the destruction of a Rohingya village. Human Rights Watch and other organizations have documented the destruction of nearly 300 Rohingya villages in northern Rakhine State, with at least 288 villages partially or totally destroyed by fire since August 25, 2017. Reports indicate that some Rohingya structures were burned while neighboring Rakhine buildings remained unharmed. Despite allegations, Commander-in-Chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing denies any involvement in the destruction. Senior General Min Aung Hlaing denies allegations of human rights abuses by Burmese security forces and claims that unlawful acts are not allowed. He has agreed to establish a military investigatory team to examine the allegations. Burmese government officials, including Vice President Henry Van Thio, have also denied the human rights abuse allegations. Burma's National Security Advisor Thaung Tun denies ethnic cleansing and genocide in Myanmar, stating that the government will prevent such actions. The Tatmadaw and Burmese government blame ARSA and its supporters for the conflict. The Burmese government and military accuse ARSA and its supporters of human rights violations, including the killing of civilians in Rakhine State. ARSA was declared a terrorist organization due to these alleged actions. The government's descriptions of the military's operations have been selective in providing information. The Tatmadaw's \"clearance operation\" in northern Rakhine State has led to allegations of human rights abuses, with evidence questioning the accuracy of reports. Military operations in the region have historically resulted in the displacement of Rohingyas and allegations of serious human rights violations by Tatmadaw soldiers. The Tatmadaw views the Rohingya as inferior to the Bamar majority. The Tatmadaw's treatment of the Rohingya is seen as discriminatory and maltreatment, with some officers justifying rape by calling Rohingya women \"dirty\" and \"ugly.\" The goal of the Tatmadaw's actions is debated, with some calling it ethnic cleansing while others believe it aims to reduce the Rohingya population in northern Rakhine State through forced displacement and immigration of other ethnic groups. Past evidence suggests the Burmese government's desire to remove all Rohingya from Burma. In July 2012, President Thein Sein offered to hand over the Rohingyas to the UNHCR for resettlement in other countries. The United Nations rejected the offer. In March 2017, a fact-finding mission was approved by the U.N. Human Rights Council to investigate human rights violations in Rakhine State, but Aung San Suu Kyi refused entry, citing potential hostility. U.N. Special Rapporteur Yanghee Lee expressed concern about the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Rakhine State in August 2017. The United Nations reiterated its request for action on September 19, 2017. The United Nations and other international actors have called on the Government of Myanmar to stop violence against the Rohingya community and address human rights violations in Rakhine State. The U.N. Security Council expressed grave concern over reports of abuses by Myanmar security forces, including killings and intimidation. The international community has condemned the violence against the Rohingya in Myanmar, with calls for the government to implement recommendations and cooperate with the UN. The World Bank postponed a loan, the UK suspended defense cooperation, and the EU halted ties with military leaders. The EU announced a halt in ties with Burma's senior military leaders in response to the Rohingya crisis, with concerns about potential radicalization among displaced populations. Displaced Rakhine may turn to ethnic armed groups like the Arakan Army for protection, potentially escalating Burma's civil war. The emergence of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) in Burma's civil war has raised concerns about potential ties to international terrorist groups. Despite ARSA's denial of such connections, observers warn of the risk of recruitment by terrorist organizations among the Rohingya population. An International Crisis Group report identified ARSA as a Muslim insurgency previously known as Harakah al-Yaqin (HaY), led by emigres in Saudi Arabia. The International Crisis Group (ICG) described the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) as led by a committee of emigres in Saudi Arabia and not having a terrorist agenda. The ICG report warned that a disproportionate response by Burma could radicalize sections of the Rohingya population. Unconfirmed reports suggest ties between elements in the Rohingya community and terrorist groups in Pakistan and Bangladesh. Analysts fear that groups like IS or AQIS could exploit the Rohingya issue for recruitment. The presence of dispossessed Rohingya in Bangladesh could make it a fertile ground for terrorist recruitment. Recent analysis suggests the Rohingya issue could become a focus of international jihadism for recruitment and support. The Rohingya issue has become a motivating factor for global terrorist organizations to rally support against the Myanmar government. Marginalized refugees and sympathizers are vulnerable to recruitment by extremists exploiting their causes. The crisis also impacts Bangladesh's domestic politics and international relations, with the Bangladesh National Party criticizing the government for not addressing the human rights crisis as genocide and failing to involve India and China in resolving the issue. The Bangladesh Islamist movement Hefazat-e-Islam has called for the liberation of Rakhine and threatened to wage jihad on Burma if it does not stop torturing Rohingya Muslims. An estimated 20,000 Hefazat supporters marched against the violence in September 2017, urging the Bangladesh government to go to war with Burma. Some in the Bangladesh media have contemplated arming the Rohingya, creating pressure on regional relations. The ASEAN was divided on issuing a joint statement on the situation in Rakhine State in September 2017. Malaysia criticized the text as a misrepresentation and called for a more active response to alleged human rights violations. Indonesia supported a more measured approach, while Singapore maintained noninterference but supported greater humanitarian assistance. ASEAN's internal disagreement on addressing the Rohingya crisis may hinder its role in responding to the crisis. China's response to the crisis may be influenced by its investments in oil and gas pipelines in Rakhine state as part of the Belt and Road Initiative. The evolving geopolitical dynamics between China and India could impact their responses to the Rohingya humanitarian crisis. India's response to the Rohingya crisis may be influenced by geopolitical concerns, including countering Chinese influence in the Indian Ocean. India sees Burma as a key part of its \"Act East\" policy, which may affect its approach to humanitarian issues. The U.S. aims for a democratically elected civilian government in Burma that respects human rights for all citizens. During military rule in Burma, Congress imposed sanctions to pressure the military junta to stop repression. The Obama Administration engaged with Burma's military leaders while keeping sanctions in place. In Obama's second term, sanctions were lifted to encourage political and economic reforms. The Trump Administration's response to the Rohingya crisis evolved over time, initially denouncing ARSA attacks and expressing concern. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson denounced alleged ARSA attacks on border outposts and expressed concern about human rights abuses, including mass burnings of Rohingya villages. He called for an end to the violence and persecution, labeling it as ethnic cleansing. Tillerson emphasized the need to support Aung San Suu Kyi's leadership while making it clear to the military that the violence is unacceptable. He stressed the importance of not standing idly by in the face of reported atrocities. The U.S. government urged the Burmese military to be disciplined and restrained in dealing with rebel elements in the country. U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley accused the Burmese government of conducting a brutal campaign against an ethnic minority and called for action against security forces implicated in abuses. She also called for a global ban on arms sales to Burma's military. The U.S. embassy, along with 19 other embassies, condemned the ARSA attacks in Rakhine State and urged the Burmese government to allow a U.N. investigation team to visit. The State Department announced visa ban waivers for Burmese military officers would no longer be granted and assistance to military units involved in operations in Rakhine State would be cut off. The State Department was assessing authorities under the JADE Act and Global Magnitsky Act to impose sanctions on those responsible for human rights violations. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State W. Patrick Murphy stated that they were still determining how to describe the treatment of the Rohingya and were not shying away from using appropriate terminology. The State Department had not labeled the situation in Rakhine State as ethnic cleansing yet, and their assessment is still pending. A U.S. delegation led by Acting Assistant Secretary of State Simon Henshaw was involved in the process. Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration Simon Henshaw visited Bangladesh and Burma to address humanitarian and human rights issues. He emphasized Myanmar's responsibility to restore stability in Rakhine State and investigate reported atrocities. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Thomas Shannon mentioned the availability of sanctions but prioritized problem-solving over punishment. Henshaw highlighted the ongoing need for humanitarian assistance and acknowledged contributions from other donors. The United States imposed sanctions on Burma in 1990 due to concerns over human rights violations by the ruling military junta. Despite this, U.S. policy towards Burma remained relatively normal until then, with support for trade relations and developmental assistance. Military relations were also close until 1988. The United States imposed sanctions on Burma in 1990 following the brutal suppression of the 8888 Uprising by the military junta. Congress passed laws like the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003 and the JADE Act in 2008, imposing political and economic sanctions. U.S. Presidents also imposed sanctions, including arms restrictions. The United States imposed sanctions on Burma, including an arms embargo and withdrawal of GSP benefits. Sanctions included visa bans, import restrictions, investment prohibitions, asset freezes, and limitations on aid and military interactions with the Tatmadaw. The United States imposed sanctions on Burma, including visa bans and economic restrictions. Former President Obama waived most sanctions on Burma, but some non-economic restrictions, such as visa bans for certain Burmese officials, remain in effect. The United States has imposed sanctions on Burma, including visa bans and economic restrictions. Some non-economic restrictions, such as visa bans for certain Burmese officials, remain in effect. Additionally, there are limitations on U.S. assistance to Burma and an embargo on arms sales. Legal restrictions have led to limited engagement with the Burmese military. The Bureau of Political-Military Affairs issued Public Notice 1820 suspending export licenses to Burma, and the JADE Act imposes visa restrictions on Burmese military leaders involved in human rights abuses. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 also contains restrictions on relations with the Burmese military. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 imposes restrictions on assistance for Burma, prohibiting funds to organizations controlled by the military and individuals or organizations involved in human rights violations. The Act also limits consultations with the armed forces of Burma to focus on human rights and disaster response. The Department of Defense and the Department of State have had limited interaction with the Burmese military despite restrictions on assistance for Burma. The Department of Defense has used unrestricted funding to send Burmese officers to training courses at the Daniel K. Inouye Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies in Honolulu, including courses on security cooperation and terrorism response. The Burmese military has participated in workshops and regional military exercises with U.S. assistance. Congress faces various issues related to the Rohingya crisis, including humanitarian assistance in Bangladesh and Rakhine State. Repatriation challenges and discriminatory laws in Burma hinder efforts to address the crisis. The discriminatory laws and policies in Burma hinder efforts to repatriate Rohingya and contribute to systemic human rights issues. The use of force by Burma's security forces reduces the likelihood of Rohingya voluntarily returning to Rakhine and raises concerns about accountability for alleged atrocities. The Rohingya crisis could potentially become a security issue if it is exploited by international or Bangladesh-based terrorist groups, impacting the political balance in Bangladesh. The Rohingya crisis in Burma could potentially impact regional geopolitical dynamics and lead to increased tensions between Bangladesh and Burma. The introduction of the BURMA Act and the Burma Human Rights and Freedom Act in 2017 aim to address human rights abuses in Burma by imposing visa bans and restrictions on security assistance. The BURMA Act and the Burma Human Rights and Freedom Act aim to address human rights abuses in Burma by imposing sanctions and restrictions on financial assistance. S. 2060 proposes a ban on jadeite and ruby imports from Burma, opposes IFI loans to military-controlled enterprises, and allocates $104 million for humanitarian aid. It also requires a review of Burma's eligibility for the GSP program."
