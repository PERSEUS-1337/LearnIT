    "content": "The 1970s were marked by high inflation rates in leading industrial countries, leading to a focus on achieving price stability through central bank policies. Countries like Canada, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand adopted inflation targeting as a major goal of monetary policy. The European Central Bank also prioritized price stability. These developments influenced the United States' Federal Reserve policy objectives. The Federal Reserve's policy objectives are currently focused on maintaining long-term growth of monetary and credit aggregates to promote maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. There are proposals to replace the current multigoal mandate with a single goal of maintaining stable prices, with different definitions of what \"stable prices\" entail. Democratic and Republican Members of Congress have introduced legislation in this regard, with past efforts dating back to the 1980s. In the 109th and 110th Congress, bills were introduced to mandate price stability as the primary goal of monetary policy. The Federal Reserve has mixed views on inflation targeting, with some officials supporting it and others, like Alan Greenspan, opposing a congressionally mandated inflation target. The Federal Reserve has mixed views on inflation targeting, with some officials supporting it and others opposing a congressionally mandated inflation target. Central bankers worldwide share a concern for price stability, with differences in approaches but a common goal. The proposal to focus the Federal Reserve on achieving price stability raises technical issues to be considered. The Federal Reserve is being refocused on achieving price stability to increase real goods and services available to the nation. Proponents argue that inflation has negative effects on economic growth, efficiency, choices, and employment. The case for price stability as the sole goal of monetary policy is supported by economic theory and empiricism, as well as a political argument. The Neutrality of Money doctrine is a key basis for this refocusing. The Neutrality of Money doctrine argues that changes in the money supply have neutral effects on the real economy, with economic growth and employment determined by other factors. Money primarily influences things like the price level and interest rates. Focusing on achieving price stability in monetary policy is supported by the doctrine and empirical evidence. The refocus on price stability in monetary policy is based on the idea that changes in the money supply can impact economic activity and prices with a long and variable lag. This lag can be influenced by changes in the economy's structure or policy regimes. Some economists argue against using monetary policy for goals like full employment due to the potential destabilizing effects of countercyclical monetary policy. The introduction of the theory of rational expectations revolutionized how economic agents form their expectations, especially regarding inflation. This theory suggests that agents use all relevant information, including monetary policy, to predict future economic conditions when making decisions such as wage bargaining. The theory of rational expectations implies that systematic monetary policy has no effect on the real sector of the economy as it is anticipated by economic agents. Any short-term impact would be due to unanticipated and nonsystematic policy changes, which would only last until agents adjust their decisions. The Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions, including price and interest rate changes, can lead to business cycle misperceptions. There is a theory that the Fed may surprise the economy with monetary changes to boost economic activity before presidential elections, known as the political business cycle. However, this surprise-based policy is not optimal as it can lead to inflation and reduce welfare. Rational expectations suggest that the focus should be on price stability to avoid the \"time inconsistency problem.\" The Federal Reserve's monetary policy can only affect employment through surprise changes, which have short-term effects. In the long run, monetary policy mainly impacts inflation, which can have harmful side effects on the economy. To reduce errors and misperceptions, making monetary policy more predictable and transparent is crucial. Over time, surprise changes become less effective and may even be counterproductive. Monetary policy changes, like disinflations, could be faster and less costly with increased credibility. Monetary policy changes, such as disinflations, could be faster and less costly with greater credibility. A credible central bank can lead to quicker changes in inflation expectations, making the economy more flexible. Precommitment and credibility in monetary policy can promote economic stability by anchoring expectations, particularly with a single goal like price stability. Credibility is crucial during financial crises, as seen in the importance of having an inflation target to maintain anchored expectations and reassure the public. In the 1960s, there was a consensus in macroeconomics about the Phillips Curve linking inflation and unemployment. However, economists like Phelps and Friedman introduced the concept of NAIRU, which defines the unemployment rate consistent with full employment and stable inflation. This theory challenged the traditional Phillips Curve framework. In the long run, the economy will return to the NAIRU with any inflation rate, and there is no permanent tradeoff between inflation and unemployment. Phelps and Friedman predicted the stability of the Phillips curve would vanish as individuals adjusted their expectations to higher inflation rates. Monetary policy would need to continually accelerate inflation to keep unemployment below the natural rate. Their contribution was important and prescient. The contribution of Phelps and Friedman was important and prescient as the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment vanished after the 1960s. The relationship between the two variables became positive, with a falling unemployment rate correlating with a decrease in the inflation rate. The NAIRU is determined by factors in the real sector of the economy, such as individual work/leisure choices, and monetary policy should focus on maintaining aggregate demand for price stability. The political argument for making price stability the sole goal of monetary policy is related to dissatisfaction with the Federal Reserve's accountability. The Fed's political independence and conflicting goals make it difficult for congressional criticism to impact future policy decisions. The Chairman of the Board of Governors presents economic reviews and projections to Congress twice a year. The future course of the economy over the next 36 months is uncertain, with little accountability in the Federal Reserve system. Despite criticism from Congress during economic downturns, no governor has been removed from office. The Fed's independence and conflicting goals make it challenging for congressional criticism to influence policy decisions. Proponents argue that a price target would make the Fed more accountable without undermining its independence. They believe that money is neutral in the long run and that price stability is the natural goal of monetary policy. The proponents argue that price stability is the natural goal of monetary policy, as it serves as an anchor for decision-making and accountability. They believe that the Federal Reserve cannot be held responsible for achieving full employment due to the natural rate of unemployment and rational expectations of individuals. This predictable anchor is seen as making monetary policy more transparent and effective. Some proponents argue that a price-stability goal is desirable for monetary policy, as discretionary policy can destabilize the business cycle. They believe in responsible stabilization policy alongside a price stability goal, known as \"constrained discretion.\" This approach allows central banks to stabilize the economy without risking long-run price stability. The Federal Reserve has an implicit anchor for the current monetary system, as it has been reluctant to let the U.S. inflation rate rise above 3%-4% without intervention. Proponents argue that adopting an inflation target may not improve the Fed's past or future performance in pursuing price stability. The case against an exclusive price stability goal is based on the belief that changes in the money supply can have lasting effects on real output and employment. This perspective challenges the idea that central bank actions only influence prices in the long run. The assumption of neutrality of money is dangerous and rarely questioned. Empirical evidence shows it is false in the short run and weakly supported in the long run. Some argue for exploiting a stable Phillips curve to address unemployment costs over inflation costs. This challenges views on business cycles and the NAIRU concept. Some economists question the practical significance of rational expectations and political influences on the Federal Reserve's decisions. Former Presidents faced economic challenges during re-election, highlighting the need to refocus the Federal Reserve on price stability. The proponents of refocusing the Federal Reserve on price stability criticize the current inflation due to political short-term focus. Some question the concept of NAIRU, citing the U.S. economy's behavior from late 1990s to 2007 as contradictory to the 6.0% NAIRU estimate. Critics argue that monetary policy can influence long-term unemployment rates, contrary to the neutrality of money and NAIRU. They suggest that severe short-term downturns may impact future unemployment rates. Data patterns in Figure 2 must be explained by economists critical of NAIRU. Oil price shocks can cause both unemployment and inflation to rise, with efforts by the Federal Reserve to reduce unemployment from supply shocks. The Federal Reserve aims to reduce unemployment caused by supply shocks, which may accelerate inflation. Implementing monetary policy for price stability can be challenging due to policy lags. The Fed controls monetary conditions that influence aggregate demand, impacting the price level and inflation rate. Policy lags could hinder the Fed from immediately returning inflation to target levels in case of an economic shock. The Federal Reserve faces challenges in implementing monetary policy for price stability due to policy lags. The lack of direct control over inflation is not a fatal problem, as it depends on how price stability is defined and the time horizon for achieving it. One proposed solution to address the lags is using intermediate targets like monetary aggregates, although their value in providing information about Federal Reserve intentions has decreased since the 1980s. The case for using an intermediate target like a monetary aggregate is well stated by Bernanke and Mishkin. Targeting the intermediate variable may be preferred if it is controlled by the central bank, understood by the public and financial markets, and related to the ultimate goal variable. Supply shocks, such as the OPEC oil cut-off in 1973, can require adjustments in real wages to restore full employment. In order to restore full employment, it is argued that allowing the price level to rise can lead to a decrease in real wages with less loss of output and increase in unemployment. A little inflation is believed to facilitate the return to full employment, as shown in a model by Akerlof, Dickenson, and Perry. Nominal wage rigidity persists even with rational expectations, but an inflation target could mitigate this issue. Those against changing the ultimate goal of Federal Reserve policy suggest that a central bank has various options to address the situation. The Federal Reserve's role goes beyond price stability to include ensuring the integrity of the payments system and serving as a lender of last resort during financial crises. This crucial function could be hindered by a narrow focus on price stability in policy mandates. Critics argue that a narrow focus on price stability could increase output volatility and unemployment. Most central banks with a sole price stability goal still use counter-cyclical policies. Monetary policy is not the only tool available, as governments have fiscal, debt management, and exchange rate policies. The Federal Reserve's role extends beyond price stability to include maintaining the payments system and acting as a lender of last resort during financial crises. The debate over whether monetary policy should focus solely on price stability is ongoing. Critics argue that unforeseen circumstances may arise that cannot be accommodated within a simple target. This debate often revolves around whether the Federal Reserve should be constrained by rules or allowed discretion in decision-making. The debate over monetary policy focuses on whether central bankers' judgment should prevail in decision-making, rather than being constrained by a simple target. Critics argue that unforeseen circumstances may arise that cannot be accommodated within a target, and empirical evidence suggests that more discretionary power can lead to better economic performance. Studies comparing the German and U.S. economies before the Euro introduction support this argument. The German central bank was expected to fare better than the Federal Reserve in responding to shocks due to its history of low inflation. However, evidence shows that the United States experienced smaller losses. Bernanke and Mishkin argue that central banks have operational independence in meeting inflation goals, rather than rigid rules. Bernanke and Mishkin argue that inflation targeting provides operational independence for central banks, combining the advantages of rules and discretion. Critics question the purpose of a price stability goal if broad discretion can override it for other goals. Some argue that monetary policy should aim for short-term stabilization of the business cycle, even if not all economists agree with this view. The critics argue that the pursuit of price stability should not sacrifice the stabilization of the business cycle. They believe that the economy is too complex for monetary policy to focus on one simple goal and advocate for multiple goals to ensure success. Discretion is necessary for experts to use their judgment in unforeseen circumstances. The adoption of a singular goal of price stability for the Federal Reserve has been implemented by several countries, including the European Central Bank. Price stability is defined as when inflation does not influence household and business decisions, raising the question of whether it should be defined broadly or quantitatively. The debate over defining price stability in general terms or with a quantified numerical target continues. Some suggest using terms like \"reasonable price stability\" legislatively, while others argue that maintaining stable prices has been the dominant goal of the Federal Reserve. Setting a numerical target for price stability may be necessary to drive policy changes. Discussions on defining price stability often revolve around whether it should be based on keeping a price index stable. The debate continues on whether to define price stability in terms of a stable price index or a stable inflation rate. One option is to have a stable price index, providing certainty for economic planning but risking bouts of deflation. Alternatively, price stability could be defined as a target inflation rate, with advantages such as leaving past deviations behind. The debate on defining price stability as a stable price index or target inflation rate continues. Countries with price stability goals use inflation ranges rather than price level targets. An ideal index should be timely, accurate, not subject to revisions, and easily understood by the public, excluding GDP-based indexes. The CPI, published monthly, meets these criteria. The CPI, published monthly, is widely reported in the news media and understood by the public. However, it may overstate inflation, leading to potential economic harm if a 0% inflation target is enforced. Some economists suggest targeting \"core inflation\" excluding volatile commodities like food and energy to avoid destabilizing monetary policy. The argument for targeting \"core inflation\" excludes volatile commodities like food and energy to avoid destabilizing monetary policy. Core and headline inflation rates can diverge for long periods, potentially affecting price stability goals. Countries with a price stability goal typically use a CPI index, with most using the full CPI. Central banks use a CPI index, with most using the full CPI. Some exclude items like food, energy, excise taxes, and home mortgage costs. Targets set should be demanding and credible. Two approaches are taken to achieve this: one focuses on a point target specified in law, while the other specifies a permissible range or band for inflation fluctuations. Both approaches aim to maintain price stability goals. The width of the band within which prices might fluctuate is crucial for credibility. A balance must be struck to avoid breaching the band too frequently or being perceived as not demanding enough. Estimates range from 3 to 14 percentage points for the central bank to stay within the band 95% of the time. Factors to consider include the type of shocks faced by the economy and the type of price index used. In practice, the width of the band within which prices fluctuate is crucial for credibility. The harm from inflation is more about its variability than the inflation itself. Maintaining a constant moderate inflation rate can prevent economic damage caused by variable inflation rates. The width of the band for permissible variations in price levels or inflation rates is important for economic stability. Inflation is influenced by various factors such as money supply, turnover rate, and shocks to supply like productivity, weather, and international trade. Some shocks are random while others can be longer-lasting and nonrandom. Supply type shocks are the most challenging for achieving price stability as they impact output and inflation. Demand shocks, on the other hand, can be offset by monetary policy to stabilize both output and inflation simultaneously. Supply shocks, such as OPEC-type oil price shocks, pose a significant challenge to achieving price stability. These shocks can lead to deflation of other prices to maintain the stability goal, resulting in increased unemployment in the short term. Terms-of-trade shocks can also occur due to international capital movements, causing a trade deficit and impacting the price index. Under a constant price level target, the Federal Reserve may need to inflate domestic prices to meet its goal. Supply shocks could also occur if the US implements a consumption-based tax like a VAT. Some countries allow tax changes as exceptions to their central bank's price stability goal. If too many exceptions are made, confidence in the goal may be affected. Setting a wide range or band for permitted price fluctuations can help avoid diluting the central bank's directive to maintain price stability. While some exceptions may be necessary, too many could undermine credibility. Most countries do not have a formal list of exceptions, but some allow for shocks like changes in terms of trade, supply disruptions, and tax and interest rate changes. This highlights the importance of supply shocks in affecting price stability. The Federal Reserve manipulates short-term market interest rates to influence aggregate demand, price levels, and inflation. Success requires technical expertise, good economic models, patience, and a long time horizon due to policy lags. The operation is hindered by the unobservable real or inflation-adjusted interest rates that impact aggregate demand. The success of meeting a goal of price stability depends on the time horizon, with technical considerations supporting a longer timeframe. Countries with numerical price goals typically specify a time horizon of at least one year. Implementing a new target different from the prevailing inflation rate may require a transition period to avoid destabilizing the economy. The Federal Reserve's pursuit of its goal should consider the lags in monetary policy and uncontrollable shocks to inflation and output. The Federal Reserve's pursuit of its goal under an inflation target raises questions about the trade-off between stabilizing inflation and minimizing short-run fluctuations in output. Countries with inflation targets often interpret the target as an intermediate goal to balance short-run output fluctuations with medium-run effects on inflation. Critics question the accountability of an inflation target regime if the central bank can always claim to be aiming for the medium run. The purpose of claiming a \"sole goal\" in monetary policy is questioned, especially when central banks also pursue an unemployment goal in the short run. Corrective action may be needed if targets are missed to ensure a smooth transition back to the goal, avoiding sudden and disruptive changes in monetary variables. The goal of price stability should aim to increase goods and services availability without causing extreme volatility in income, employment, and financial markets. Legislation refocusing the Federal Reserve should consider the time period to re-establish goals and the consequences of missing targets. A single goal of price stability with clear accountability may be beneficial, but appropriate recourse for missing targets must be determined to maintain public confidence. Unavoidable economic shocks suggest a medium-term target, balancing accountability with flexibility. The central bank's accountability is weakened if it aims to meet a target only in the medium run. Some suggest that central banks should be able to change inflation targets regularly, reducing accountability further. Formal accountability for meeting price stability targets varies among countries with such goals for their central bankers. In some countries, central banks must explain to the finance minister why inflation targets were missed and what actions were taken. New Zealand ties the central bank head's tenure to meeting the inflation target. Suggestions include linking governors' salaries and bonuses to price stability goals. The issue of joint goal-setting between the government and central bank is debated in parliamentary systems, highlighting the importance of central bank independence. Central bank independence is well established, with most countries jointly setting goals to enhance credibility. In the United States, Congress grants the Federal Reserve operational independence while maintaining oversight. If Congress sets a target for price stability, it can do so broadly or specify a numerical inflation target. Fed implementation could involve consultation with relevant congressional committees. The Federal Reserve could implement inflation targeting in consultation with relevant congressional committees. Congress could set the target range for price stability, directing the Fed to achieve the goal. Inflation targeting is viewed as a means to achieve price stability, with proponents aiming to move monetary policy away from maximum employment goals. Chairman Bernanke argues that inflation targeting is consistent with the current multi-goal mandate, as low inflation promotes economic efficiency. Chairman Bernanke argues that if an inflation target does not require a change in the mandate, the Fed can adopt one independently without Congressional action, impacting the credibility of a monetary policy focused on price stability. Concerns have been raised about the government's ability to override the target, leading to opportunistic changes that could undermine confidence in monetary policy. The American model of central banking allows for opportunistic changes in monetary policy to meet short-term political objectives, which may impact credibility. The U.S. Congress delegates power to the central bank to achieve various goals, leading to potential inconsistencies in policy objectives. The Federal Reserve has complete instrument independence in choosing monetary policy goals. Some economists advocate for a single goal of price stability, while others argue against fixing what isn't broken. Proponents argue that making price stability the sole goal of monetary policy would institutionalize success, prevent future departures from this philosophy, and insulate policy from political pressure. They believe the current regime of broad discretion could lead to opportunistic monetary surprises and an inflationary bias. Additionally, they suggest that focusing on one goal would enhance credibility, transparency, and accountability. Critics argue that a price stability goal for monetary policy underestimates its complexity and effects on the economy, despite acknowledging its positive impact. They believe that focusing solely on price stability may not be sufficient as the only policy goal. The pursuit of price stability is essential, but critics argue that it should not be the only policy goal for the Fed. They believe that maintaining price stability can coexist with minimizing business cycle excesses and ensuring financial sector soundness. Failure to pursue these additional goals could harm the economy, as seen during events like oil shocks and September 11. The recent expansion of Federal Reserve activities in response to the 2007 financial crisis may challenge its ability to uphold an inflation goal. Critics argue that the Fed's multi-goal mandate is more appropriate than a sole focus on price stability. They believe expert judgment is necessary due to the economy's complexity. The Fed's control over inflation is imprecise and delayed, making it challenging to maintain a point target at all times. Legislation may be needed to address accountability issues. Legislation may need to address the issue of inflation targeting. Possible remedies include allowing inflation to stay within a range, targeting core inflation, and targeting forecasted inflation. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke suggests the Fed could independently adopt inflation targeting without changing the current mandate. Opponents argue that inflation targeting and changing the mandate to focus solely on price stability are closely linked. If the Fed chooses to adopt an inflation target unilaterally, Congress can either block it through legislation or allow it to happen through inaction."
