    "content": "Phase-out of tax subsidies for alcohol fuels produced from feedstocks eligible for federal agricultural subsidies. The Internal Revenue Code is amended to phase out the credit for alcohol fuels produced from subsidized agricultural commodities. The credit will be reduced to 67 percent in 1995 and 33 percent in 1996 before being fully phased out. The subsection defines 'subsidized agricultural commodity' as any agricultural commodity supported by the Secretary of Agriculture. The excise tax reduction phase-out for alcohol produced from eligible feedstocks receiving federal agricultural subsidies is outlined. The subsection excludes qualified alcohol mixtures produced from subsidized agricultural commodities from certain tax benefits. In 1995 and 1996, the tax rate for these mixtures is increased by a certain percentage. The subsection excludes alcohol fuel produced from subsidized agricultural commodities from certain tax benefits, with a phase-out of subsidies for alcohol produced from feedstocks eligible for federal agricultural subsidies. The tax benefits for alcohol fuel do not apply to alcohol produced from subsidized agricultural commodities. In 1995 and 1996, the tax rate for such alcohol fuel is calculated with a phase-out provision. The tax benefits for alcohol fuel do not apply to alcohol produced from subsidized agricultural commodities. The phase-out provision for aviation fuel containing alcohol from subsidized feedstocks is outlined in the amendment. The phase-in of disallowance for aviation fuel containing alcohol from subsidized agricultural commodities involves a tax rate adjustment for calendar years 1995 and 1996. The term 'subsidized agricultural commodity' refers to any agricultural commodity supported by a price support program. The effective dates for the amendments are after December 31, 1994 for credit and January 1, 1995 for excise taxes. On any tax-increase date, a floor stock tax is imposed on alcohol fuel held by any person, equal to the difference between the taxes imposed before and after the date. The person holding the fuel is liable for the tax and must pay it within 90 days in the manner prescribed by the Secretary, with exceptions to the tax in certain cases. The clause does not apply to fuel held in the tank of a motor vehicle or motorboat, or to any fuel held by a person if the aggregate amount does not exceed 2,000 gallons on the tax-increase date of January 1, 1995, and January 1, 1996. Other laws, including penalties, apply to the taxes imposed. The floor stock taxes imposed by clause (i) are subject to the same rules as taxes imposed by sections 4041, 4081, and 4091 of the Code."
