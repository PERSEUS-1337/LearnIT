    "content": "During the medieval period, Kosovo was the center of a Serbian Empire. The defeat of Serbian forces by the Turkish military at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389 led to five centuries of Ottoman rule. Albanians replaced Serbs as the dominant ethnic group by the end of the 19th century. Kosovo was incorporated into Yugoslavia after World War I and became an autonomous province of Serbia in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In the 1980s, Albanian nationalism increased in Kosovo, leading to protests for independence. In 1989, Serbs revoked Kosovo's autonomous status, sparking political unrest. By 1998, ethnic violence escalated, prompting Slobodan Milosevic to launch a counterinsurgency campaign. NATO intervened in 1999, forcing Serb forces to withdraw from Kosovo. In 1999, NATO intervention forced Serbs to withdraw from Kosovo. A U.N. resolution placed Kosovo under UNMIK administration. Kosovo declared independence in 2008, leading to a legal dispute referred to the ICJ in 2010. Kosovo declared independence in 2008, which was upheld by the ICJ in 2010. Despite being recognized by over 110 countries, Serbia, Russia, China, and some EU nations do not acknowledge its independence. Kosovo has joined various international organizations but still lacks full sovereignty and is heavily overseen by international bodies. Kosovo remains heavily overseen by international organizations, with an unresolved border with Serbia due to Serbia's refusal to recognize Kosovo's independence. Ethnic Serb communities in northern Kosovo demand autonomy and direct links to Belgrade. A 400-member U.N. mission and the EU's rule-of-law mission operate in Kosovo to promote security, stability, human rights protection, and engagement between Pristina, Belgrade, and regional/international actors. The EU's rule-of-law mission (EULEX) in Kosovo has been downsized and will no longer have executive authorities. It will continue to support rule-of-law institutions in Kosovo towards increased effectiveness, sustainability, and accountability. The mission will monitor cases in Kosovo's justice institutions and advise the Kosovo Correctional Service. A new special court in The Hague will hear cases of Kosovo citizens accused of war crimes. The KFOR peacekeeping force oversees the training of the Kosovo Security Force. CEFTA promotes trade among Central and Eastern European countries. Kosovo joined CEFTA in 2007, represented by UNMIK due to Serb objections. President Hashim Tha\u00e7i leads Kosovo. The president of Kosovo, currently Hashim Tha\u00e7i of the Democratic Party of Kosovo, serves as the head of state and represents the country abroad. Tha\u00e7i was a political leader during the conflict with Serbia and has also served as deputy prime minister. The government of Kosovo is led by a prime minister and a Cabinet, with the prime minister nominated by the president and approved by the unicameral parliament. In 2017, national elections were held, resulting in a three-party coalition government. The PAN coalition, consisting of the PDK, AAK, and NISMA, won the most seats in the 120-seat Assembly. They nominated Kadri Veseli for speaker and Ramush Haradinaj for prime minister. Haradinaj, previously cleared of war crimes charges, faced a deadlock in forming a government until the New Alliance for Kosovo party ended its partnership. The Kosovo party, led by Behgjet Pacolli, joined the PAN coalition to form a government. Kadri Veseli was elected as speaker, and Haradinaj became prime minister with 61 votes, including support from the Serb-dominated Srpska Lista party. Vetevendosje, the ultranationalist party, won 32 seats but opposed the new government. Behgjet Pacolli was appointed deputy prime minister and foreign minister. The opposition parties, Vetevendosje and LDK, criticized the new government for being overdependent on Serbia due to the support of the Serb minority party. The decision to support Veseli and Haradinaj was seen as a strategic move possibly backed by Serb President Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107 to strengthen Kosovo's Serb minorities. Some believed the Haradinaj government would struggle to govern effectively. Despite initial doubts about its ability to govern, the Haradinaj government has managed to survive despite criticism over decision-making, particularly regarding agreements with Serbia and Montenegro. Political paralysis ensued in Pristina due to opposition parties and the Serb minority party blocking parliamentary activity through protests. The opposition raised concerns about the powers granted to Serb \"community associations\" and the border agreement potentially ceding Kosovo's western territory. The Srpska Lista objected to the border agreement, claiming Kosovo could not give away what they consider Serb territory. Former Prime Minister Mustafa proposed the agreement in September 2016 but had to withdraw the bill when Srpska Lista walked out, causing a six-month paralysis in the Assembly. Tensions eased when Srpska Lista members returned in March 2017. Prime Minister Haradinaj, critical of the agreement, planned to renegotiate with Montenegro. Haradinaj faced challenges to renegotiate the border agreement with Montenegro, initially met with resistance. Under pressure from the EU, he agreed to move the agreement to Parliament for ratification in February 2018. The border agreement between Kosovo and Montenegro faced opposition from the Vetevendosje party and Srpska Lista, delaying its ratification in Parliament. Despite protests and disruptions, the agreement was eventually passed on March 21, 2018, with the necessary 80 votes secured. The Tha\u00e7i/Haradinaj government in Kosovo faced challenges including weak governing institutions and unresolved issues like the Association of Serbian Municipalities demanded by Belgrade and Srpska Lista. Concerns were raised by the OSCE and EU about executive influence on judicial decisions, threats against judges, and poor court infrastructure. Allegations of war crimes from 1999-2000 also added controversy. In 1999-2000, former KLA members allegedly committed war crimes against ethnic Serbs and minorities. The ICTY convicted mostly Serbs and Bosnian Serbs for war crimes, while allegations in 2008 led to an investigation by Senator Dick Marty. The Council of Europe called for an independent investigation in 2010. Following Marty's investigation, the council called for an independent investigation and potential prosecution of alleged crimes, leading to the establishment of a special court in Kosovo. In 2015, the government pushed through a controversial amendment to create the Specialist Court for Kosovo in The Hague with international judges and prosecutors. President Tha\u00e7i criticized the court, causing tensions in Pristina. The court remains controversial as some view potential suspects as freedom fighters. In Kosovo, former KLA members are now active in the political system. The Marty investigation named President Thaci and Speaker Veseli as alleged perpetrators. In 2017, former KLA veterans petitioned to change the law for the special court, claiming it targeted only KLA members. Efforts to repeal the law failed in the Kosovo Assembly. The United States, the EU, and others have cautioned Kosovo against repealing the law targeting former KLA members. Speaker Veseli acknowledged the court as unjust but stated future attempts to stop it would fail. The most sensitive issue for the court's work will be protecting witnesses to possible KLA crimes. Pristina is preparing for the first indictments of former KLA fighters, which could lead to protests and violence. In 2015, Kosovo faced challenges with migration flows into the EU due to its poor economy and relaxed border controls with Serbia. The Kosovo government had to address the issue of rejected asylum applications and take measures to stop the migrant flows, leading to many Kosovars being forced to return. Additionally, there was an influx of Turkish citizens into Kosovo as a result of military actions. The flow of Turkish citizens into Kosovo has increased due to the military crackdown in Turkey after an alleged coup attempt. The Erdogan government has pressured Kosovo to extradite citizens accused of involvement in the coup, leading to tensions between Pristina and Ankara. Concerns also arise over Kosovars joining foreign forces in Syria and Iraq, with about 300 Kosovars, including Lavdrim Muhaxheri, joining ISIS. Kosovo is a member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS. In 2015, Kosovo passed a law making it a crime for citizens to participate in foreign conflicts, with penalties up to 15 years imprisonment. Around 60 individuals are on trial for terrorist activities, with some already convicted and sentenced to prison. Kosovo is implementing rehabilitation and de-radicalization programs, following other European countries. Kosovo is implementing rehabilitation and de-radicalization programs for citizens involved in conflicts in Syria or Iraq, following European countries like Denmark and Germany. Concerns remain over Kosovars with ties to ISIS and the potential for their return. The threat of violent Islamist extremism is growing in Kosovo, fueled by foreign funding and social media recruitment. Saudi influence is transforming the once-tolerant Muslim society into a hub for extremism. Kosovo is now facing the challenge of radical Islam, with the government taking steps to address the issue. In late December 2017 and early January 2018, a former imam of Pristina's Grand Mosque was charged with incitement to commit terrorist acts and inciting hatred through his lectures. Despite crackdowns on radical extremists, young people in Kosovo are still targeted for ISIS recruitment. The Islamic State remains a challenge until Kosovo implements a strategy to counter the ISIS narrative. The Kosovo government is actively cooperating with the United States on counterterrorism efforts. Various U.S. agencies have assisted Kosovo in counterterrorism cases and border security. Kosovo has implemented biometric travel documents and a Law on the Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing. The Kosovo Police Counterterrorism Directorate is enhancing its investigative capabilities, including developing a cyber-counterterrorism unit. Kosovo has established a Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and joined the Egmont Group to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. The country faces high poverty and unemployment rates, leading to a significant informal economy and migration of young people. Agriculture plays a small role in Kosovo's economy, with many living in rural areas outside the capital. Kosovo's economy heavily relies on near-subsistence farming, with lower labor costs compared to the region. The country faces challenges such as insufficient transport infrastructure, poor energy dependability, and limited connectivity. The IMF and World Bank suggest focusing on energy infrastructure, private-sector development, skill-building for the youth, and governance improvement. Despite these issues, the EBRD notes Kosovo's economy's resilience. Kosovo's economy showed resilience during the global and Eurozone crises, growing by 3.5% annually from 2009-2013. It was one of four European countries with continuous growth. After a slowdown in 2014, the economy rebounded in 2015 with 4% growth driven by domestic demand and investments. Growth slightly slowed to 3.4% in 2016 but is expected to increase with advancing reforms and higher investments. The IMF approved a Stand-By Arrangement in 2015 to maintain low deficits and debt levels and address structural barriers to growth. The IMF mission visited Pristina in May-June 2018 to discuss Kosovo's economic outlook. Kosovo's economy is solid with growth expected at about 4% in 2018, driven by robust private consumption and remittances. Remittances from the diaspora account for about 15% of GDP. Kosovo has limited large-scale industry and exports, hindering foreign direct investment. Disputes with Serbia over ownership have hampered full production at the Trepca mines. Kosovo's economy is solid with growth expected at about 4% in 2018, driven by robust private consumption and remittances. The privatization of state-owned enterprises has been successful with international assistance. However, Kosovo needs to improve its investment climate to attract more foreign investment beyond the current estimate of $200 million in FDI in 2017. High levels of corruption and little contract enforcement have discouraged potential investors, especially in the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) sector. Access to credit for SMEs remains a challenge for the government. The government has been working to improve access to credit for SMEs in Kosovo through initiatives like the Kosovo Credit Guarantee Fund (KCGF), which provides partial loan guarantees to stimulate lending and reduce collateral requirements. This effort is supported by the EBRD and USAID in partnership with the Government of Kosovo and other donors. The Kosovo Credit Guarantee Fund (KCGF), launched in April 2016 with support from USAID and the Government of Kosovo, has facilitated increased lending to SMEs, leading to business expansion and job creation. KCGF has agreements with 7 out of 10 Kosovo commercial banks, disbursing 558 individual loans totaling $23 million by October 30, 2017. Kosovo's efforts to promote a stronger economy are also evident in the World Bank's \"Doing Business\" project, where Kosovo was ranked as the second most-reformed country in the fragile states group, achieving an overall ranking of 40 in 2018. Kosovo has made significant progress in improving its business environment, ranking 40th overall in 2018 compared to 60th in 2017. The World Bank highlighted advancements in starting a business, getting credit, and resolving insolvency. Kosovo introduced a new bankruptcy framework for corporate insolvency, resulting in a lower rating of 49. Despite Serbia's refusal to recognize Kosovo's independence, Kosovo has made efforts to enhance economic stability and promote business growth. Despite Serbia's nonrecognition of Kosovo, talks between Pristina and Belgrade facilitated by the EU have focused on technical issues and agreements regarding various aspects such as free movement of persons, customs stamps, and civil registries. Implementation of these agreements has been hindered by disagreements over scope and enforcement. Liaison personnel have been exchanged to monitor the implementation of agreements and address any issues. On April 19, 2013, Kosovo and Serbia reached a significant agreement affirming Kosovo's legal framework. One key provision was the creation of an \"Association/Community of Serbian-majority municipalities\" in northern Kosovo, with oversight in various policy areas. Serb police in the region would be integrated into Kosovo's unified police force, with their salaries paid by Pristina. The police commander in the North would be a Kosovo Serb chosen by Pristina from a list of nominees. The police commander in the North of Kosovo was to be a Kosovo Serb selected by Pristina from nominees provided by the mayors of the four Serb municipalities. The ethnic composition of the local police force was to reflect the population. The judicial system in northern and southern Kosovo would operate under Kosovo's legal framework, integrating Serbian judges and prosecutors. An Appellate Court in Pristina would have a majority of Kosovo Serb judges, with a division based in northern Mitrovica. Serbian judges initially complained about lack of information on the new integrated court system. President Tha\u00e7i appointed 40 Kosovo Serb judges and 13 prosecutors in line with the Dialogue Agreement on the Judiciary. The integration of Serb judicial authorities in northern Kosovo marks the unification of Kosovo's justice system. Despite these achievements, Pristina and Belgrade continue to disagree on the next steps. The Haradinaj government has struggled to finalize the parameters of the Association of Serbian-majority Municipalities plan agreed to in 2013. The agreement is controversial in Kosovo, with political opponents claiming it favors Serbian interests. Serb President Vu\u010di\u0107 warned that Serbia would protect Kosovo Serbs amid slow progress by the Kosovo government. Tensions persist despite ongoing negotiations between Kosovo and Serbia. Tensions between Kosovo and Serbia persist despite efforts to cooperate. Incidents, such as the Belgrade-to-Mitrovica train painted in Serb colors, have escalated tensions. Kosovo President Tha\u00e7i accused Serbia of wanting to annex northern Kosovo, leading to threats of military action. Albania's Prime Minister mentioned the possibility of a union with Kosovo if EU membership prospects for the region fade. Serbian officials and Serbs in the Western Balkans warned of potential conflict if Albanians attempt to unite with Kosovo. Serbian government minister Aleksandar Vulin mentioned the possibility of another war involving Macedonia and Montenegro. The murder of Serb political leader Oliver Ivanovi\u0107 in Kosovo sparked condemnation from Kosovo's President Tha\u00e7i, who called for swift justice for the perpetrators. Ivanovi\u0107, known for supporting reconciliation talks between Serbia and Kosovo, was seen as a moderate figure in the region. The murder of Serb political leader Oliver Ivanovi\u0107 in Kosovo sparked speculation about motives, including his support for reconciliation between Serbs and Kosovars. Some believe his willingness to identify former KLA fighters for prosecution may have been a factor. Kosovo's Deputy Prime Minister suggested Russian involvement to destabilize Kosovo. Kosovo police arrested a Kosovo Serb refugee on war crimes charges, leading to complaints from Belgrade about intimidation of Kosovo Serb refugees. Relations between Belgrade and Pristina remain tense, with recent incidents including the detention and deportation of Marko Djuric by Kosovo Special police. Despite ongoing tensions, there have been some positive developments such as Pristina allowing Serbia's prime minister to campaign among Serb communities in Kosovo during the presidential election. Additionally, Serbia continues to pay off Kosovo's foreign debt to international creditors. Serbia is paying off Kosovo's \u20ac900 million foreign debt to international creditors incurred between 1970 and 1990. Trade between Kosovo and Serbia is imbalanced, with Serbia benefiting more. Serbian President Vu\u010di\u0107's commentary in August 2017 on Kosovo sparked reactions from nationalists in Serbia and the government in Pristina, hinting at a possible willingness to make concessions. Serbia may make concessions on Kosovo to improve relations with the EU, including allowing Kosovo to join U.N. organizations like UNESCO and Interpol. Kosovo withdrew its Interpol application due to opposition from Serbia and China. Border adjustments remain a controversial issue between Kosovo and Serbia. Border adjustments have been proposed as a solution for Kosovo and Serbia, with Kosovo potentially ceding parts of northern Kosovo in exchange for diplomatic recognition. This idea, rejected in the past, resurfaced in 2018 when Kosovo President Thaci mentioned \"border corrections\" with Serbia. This proposal has raised concerns about potential ethnic tensions and has been met with skepticism by many observers. Thaci's remarks on potential territorial adjustments with Serbia sparked intense debate and speculation. He suggested a referendum in Kosovo to gauge acceptance of such exchanges for recognition. Despite clarifying he wasn't advocating partition, Thaci emphasized the need for exploring historic deals with Serbia, prompting reactions from various NGOs in both countries. The EU plays a significant role in Kosovo's development, providing over \u20ac2.3 billion in assistance since 1999 for infrastructure, healthcare, education, and more. Kosovo's largest trade partner is the EU, with 32% of exports going to EU countries. Kosovo and Serbia may have requested EU support against any partition or territorial exchanges along ethnic lines. Kosovo aims to join the EU and has been a potential candidate since 2008. In 2014, a Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) was signed with the EU to enhance cooperation, entering into force in April 2016. EU Commission President Juncker stated in 2017 that new Balkan members may join by 2025. Juncker mentioned that no candidate country would likely join the EU until 2025, but Montenegro and Serbia were on track. Kosovo, facing political and economic difficulties, was criticized for lagging behind. Kosovo's potential EU accession is hindered by some member states not recognizing its independence, with Spain raising concerns due to its own internal issues with Catalonia. Kosovo's EU membership application is on hold as the EU rejected the approach. Spain now follows Serbia's lead on the matter. Accession negotiations require unanimous approval, making progress unlikely unless Kosovo and Serbia resolve their dispute. One point of contention is visa-free travel for Kosovo citizens, with the EU conditioning it on a border demarcation agreement with Montenegro. In early October 2017, Kosovo President Tha\u00e7i asked Albania to approve a law for dual Albanian-Kosovo citizenship to bypass EU visa restrictions. Kosovo's border dispute with Montenegro has been resolved, prompting Pristina to inquire about visa-free travel to Europe. The United States recognized Kosovo's independence in 2008 and continues to support normalization efforts between Kosovo and Serbia. Kosovar leaders see the U.S. as their strongest ally, reinforced by statements from U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley in 2017. In 2017, there were various occasions in Kosovo with statements from U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley and a visit by the U.S. Congress's House Democracy Partnership. Concerns arose in Pristina about the Trump Administration's long-term priorities in the Balkans and social attitudes towards Muslims. Kosovars were disappointed that Vice President Mike Pence's visit to the Balkans did not include a stop in Pristina. Kosovo's Prime Minister Haradinaj met with U.S. Ambassador Greg Delawie to strengthen relations with Washington. The U.S. embassy welcomed the formation of Kosovo's new government, expressing continued support for Euro-Atlantic integration, rule of law, economic development, and regional relations. U.S.-Kosovo relations faced challenges in early 2018 over attempts to repeal a law creating a special court for former KLA members. U.S. Ambassador warned that such actions would negatively impact Kosovo's future in Europe. In March 2018, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State visited Pristina and Belgrade to address regional issues. The Secretary discussed the importance of Kosovo engaging with Serbia and normalizing relations with Belgrade. He also advised that any creation of a Kosovo army should involve consultation and support from all parties. U.S. economic and trade relations with Kosovo are limited, with total trade in goods amounting to $12 million in 2017. U.S. investors in Kosovo are active in construction, energy, health, telecommunications, and real estate development sectors. Kosovo has been designated as a beneficiary country. In FY2017, the Obama Administration requested approximately $53 million in aid for Kosovo, including $38.5 million for Economic Support Funding (ESF) aimed at improving fiscal and banking policies and creating an investor-friendly business environment. Kosovo is a beneficiary country under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program, which eliminates duties on products imported from Kosovo. USAID works to combat corruption, increase transparency, and assist Kosovo's integration into the EU. In FY2017, the Obama Administration requested $38.5 million in aid for Kosovo to support effective governance, justice-sector development, economic growth, democratic institutions, civil society, and media. USAID assistance focused on promoting economic development by supporting Kosovo's private sector and government accountability. USAID assistance in Kosovo simplified the process of starting a business and supported the drafting of the country's first bankruptcy law. Despite initial concerns about reduced U.S. foreign assistance under the Trump Administration, Kosovo received approximately $52 million in FY2018. The Administration's FY2019 request seeks around $30 million for Kosovo. In 2016, an extradition agreement was signed between President Tha\u00e7i and U.S. Ambassador Delawie. The U.S. and Kosovo signed an extradition agreement to enhance cooperation in extraditing criminals. The $49 million \"threshold program\" aims to promote economic growth, modernize the energy sector, and encourage investments in energy efficiency. The Department of State's reports highlight significant human rights issues in Kosovo, including assaults on journalists, government corruption, lack of judicial independence, and violence against ethnic minorities and the LGBTI community. Kosovo remains a Tier 2 source and destination country for sex trafficking and forced labor, with the government making efforts to identify victims and conduct joint investigations. The government in Kosovo has made efforts to combat trafficking by appointing a special coordinator and establishing a new database. However, weaknesses remain as judges give lenient sentences to traffickers and prosecutors downgrade trafficking cases."
