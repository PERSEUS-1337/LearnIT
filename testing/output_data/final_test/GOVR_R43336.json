    "content": "This report provides an update on Brazil's challenge to certain aspects of the U.S. cotton program under the WTO dispute settlement process in case DS267, which originated in 2002 and was resolved in 2014. It focuses on developments in the case since 2011, particularly on efforts to resolve the trade dispute. The WTO cotton case involves efforts to resolve a trade dispute between Brazil and the U.S., impacting U.S. agricultural policy. Brazil had authority to impose trade retaliation, and the resolution could set a precedent for future disputes and stricter WTO rules. In 2002, Brazil initiated a WTO dispute against the U.S. cotton program, claiming it depressed international prices and harmed Brazil's cotton sector. A WTO panel found U.S. support payments and export programs violated WTO rules, requiring different responses to remedy the inconsistencies. The WTO panel recommended that the United States take steps to remove adverse effects of certain subsidies by September 21, 2005. Prohibited subsidies included export credit guarantee programs that assisted cotton and other products. The WTO panel recommended that the United States withdraw certain subsidies by July 1, 2005, including export credit guarantee programs for cotton. In response, the U.S. made changes to comply with WTO recommendations, but Brazil deemed them inadequate and requested $3 billion in retaliation. Arbitration was suspended in 2006, and Brazil requested a compliance panel to review U.S. actions. In August 2006, Brazil requested a WTO compliance panel to review the United States' cotton programs. A compliance panel ruled in favor of Brazil's charge in December 2007, upheld on appeal in June 2008. Brazil requested arbitration in August 2008 for a $3 billion retaliation value. In August 2009, the WTO arbitration panel announced trade countermeasures against U.S. goods and services, including a fixed annual amount and a variable formula-derived retaliation amount. Trade retaliation should occur within the violating sector according to WTO rules. Brazil proposed cross-retaliation beyond punitive tariffs on U.S. goods, citing detrimental effects on its economy. Arbitrators ruled in favor of Brazil's request for suspension of tariff concessions and obligations under WTO agreements. Brazil proposed cross-retaliation against the U.S., including in areas like copyrights and patents. In December 2009, Brazil announced trade retaliation starting in April 2010, targeting up to $829.3 million in U.S. goods. This led to negotiations to avoid sanctions, with concerns from both U.S. exporters and Brazil's domestic sectors. In April 2010, Brazil and the United States agreed to a memorandum of understanding to avoid trade retaliation. The agreement included the U.S. paying $147.3 million annually to Brazil for technical assistance in the cotton sector and working together to find a mutually satisfactory solution to the dispute. In April 2010, Brazil and the United States reached a memorandum of understanding to resolve the cotton dispute. The joint work period would begin on April 22, 2010, lasting for 60 days, with Brazil refraining from imposing countermeasures. On June 17, 2010, U.S. and Brazilian trade negotiators finalized the Framework for a Mutually Agreed Solution to the Cotton Dispute in the WTO. The agreement aimed to avoid trade retaliation by Brazil against U.S. goods and services, with Brazil suspending retaliation pending U.S. compliance with the measures outlined in the agreement. Key aspects of the agreement included discussions on an annual limit on trade-distorting U.S. domestic cotton support. The United States would implement a limit on trade-distorting domestic cotton support, with adjustments to the GSM-102 program and quarterly discussions with Brazil. Upon enactment of the 2014 farm bill, the U.S. and Brazil agreed to consult on resolving the WTO cotton dispute, delaying trade retaliation until after potential changes to U.S. cotton programs were evaluated. The U.S. and Brazil reached a new agreement in the long-standing cotton dispute at the WTO. Brazil agreed to forgo countermeasures against U.S. trade, while the U.S. agreed to new rules for fees and tenor in the GSM-102 program. A temporary Peace Clause was established, and the U.S. would make a final payment of $300 million to the Brazil Cotton Institute. The United States agreed to make a one-time final payment of $300 million to the Brazil Cotton Institute with specific conditions on how the funds can be used. The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) includes provisions for expanding the use of funds beyond cotton-related activities, requiring routine reporting of compliance, and setting termination dates for certain conditions. The agreement also made changes to cotton and export credit guarantee programs since 2005. The United States made changes to its cotton and export credit guarantee programs to comply with WTO recommendations. These changes were made before and as part of the 2014 farm bill, as well as to conform with the final MOU of October 1, 2014. Congress also included relevant amendments to non-farm-bill legislation to address outstanding case-related issues. The Step 2 cotton program was eliminated in 2006 to address actionable subsidies in the Brazil-U.S. cotton case. Nearly $3.9 billion in payments were made under this program from 1991 to 2006. Steps were taken by USDA and Congress to address export credit guarantees with implicit export subsidies prohibited under WTO rules. USDA implemented a temporary fix in 2005 by using a risk-based fee structure for export credit guarantee programs. The USDA implemented a risk-based fee structure for export credit guarantee programs to eliminate subsidies and ensure long-run operating costs are covered. The 2008 farm bill eliminated the GSM-103 and SCGP programs, removed the 1% fee cap on the GSM-102 program, and required the Secretary of Agriculture to work with the industry on risk-based fees. The USDA implemented a risk-based fee structure for export credit guarantee programs to cover operating costs and losses over the long-term. Changes to the GSM-102 program have led to a drop in Brazil's retaliatory rights, despite an increase in program usage since 2008. The USDA disqualified Brazil as an export destination for third-country banks seeking loan guarantees for U.S. agricultural exports, impacting Brazil's retaliatory rights. This change was due to the negative impact of GSM-102-backed loans by Brazilian banks on Brazilian agricultural producers. The Brazil-U.S. memorandum of understanding in April 2010 involved the U.S. making monthly payments to a Brazilian cotton fund. The USDA reduced monthly payments to Brazil's cotton fund by 5% in 2013, citing federal budget sequestration effects. The total annual payment was $147.3 million, with the reduction amounting to $7.365 million. This move was met with praise and criticism, with no amendments to eliminate the payments enacted in 2011. In October 2013, USDA stopped payments to Brazil's cotton fund, citing loss of authority and funding exclusion from the President's 2014 budget proposal. Cumulative payments to Brazil totaled nearly $496 million by that time. Congress had previously passed legislation to eliminate certain export credit guarantee programs. The United States made payments to Brazil's cotton fund and held regular meetings to discuss cotton support programs. Despite efforts to resolve the cotton dispute, Brazil argued that the U.S. response was inadequate. In 2014, Congress proposed revamping cotton support programs with an insurance-like program. The National Cotton Council helped design the new program to address WTO concerns. The National Cotton Council played a key role in designing the new cotton support program to address WTO concerns. The program now treats U.S. cotton differently from other crops, relying on market-based insurance as the primary support measure. Producers must pay into the program, a loss must occur before payment is made, and payments cannot exceed the crop's insured value to minimize incentives. The 2014 farm bill repealed current cotton support programs, including direct payments, counter-cyclical program, and Average Crop Revenue Election. This represents a significant concession for the U.S. cotton sector. Payments under the direct payment program were made annually to cotton base acres. Since 1996, owners of upland cotton base acres have received over $10 billion in direct payments and nearly $7.6 billion in CCP payments. Cotton is ineligible for new price and income support programs like PLC, ARC, and SCO, resulting in reduced marketing loan program benefits for cotton. The 2014 farm bill introduces a new marketing loan rate for upland cotton, calculated as the average of the adjusted world price for the two preceding marketing years. Upland cotton producers are eligible for the Stacked Income Protection Plan (STAX), a county-based revenue insurance policy. STAX covers county-wide revenue losses between 10% and 30% of expected county revenue. The STAX program offers indemnity payments for county revenue losses between 10% and 30%, with producers paying 20% of the premium and the government covering the remaining 80%. Total indemnity payments, including other crop insurance, cannot exceed the crop's insured value. This subsidy rate is more generous than other insurance products, but producers must now pay to participate in STAX, unlike previous cotton support programs. Premiums are based on the risk of loss and crop value. Under the STAX program, producers must pay premiums based on the risk of loss and crop value. Premiums increase when crop prices rise. Even in years with no loss, producers still have to pay premiums. The program's revenue guarantee is determined by market conditions, with the price component fluctuating yearly. The STAX program's revenue guarantee fluctuates yearly based on market conditions, with no safety net against multiple-year low returns for cotton. STAX, an insurance product, has no cap on individual payments but limits total indemnities to the insured crop value. The 120% payment rate multiplier allows producers to enhance risk management coverage, causing concern for Brazil. Crop insurance indemnities limit abnormal production incentives and market distortion. Cotton producers receive transition payments in 2014 and 2015 due to the repeal of Direct Payments. Brazil Cotton Institute spending concessions are allowed in the 2014 farm bill. The 2014 farm bill allows funds from Brazil's special cotton fund to be used for agricultural research in collaboration with USDA or US institutions. Changes to the GSM-102 program include a maximum contract length of 24 months and flexibility for negotiations with Brazil to comply with WTO recommendations. Other provisions in the bill include reduced upland cotton storage costs and special marketing provisions for the US cotton sector. The 2014 farm bill includes special marketing provisions for the US cotton sector, such as import quotas and economic adjustment assistance payments. The bill also allows funds from Brazil's special cotton fund to be used for agricultural research in collaboration with USDA or US institutions. Since 2006, market forces have shifted resources away from cotton towards other crops due to rising prices of corn and other feed grain and oilseed crops. Globalization and the decline of the U.S. textile sector have also contributed to the decrease in domestic mill use of U.S. upland cotton. This has led to a decline in U.S. upland cotton's competitiveness against other program crops. The decline in U.S. upland cotton's competitiveness against other program crops led to a shift in resources towards corn and feed grain prices in 2013. The increase in cotton plantings in 2014 was influenced by market conditions rather than government incentives. The 2014 farm bill's treatment of upland cotton aligns with WTO criteria, with the STAX program now being the principal support program. The original WTO panel hearing the cotton case found that crop insurance payments did not seriously harm Brazil's interests. Both U.S. and Brazilian commercial interests were eager to resolve the dispute. Brazil presented a report on the 2014 farm bill to CAMEX in February. CAMEX recommended Brazil request a WTO panel to assess US compliance with the 2004 decision faulting subsidies to cotton producers. The decision is based on Article 21.5 of the Dispute Settlement Understanding, with the panel required to circulate its report within 90 days. On February 20, the Brazilian government informed the U.S. government of seeking negotiations before moving to a WTO compliance panel for the long-running cotton dispute. Brazil and the United States reached an agreement on October 1, 2014, resolving the issue through a new memorandum of understanding. The MOU between Brazil and the U.S. outlined new rules for the GSM-102 export credit guarantee program, including a shorter maximum tenor of 18 months and a risk-based fee system. The U.S. also made a one-time payment of $300 million to the Brazil Cotton Institute in exchange for Brazil dropping the WTO cotton dispute. Brazil agreed to drop the WTO cotton dispute and abide by a temporary Peace Clause regarding new WTO actions against U.S. cotton support programs and agricultural export credit guarantees. The resolution avoided a trade war between the U.S. and Brazil, resulting in significant changes to U.S. domestic support programs for upland cotton and export credit guarantees. This resolution could impact future WTO trade negotiations and dispute settlement cases. The WTO Brazil-U.S. cotton case has set a precedent for domestic support policy in ongoing trade negotiations. The WTO's inability to progress in multilateral trade talks suggests that its dispute settlement mechanism may be key in shaping future changes in domestic support policies."
