    "content": "The collapse of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact in 1991 changed the international environment. Transnational issues like narcotics, terrorism, money laundering, and weapons of mass destruction have become more urgent than traditional geopolitical concerns. The Director of Central Intelligence emphasized the evolving threat of terrorism in 2001, noting a rise in decentralized transnational groups. Before the attacks on the Pentagon and World Trade Center in September 2001, there was greater concern among the American public about international crime reaching the country. Changed international realities have expanded the role of law enforcement agencies and intelligence agencies in addressing transnational threats. The evolution of law enforcement and intelligence agencies has blurred distinctions between domestic and international missions. The FBI has expanded its international role by increasing agents overseas to address transnational threats, while the CIA focuses on illegal activities in foreign countries. The CIA and other intelligence agencies are increasing resources to counter transnational threats like terrorism and narcotics. There is a lack of clear primacy between law enforcement and intelligence communities in addressing these threats, with different legal authorities and organizational structures. Some analysts feel that law enforcement heads may not fully understand the complexities of international threats. Many observers express concerns about intelligence agencies using covert techniques for criminal proceedings, raising questions about legal channels for resolving such issues. The use of law enforcement mechanisms against international threats may imply that non-legal instruments like military force or covert actions are less important. In 1999, military force was deployed in support of international law enforcement, with U.S. armed forces conducting air strikes as part of NATO to stop violations of international law and crimes against humanity. President Clinton stated that the United States participated in Operation Allied Force to oppose crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing. The blurred lines between law enforcement and security issues have led to confusion and counterproductive actions, such as the FBI withholding information on illegal Chinese political contributions and disagreements over support for Iraqi dissident groups. The September 11, 2001 attacks led to discussions on the relationship between law enforcement and national security agencies. Inadequate information sharing among agencies was seen as a factor in the failure to prevent the attacks. The Bush Administration responded with a military attack on Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, supported by covert intelligence forces. Anti-terrorism legislation enacted in October 2001 aimed to improve information sharing between law enforcement and intelligence agencies. The aftermath of the 2001 attacks led to discussions on improving information sharing between law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Observers believe clearer distinctions are needed between law enforcement and security policy, as the relationship between the two continues to evolve towards a potential merger. This shift raises concerns about constitutional limits on domestic law enforcement and the protection of intelligence sources and methods. Congress plays a key role in overseeing intelligence cooperation with law enforcement, but the funding and oversight mechanisms may not fully support their evolving missions. Coordination between agencies lacks statutory charters, and oversight is divided among different committees with varying agendas. The oversight of intelligence and law enforcement activities abroad is divided among various committees in Congress, including the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, House International Relations Committee, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, House and Senate Armed Services Committees, and Judiciary Committees. This division makes seamless oversight challenging. The Judiciary Committees have a wide jurisdiction covering domestic issues like abortion and immigration, while the Intelligence and Armed Services Committees focus on advanced technologies and intelligence-military links. They do not usually handle foreign policy matters, which are the responsibility of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and House International Relations Committee. When law enforcement, military, diplomatic, and intelligence efforts overlap, effective congressional oversight faces significant challenges due to the different concerns of multiple committees. Possible new approaches to congressional oversight could include joint hearings or the establishment of select or joint committees. Changes in statutes affecting cooperation between law enforcement and intelligence agencies may be challenging. The Office of Homeland Security, established in 2001, involves intelligence and law enforcement agencies in developing a national strategy to secure the United States from terrorist threats. The enactment of the USA-Patriot Act in 2001 expanded authorities for intelligence and law enforcement agencies to combat terrorist activities through surveillance and information sharing. Concerns have been raised about potential misuse of intelligence methods for criminal investigations and the spread of information throughout the Intelligence Community. Congressional oversight is seen as crucial in managing the law enforcement-intelligence relationship. The lack of clarity in the relationship between U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies may hinder their effectiveness, leading to waste and duplication of effort. Observers suggest that current efforts in counternarcotics are not optimally deployed or organized, indicating a need for better coordination and organization within these agencies. The events of September 11, 2001, prompted intelligence and law enforcement agencies to improve information sharing. Congress may investigate agency relationships for potential advance warnings of attacks. Illegal activities like terrorism and narcotics smuggling pose security threats, requiring attention from these agencies. Since 9/11, intelligence and law enforcement agencies have enhanced information sharing to address security threats like terrorism and smuggling. US statutes now include extraterritorial provisions for crimes committed on American ships or planes, offenses affecting foreign commerce, and misconduct like genocide or terrorism. International law is based on treaty obligations accepted by signatories or customary international law. Violations include activities threatening U.S. security interests abroad, such as drug trafficking. Patterns of conduct established in customary international law benefit the global community. Individual states can initiate innovations in international law, but long-established conduct is recognized as prescriptive. International law addresses a wider range of criminal activities, including piracy, terrorism, and human rights violations. States, including the United States, can prescribe punishments for these crimes of universal concern. Materials that can be used in weapons of mass destruction have been the subject of international conventions. The spread of knowledge on weapons-making techniques has been facilitated by the Internet. Difficulty in reaching an international agreement on defining terrorism persists due to differing views on activities in \"wars of national liberation.\" The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 authorized the designation of terrorist organizations by the Secretary of State, with congressional review. The State Department designated around 30 organizations, mostly from the Middle East, in October 1997. Despite international support for U.S. counter-terrorist efforts post-9/11, there is still backing for groups considered terrorist by the U.S. Dealing with such organizations can have significant political costs, as some engage in terrorist activities and may be leaders of states the U.S. needs to cooperate with. The United States relies on diplomacy and pressure to encourage cooperation from other countries in halting illegal drug production and shipments, as narcotics trafficking is not universally considered an international crime. Countries are expected to suppress illegal narcotics and bring traffickers to justice, but there is no universal jurisdiction for enforcement like with other crimes such as piracy and torture. The United States relies on diplomacy and pressure to encourage cooperation from other countries in halting illegal drug production and shipments. The military effort to oust Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega in December 1989 was influenced by his involvement in illegal narcotics trafficking. Some suggest using the Intelligence Community's information gathering capabilities to combat criminal activities in foreign countries. The challenges of coordinating law enforcement agencies and the Intelligence Community in combating terrorism and narcotics trafficking in U.S. courts are significant. The national security paradigm focuses on proactive intelligence gathering and preventive actions, while the law enforcement paradigm emphasizes reactive measures. The National Security Act of 1947 established the CIA with a focus on intelligence gathering and preventive actions, excluding responsibilities for law enforcement. This division reflects the importance of distinctions between law enforcement efforts and intelligence operations. The National Security Act of 1947 established the CIA with a focus on intelligence gathering and preventive actions, excluding responsibilities for law enforcement. The Act aimed to prevent the creation of an American \"Gestapo\" and to maintain the division of labor between intelligence agencies and law enforcement, with the Department of Defense largely precluded from direct involvement in domestic law enforcement efforts. The Posse Comitatus statutes restrict military involvement in law enforcement, but DOD has legal authority to assist in counternarcotics efforts. Intelligence agencies' support for law enforcement has been criticized, especially for acquiring information on U.S. citizens. Questionable activities during the Cold War, like mail openings and monitoring antiwar groups, led to congressional investigations of the U.S. Intelligence Community in the 94th Congress. After revelations of improper activities by intelligence agencies, efforts were made to separate intelligence and law enforcement to protect citizens. Proposals for an Intelligence Community charter failed, but criticisms of domestic spying led to a recognized separation between the two communities. A 1996 House Intelligence Committee study noted behavioral changes following investigations. After the Cold War, concerns about terrorism and narcotics smuggling grew, leading to Executive Order 12333 assigning the CIA responsibilities in collecting intelligence on foreign narcotics production. Intelligence agencies were authorized to participate in law enforcement activities to combat international terrorism and narcotics activities. Intelligence agencies had to adjust their efforts post-Cold War. With the end of the Cold War, intelligence agencies downsized by a third from 1980s levels and adjusted their efforts to meet changed national security requirements. The Intelligence Community faced challenges in adapting expensive technical collection systems to the changed environment, relying more on open sources. Human collection methods had to evolve to gather information on new threats like terrorism and drug-smuggling groups. The Intelligence Community has vast data and resources that could support law enforcement efforts, especially in regions where unique intelligence contacts can provide valuable information related to criminal activities. Despite the majority of intelligence collection focusing on non-law enforcement topics, there is potential for using intelligence information to address global criminal activities. During the late 1980s, demands for closer intelligence and law enforcement cooperation intensified due to investigations of international banking scandals involving BCCI and BNL. The CIA acquired information about potential wrongdoing not readily shared with the Justice Department, leading to public consternation. Congressional committees recommended establishing procedures to ensure relevant information about international criminal activity collected by intelligence is shared effectively. The FBI responded to new expectations by increasing the number of agents abroad and launching a plan to double the number of officials in legal attach\u00e9 offices at U.S. embassies. Offices were opened in various countries, with more planned, to enhance international cooperation in combating criminal activity. The FBI's plan to expand its legal attach\u00e9 offices abroad involves assigning around 130 special agents and support staff to establish relationships with host-country officials for exchanging law enforcement information. These offices also help cultivate ties with other sources of information in host countries, crucial for detecting and investigating international crimes. Concerns have been raised about potential overlap with CIA or other intelligence officials in these countries, but efforts have been made to address these issues. Deutch initially had reservations but cooperation arrangements were made. In some countries, there is no strict separation between intelligence and law enforcement agencies, requiring careful relationship management with foreign counterparts. Complications and overlap will be addressed on a case-by-case basis, with ambassadors or chiefs of station playing a key role. Ambassadors may not always be actively involved, and officials in embassies may not always be forthcoming. Washington agencies' policies may be carried out without full disclosure. Observers note potential disagreements and competition between FBI and intelligence officials in foreign countries, despite the benefits of cooperation. A Joint Task Force on Intelligence and Law Enforcement was established in response to criticism over CIA's failure to share information about cases with the Justice Department. The task force made recommendations to improve information flow and data retrieval. The Justice Department has implemented various measures to improve information flow and data retrieval, including the creation of coordinating offices, new procedures for intelligence-file searches, requirements for law enforcement agencies to notify prosecutors of intelligence interest, protection of classified information, and an intercommunity training plan. The Justice Department has implemented measures to improve information flow and coordination between intelligence and law enforcement agencies. Deputy Assistant Attorney General Mark Richard acknowledged past issues but emphasized progress. Challenges include bureaucratic cultures, modes of operation, sources of information, and oversight structures. Solutions considered included blending services under law enforcement or intelligence rules, or coordinating activities cautiously. The Justice Department, including the FBI and DEA, conducts investigations and prosecutes criminals. Law enforcement prioritizes tactical information over strategic intelligence. Information used in trials must be disclosed to the defendant's lawyer. Agencies work on a case-by-case basis, with information revealed after trials and appeals are completed. National security policymakers require continuous information from intelligence agencies about world conditions, even after trials and appeals are completed. The need for intelligence is often more important than dealing with specific incidents, leading to the support of covert intelligence sources for years, even if publicly identified as anti-American or involved in illegal activities. Maintaining secrecy is crucial to protect these sources. The U.S. intelligence agencies rely on covert sources for crucial information, which must be kept secret to protect their effectiveness. National security policymakers value rumors and gossip as indicators of political situations that could impact U.S. interests. Coordinative mechanisms like the Intelligence-Law Enforcement Policy Board ensure the integrity of information exchanges and preserve the functions of the Intelligence Community. The Intelligence Community has established administrative policies for law enforcement-intelligence coordination. The Intelligence Authorization Act for FY 1995 established a commission to review the roles and capabilities of the Community, which concluded that while law enforcement is a powerful tool against terrorism and criminal activity, it may not always be the most appropriate response. The Aspin-Brown Commission recommended a senior-level committee of the National Security Council to coordinate law enforcement activities abroad with intelligence agencies and local U.S. ambassadors. The Aspin-Brown Commission recommended coordinating law enforcement activities abroad with intelligence agencies and local U.S. ambassadors. They argued that the Intelligence Community should be allowed to collect information overseas at the request of law enforcement agencies, as long as a U.S. person is not the target. Intelligence agencies had previously only collected information for foreign intelligence purposes, with law enforcement use as a by-product. The FY1997 Intelligence Authorization Act (P.L. 104-293) authorized elements of the Intelligence Community to collect information outside the US about non-US persons at the request of law enforcement agencies. This raised concerns about blurring the line between intelligence and law enforcement. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 allowed the use of classified information in deportation hearings for aliens entering the US, raising concerns about due process violations. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 permits the use of classified information in deportation cases, sparking debate over due process violations. Former DCI James Woolsey has contested the Immigration and Naturalization Service's use of classified materials in deporting Iraqis without sharing it with their counsel. Additionally, the National Drug Intelligence Center in Pennsylvania promotes cooperation between law enforcement and intelligence agencies in counternarcotics efforts. The National Drug Intelligence Center (NDIC) was established to provide information from both law enforcement and intelligence agencies to identify and target critical parts of drug organizations. Its mission is to coordinate and consolidate drug intelligence to assess the structure, membership, finances, and activities of drug trafficking organizations. NDIC's success in fulfilling its mission is not publicly detailed, but it continues to receive funding from Congress. The National Drug Intelligence Center (NDIC) receives annual funding of $27 million from Congress, with the Attorney General having full authority over its operations. NDIC is seen as a facility that should integrate all law enforcement and intelligence information for comprehensive analysis. Despite being managed by the Justice Department, NDIC's funding comes from intelligence authorization legislation, leading some to view it as an organizational anomaly. The FBI is responsible for counterintelligence and protecting U.S. government agencies from foreign threats. Despite longstanding arrangements with the CIA, there were limits to cooperation, as seen in the failure to identify Aldrich Ames as a spy for the Soviet Union. The Ames debacle led to the establishment of a National Counterintelligence Policy Board in 1994. In response to the Ames debacle, a National Counterintelligence Policy Board was established in 1994. President Clinton later created the National Counterintelligence Center (NACIC) to coordinate activities across agencies. However, the NACIC was criticized for lacking visibility. In 2001, Clinton signed a directive creating a National Counterintelligence Executive to address 21st-century challenges. The National Counterintelligence Executive was created in 2001 to coordinate a counterintelligence program, including strategic planning, analysis, budgeting, and information collection operations. It serves as the national coordination mechanism to issue warnings of counterintelligence threats to national security. Additionally, a Counterterrorist Center (CTC) was established within the CIA in 1986 to produce intelligence on terrorist threats. The CTC includes representatives from various intelligence agencies, law enforcement, and policy agencies. DCI Tenet has emphasized that the CTC brings together operational, analytical, and technical elements devoted to counterterrorism. The Counterterrorist Center (CTC) within the CIA has been successful in uncovering terrorist activities, such as Libya's role in the bombing of Pan Am 103 and thwarting Ramzi Yousef's attempt to blow up US airliners in 1995. The CTC has also provided counterterrorist training to allies in 50 nations, with over 18,000 individuals trained in the past decade. The exchange of information between intelligence and law enforcement agencies is considered essential for combating terrorism. The exchange of information between intelligence and law enforcement agencies is crucial for combating terrorism. Procedures have been established to transfer intelligence without compromising sources or violating constitutional rights. The extent of cooperation is uncertain, with limits set by important principles. Prosecutors must maintain a clear separation between criminal prosecutions and foreign intelligence activities to avoid the perception of circumventing criminal law protections. Coordination between law enforcement and intelligence agencies is overseen by White House-level entities like the National Security Council. Executive branch concerns are addressed by the Attorney General on behalf of the President. The Attorney General coordinates with the President on executive branch oversight of the U.S. response to transnational threats. The National Security Act of 1947 was amended in 1996 to establish a Committee on Transnational Threats within the NSC to develop strategies and enhance coordination among Federal departments and agencies in responding to transnational threats. The Attorney General is not a statutory member of the NSC to maintain separation between law enforcement and other agencies, but is involved in decision-making. The President has authority over intelligence and law enforcement efforts. The President has limited time to sort out agency responsibilities, leading to questions about the effectiveness of existing mechanisms. Philip Heymann suggests proposing a statute to settle jurisdictional issues, as uncertainty can be disruptive. The distinction between law enforcement and intelligence can create difficulties, with the Supreme Court likely to defer to the executive and legislative branches on national security matters. The FBI's reluctance to share information with NSC staff about Chinese officials' contacts with U.S. political fundraisers raised concerns in March 1997. This lack of information sharing, including with the Secretary of State, highlighted the issue of insufficient information-sharing in national security policy formulation. Samuel Berger's frustration and the common problem of inadequate information-sharing were noted, emphasizing the importance of having access to information on foreign efforts to influence U.S. policies. The FBI's lack of information sharing with NSC staff regarding Chinese officials' contacts with U.S. political fundraisers raised concerns about national security policy formulation. Critics argue that withholding important initiatives from the Secretary of State may jeopardize U.S. interests in international negotiations. The Attorney General and FBI Director criticized Saudi Arabia's cooperation in the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing. Former DCI John Deutch commented on the situation. Former FBI Director Louis Freeh faced challenges in obtaining cooperation from Saudi officials for an internal investigation. Concerns also arose about potential cyber attacks on U.S. information systems. Many are concerned about potential cyber attacks on U.S. computer systems and databases, which are crucial for government agencies and the economy. Determining the source of attacks, whether domestic or foreign, and their purpose can be complex due to separate responsibilities of law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Collaboration between both agencies may be necessary to effectively address cyber threats. The involvement of law enforcement and intelligence agencies is crucial in addressing cyber threats, but current statutory restrictions can hinder intelligence agencies' investigatory role. Presidential Decision Directives 62 and 63 emphasize the need for coordination among agencies to develop plans with the private sector to protect U.S. infrastructure. The Bush Administration placed responsibilities for infrastructure protection in the NSC Policy Coordination Committee on Counter-Terrorism and National Preparedness. PDD-63 established the National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC) within the FBI to assess threats, warn about vulnerabilities, and respond to attacks on critical infrastructure. The NIPC, staffed by law enforcement investigators and representatives from various agencies, can provide support to DOD or the Intelligence Community based on established protocols and the President's decision. The NIPC, housed in the FBI, coordinates the gathering of facts and analysis to determine appropriate responses to cyber attacks, including potential military action if necessary. The President makes the final decision based on the factual foundation provided by the NIPC. The PDD emphasized cooperation with the NIPC and the need for greater authorities to trace internet abusers, leading to the USA-Patriot Act in 2001. The Clinton and Bush Administrations established policies and structures to address critical infrastructure protection and terrorism, with a focus on private sector cooperation. Some concerns include potential obstacles in detecting and responding to computer-based attacks, as well as the lack of public accountability in classified executive branch directives. The NSC staff's flexible structure aims to address transnational threats like narcotics smuggling and terrorism by providing training and support to foreign governments. Intelligence agencies also collaborate with diplomats to bring international criminals to the United States. The NSC staff collaborates with diplomats and intelligence agencies to bring international criminals to the United States, often preferred by foreign countries to avoid political repercussions. The Department of State, Department of Justice, and Department of Defense play proactive roles in countering transnational threats through extradition or rendition. In some cases, suspects have been brought to the United States by force, such as an alleged airline hijacker in 1987 and a participant in the torture death of a DEA agent in Mexico. Panamanian General Manuel Noriega's involvement in narcotics smuggling led to indictments and a full-scale invasion of Panama in 1989 to restore legitimate leadership and bring him to trial in the U.S. In 1989, the US invaded Panama to capture Noriega, who was later convicted of drug trafficking and sentenced to 40 years in prison. The US justified the intervention based on self-defense against Noriega's forces, not solely on drug trafficking allegations. However, Noriega's drug trafficking was the underlying reason for the invasion. The forcible abductions by the US can complicate international relations and may reflect disdain for international law. Supporters argue that it is necessary in extreme cases to deal with criminals threatening US interests. They believe in fair public trials as the best means, as alternatives like diplomatic protests or economic restrictions are limited. In April 1986, President Reagan ordered air attacks on Libyan military targets in retaliation for Libyan involvement in a bomb attack on a Berlin nightclub frequented by U.S. military personnel. Libyan leader Muammar Qadhafi was not injured, but around 70 people were reportedly killed in the attacks. In response to terrorist activities, President Clinton ordered missile strikes on Iraqi military headquarters, a terrorist training complex in Afghanistan, and a chemical weapons factory in Sudan. The September 11, 2001 attacks were treated as military strikes, leading Congress to authorize the use of force against those involved. The response to terrorist activities involved extensive support from intelligence agencies and military operations. Small elite units or intelligence agents can capture suspects without large military forces. Abductions abroad do not necessarily jeopardize a fair trial. Military forces and intelligence agencies operate within indeterminate parameters. Intelligence agencies operate within international law for self-defense, allowing deniable covert actions that may contradict domestic laws but align with international law. This deniability helps the US avoid responsibility for offensive actions abroad. Covert actions are conducted outside the framework of international law and normal state-to-state relations, without the use of military force. They are based on the belief in overriding national interests that may contradict specific provisions of U.S. law. This approach is necessary due to the existence of entities that disregard U.S. interests and international norms, and the lack of global institutions with coercive power. The absence of global institutions with coercive force means the U.S. may need to take direct action to protect its interests, even if it involves covert initiatives. While such actions may be tolerated by most countries, they can undermine international law and the rule of law. Covert actions, conducted outside of international law, can lead to legal challenges and may not necessarily uphold the larger purposes of maintaining a rule of law. Covert actions, designed to punish illegal activities, can be hazardous as they involve operating outside legal norms and may result in the loss of lives of U.S. officials. These actions also undermine the premise of acting within national or international law, sending a message that the U.S. is willing to use force without taking formal responsibility. Covert actions are designed to avoid revealing the U.S.'s role in illegal activities, undermining international norms. Decision-makers must consider factors like the country's willingness to cooperate in dealing with criminals and extradition procedures. The decision to employ covert actions in dealing with transnational threats must consider factors like the country's willingness to cooperate and potential retaliation. Different criteria apply for various scenarios, with a higher threshold for actions risking lives compared to diplomatic measures. The response to transnational threats is complex, with considerations for legal standards, capturing perpetrators, and maintaining relationships with certain groups and governments. Military or covert actions may be necessary for grave threats, depending on the specifics of each situation. In response to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the Bush Administration opted for a military approach to deal with the Osama bin Laden network in Afghanistan, supported by covert intelligence units and approved by Congress. They also sought legislation to enhance law enforcement agencies' authority to acquire information on terrorist activities and detain non-U.S. persons suspected of terrorist ties. The USA-Patriot Act (P.L. 107-56) was enacted to ease restrictions on law enforcement agencies post 9/11. It allowed for the sharing of foreign intelligence information obtained from grand jury disclosures and criminal investigations, raising concerns about potential abuses and privacy violations. The Act modified the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to permit roving surveillance and other authorities to adapt to changing technologies. The USA-Patriot Act allows for the sharing of foreign intelligence information obtained from law enforcement sources to intelligence agencies, with the premise that it helps in identifying and responding to threats against U.S. interests. Concerns about potential abuse exist, but the Act aims to enable analysts to piece together information on groups plotting against the U.S. and choose appropriate responses. The response to a threat could involve diplomatic protests, military strikes, arrests, or extradition requests. The goal is for the U.S. government to have a complete picture of the threat. Post-Cold War realities challenge law enforcement and intelligence agencies. The roles and missions of intelligence and law enforcement agencies are under review, with areas of overlap and uncertainty remaining. Some argue for allowing the situation to evolve before establishing a statutory framework, while others suggest resolving ambiguities and increasing congressional oversight. The complex jurisdictional issues and oversight responsibilities should be addressed when relationships are clearer. Efforts to enforce international law and domestic laws' extraterritorial provisions are crucial in the U.S. Government's response to post-Cold War transnational threats. Decision-makers face challenges in balancing competing interests between law enforcement, defense, and intelligence agencies. Delicate decisions have traditionally been made by the executive branch. Some believe a larger role for the legislative branch is needed in making delicate decisions regarding national security threats, especially in light of the events of September 11, 2001. Congress has taken steps to improve cooperation and information exchange among intelligence and law enforcement agencies. In the aftermath of September 11, 2001, there is a call for increased collaboration between intelligence and law enforcement agencies to combat international terrorism. The destruction of the Al Qaeda network in Afghanistan is seen as just one step in addressing transnational threats, requiring ongoing cooperation between the two communities. Congressional oversight will play a crucial role in analyzing the relationship between intelligence and law enforcement efforts."
