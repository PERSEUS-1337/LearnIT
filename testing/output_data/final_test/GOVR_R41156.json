    "content": "The Supreme Court has made rulings on enemy combatants since 2004, addressing the Executive's authority to detain them under the 2001 AUMF, legality of military commissions, and detainees' access to federal courts. The Hamdi case dealt with the President's authority to detain \"enemy combatants\" under the AUMF, allowing detention of individuals captured while fighting U.S. forces in Afghanistan. The Supreme Court ruled that \"enemy combatants\" have the right to challenge their detention before a neutral decision-maker, with a focus on providing notice, opportunity to rebut, and right to counsel. The Court recognized this right for a detained U.S. citizen, allowing for tailored proceedings based on the circumstances of capture. The Supreme Court ruled that \"enemy combatants\" have the right to challenge their detention before a neutral decision-maker, possibly allowing hearsay evidence and a presumption in favor of the Government's evidence. The Padilla case involved a U.S. citizen designated as an \"enemy combatant\" and militarily detained in the U.S. for alleged involvement in an Al Qaeda plot. The Court remanded the case without deciding on the merits due to a procedural issue. The Supreme Court ruled that the President's authority under the AUMF did not extend to detaining individuals captured on American soil. The Court affirmed that detention is prohibited under the Non-Detention Act for U.S. citizens unless authorized by Congress. In Rasul v. Bush, the Court held that federal courts have jurisdiction to consider habeas corpus petitions from detainees at Guantanamo Bay. The Supreme Court affirmed that Guantanamo detainees could seek habeas review of their detention by statute, but did not address if the constitutional writ of habeas extended to noncitizens at Guantanamo. Congress tried to limit federal habeas statute reach with the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 and the Military Commissions Act of 2006. In Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, the Court reviewed military tribunals' validity for trying suspected terrorists for law of war violations. The Court had to determine the DTA's applicability before addressing the case's merits. The Hamdan Court first had to decide if the DTA stripped jurisdiction to review habeas corpus challenges for Guantanamo detainees with pending petitions. The Court ruled that the DTA did not apply to these petitions. On the merits, the majority found that the tribunals did not comply with the UCMJ or the law of war, applying the Geneva Conventions to the conflict with Al Qaeda. Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions provides baseline protections for persons captured in the conflict. The Hamdan Court found that military commissions were not \"regularly constituted\" and deviated too far from court-martial rules. The commission rules allowing the exclusion of the defendant from parts of the trial were noted as a substantial deviation. The plurality also stated that for an act to be triable under the common law of war, the precedent for it must be \"plain and unambiguous.\" The Hamdan decision found military commissions not \"regularly constituted\" and deviating from court-martial rules. Congress then enacted the MCA, limiting court jurisdiction. In Boumediene v. Bush, the Court ruled habeas applies to Guantanamo detainees based on objective factors and practical concerns. The Court in Boumediene v. Bush found that the MCA \u00a77 limiting judicial review of executive determinations of enemy combatant status was unconstitutional as it did not provide an adequate habeas substitute. The majority identified potential constitutional issues in the DTA review process, including the lack of provisions for ordering release of unlawfully held detainees and challenging indefinite detention. The Boumediene Court extended the constitutional writ of habeas to noncitizens at Guantanamo but did not specify the scope of habeas review or remedies for unlawfully held detainees. Prior to this decision, challenges under the DTA were made regarding Combatant Status Review Tribunal determinations. The government sought Supreme Court review of D.C. Circuit rulings on these matters in 2008. The government petitioned the Supreme Court to review D.C. Circuit rulings on judicial review of CSRT determinations. The Supreme Court vacated the decisions and remanded for reconsideration in light of Boumediene. The D.C. Circuit reinstated its decisions without explanation. In December 2008, the Supreme Court granted certiorari to review a Fourth Circuit ruling on petitioner al-Marri, an alien detained as an enemy combatant. The Supreme Court vacated the Fourth Circuit's ruling on al-Marri, transferring the case back to the lower court to dismiss as moot. In October 2009, the Court agreed to review the D.C. Circuit's ruling in Kiyemba v. Obama involving Guantanamo detainees. The Kiyemba petitioners, Guantanamo detainees cleared for release, were unable to be transferred due to issues with finding a foreign country for resettlement. After the Supreme Court granted certiorari, some detainees were resettled, while others were offered resettlement which some rejected. The Supreme Court vacated the appellate court's opinion and remanded the case back for further review. The Supreme Court granted certiorari for the Kiyemba petitioners, Guantanamo detainees cleared for release, but unable to be transferred. After some detainees were resettled, the Supreme Court remanded the case back to the D.C. Circuit for further review. The circuit panel reinstated its opinion with slight modifications, and the Supreme Court denied the petitioners' request for review on April 18, 2011. Justice Kagan recused herself. Justice Breyer, along with Justices Kennedy, Ginsburg, and Sotomayor, emphasized the issue of releasing unlawfully held prisoners into the United States. Breyer found no obstacle to the petitioners' release and resettlement at the time, but noted they could raise the issue again if circumstances changed. Most judicial activity on U.S. detention policy in the conflict with Al Qaeda has mainly occurred in the D.C. Circuit. After the Supreme Court's Boumediene ruling extending habeas corpus to Guantanamo detainees, over 200 petitions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Courts have differed on the Executive's detention authority, admissibility of evidence, methodology for assessing evidence, and remedies for unlawfully detained individuals. The D.C. Circuit decisions have been significant in this area. The D.C. Circuit has issued rulings favoring the government's legal positions on detainment since 2009, allowing for lawful detention of individuals associated with Al Qaeda and affiliated groups. A functional approach is used to determine if a person is \"part of\" Al Qaeda, considering their activities rather than formal membership proof. The D.C. Circuit has issued rulings supporting the government's legal positions on detainment since 2009, allowing for lawful detention of individuals linked to Al Qaeda and affiliated groups. The government can meet its evidentiary burden for a person's detention with a preponderance of evidence, and a lower standard may be acceptable. Habeas courts can assess evidence using a \"conditional probability analysis\" to determine if the government has shown grounds for detention. Hearsay evidence in habeas cases is not bound by Federal Rules of Evidence, and official government records are presumed regular in Guantanamo habeas litigation. The writ of habeas allows Guantanamo detainees to challenge transfer to foreign custody and conditions of confinement. Habeas courts cannot compel the Executive to release detainees into the US without an authorizing statute. Noncitizens transferred to foreign custody may not seek judicial review of their designation as enemy combatants. Habeas does not extend to noncitizen detainees in US-operated facilities in Afghanistan. Requests for Supreme Court review have been made in some cases. The D.C. Circuit has issued several opinions regarding the Executive's authority to detain persons in the conflict with Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces. Requests for Supreme Court review have been made by affected detainees, with some being denied. It is uncertain if the Supreme Court will review any of the D.C. Circuit's decisions. In January 2010, a three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit ruled on the government's detention authority under the AUMF in Al-Bihani v. Obama. The court recognized the President's authorization to detain individuals associated with Al Qaeda or the Taliban, including those who support these forces in hostilities against the U.S. Coalition partners. Membership in or support for these organizations can justify detention according to the panel. The court declined to explore the outer bounds of what constitutes sufficient support or indicia of membership to justify detention under the AUMF. It noted that the standard would allow the detention of a civilian contractor who materially supported an AUMF-targeted organization through essential food operations and carrying of arms. The panel rejected the idea that international law of war has relevance to the courts' interpretation of the detention power conferred by the AUMF. In habeas cases involving wartime detainees, courts are not required to follow the same procedures as in traditional criminal law. The court found that in the context of military detention of enemy belligerents, the government only needs to provide a \"preponderance of evidence\" to justify detention. The court emphasized that habeas procedures in this context are a new branch of law and not mere extensions of existing doctrine. The court established a hearsay rule for detainee habeas cases, emphasizing that the probative weight of hearsay should be considered, not its admissibility. The D.C. Circuit denied a petition for an en banc rehearing of the Al-Bihani case, with a concurring opinion labeling certain aspects of the decision as non-binding dicta. The court did not address whether parts of the Al-Bihani ruling on detaining individuals linked to Al Qaeda or the Taliban were non-binding dicta. Circuit court decisions post-Al-Bihani have interpreted the AUMF as allowing the Executive to detain those affiliated with targeted organizations or providing support. The 2012 NDAA explicitly permits detention of individuals who have supported these groups engaged in hostilities against the US or its allies. In Guantanamo detainee cases post-Al-Bihani, the Obama Administration has not solely justified detention based on support provided by a detainee. The Supreme Court denied a petition to review the Al-Bihani decision, which focused on detainees being considered part of Al Qaeda or the Taliban at the time of capture. In Al-Adahi, the D.C. Circuit endorsed the use of \"conditional probability analysis\" by habeas courts to assess evidence for lawful detention under the AUMF. The D.C. Circuit panel reviewed a habeas petition by a Guantanamo detainee claimed to be part of Al Qaeda. The panel questioned the constitutional requirement of proving lawful detention under the AUMF by a preponderance of evidence. It criticized the district court's handling of evidence and application of the standard, finding errors in the analysis. The D.C. Circuit panel criticized the lower court for separately assessing the sufficiency of each piece of evidence in a Guantanamo detainee's habeas petition, stating that false exculpatory statements can be strong evidence of guilt. They emphasized the use of conditional probability analysis to evaluate the cumulative weight of evidence for detention under the AUMF. The Al-Adahi panel emphasized the use of conditional probability analysis to assess the evidence in Guantanamo detainee cases, highlighting that some events are dependent, making the occurrence of one event more or less likely based on the occurrence of another. This analysis helps in evaluating the cumulative weight of evidence for detention under the AUMF. Conditional probability analysis is crucial in evaluating evidence in Guantanamo detainee cases. The government's argument is that overlooking conditional probability can lead to errors in judgment, as seen in the case of Al-Adahi where key facts were dismissed because they did not directly prove his ties to al-Qaida. The government successfully proved the petitioner's ties to Al Qaeda through various pieces of evidence, including his stay at an Al Qaeda guesthouse and receiving orders from Al Qaeda members at a weapons training camp. The district court's analysis was flawed as it did not consider all evidence collectively, leading to an incorrect judgment. The Supreme Court denied a petition to review the denial of habeas relief to a Guantanamo detainee with ties to Al Qaeda, based on evidence of his training at a weapons camp and receiving orders from Al Qaeda members. The circuit panel reaffirmed the use of conditional probability analysis to assess evidentiary challenges in the denial of habeas relief to a Guantanamo detainee with ties to Al Qaeda. They found the proffered evidence, including Al Qaeda documents and hearsay statements, to be sufficiently reliable. The circuit panel upheld the reliability of the evidence presented in the case of a Guantanamo detainee with ties to Al Qaeda. They rejected legal challenges regarding the standard of evidence required for detainment and the need for a specific finding of threat if released. The circuit panel upheld the reliability of evidence in the case of a Guantanamo detainee with ties to Al Qaeda, rejecting challenges on detainment standards and the need for a specific threat finding if released. The panel determined that joining Al Qaeda fighters behind a barricade was sufficient grounds to be considered \"part of\" Al Qaeda, without requiring proof of being part of the \"command structure.\" The Supreme Court denied a petition to review the Awad decision regarding a detainee at Guantanamo with ties to Al Qaeda. A three-judge panel upheld the denial of a habeas petition challenging the detainment procedures and evidence sufficiency. The panel rejected the argument that the government needed \"clear and convincing evidence\" to support the legality of the detainee's detention. The panel upheld the denial of a habeas petition challenging detainment procedures and evidence sufficiency, rejecting the argument for \"clear and convincing evidence\" to support legality of detention. The court allowed admission of reliable hearsay evidence in considering the petition. The court upheld the denial of a habeas petition challenging detainment procedures and evidence sufficiency, allowing reliable hearsay evidence to be considered. The court found that the government's evidence suggested individuals used specific travel routes for jihad purposes, supporting the detainment decision. The Supreme Court denied a petition to review the Al-Odah decision, which has been relied upon by the D.C. Circuit in other cases. One case involved an Algerian citizen denied habeas relief after being arrested in 2001 and transferred to Guantanamo for intending to fight U.S. forces in Afghanistan. The government argued it had legal authority to detain him under the AUMF and the President's \"inherent authority.\" The detainee was held under the AUMF and the President's authority for alleged ties to Al Qaeda. A district court denied the detainee's habeas petition in 2008, finding grounds for detention for supporting Al Qaeda. On appeal, the government changed its argument to detain the petitioner for being part of the organization. The detainee was held under the AUMF and the President's authority for alleged ties to Al Qaeda. The government relied on the AUMF to justify detention, rather than independent authority. The circuit panel reversed the lower court's decision, stating that evidence was insufficient to prove the detainee was \"part of\" Al Qaeda. The D.C. Circuit clarified that the AUMF authorizes the Executive to detain individuals associated with Al Qaeda. The AUMF authorizes the Executive to detain individuals who are functionally part of Al Qaeda. The organizational structure of Al Qaeda is unknown, so determination of being \"part of\" the organization is case-by-case based on actions. Evidence of operating within Al Qaeda's command structure is sufficient, but independent conduct of a freelancer is not enough to be deemed part of Al Qaeda. The case involved a Guantanamo detainee captured in 2001 in Mauritania, where the government alleged he was \"part of\" Al Qaeda based on activities from years before 9/11. The petitioner claimed to have severed ties with Al Qaeda in the early 1990s. The detainee captured in Mauritania in 2001 claimed to have severed ties with Al Qaeda in the early 1990s. The district court ruled that the government failed to prove his current affiliation with Al Qaeda, leading to his release. On appeal, a three-judge panel questioned the lower court's approach, citing previous cases as precedent. The detainee captured in Mauritania in 2001 claimed to have severed ties with Al Qaeda in the early 1990s. A panel recognized that membership in Al Qaeda could be demonstrated through activities showing functional involvement. In cases where combat activities against the US were not involved, the government's failure to prove orders from Al Qaeda could be relevant. The panel declined to direct denial of the habeas petition, opting to remand the case for further proceedings consistent with established jurisprudence. The panel remanded the case to the lower court for further factual findings, emphasizing the need to consider assorted evidence collectively in habeas petitions by Guantanamo detainees. The lower court lacked guidance from subsequent circuit jurisprudence and did not make definitive findings on key facts regarding the petitioner's ties to Al Qaeda. The appellate court suggested that the lower court's consideration of evidence in the petitioner's case may have been too fragmented. It emphasized the importance of assessing the petitioner's connections to Al Qaeda collectively, including his oath and sporadic support. The court did not address the government's argument regarding the petitioner's oath in the early 1990s. The appellate court reversed a district court decision granting habeas relief to a Yemeni national captured in Afghanistan and detained by U.S. forces since December 2001. The court did not address the government's argument about the petitioner's oath to Al Qaeda in the early 1990s. The D.C. Circuit recognized that determining if a person was \"part of\" Al Qaeda required a case-by-case assessment of their actions. The Uthman decision clarified the type of evidence needed to support detention under the AUMF, citing Uthman's alleged activities with Al Qaeda. Despite contested claims, the court found sufficient uncontested facts to show Uthman's likely affiliation with Al Qaeda. The Uthman decision provided evidence showing his likely affiliation with Al Qaeda, including being captured near Tora Bora with Al Qaeda members, studying at a known recruiting ground, and giving a false explanation for his travel to Afghanistan. The Uthman decision supported the government's claims of his involvement with Al Qaeda based on various findings, leading to the conclusion that he was likely part of the group. The Supreme Court chose not to review the decision. In Al-Madhwani, a habeas petition by a Guantanamo detainee was dismissed due to insufficient evidence under the AUMF. The petitioner in Al-Madhwani challenged his detention under the AUMF, alleging procedural errors and coercion leading to tainted evidence. The circuit panel upheld the denial of habeas, citing sufficient untainted evidence supporting the district court's decision. The panel upheld the government's evidence that Al-Madhwani was \"part of\" Al Qaeda, based on his admissions of staying at an Al Qaeda-affiliated guest house and military training camp, carrying a rifle, suspicious travel, and final capture with known Al Qaeda operatives. The panel also rejected legal and evidentiary arguments made by Al-Madhwani. The D.C. Circuit rejected arguments regarding hearsay evidence in wartime detention cases. The Supreme Court declined to review the case. In Almerfedi, a district court granted habeas relief to a Guantanamo detainee accused of being an Al Qaeda facilitator. The government's claim was based on admissions by Almerfedi and another detainee, but the district court found the evidence insufficient. The circuit panel reversed and remanded the decision. The circuit panel reversed the district court's decision to grant habeas relief to a Guantanamo detainee accused of being an Al Qaeda facilitator, deeming the evidence unreliable. The ruling did not establish new legal standards but suggested the government's evidence was not as compelling as in previous cases, indicating the minimum evidence required for lawful detention. Almerfedi, a suspected Al Qaeda facilitator, traveled from Yemen to Pakistan in 2001 and stayed at a Jama'at Tablighi headquarters linked to Al Qaeda. He then went to Iran, where he was arrested with cash and allegedly stayed at an Al Qaeda guest house in Tehran. Other detainees claimed he was a facilitator named \"Hussain al-Aden.\" Almerfedi denied being Hussain al-Adeni, stating he never stayed at an Al Qaeda guesthouse or served as a facilitator. He left Yemen for Europe, traveled to Pakistan for a visa, stayed with Jama'at Tablighi for travel discounts, and attempted to be smuggled into Europe through Iran. The circuit court concluded that Almerfedi's stay at Jama'at Tablighi headquarters, combined with his suspicious travel route and possession of unexplained cash, provided sufficient grounds to detain him as an Al Qaeda facilitator. The circuit court found that Almerfedi's stay at Jama'at Tablighi headquarters, suspicious travel route, and possession of unexplained cash justified his detention as an Al Qaeda facilitator. The government's case against Almerfedi was strengthened by the circuit panel's view that his explanation of activities was unconvincing, and the lower court erred in not considering false exculpatory statements as evidence. Additionally, the lower court was criticized for dismissing al-Jadani's statements as unreliable \"jail house gossip.\" The circuit panel believed that al-Jadani's timing confusions were inconsequential as the correct date of Almerfedi's capture had been given in some reports of al-Jadani's interrogations. Al-Jadani's reliability was established through a classified government declaration, and the panel criticized the district court for not assessing al-Jadani's recounting of conversations with unnamed detainees implicating Almerfedi. The capture of \"Hussain al-Aden\" by Iranian authorities led to his transfer to Afghan and then U.S. custody. The panel confirmed that Hussain Almerfedi and Hussain al-Adeni are the same person, supporting the credibility of al-Jadani and detainees who identified Almerfedi as an Al Qaeda facilitator. Judge Judith W. Rogers agreed that the government met the evidentiary burden for Almerfedi's detention but disagreed with the analysis of al-Jadani's recorded statements. The district court's determination of al-Jadani's unreliability could only be reversed for clear error. The Supreme Court declined to review the circuit court's decision regarding Al Alwi's detention based on his admissions during interrogation. The circuit panel found that corroboration of hearsay statements is useful for reliability but not necessary for statements made by the petitioner himself. Al Alwi admitted to traveling to Afghanistan to join the fight against the Northern Alliance, staying in guesthouses associated with enemy forces, receiving military training, participating in hostilities, and being part of a unit bombed by U.S. forces in late 2001. The appellate court found Al Alwi's statements during interrogation to be reliable, as they were consistent and not coerced. The corroboration rule applicable in criminal trials was deemed irrelevant in habeas proceedings, where other indicators of reliability could satisfy the requirement. The government also provided evidence connecting Al Alwi's admissions to the events mentioned. The appellate court upheld the petitioner's detention, stating there was sufficient evidence to establish his connection to the Taliban or Al Qaeda. Al Alwi's argument that he must have \"substantially supported\" these entities was rejected. The court found enough facts to determine his affiliation without remanding the case. The circuit panel upheld the petitioner's detention, finding sufficient evidence of his connection to the Taliban or Al Qaeda. The court rejected his argument that he must have \"substantially supported\" these entities and determined his affiliation without remanding the case for further fact-finding. Additionally, the court rejected the petitioner's claim that the district court's denial of his request for a 30-day continuance was an abuse of discretion, stating that he failed to demonstrate actual prejudice from the denial. The three-judge circuit panel reviewed a district court ruling granting the habeas petition of a Guantanamo detainee. The government failed to prove the detainee's connection to the Taliban, leading to a 2-1 decision to vacate the ruling and remand the case for further proceedings. The Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal of the case. The panel's decision focused on classified government intelligence documents supporting allegations against Latif. The majority found the district court erred by not giving a \"presumption of regularity\" to the documents. Judge Brown explained this presumption as assuming public officers properly discharged their duties unless proven otherwise. Brown distinguished between a presumption of regularity and a presumption of truthfulness regarding government intelligence documents. The confusion arises from the involvement of two actors - the non-government source and the government official summarizing the source's statement. The presumption of regularity applies to the government official accurately identifying and summarizing the source's statement, but does not imply the truth of the source's statement. This distinction is important as a government document may accurately record an incredible statement for various reasons, such as the source lying or being coerced. The majority upheld the presumption of regularity for intelligence documents, citing separation of powers principles and deference to executive branch expertise. They found that the government's record should be treated as accurate unless rebutted, but it does not establish the truth of the information offered. The panel also referenced prior D.C. Circuit rulings supporting their decision. The panel majority upheld the presumption of regularity for intelligence documents, citing separation of powers principles and deference to executive branch expertise. They found that Latif failed to rebut the government's evidence with more convincing evidence of his own, and the district court had not properly considered relevant evidence in assessing Latif's credibility. The case was remanded back to the district court for further consideration. The panel remanded the case back to the district court for further consideration of the evidence. Judge Henderson concurred with the decision but argued against the need for remand, suggesting a reversal instead. Judge Tatel dissented, arguing for a deferential clear error standard of review and disputing the application of a presumption of regularity to government intelligence documents in habeas cases. Tatel argued against applying a presumption of regularity to intelligence documents in habeas cases, expressing concerns about blindly accepting government claims. The Supreme Court declined to review the Latif decision. Al Warafi denied Taliban affiliation, asserting protection as medical personnel under the Geneva Conventions. The Army Regulation implements Geneva Conventions provisions for detaining \"retained personnel,\" including medical personnel. Despite restrictions on invoking Geneva Conventions in habeas proceedings, a detainee can still invoke the Regulation. However, the detainee failed to prove his status as a medic due to lack of required identification. The circuit court agreed with the lower court's decision. The circuit court affirmed that the detainee, Al Warafi, was not entitled to special protections under Article 24 as he failed to provide the required means of identification as a medic. Despite claiming he was not involved in hostilities or part of the Taliban or Al Qaeda command structure, the court found him to be associated with these groups. The D.C. Circuit upheld the lower court's decision, citing the petitioner's unconvincing explanations for his actions. The petitioner's explanations were deemed unpersuasive in supporting his claim of not being a member of the Taliban or Al Qaeda, leading to his lawful detention under the AUMF. The evidence presented did not meet the preponderance of the evidence standard, according to Senior Circuit Judge Edwards. The Supreme Court declined to review the decision, with Justice Breyer indicating a potential different vote if the petitioner had raised specific claims. The D.C. Circuit has considered cases involving Guantanamo detainees challenging their transfer to foreign countries due to fear of torture or unlawful detention. They have also addressed the issue of detainees challenging their unlawful detention when they cannot be resettled due to legal or practical obstacles. The D.C. Circuit has addressed cases of Guantanamo detainees challenging their transfer to foreign countries to avoid torture or unlawful detention. In one case, detainees ordered for release into the U.S. due to no longer being enemy combatants faced obstacles returning to China. The D.C. Circuit panel stayed the release order pending review and later reversed the decision in Kiyemba v. Obama. In February 2009, the majority ruled that Guantanamo detainees can challenge their detention but cannot be transferred to the U.S. without an authorizing statute. The decision was based on the political branches' authority over immigration and the lack of Due Process protection for non-citizen detainees. The Supreme Court later reviewed the Kiyemba ruling. In response to the Kiyemba ruling, the Supreme Court vacated the appellate court's opinion and remanded the case after several countries agreed to resettle the petitioners. The D.C. Circuit panel reinstated its opinion in May 2010, known as \"Kiyemba III,\" considering subsequent congressional enactments. The Supreme Court declined to review Kiyemba III. Another case, \"Kiyemba II,\" involved habeas petitions by detainees no longer considered enemy combatants seeking to prevent transfer to countries where they may face further challenges. The Kiyemba II panel rejected the government's argument that the MCA stripped the court of jurisdiction to hear claims related to the petitioners' proposed transfer. The panel interpreted Boumediene as invalidating the MCA's court-stripping provisions with respect to all habeas claims brought by Guantanamo detainees. However, the panel held that an executive branch determination that a detainee will not be tortured if transferred to a particular country is binding on the court. The circuit panel also reversed a district court ruling that required the government to provide 30 days' notice to detainees' counsel before any proposed transfer. The Supreme Court denied a petition to review the appellate court's ruling on detainees' ability to challenge their transfer from Guantanamo. The Kiyemba II decision limited detainees' rights to challenge the Executive's determination of transfer and receive advance notice. Former Guantanamo detainees sought to challenge their designation as \"enemy combatants\" after being transferred to foreign government custody. The lower court dismissed their habeas petitions as moot, leading to an appeal to the D.C. Circuit. The D.C. Circuit upheld the dismissal of former detainees' habeas petitions, ruling that the collateral consequences they suffered did not give the court jurisdiction. The petitioners claimed their enemy combatant designation led to travel restrictions in foreign countries, but the court found this was not an injury redressible by the court. The court upheld the dismissal of former detainees' habeas petitions, stating that their enemy combatant designation did not warrant court jurisdiction. The petitioners' claim of travel restrictions due to their designation was deemed not redressible by the court. The court dismissed former detainees' habeas petitions, stating their enemy combatant designation did not warrant court jurisdiction. The petitioners' claim of travel restrictions was not redressible. The Supreme Court declined to review the case, and the D.C. Circuit has issued opinions on various issues related to U.S. detention policy. In June 2008, the D.C. Circuit ruled in Parhat v. Gates that the petitioner was wrongly labeled an \"enemy combatant\" by a CSRT. The decision highlighted the need for government evidence to be reliable for court assessment. The petitioner in Parhat, an ethnic Chinese Uighur captured in Pakistan in December 2001, was found by a CSRT to be subject to detention due to his affiliation with a Uighur independence group called the East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM), allegedly associated with Al Qaeda and the Taliban. However, the court found the evidence presented by the government insufficient to support this claim, leading to the conclusion that Parhat was not an enemy combatant. The court found that the documents on ETIM activities and its ties to Al Qaeda and the Taliban lacked underlying reporting and reliability assessments. Therefore, the CSRT's designation of Parhat as an enemy combatant was deemed improper. The circuit court emphasized the need for evidence presented in a form that allows for assessment. The Parhat panel denied a government motion to protect nonclassified information labeled \"law enforcement sensitive\" from public disclosure, citing a lack of specific rationale for withholding the information. The case concerned the availability of DTA review procedures for non-citizen detainees at Guantanamo following the Supreme Court's ruling in Boumediene v. Bush. The D.C. Circuit reinstated rulings on the scope of judicial review of CSRT determinations, but the government argued that Boumediene nullified the DTA review system. The D.C. Circuit granted a rehearing on the government's motion. In Bismullah v. Gates, a three-judge panel held that the D.C. Circuit no longer had jurisdiction over petitions for review filed under the DTA due to the Supreme Court's ruling in Boumediene. Four British nationals sued the Secretary of Defense and military officers for damages related to their treatment at Guantanamo, but their Bivens claims were dismissed based on qualified immunity. The D.C. Circuit affirmed that aliens held at Guantanamo have no rights under the U.S. Constitution, citing qualified immunity under Bivens and national security concerns as reasons for dismissing claims for damages. The circuit court did not address whether Boumediene's holding invalidating Section 7 of the MCA encompassed only the portion that stripped courts of jurisdiction over habeas claims. The D.C. Circuit later extended the holding to preclude lawsuits by former detainees for their treatment after being declared no longer enemy combatants. This case concerned the application of the constitutional writ of habeas corpus to non-citizens detained by the United States in Afghanistan. In 2009, a federal district court ruled that the constitutional writ of habeas may extend to non-Afghan detainees held in a U.S.-operated facility in Bagram, Afghanistan, when those detainees had been captured outside of Afghanistan but were transferred to Bagram for long-term detention as enemy combatants. The D.C. Circuit later reversed this decision, stating that the constitutional writ of habeas did not extend to non-citizens detained in the Afghan theater of war. The Boumediene case analyzed the extraterritorial application of the writ of habeas, considering factors such as detainee citizenship, site of detention, and practical obstacles. The circuit panel found that while the status determination process in Afghanistan favored extending the writ to petitioners, the other factors weighed against extending habeas to non-citizens held at Bagram due to the level of U.S. control over the facility. The circuit panel found that U.S. control over Bagram was more limited than Guantanamo, with practical obstacles in resolving habeas claims due to detainees being in an active war zone. Extending constitutional protections to Bagram detainees could disrupt the U.S.-Afghan relationship. The Maqaleh panel suggested that habeas might apply if detainees were transferred to evade judicial review. The Maqaleh petitioners sought a rehearing of their habeas claims based on new evidence. The district court allowed them to amend their complaint, but ultimately dismissed their case. The D.C. Circuit denied their appeal, stating that circumstances in Afghanistan had not changed enough to warrant a revisiting of the decision. The court rejected creating a new factor for determining Suspension Clause application. The petitioners were arrested in Asia before being transferred to another Asian country, which did not raise constitutional concerns. In Al-Zahrani, a civil suit against federal officials was dismissed under the MCA, stripping federal courts of jurisdiction over non-habeas claims. The MCA stripped federal courts of jurisdiction over non-habeas claims brought against the government concerning the detention of aliens designated as \"enemy combatants.\" The Al-Zahrani panel upheld the MCA's jurisdictional bar over non-habeas claims, stating that seeking money damages for constitutional rights violations is not constitutionally required. Appellant al Janko's civil lawsuit for damages was dismissed based on similar reasoning. Appellant al Janko, who was wrongfully detained at Guantanamo for seven years, sued the United States and officials for mistreatment. The district court dismissed his claims citing the MCA provision. Despite being ordered released by a district court, the D.C. Circuit affirmed the dismissal, stating he was properly detained as an enemy combatant. The D.C. Circuit affirmed the dismissal of al Janko's claims, stating he was lawfully detained as an enemy combatant despite a district court ordering his release. The court agreed with petitioners challenging the government's plan to condition detainees' access to counsel on an MOU. The court ruled that the Protective Order governing Guantanamo detainee habeas cases should continue even after a detainee's case is terminated. The government's view that the Protective Order expired was challenged by attorneys for the detainees, who argued for continued privileged access to their clients. The court noted critical differences between the Protective Order and the MOU, particularly that the MOU gave military authorities sole discretion over counsel visits, with no role for the courts in disputes. The court ruled that the Protective Order for Guantanamo detainee cases would remain in effect even after a case is closed. Disputes under the MOU would be decided by the Commander of Joint Task Force-Guantanamo Bay. The MOU did not presume a \"need to know\" for attorneys, unlike the Protective Order. Attorneys had to justify access to their work product, which could lead to delays. The court expressed concerns about the government's new counsel-access provisions, questioning the need to replace the smoothly functioning Protective Order for Guantanamo detainee cases. The court warned against allowing the Executive to create its own rules, which could infringe on individual liberties. The court reinstated the Protective Order for Guantanamo detainees, allowing involuntary enteral feeding for hunger strikers. Petitioners argued against the procedure, claiming a constitutional right to refuse medical treatment. District court judges initially dismissed the petitions for lack of jurisdiction. The D.C. Circuit reversed the decision on force-feeding Guantanamo detainees, stating that the habeas corpus statute allows challenges to conditions of confinement. Congress could have restricted Guantanamo habeas petitions post-Boumediene, but it was deemed unnecessary to decide. The D.C. Circuit reversed a decision on force-feeding Guantanamo detainees, stating that challenges to conditions of confinement are allowed under the habeas corpus statute. Congress could have restricted Guantanamo habeas petitions post-Boumediene, but it was deemed unnecessary to decide. The majority found itself bound by circuit precedent to accord jurisdiction, while Senior Circuit Judge Williams dissented, arguing for restrictions on legal challenges by detainees. The circuit court denied petitioners' motion for a preliminary injunction, stating that force-feeding could further the government's legitimate interest in preserving lives in custody. The detainees challenged a change in the Guantanamo detention facility visitation policy, alleging that it impedes their access to counsel and conflicts with their religious beliefs. The new policy includes more intrusive search procedures and requires detainees to travel to a separate part of the camp, causing hardship due to their weakened physical state from a hunger strike. They will have the opportunity to demonstrate to the lower court that the government's interests can be achieved through alternative measures. The D.C. Circuit reversed the district court's order to reverse the policy change at Guantanamo, citing deference to the military's security needs. The appellate court applied the Turner v. Safley framework, treating the challenge as ordinary habeas cases in prison settings. The D.C. Circuit applied the Turner v. Safley framework to determine the constitutionality of prison regulations at Guantanamo, focusing on factors such as the connection between the regulation and governmental interest, alternative means for inmates, impact on guards and resources, and the absence of alternatives. The D.C. Circuit applied the Turner v. Safley framework to assess the constitutionality of a new prison policy at Guantanamo. The court found the policy reasonable in addressing contraband issues and managing security efficiently. Detainees could communicate with counsel by mail if unwilling to undergo searches, balancing their desires with security concerns. The detainees' proposed alternative of reverting to the previous policy was deemed inadequate by prison administrators. The detainees' suggestion to return to the previous policy was rejected by prison administrators as inadequate. Judicial activity on U.S. detention policy has mainly been in the D.C. Circuit, with a few cases in the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals involving military detention of individuals as unlawful enemy combatants. These cases resulted in the individuals being transferred to civilian custody and convicted of terrorism-related activities. The circuit court's analysis of Executive detention authority may influence future judicial rulings. After the Supreme Court vacated a ruling in his favor, Jose Padilla filed a new petition in the District Court for the District of South Carolina. The court granted Padilla's motion for release from military detention, suggesting civilian custody if charged with a crime. Padilla's attorneys argued based on dissenting Supreme Court Justices' opinion and the Non-Detention Act. The government contended Padilla's detention was authorized under the AUMF. The Hamdi decision interpreted the AUMF as authorizing Jose Padilla's detention for attending an Al Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan. The court found Padilla's detention barred by 18 U.S.C. \u00a74001(a) and disagreed with the President's inherent authority as Commander-in-Chief. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, allowing Padilla's detention under the AUMF for being \"'armed and present in a combat zone' in Afghanistan.\" The Supreme Court granted the government permission to transfer Padilla from military custody to a federal prison for civilian trial. Padilla was found guilty and sentenced to 17 years and three months' imprisonment. In al-Marri, the Fourth Circuit considered whether the AUMF permits the detention of a resident alien alleged to have supported Al Qaeda within the United States. The Fourth Circuit considered whether the AUMF permits the detention of a resident alien alleged to have supported Al Qaeda within the United States. Four judges believed al-Marri did not fit the legal category of \"enemy combatant\" and should be charged with a crime or deported. A plurality found that the President has the power to detain individuals entering the US as \"sleeper agents\" for Al Qaeda. The case was remanded for further evidence consideration. The en banc panel remanded the case to the district court to determine if al-Marri was a sleeper agent and discussed the evidentiary burden required to detain him as an enemy combatant. Judge Traxler's opinion criticized the lower court for applying relaxed evidentiary standards and emphasized the need for individualized procedures in such cases. The government relaxed procedural safeguards for national security interests in the case of al-Marri, leading to uncertainty about the AUMF's applicability to persons captured in the US. Al-Marri pled guilty to supporting terrorists and was sentenced to eight and a half years in prison. This 2012 decision involved a civil suit by Jose Padilla and his mother against government officials over Padilla's military detention as an enemy combatant. The petitioners challenged Padilla's military detention as an enemy combatant, seeking a declaration of unconstitutionality, an injunction against future designations, and nominal damages. The district court and a circuit panel dismissed the suit, citing judicial hesitation to imply a cause of action for constitutional violations by federal officials in military detention cases. The panel emphasized the political branches' authority over military affairs, limiting judicial involvement to avoid straying from traditional judicial competence. The panel dismissed Padilla's Bivens claims, citing judicial hesitation to imply a cause of action for constitutional violations in military detention cases. They found that the judiciary was ill-equipped to administer a Bivens remedy in this case, as it could interfere with military operations and chain of command. Padilla had ample opportunities to challenge his detention in prior habeas litigation, and alternative avenues for protecting his interests were available. Additionally, Padilla brought action under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act for alleged burdens to his free exercise of religion caused by his military detention. The panel upheld the lower court's ruling that Padilla lacked standing to seek an order enjoining the government from designating him as an enemy combatant in the future, citing no real and immediate risk of harm. They found strong reasons to believe that RFRA did not apply to enemy combatants and recognized an immunity defense due to the unsettled area of law. The Supreme Court declined to review the case of Padilla, who is serving a long-term prison sentence for terrorist activities. The plaintiffs in Hedges v. Obama were able to obtain a preliminary injunction against Section 1021(b)(2) of the 2012 NDAA, which allows detention of individuals associated with terrorist groups. The Hedges plaintiffs, activists and journalists, sued the government over Section 1021 of the 2012 NDAA, arguing it caused them to change their behavior to avoid military detention without trial. The Obama Administration claimed the provision was not new but reaffirmed existing detention authority. The court rejected this argument, stating that Section 1021 did change the law regarding detention. The court rejected the Obama Administration's claim that Section 1021 of the 2012 NDAA reaffirmed existing detention authority, stating that it changed the law regarding detention. The court noted differences in language between the statutes, making the NDAA language seem broader and too vague to satisfy the Fifth Amendment's requirement for adequate notice. The court clarified that a preliminary injunction would not burden the government, but the U.S. Court of Appeals later reversed the decision, stating that both citizen and non-citizen plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the NDAA provision. The court clarified that the NDAA provision does not affect the lawful detention of U.S. citizens under the AUMF. It found the provision relevant for non-citizens outside the U.S., but ruled that the plaintiffs failed to show a reason to fear military detention. The court saw Section 1021 of the 2012 NDAA as clear and clarified that it added criteria for how the AUMF applies to organizations involved in the 9/11 attacks. The court explained that this clarification resolved previous debates on the Administration's detention authority. The court clarified that the NDAA provision does not affect the lawful detention of U.S. citizens under the AUMF. It found the provision relevant for non-citizens outside the U.S., but ruled that the plaintiffs failed to show a reason to fear military detention. The court further clarified why Sections 1021(d) and 1021(e) are not duplicative. Section 1021(d) states that the provision does not expand or limit the President's authority to detain under the AUMF, while Section 1021(e) disclaims any statement about existing authority. The Supreme Court declined to review the case involving two U.S. citizens detained in Iraq as \"security internees\" after being accused of illicit arms sales. The plaintiffs, who were detained without charge for reporting suspicious activity, sued Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld for mistreatment. The district court denied Rumsfeld's motion to dismiss, leading to appeals. The United States also appealed based on the Administrative Procedure Act, but an appellate panel reversed the decision. The appellate panel reversed the decision regarding the U.S. claim and affirmed it for Secretary Rumsfeld. Rehearing en banc was granted, and both decisions were set aside. The full circuit court agreed that there was no right of action against the United States for activities in Iraq. The majority declined to create a right of action for damages against soldiers who mistreat military prisoners or fail to prevent improper detention and interrogation. The majority declined to permit a new Bivens action, citing potential national security risks and lack of statutory authority to interfere with the military chain of command. They found that even if constitutional rights were violated, creating a right of action would not extend liability to high-ranking officials. Three judges dissented, arguing that the majority's decision created absolute immunity for members of the military. The majority declined to allow a new Bivens action, citing national security risks and lack of statutory authority to interfere with the military chain of command. Three judges dissented, arguing that the majority's decision created absolute immunity for military members, even in cases involving torture of civilians. Notable criminal cases discussed include Zacharias Moussaoui's role in the 9/11 attacks, John Walker Lindh's activities in Afghanistan, and Ahmed's involvement in terrorist activities. The curr_chunk discusses various high-profile terrorism cases, including Zacharias Moussaoui's connection to the 9/11 attacks, Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani's trial in civilian court for the 1998 African Embassy bombings, and appeals of military commission convictions. Ghailani is the only Guantanamo prisoner transferred for civilian trial in the US. In 2001, Moussaoui was charged in connection with the 9/11 attacks. Special Administrative Measures (SAMs) were imposed to restrict his communication with other terrorists. He had limited access to classified information for his defense. Moussaoui was permitted to defend himself without counsel, but the judge appointed standby counsel. Despite refusing to cooperate with his lawyers, motions were filed on his behalf. He attempted to plead guilty in July 2002 but was unwilling to admit necessary facts. Moussaoui attempted to plead guilty in July 2002 but withdrew the plea. He sought access to overseas individuals to testify that he was not involved in the September 11 attacks. The government believed he was the intended \"20th hijacker\" and his refusal to provide information contributed to the attacks. The government offered redacted summaries of reports based on interrogations of enemy combatant witnesses, but the judge rejected them to protect Moussaoui's Sixth Amendment rights. The Court of Appeals affirmed that enemy combatants could provide testimony through judicial process, but reversed the order for depositions and sanctions for the government's non-compliance. The appellate court reversed the order for depositions and sanctions imposed on the government for non-compliance. It held that substitutions for depositions could be prepared to provide a defense, remanding the case to the district court for collaboration on preparing substitutions. The court emphasized the reliability of intelligence reports and the need for jury instructions to assess evidence. Moussaoui's pro se privilege was revoked by the district court. The district court revoked Moussaoui's pro se privilege due to improper filings containing threats, political statements, and insulting language. Despite warnings, he pleaded guilty to avoid the death penalty after the Supreme Court denied certiorari. Moussaoui understood the consequences of his guilty plea forfeiting his right to appeal violations of his constitutional rights. Moussaoui admitted to government allegations, signed guilty plea statement, and was sentenced to life in prison. He later filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea, claiming a flawed understanding of the legal system. Moussaoui filed a motion for a new trial, claiming the American legal system was flawed and he could receive a fair trial. He appealed the court's denial, arguing his guilty plea was not voluntary and he lacked access to classified information contradicting the government's theory. The circuit court affirmed his guilty plea was entered knowingly and his objections to constitutional claims were waived. The circuit court affirmed Moussaoui's guilty plea was entered knowingly, and his objections to constitutional claims were waived. The court reviewed his access to classified information, noting that adequate substitutions under CIPA would have protected his rights if the process had not been cut short by the guilty plea. Additionally, the court rejected Moussaoui's contention of plain error in the jury's sentencing options. Moussaoui faced the death penalty or life imprisonment without parole, challenging the jury's sentencing options. John Walker Lindh, a U.S. citizen, argued for combatant immunity as part of the Taliban but was denied by the court. Lindh also failed to avoid government charges. The court rejected Lindh's defense and issued a protective order to restrict certain information from the government's reports on detainee interviews at Guantanamo for national security reasons. The court issued a protective order to prevent Al Qaeda members from learning about the ongoing investigation of detainees. Lindh objected to the order, arguing it would burden his trial preparation by revealing his defense strategy. The judge amended the order to require a memorandum of understanding from defense investigators and expert witnesses instead of pre-screening. Lindh also objected to the order's impact on his ability to use the media to influence public opinion. The judge rejected the defendant's argument about using the media to influence public opinion, stating it was not a constitutional right. Lindh later struck a plea deal and was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Ghailani, an alleged Al Qaeda member, was indicted in 1998 for conspiracy to kill Americans abroad. Ghailani was arrested in connection with the bombing of the United States Embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. He was transferred to U.S. custody and held at Guantanamo as an enemy combatant before being tried in the Southern District of New York. Ghailani was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for his role in the conspiracy. The case has raised constitutional issues relevant to trying similar crimes in federal court or military commissions. The case of Ghailani, convicted for his role in the embassy bombings, raised constitutional issues regarding trials in federal court or military commissions. Key issues included the right to counsel, speedy trial, self-incrimination privilege, and jury trial consequences. The resolution of these issues in military commissions or reviewing courts is still uncertain. Ghailani also sought relief against the Secretary of Defense to prevent reassignment of his military defense attorneys. Ghailani requested his trusted military officers to act as his counsel in federal court, citing a violation of his Sixth Amendment right. The government argued against this, stating it was within the executive branch's prerogative. The judge denied the motion, stating that an indigent defendant does not have the right to continuous representation by counsel of his choice. Ghailani filed a motion for dismissal of his indictment based on a violation of his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. He sought discovery of documents to show government delays in his prosecution. The judge allowed some discovery but excluded one document as attorney work product. The judge allowed discovery of documents related to Ghailani's transfer for trial based on a Supreme Court ruling regarding the \"reason for delay\" in providing a speedy trial. This included high-level DOJ officials involved in the decision to prosecute Ghailani, as the embassy bombing case had the attention of top government officials before Ghailani's custody. The judge ordered the DOJ to produce relevant documents for Ghailani's case, considering high-level officials as part of the \"government.\" The court denied the speedy trial motion after a balancing test, justifying Ghailani's time in CIA detention for intelligence purposes. The delay between his transfers was deemed insufficient for postponement. The court found that the delay in Ghailani's case, including his transfer to New York in 2009, did not justify postponing the trial. The government's discretion in prosecution and the lack of evidence for tactical advantage were key factors. The court determined that Ghailani's rights were not violated, and his overseas detention by the CIA did not impact the case. The court ruled that Ghailani's overseas detention by the CIA did not affect his Sixth Amendment rights. However, it led to the exclusion of a government witness due to the witness's identity being revealed during Ghailani's interrogation. The judge required the government to prove the connection between Ghailani's coerced statements and the witness's testimony was sufficiently remote to be admissible. The government failed to establish this, resulting in the witness testimony being excluded. The court held hearings to determine the voluntariness of a witness's testimony, the role of coerced statements in securing cooperation, and the attenuation between illegal government actions and witness contact. The judge found in favor of the defendant, leading to Ghailani's conviction for conspiracy to destroy US buildings but acquittal on 284 other counts. The jury found Ghailani guilty of conspiracy to destroy US buildings and sentenced him to life imprisonment. The trial outcome sparked a debate on the use of military commissions versus federal court trials in terrorism cases. The trial outcome of Ghailani, sentenced to life imprisonment for conspiracy to destroy US buildings, sparked a debate on the use of military commissions versus federal court trials in terrorism cases. The judge's post-trial opinion shed light on the verdict, highlighting Ghailani's defense of being unknowingly duped into carrying out acts in furtherance of the bombing conspiracy. The charge did not require proof of Ghailani's awareness of the exact objective and targets, only that he understood his activities would likely result in the bombing of American facilities. The jury was instructed that willful blindness on the part of the accused to the precise objective of the conspiracy would invalidate a defense based on the lack of requisite knowledge. Ghailani appealed, arguing that his pretrial detention should have precluded his trial on speedy trial grounds. Salim Hamdan challenged the district court's jury instruction on \"conscious avoidance\" and argued that his life sentence was disproportionate to his conviction on one of 286 charges. The appellate court upheld the district court's decisions. Hamdan had previously won a habeas case at the Supreme Court, leading to the invalidation of the military commission system. He was then charged under the Military Commission Act of 2006 and found guilty of providing material support for terrorism. Salim Hamdan was found guilty of providing material support for terrorism and sentenced to 66 months' imprisonment. Despite his release, he continued his appeal through the system established by the Military Commission Act (MCA). The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned his conviction, stating that the MCA did not intend for offenses to apply retroactively. The court agreed that the crime of material support of terrorism did not exist as a war crime under international law at the time of the relevant conduct. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned Salim Hamdan's conviction for providing material support for terrorism, citing that the Military Commission Act did not intend for offenses to apply retroactively. The court found that the crime did not exist as a war crime under international law at the time of the relevant conduct. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned Salim Hamdan's conviction for material support for terrorism, ruling that the offense was not retroactive under the Military Commission Act. The court rejected the government's argument that the charge was supported by U.S. common law of war, distinguishing it from international law applied by Congress for military commissions. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned Salim Hamdan's conviction for material support for terrorism, ruling that the offense was not retroactive under the Military Commission Act. The court suggested that offenses must be \"based on norms firmly grounded in international law\" to avoid being retroactive. The government chose not to appeal directly but challenged the ruling indirectly by appealing a different case to the D.C. Circuit en banc. The government appealed the military commission conviction in Al Bahlul, citing Hamdan II as precedent for overturning the conviction based on the validity of conspiracy, solicitation, and material support of terrorism charges before the MCA 2006. The court granted en banc consideration of the D.C. Circuit's ruling on crimes under the laws of war, invalidating Al Bahlul's military commission conviction. Al Bahlul, a former associate of Osama bin Laden, was convicted of providing support to al Qaeda and soliciting others to commit terrorist acts. The Court of Military Commission Review upheld Al Bahlul's conviction for offenses violating the law of war. The government disagreed with the D.C. Circuit's decision in Hamdan II, arguing that Congress intended to authorize military commissions for pre-2006 conduct. The government disagreed with the D.C. Circuit's interpretation of Article 21 of the UCMJ, arguing that military commissions have historically had jurisdiction over crimes violating the U.S. common law of war. The D.C. Circuit granted the government's petition for rehearing en banc regarding the Ex Post Facto Clause and detainees held at Guantanamo. The full court overruled the Hamdan II panel's holding that Congress intended to avoid violating the Ex Post Facto Clause for detainees at Guantanamo. Congress unambiguously authorized Bahlul's prosecution for pre-2006 conduct, leading to a plain error review standard for his appeal. The court found that the CMCR committed plain error with respect to Bahlul's convictions. The court found that the CMCR committed plain error with respect to the convictions on charges of material support and solicitation, but not for conspiracy. The conspiracy charge was upheld based on two alternative rationales, including the fact that the conduct could have been charged under a pre-existing federal criminal offense. The court remanded the appeal to the original three-judge panel to decide the remaining challenges to the conspiracy conviction, including questions about Congress's authority to define crimes triable by military commission and potential violations of the First Amendment and Due Process Clause. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit declined to stop the military commission trial of Abd Al Rahim Hussein Al-Nashiri for his alleged role in terrorist plots, including the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole. Judge Henderson wrote the majority opinion, finding the Ex Post Facto Clause inapplicable to Bahlul. Judge Rogers dissented on the conspiracy charge, arguing inchoate conspiracy is not a violation of international law. Judge Brown and Judge Kavanaugh agreed on the outcome but differed on the rationale for affirming the conspiracy conviction. Three partial dissents objected to using the plain error standard as it does not provide a definitive answer to the questions raised. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld the military commission trial of Abd Al Rahim Hussein Al-Nashiri for his involvement in terrorist plots, including the 2000 USS Cole bombing. The court ruled that federal courts cannot entertain pre-trial challenges to military commissions' jurisdiction due to the Military Commissions Act of 2006. Al-Nashiri, a Saudi national detained at Guantanamo Bay, faces charges related to the Cole bombing, attempted bombing of USS The Sullivans, and the 2002 bombing of M/V Limburg. Al-Nashiri argues that the charges against him are unlawful as neither the President nor Congress certified an armed conflict in Yemen before 2003. He claims the Convening Authority exceeded his authority by bringing the charges. The government moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, which was granted by the district court. Al-Nashiri renewed his contention on the legality of MCA Section 7 on appeal. On appeal, Al-Nashiri argued that MCA Section 7 is unconstitutional, but the appellate court disagreed. He also claimed that the provision does not apply to his lawsuit because he named the Convening Authority in his personal capacity. The court of appeals noted that the relief sought would not help Al-Nashiri unless it applied to the new Convening Authority and the government as a whole. The appellate court dismissed arguments regarding the exercise of delegated authority and plain text reading. It was noted that military commissions have jurisdiction to determine their own jurisdiction. Al-Nashiri can contest the military commission's jurisdiction over his alleged crimes at trial and on appeal. The judiciary, along with the political branches, has shaped U.S. wartime detention policy in the conflict with Al Qaeda and the Taliban. The judiciary has played a significant role in clarifying detainee rights and privileges in the conflict with Al Qaeda and the Taliban. Judicial decisions may impact U.S. detention policy and compel the executive branch to modify practices to align with judicial opinions. This includes decisions on detention authority under the AUMF and statutes applicable to criminal prosecutions in Article III courts or military tribunals. The judiciary's role in clarifying detainee rights in the conflict with Al Qaeda and the Taliban may influence executive decisions on trial forums and prompt legislative responses. The 2012 NDAA codifies aspects of existing jurisprudence on U.S. detention policy. Judicial rulings on the 2001 AUMF could guide future legislative actions on authorizing military force in new conflicts. While the Supreme Court has issued definitive rulings on some detainee issues, many remain unresolved. The courts are likely to have a significant role in shaping U.S. policies regarding enemy belligerents in the future, as many issues related to their capture, treatment, and trial are still being litigated or are yet to be addressed by the judiciary."
