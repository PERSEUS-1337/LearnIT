    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Life Patenting Moratorium Act of 1993\". The Congress acknowledges the ethical, legal, economic, and social issues arising from advances in biotechnology and genetic research, including concerns about patenting life forms, genetic discrimination, and genetic privacy. There is ongoing discussion in the scientific community about the permanent alteration of human genetic code through germ-line research, yet Congress has not addressed the implications of such experimentation. The National Institutes of Health has proposed patenting over 2,000 human gene sequences, raising ethical, legal, economic, and social questions. Prior to April 7, 1987, no animals had been patented in the United States. Currently, there are over 150 animal patents pending, with three granted in December 1992. Congress may restrict or alter the policy of patenting animals and human genes. The Office of Technology Assessment will complete a review. The Office of Technology Assessment will conduct a review of the ethical, legal, economic, and social implications of patenting human genes. Congress is planning hearings and debates on this issue in the spring of 1993. SEC. 3. RESTRICTION ON THE ISSUANCE OF PATENTS. Prohibition on Patentability of Certain Biomedical Inventions or Processes: No human being, human organ, genetically engineered animal, human tissue, fluid, cell, gene, gene sequence, animal, or animal organism shall be considered patentable subject matter under this title for a 2-year period. The prohibition on patentability of certain biomedical inventions or processes may continue after a 2-year period, with exceptions for patents issued prior to the enactment of this section. This section aims to maintain the rights of individuals applying for patents related to genetically engineered material until the expiration of the 2-year period. The term 'genetically engineered' refers to the formation of new genetic material combinations through the insertion of nucleic acid molecules into host organism cells. The text chunk discusses the insertion of genetic material into the host organism's genetic material. A conforming amendment is made to the table of sections for chapter 10 of title 35, United States Code. SEC. 4. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS. Prohibition on patentability of certain biomedical inventions or processes. The Congress acknowledges the risks of uncontrolled patenting and proliferation of genetic material, including issues like patenting of life, eugenics, genetic discrimination, mutations, conflicts of interest, and genetic privacy. Legislation addressing genetic research implications should be thoroughly studied and passed. Collaboration with the international community to develop international standards is recommended. The Congress recommends collaboration with the international community to establish global standards for patenting genetic information and ensuring access to such data."
