    "content": "The \"Consumer Broadband and Digital Television Promotion Act\" includes sections on security system standards, preservation of security integrity, prohibition on nonconforming digital media devices, enforcement, and definitions. The Act aims to regulate the shipment and security technology of digital media devices. The Congress finds that the lack of high-quality digital content hinders consumer adoption of broadband Internet service and digital television products. Owners of digital programming are reluctant to transmit their products without technologies that recognize and respond to content security measures to prevent theft. Digital content piracy is a growing threat due to the ease of copying without degradation. Current marketplace agreements for security technologies in digital media devices do not provide a secure digital environment. Existing digital rights management schemes are limited and do not promote consumer access to a variety of digital content. Technological solutions can protect digital content on broadcast television and the Internet, but competing business interests have hindered the deployment of these technologies. Secure protection of digital content is necessary, as current agreements for security technologies in digital media devices fail to prevent the use of devices lacking security technologies. The secure protection of digital content is crucial for the dissemination of high-quality digital content and the growth of broadband networks. Cable and satellite currently have an advantage over digital television due to encryption, while over-the-air broadcasts lack this protection. This protection is also necessary for the transition to high-definition television. The protection of digital content is crucial for high-quality dissemination and broadband network growth. Cable and satellite have an advantage with encryption, while over-the-air broadcasts lack protection. Converting protected digital content to analog makes it vulnerable to illegal copying and redistribution. Government action is needed to mandate swift adoption of a technological solution to prevent piracy. Piracy through illegal file sharing poses a significant economic threat to America's content industries. A technologically feasible solution requires government action to ensure swift adoption and provide a secure environment for digital content while preserving consumer expectations. Consumer expectations for digital content in the home should be met through secure technological protections that allow content owners to distribute content online without hindering legitimate use by consumers for educational or research purposes. SEC. 3. ADOPTION OF SECURITY SYSTEM STANDARDS AND ENCODING RULES. The Federal Communications Commission, in consultation with the Register of Copyrights, will determine if representatives of digital media device manufacturers, consumer groups, and copyright owners have agreed on security system standards and encoding rules for digital media devices within 12 months of the Act's enactment. The Commission will report to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation within 6 months of the Act's enactment. The Senate and House committees are assessing progress on security system standards and encoding rules for digital media devices, private sector negotiations, the likelihood of reaching a final agreement within a year, and the possibility of extending the deadline if needed. The Commission will initiate a rulemaking process to adopt security system standards and encoding rules within 30 days if an agreement is reached, with a final rule published within 180 days. If no agreement is reached, the Commission will take alternative actions. The Commission will initiate a rulemaking process to adopt security system standards and encoding rules within 30 days if an agreement is reached, with a final rule published within 180 days. If no agreement is reached, the Commission will take alternative actions. The security system standards aim to provide effective security for copyrighted works by ensuring reliable standard security technologies. The standard security technologies must be reliable, renewable, resistant to attack, readily implemented, modular, applicable to multiple platforms, extensible, upgradable, and not cost prohibitive. Any software part of these standards must be based on open source code. The encoding rules must consider limitations on copyright owners' exclusive rights, including the fair use doctrine. The security system standards adopted must provide secure technical means for implementing copyright owners' directions for copyrighted works, including personal use copies for lawful recipients. The Commission may conduct subsequent rulemakings to modify security system standards for implementing copyright owners' directions for copyrighted works. Consultation with digital media device manufacturers, consumer groups, and copyright owners is required. Final rules apply prospectively only. After establishing security system standards, representatives of digital media device manufacturers, consumer groups, and copyright owners may modify the standard security technology if they determine a change is necessary. The modification shall consider the impact on consumers' ability to use devices manufactured before the new standards take effect. The representatives of digital media device manufacturers, consumer groups, and copyright owners may modify standard security technology if necessary due to compromise or technological advancements. The Commission must be notified before implementation, ensuring compliance with requirements. SEC. 4 requires interactive computer services to maintain the security measures of copyrighted material they store or transmit. SEC. 5 prohibits the interstate shipment of nonconforming digital media devices. SEC. 6 prohibits the sale or transportation of digital media devices without standard security technologies. There is an exception for devices legally sold before regulations were adopted. This section also prohibits the removal or alteration of security technology. SEC. 7 outlines enforcement measures for the prohibition of removing or altering standard security technology in digital media devices and applying unauthorized security measures to copyrighted works. SEC. 7 enforces penalties for violations of the Act related to altering security technology in digital media devices and unauthorized security measures on copyrighted works. Violations are treated as infringements of specific sections of the United States Code, with statutory damages ranging from $200 to $2,500 per violation. SEC. 8 provides an exemption under the Federal Advisory Committee Act. SEC. 8 exempts committees developing security system standards from the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The Act defines \"standard security technology\" as security technology following system standards, \"interactive computer service\" as defined in the Communications Act of 1934, and \"digital media device\" as hardware or software handling copyrighted works in digital form. The term \"Commission\" refers to the Federal Communications Commission. SEC. 10. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act will be effective upon enactment, with sections 4, 5, and 6 taking effect when the final rule under section 3(b) or (c) is implemented."
