    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Defense Energy Savings Act of 2004\" and includes provisions for Energy Savings Performance Contracts. The National Defense Energy Savings Act of 2004 authorizes the Secretary of Defense to enter into energy savings performance contracts for the purpose of achieving energy savings. Contracts can last up to 25 years and must be awarded competitively. The National Defense Energy Savings Act of 2004 authorizes the Secretary of Defense to enter into energy savings performance contracts for up to 25 years, awarded competitively. The contract must meet certain criteria, including availability of funds, adherence to Federal Acquisition Regulation, and notification to Congress if the cancellation ceiling exceeds $10,000,000. The contractor is responsible for implementing energy-saving measures, including costs for energy audits. An energy savings performance contract involves costs for energy audits, equipment installation, and personnel training in exchange for a share of energy savings. The contract also includes terms for annual energy audits, government payments, and maintenance responsibilities for energy-related equipment. Annual payments under the contract are limited by the Secretary. The Department of Defense's maintenance costs under an energy savings performance contract are capped at the estimated amount they would have paid for energy, operations, and maintenance without the contract. The contract must guarantee savings to the Department and establish payment schedules reflecting this guarantee, including any capital costs. The Secretary will issue final rules within 90 days to establish procedures for selecting, monitoring, and terminating energy savings performance contracts in a cost-effective manner. The Secretary, with the concurrence of the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council, will determine and formulate substitute regulations consistent with laws governing Federal procurement to achieve the intent of this section in a cost-effective manner. Implementation procedures and methods shall include calculating energy savings based on engineering and financial practices, and allowing the Secretary to request qualifications from contractors for energy savings services. The Secretary can presume contractor qualifications based on past contracts with the Federal Government or listing by a Federal agency. A list of qualified firms for energy savings services will be prepared and updated annually. Selected firms can engage in discussions for proposed energy projects. The Secretary can select the most qualified firm for energy savings projects based on technical and price proposals. The Department of Defense can also receive unsolicited proposals for energy savings services from qualified firms, inviting competition from other similarly qualified firms. The Secretary can choose the most qualified firm for energy savings projects through a competitive process. Qualified firms can submit proposals, enter into energy savings contracts, and request a review of their qualifications. Additionally, a transition rule applies to energy savings contracts entered into before a certain date. The Secretary may issue additional task orders and contract modifications for services at Department of Defense facilities. A pilot program allows up to 10 energy savings performance contracts for nonbuilding applications to achieve energy savings and demonstrate benefits. The Secretary may issue task orders and contract modifications for services at Department of Defense facilities. A pilot program allows up to 10 energy savings performance contracts for non-building applications to achieve energy savings and demonstrate benefits. A report on the progress and results of the pilot program must be submitted to Congress within three years, including project descriptions, energy and cost savings, and recommendations for program extension or expansion.
