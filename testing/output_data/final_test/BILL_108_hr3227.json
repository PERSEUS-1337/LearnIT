The Congress acknowledges the need for standards in emergency preparedness and response, as highlighted by various reports and strategies. The lack of such standards poses a risk to the effectiveness of grant funds for preparedness against weapons of mass destruction. Accelerated and coordinated standard-setting activities are required as per the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The Congress recognizes the importance of standards in emergency preparedness and response to prevent wastage of grant funds. SEC. 3. EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE STANDARDS. This section adds emergency preparedness and response standards to the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The Secretary, in consultation with various agencies and bodies, shall establish standards and guidelines for emergency preparedness and response capabilities at all government levels, ensuring flexibility for local officials to prioritize needs while meeting national preparedness levels within a set timeframe. The Secretary will determine minimum essential emergency preparedness and response capabilities for each State and measure progress made by State and local government agencies in achieving these standards within a fixed time period. These capabilities must be measurable and subject to Federal audit. The Secretary may coordinate the development of standards for emergency preparedness and response capabilities at the federal, state, and local levels, including training, communication systems, and equipment. Additionally, an integrated capability for planning and addressing terrorism consequences may be established, along with coordinating the provision of federal terrorism resources. The Secretary coordinates Federal terrorism preparedness assistance to State, tribal, and local governments, establishes standards for emergency communications and warning systems, and sets standards for training and equipment for first responders. Consultation with relevant private sector groups is required. The Secretary is responsible for coordinating Federal terrorism preparedness assistance to State, tribal, and local governments, establishing standards for emergency communications and warning systems, and setting standards for training and equipment for first responders. Additionally, the Secretary is required to report annually to Congress on the progress of grant and training programs in increasing terrorism preparedness at the State and local levels, conforming to applicable Federal standards, and the expenditures needed for such preparedness. The Secretary coordinates federal terrorism preparedness assistance and sets standards for emergency communications, training, and equipment for first responders. The local government's terrorism preparedness must conform to these standards. The Secretary of Homeland Security will establish emergency preparedness and response standards for weapons of mass destruction in the fiscal year 2005 budget request. This standard will include equipment and training for metropolitan and rural areas."
