    "content": "President George W. Bush announced the creation of Africa Command (AFRICOM) on February 6, 2007, reflecting the continent's strategic importance to the United States. AFRICOM is one of the Department of Defense's (DOD) six geographic commands and was initially under EUCOM before reaching full operating capability on October 1, 2007. AFRICOM was established as a stand-alone unified command on October 1, 2008, with General Carter F. Ham taking over command authority from Army General William E. \"Kip\" Ward in 2011. The command's mission is to promote U.S. strategic objectives in Africa by working with African partners to strengthen defense capabilities for regional stability and security. AFRICOM also supports other agencies' efforts on the continent and oversees military operations when directed. AFRICOM, established in 2008, oversees military operations to deter aggression and respond to crises. Operation Odyssey Dawn in Libya was its first major military operation in 2011, with General Ham leading the theater command and Admiral Locklear coordinating tactical operations. Locklear also commands U.S. Naval Forces Europe and Africa, and Allied Joint Force Command, Naples. The Commander of U.S. Air Forces Africa led Operation Odyssey Dawn in Libya, with AFRICOM supporting humanitarian efforts. NATO took over military operations on April 1 under Operation Unified Protector. The creation of AFRICOM was motivated by concerns over coordination challenges among three geographic commands. The United States, acting alone and as a member of NATO, provided airlift and training for African peacekeeping troops in the Darfur region of Sudan. EUCOM and CENTCOM were overstretched by the mid-2000s due to conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Commander of EUCOM testified that Africa's increasing strategic significance poses the greatest security challenge in the region. Key challenges in Africa such as ungoverned areas, HIV/AIDS epidemic, corruption, weak governance, and poverty impact security stability in the region. AFRICOM has faced challenges in its establishment, with Congress addressing some issues. Questions on U.S. strategic interests in Africa and the impact of AFRICOM's creation on future military operations remain. AFRICOM's mission, preparation for contingencies in Africa, perceptions by Africans and other countries, costs, headquarters location impact, coordination between State Department and DOD, Obama Administration's views on interagency process development, and effectiveness of integrating non-DOD USG agency personnel. AFRICOM is addressing intelligence community's realignment of resources towards Africa, current ISR needs, and ensuring military efforts align with diplomatic and development objectives. Conflict prevention activities are being considered as part of DOD's mandate, and the authorities granted to U.S. Chiefs of Mission regarding combatant command activities are being evaluated. Counterterrorism operations are prominent in AFRICOM's mandate, alongside peacekeeping training and support components. AFRICOM's civil affairs teams contribute to the command's mission, legal authorities guide DOD's security cooperation programs, procedural challenges hinder capacity building, lack of assigned forces affects mandate implementation, sustaining partner capacity improvements is crucial, and DOD ensures training and equipment are not misused. AFRICOM's mission includes interagency coordination, basing, and manpower requirements. U.S. strategic interests in Africa are supported by the geographic and functional commands within the Department of Defense. The creation of a new combatant command requires changes to the Unified Command Plan (UCP), initiated by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) and approved by the President. Prior to AFRICOM, the most recent geographic command established was NORTHCOM in 2002 after the September 11 attacks. The UCP is reviewed regularly. The Unified Command Plan (UCP) is reviewed every two years as required by the Goldwater-Nichols DOD Reorganization Act of 1986. The establishment of Africa Command was recommended in the 2006 review and codified in the 2008 review. Africa Command is referred to as a combatant command \"plus,\" with roles of a traditional command and a broader \"soft power\" mandate. Congress has taken legislative action leading to changes in the UCP. The Department of Defense issued DOD Directive 3000.05 in 2005, defining stability operations as a core U.S. military mission. The 2008 National Defense Strategy highlights the threat of instability in foreign countries to U.S. interests. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review emphasizes the importance of preventing conflict and building security sector capacity for America's national security approach. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review emphasized the importance of preventing conflict and building security sector capacity for America's national security approach, shifting focus towards conflict prevention and security assistance to address threats at their inception through theater security cooperation and capacity building of allies. The evolving defense strategy recognizes that future security threats are more likely to come from state weakness rather than state strength. In the future strategic landscape, challenges in the gray area between war and peace will require enabling partners to respond to security threats, reducing risks to U.S. forces. The 2010 QDR outlined three strategic goals for the DOD: prevail in current conflicts, prevent and deter conflict, and prepare for various contingencies. A separate command for Africa was proposed to enhance focus and synergy in supporting U.S. policy and engagement in the region. The 2008 National Defense Strategy emphasizes a \"whole-of-government\" approach for national security objectives, including greater civilian participation in military operations and interagency partnerships. AFRICOM's role in Africa involves DOD leading on security issues, supporting the Department of State in diplomacy, and the U.S. Agency for International. AFRICOM supports USAID in development programs, emphasizing that its role is supportive. Activities should complement, not duplicate, other U.S. government efforts and strengthen security sector relationships. Approval from the Ambassador and USAID Mission Director is required for activities to align with U.S. foreign policy objectives and AFRICOM's strategic interests. Comparisons have been made between AFRICOM's mission and that of Southern Command (SOUTHCOM). AFRICOM, like SOUTHCOM, focuses on security cooperation, counter-narcotics operations, humanitarian assistance, and human rights initiatives in Africa. It aims to prevent conflict and keep American troops out of Africa for the next 50 years, reflecting a shift in DOD strategy towards proactive deterrence. AFRICOM's broad mandate of developing a stable environment in Africa to improve citizens' quality of life may be challenging to operationalize. The shift towards proactive deterrence and focus on prevention rather than fighting wars raises concerns about the military's diplomatic role and capabilities. The unequal allocation of resources between the Departments of Defense, State, and USAID may hinder their ability to act as equal partners and lead to the militarization of development and diplomacy. A report by the State Department's Office of Inspector General found that cuts in resources after the Cold War led to a decline in staffing at U.S. missions in Africa. The increase in funding for HIV/AIDS programs and military programs in African countries has left embassy personnel stretched. The report by the State Department's Office of Inspector General highlighted the challenges faced by U.S. embassy personnel in African countries due to increased funding for military programs. It pointed out a lack of resources for traditional development and public diplomacy, leading to confusion about the role of AFRICOM. Recommendations were made to address the imbalance between civilian and military efforts. The DOD acknowledges the imbalance between civilian and military capacity in U.S. foreign affairs, citing challenges in current conflicts. Efforts to address this issue are ongoing, with the Bush Administration proposing AFRICOM to involve other government agencies in DOD planning. Interagency coordination is facilitated by the State Department's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs in Washington, DC. The Office of Political-Military Affairs (PM) at the State Department liaises with the Department of Defense (DOD) through the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs (ISA). USAID's Office of Military Affairs (OMA) coordinates agency policy with DOD and the State Department for humanitarian relief and post-conflict reconstruction. State's PM Bureau appoints Foreign Policy Advisors (POLADs) to advise combatant commanders on diplomatic and political aspects of their military responsibilities. The State Department's Office of Political-Military Affairs liaises with the Department of Defense through the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs. USAID's Office of Military Affairs coordinates agency policy with DOD and State Department for humanitarian relief and post-conflict reconstruction. DOD assigns senior defense officials to serve as military liaisons at embassies worldwide, working with U.S. ambassadors and interagency embassy Country Teams. USAID OFDA deploys military liaison officers as part of Disaster Assistance Response Teams during humanitarian assistance and disaster relief efforts. AFRICOM aims for greater interagency coordination with State Department, USAID, and other government agencies during humanitarian and disaster relief operations. The command seeks to involve non-DOD civilian staff in planning processes and hopes to set a new approach for other combatant commands to follow. AFRICOM aims to involve non-DOD civilian staff in planning processes, including senior leadership positions and subject-matter experts. Filling interagency positions has been challenging, with only roughly 40 civilians permanently assigned. Ambassador Mary Carlin Yates served as AFRICOM's first Deputy to the Commander for Civil-Military Activities. Ambassador Mary Carlin Yates was the first non-DOD civilian integrated into AFRICOM's command structure as the Deputy to the Commander for Civil-Military Activities. She later became the Senior Director for Strategic Planning and Institutional Reform at the National Security Council. J. Anthony Holmes replaced Yates as the Director of Civil-Military Affairs. Vice Admiral Charles J. Leidig, Jr. took over as the Deputy to the Commander for Military Operations in 2010, responsible for implementing AFRICOM's programs and operations. The Deputy to the Commander for Military Operations (DCMO) is responsible for implementing AFRICOM's programs and operations. The final headquarters location decision has been postponed to 2012 to gain a better understanding of operational requirements. Consideration of establishing sub-regional offices in Africa faced resistance from the State Department. The establishment of sub-regional offices in Africa faced resistance from the State Department due to concerns about chief-of-mission authority. There are no plans to create new military bases in Africa, as AFRICOM's presence in Djibouti at Camp Lemonnier supports U.S. military operations in the Gulf of Aden region and DOD objectives in Yemen. The U.S. military has a five-year lease with the Djiboutian government for Lemonnier, with the option to extend through 2020. AFRICOM has Forward Operating Sites in Djibouti at Camp Lemonnier and on Ascension Island. The U.S. military also utilizes logistic support facilities in various locations in Europe and Africa, as well as \"lily pad\" facilities in Algeria, Botswana, Gabon, and other African countries. There is ongoing debate about the ultimate location for AFRICOM's headquarters. AFRICOM's headquarters were initially located in Germany due to the majority of countries in its area of responsibility being under EUCOM. The decision on whether to move the command was postponed until 2012. Speculation arose about permanently locating AFRICOM in Europe or the United States. Some DOD officials argued that AFRICOM's headquarters should be located in Africa for proximity benefits. Flight times from Germany to key African locations are significantly shorter than from the US. However, there were concerns about a potential US military agenda in Africa. The discussion around AFRICOM's headquarters location in Africa raised concerns about a potential U.S. military agenda on the continent. DOD officials considered a dispersed regional headquarters model to lessen the U.S. presence in any one country and suggested co-locating facilities with regional organizations for better integration. General Ward found AFRICOM's current dispersed presence sufficient, with military liaison officers already stationed at key African headquarters. The Department of Defense is considering various locations for AFRICOM's headquarters in Africa, including liaison offices at different regional organizations. Several U.S. states and African countries have offered to host the command, with Liberia being a public offer in 2007. Strategic partners like South Africa and Algeria have opposed the establishment of a command. Some strategic partners, like South Africa and Algeria, strongly oppose a command headquarters in Africa due to concerns about a permanent foreign military presence. There are worries that an American military presence could empower domestic terrorist groups and challenge regional hegemons for political or military power. The Department of Defense prioritizes the safety and security of over 1,000 American personnel and their families, considering factors like living standards and access to healthcare in potential host countries in Africa. Locating U.S. soldiers permanently in a foreign country would depend on the host country's approval of legal agreements. A move to Africa by AFRICOM officials is not currently necessary or sought after. Manning the new command remains a consideration. Manning the new AFRICOM command has been challenging due to limited defense resources and personnel stretched thin by engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan. The command was authorized to have over 1,300 headquarters staff by October 2008, but less than 75% of positions were filled by the deadline. Approximately 270 personnel were transferred from other commands to help meet staffing needs, resulting in roughly 1,200 staff at AFRICOM headquarters. AFRICOM currently has around 1,200 staff at its headquarters, with additional intelligence support staff. The armed services component headquarters each have 100-300 staff supporting AFRICOM. The U.S. military footprint in Africa averaged about 3,500 troops in 2010, with forces provided through the Global Force Management system. AFRICOM's start-up costs in FY2007 were $51 million, with a budget of $154.6 million in FY2008 and $389 million in FY2009. Some funding was lost to across-the-board cuts, but appropriators expressed support for AFRICOM while emphasizing the need for State Department and USAID involvement. AFRICOM's budget for FY2010 was estimated at $295 million, slightly higher than the $278 million originally requested. Military construction at Camp Lemonnier is budgeted separately. CJTF-HOA operations and base operations at Camp Lemonnier have been funded separately as Overseas Contingency Operations. The FY2011 budget request was $296.2 million, and the FY2012 request is just under $290 million. U.S. military engagement in Africa has not historically been a strategic priority. U.S. military engagement in Africa has not historically been a strategic priority. After the Cold War, policymakers viewed the U.S. military's role in Africa as minimal. In 1995, the Department of Defense stated that there was very little traditional strategic interest in Africa. In 1998, following terrorist attacks, the U.S. conducted a retaliatory strike in Sudan. The Bush Administration's National Security Strategy of 2002 highlighted the need for a focused approach towards Africa due to the challenges of disease, war, and poverty. The strategy emphasized building indigenous security and intelligence capabilities through bilateral engagement and coalitions of the willing. The 2006 National Security Strategy further prioritized Africa, recognizing the importance of partnering with Africans to strengthen fragile states and address ungoverned areas. President Obama has emphasized Africa's strategic importance, stating that issues like genocide in Darfur and terrorism in Somalia are global security challenges that require a global response. The Obama Administration's National Security Strategy highlights the need for effective partnerships in Africa, focusing on priorities such as open markets, conflict prevention, peacekeeping, counterterrorism, and environmental protection. The United States emphasizes the importance of partnerships in Africa for addressing transnational challenges, including peacekeeping, capacity building, and counterterrorism efforts. The focus is on preventing extremism, addressing humanitarian crises, and building partner capacity in critical states to counter violent extremism in the region. The United States aims to counter violent extremism in the Horn of Africa, particularly Somalia and the Trans-Sahel, while also working to reduce security threats to civilians. Efforts include supporting states and regional organizations in contributing to Africa's security and assisting in the development of military capacity, such as the African Stand-by Force. The establishment of AFRICOM reflects a shift in policymakers' views on Africa's security challenges and U.S. strategic interests in the region. The United States has increased economic relations with Sub-Saharan Africa through the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which has been amended by Congress multiple times. Africa supplies the U.S. with a significant amount of crude oil, with Nigeria being the largest supplier. Instability in Nigeria's Niger Delta region has impacted oil output. The United States aims to reduce oil imports from the Middle East by 2025, focusing on expanding energy sources in regions like Africa and the Western Hemisphere. Nigerian political instability and attacks on oil facilities in the Niger Delta have impacted global oil prices. The U.S. aims to secure Nigeria's oil fields in Africa due to potential deep water drilling in the Gulf of Guinea. Africa's coastlines are vulnerable to illegal activities like fishing, trafficking, and piracy, posing threats to maritime commerce and oil production facilities. West Africa is a major transit point for narcotics trafficking to Europe. The United States government, through AFRICOM and other agencies, is working with West African partners to enhance maritime security in the region, particularly to combat drug trafficking and enforce maritime laws. This initiative is part of the National Strategy for Maritime Security introduced in 2005 to protect commerce and the freedom of the seas. The U.S. Navy has increased operations in the Gulf of Guinea to enhance security in the region through the African Maritime Law Enforcement Partnership (AMLEP). The Navy is also engaged in maritime security operations in the waters off the coast of East Africa with coalition partners to protect shipping routes in various seas. AFRICOM conducts train and equip programs to strengthen African navies in the Gulf of Oman, Arabian Sea, Red Sea, and Indian Ocean. Political conflicts in Africa have led to human suffering and hindered development. The continent hosts the majority of UN peacekeeping missions, with Ghana, Ethiopia, Nigeria, and South Africa among the top troop contributors. African militaries also participate in peace operations led by the African Union and regional organizations. Many African militaries lack the capability to effectively participate in peace operations led by the African Union and regional organizations. The Global Peace Operations Initiative (GPOI) was introduced in 2004 by the G8 to train peacekeeping troops worldwide. The United States and other donor countries support enhancing African forces' capabilities for these operations, driven by counterterrorism efforts as a top national security priority. The threat of violent extremism in Africa, particularly in East Africa, has been a top national security priority for the Obama Administrations. The Director of National Intelligence has expressed concerns over groups like Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and Al Shabaab in East Africa. While these groups are primarily focused on regional objectives, there are ties between Al Shabaab and Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). The threat of violent extremism in Africa, particularly in East Africa, has been a top national security priority for the Obama Administrations. Some individuals training and fighting in Somalia also aim to attack the United States. DOD emphasizes the need to work with partner nations to counteract these threats and support regional partnerships to erode terrorists' support and legitimacy. AFRICOM officials have linked the threat posed by terror groups to regional conflicts, stating that violent extremism by transnational terrorist organizations is a major source of regional instability. Policy makers are concerned about the challenge posed by \"ungoverned\" areas. State Department officials are concerned about the risk of failed states and \"ungoverned spaces\" as a threat to U.S. national security. Terrorist groups may exploit the lack of state control and use conflict situations to fund their operations, as seen in Sierra Leone's civil war with al Qaeda's involvement in the diamond trade. General Ward highlights terrorist activities, kidnapping, and illicit trafficking in the Sahel region as contributing to regional instability. The Obama Administration's strategy for countering terrorism in Africa focuses on dismantling Al Qaeda elements in the region and empowering countries to serve as countervailing forces. U.S. programs aim to build regional capacities in intelligence, military, law enforcement, and judicial sectors, strengthen security measures, stem terrorist financing, and counter extremist ideologies. Additionally, HIV/AIDS is a significant issue in Africa, with over 22 million HIV-positive individuals in 2009, representing 67% of global infections and being the leading cause of death on the continent. HIV/AIDS is a major issue in Africa, with over 22 million HIV-positive individuals in 2009, representing 67% of global infections. The Bush Administration and Congress prioritized efforts to combat HIV/AIDS, committing over $48 billion through PEPFAR. The Department of Defense established the DOD HIV/AIDS Prevention Program (DHAPP) with African armed forces to support programs in approximately 40 countries. The U.S. military conducts various activities in Africa to support national interests, including humanitarian relief, peacekeeping, counterterrorism, sanctions enforcement, and capacity-building for African militaries. These efforts aim to promote democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. The State Department funds foreign military assistance programs and provides guidance, while the U.S. military occasionally provides advisors to peacekeeping missions on the continent. The U.S. military, through programs like Joint Combined Exchange Training (JCET) and the Africa Center for Strategic Studies (ACSS), conducts joint exercises with African militaries to promote good governance, counter terrorism, and enhance regional collaboration in defense and security sectors. The United States sells military equipment to African governments through various programs like Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and Foreign Military Financing (FMF). U.S. counterterrorism efforts in Africa also include addressing root causes of terrorism and military programs. The United States is increasingly focusing on Information Operations (IO) in Africa to improve security and counter extremist ideology. Activities include website initiatives like Maghrebia.com and AFRICOM's Operation Objective Voice (OOV). Some question if these activities should be managed by other U.S. agencies instead of the Department of Defense (DOD). DOD officials argue that AFRICOM allows for better coordination with other U.S. agencies. The DOD aims to coordinate with various U.S. agencies and foreign governments, like the State Department, USAID, CIA, FBI, Britain, and France, to provide training and assistance for African security forces. AFRICOM builds on the experiences of the Combined Joint Task Force\u2014Horn of Africa to focus on cooperative conflict prevention. CJTF-HOA consists of 2,000-2,500 rotational U.S. military and civilian personnel. CJTF-HOA, consisting of 2,500 U.S. military and civilian personnel, covers various countries in Africa and provides training in counterterrorism and military professionalization. They also support peace operations and humanitarian assistance efforts in the region. Additionally, they assist regional maritime security forces in combating piracy. CJTF-HOA provides military assistance, training, and humanitarian support to African countries, including Burundi and Uganda, for peacekeeping missions. They conduct civil-military operations in East Africa to enhance regional stability and counter terrorism. AFRICOM is reexamining the scope and structure of its activities in response to the re-emergence of transnational terrorism. The focus is on building defense capacities of partner nations in Africa to ensure stability and security on the continent, rather than preparing for major combat. AFRICOM's principal mission is security cooperation and building partnership capability, not warfighting. The focus is on persistent engagement and reliable military-to-military relationships to ensure stability in Africa. U.S. training programs aim to promote respect for human rights and civilian authority in African security forces. The U.S. government provides security assistance through bilateral and multilateral initiatives, including the African Crisis Response Initiative (ACRI) in the 1990s. The U.S. military has conducted various training programs in Africa, including ACRI, EIPC, ARP, and IMET. Training has been provided by U.S. Special Forces and contractors. The National Guard State Partnership Program pairs U.S. states' National Guard units with African countries for security cooperation activities. The U.S. military has collaborated with regional security organizations like the African Union and ECOWAS to support the development of the African Standby Force. The African Standby Force (ASF) is organized by the African Union (AU) with a standby capacity of 15,000 to 20,000 peacekeepers. AFRICOM conducts training exercises like African Endeavor to improve communication and interoperability among African nations. U.S. military assistance includes programs to enhance information sharing networks and support security sector reform in post-conflict countries like the DRC, Liberia, and Sudan. In October 2007, U.S. Naval Forces Europe launched the African Partnership Station (APS) initiative in the Gulf of Guinea to provide assistance and training in maritime domain awareness, law enforcement, port security, seamanship, search and rescue, leadership, logistics, civil engineering, humanitarian aid, and disaster response. Other Navy and Coast Guard vessels have since deployed to the region under APS for similar activities. The APS initiative, launched in 2007, provides assistance and training in maritime activities in East Africa. European partners, NGOs, and U.S. government agencies collaborate with the Navy for humanitarian outreach projects. The APS vessels have a minimal onshore presence and conduct repeat visits to African ports. The cost for APS in FY2010 was estimated at $10.5 million for West and Central Africa and $9.96 million for East Africa. The Pan-Sahel Initiative (PSI) program, launched in 2005 as a follow-on to PSI, aims to increase border security and counterterrorism capacities in Mali, Chad, Niger, and Mauritania. The Trans Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership focuses on combating violent extremism in the Maghreb and Sahel regions by strengthening regional counterterrorism capabilities and coordination. Operation Enduring Freedom-Trans Sahara, led by AFRICOM, involves U.S. forces working with African counterparts to improve intelligence, logistics, and border control to combat terrorist groups. The United States and African forces conduct joint exercises like Exercise Flintlock to enhance security partnerships under PSI and TSCTP. Military efforts support development activities led by the State Department and USAID, including job creation initiatives for youth to counter terrorist recruitment. Over $500 million has been allocated for TSCTP since FY2005. The State Department's PREACT focuses on regional counterterrorism in East Africa. The U.S. government has a history of providing training to foreign militaries through programs like MAP and IMET. IMET offers training at U.S. military schools and E-IMET provides courses on defense management and civil-military relations. Sub-Saharan African countries received approximately $13.8 million in IMET assistance and $6.8 million in FMF in FY2008. In FY2008, Sub-Saharan African countries received approximately $13.8 million in IMET assistance and $6.8 million in FMF. The Clinton Administration proposed the African Crisis Response Force (ACRF) in 1996, later reintroduced as the African Crisis Response Initiative (ACRI) and then replaced by ACOTA in 2002 to upgrade African militaries' peace-enforcement capabilities. The FY2012 request includes $15.5 million in IMET and $18.8 million in FMF for Sub-Saharan Africa. ACOTA, part of GPOI, provides Peace Support Operations training for African militaries, focusing on capacity building for peacekeeping. GPOI aims to enhance African militaries' ability to contribute to peace operations through various programs and activities. The United States coordinates with other G8 countries through a G8 Africa Clearinghouse. DOD provides mentoring assistance to ACOTA training events. Over 154,500 peacekeepers from 20+ African countries have been trained. According to the State Department, over 154,500 peacekeepers from over 20 African countries have received training under ACOTA and its predecessor, ACRI. U.S. reaction to the creation of AFRICOM has been positive, but concerns have been raised. In Africa, perceptions of the command are mixed, with apprehension over U.S. motivations and fears of neocolonialism. Some question the sustained focus of DOD on the continent, citing past military interventions and counterterrorism efforts. Many view AFRICOM's primary goals as hunting terrorists. AFRICOM's primary goals are to hunt terrorists and secure U.S. access to African oil. U.S. foreign policy analysts are focusing on China's role in Africa, leading to questions about AFRICOM's influence on the continent. African governments and militaries cautiously welcome increased American attention, seeing it as a positive development with potential for increased resources and assistance. U.S. military assistance and training programs in Africa have been on the rise, with regular consultations between DOD, State Department officials, and African nations on AFRICOM. In April and June 2007, senior officials visited several African countries to explain the creation of AFRICOM and its programs. They received positive feedback from African officials and defense attach\u00e9s in Paris. In September 2007, DOD hosted representatives from the African Union and over 35 African governments to further explain its plans for the command. In October 2007, the Pan-African Parliament voted in favor of a motion to prevent African governments from hosting AFRICOM. West African military chiefs expressed a need for further understanding and sensitization of AFRICOM by African countries. Several African heads of state publicly expressed preliminary views on AFRICOM, with some advising DOD to consider how it could complement the AU's regional security structure. Former Nigerian President Umaru Yar'Adua expressed support for partnering with AFRICOM to assist Nigeria and the African continent in peace and security initiatives. Nigeria's Minister of Foreign Affairs supported President Yar'Adua's stance on AFRICOM, emphasizing African governments' responsibility for peace and security. Ghana's President Kufour also welcomed President Bush's clarification that the US had no intention of building military bases in Africa during his visit in 2008. Liberia's President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf supports AFRICOM and offered to host its headquarters. AFRICOM officials emphasize the need for strategic communications to increase understanding among African governments and people. Congress has been interested in U.S. military engagement in Africa and engaged with the Executive Branch on AFRICOM's development. Senator Russ Feingold introduced a bill in 2006 related to the creation of a combatant command for Africa. In 2006, Senator Russ Feingold introduced a bill for a feasibility study on establishing a new command for Africa. In 2007 and 2008, resolutions were introduced recognizing the strategic importance of Africa and urging consultation with African partners. General Carter Ham delivered AFRICOM's posture statement to Congress in 2011. Congress has addressed issues related to AFRICOM's development in report language. In 2011, Congress focused on AFRICOM's development, addressing issues such as authorities, funding, staffing levels, and headquarters location. The Senate Armed Services Committee expressed support but raised concerns about resources for interagency collaboration. The House Appropriations Committee also had unanswered questions about the headquarters location. The House Appropriations Committee raised concerns about the headquarters location for AFRICOM in H.Rept. 110-775 (H.R. 6599). The House Armed Services Committee directed the Secretary of Defense to report on an alternative basing review by April 2012 for AFRICOM's relocation. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison introduced a bill to restrict funds for a permanent AFRICOM headquarters outside the U.S. until a report is provided. The Secretary of Defense must provide analysis of military construction costs for establishing a permanent AFRICOM location overseas vs. in the U.S. Previous funds were used to update AFRICOM's headquarters in Stuttgart, with no further construction funds requested. Questions have been raised about military construction in Djibouti for AFRICOM's CJTF-HOA. Senate committees support regional engagement activities but seek clarification on the Task Force's future role in Africa. In FY2011, the House Armed Services Committee required DOD to evaluate CJTF-HOA's activities in countering violent extremism in Africa. The Senate Appropriations Committee supported maintaining a military presence in the Horn of Africa at Camp Lemonnier but had concerns about AFRICOM's long-term mission and funding options for CJTF-HOA. Congress has also considered AFRICOM's mandate in the broader context of DOD's role in U.S. foreign affairs. In 2008, AFRICOM was the focus of hearings by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform's Subcommittee on National Security and Foreign Affairs, as well as discussions on foreign assistance, national security reform, interagency cooperation, and \"smart power.\" The House Armed Services Committee found shortcomings in the interagency process leading the military to take on missions outside its core responsibilities. The FY2008 NDAA required a review of military core competencies, potentially impacting AFRICOM. AFRICOM's mandate includes building indigenous capacity of African defense forces. Efficiencies in funding for security cooperation programs need improvement. Simplification of laws is suggested to allow combatant commands more flexibility in responding to threats and opportunities. The National Security Council is conducting a Security Sector Assistance Review to address concerns about modifying administrative authorities for AFRICOM. The U.S. military faces policy restrictions in operations with African governments. Troop readiness and costs associated with AFRICOM's development are key issues for Congress due to stretched military resources from operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. AFRICOM's headquarters staffing is insufficient for full-time operational capacity during extended crises, as noted by combatant commands. Additional personnel were needed during Operation Odyssey Dawn in Libya, and the command is open to increasing State Department and USAID staffing if resources are provided. The development of AFRICOM's interagency staffing has been of interest to Congress, with the Secretary of Defense advocating for increased civilian agency support. The House Report on H.R. 2082 expressed concern about flawed interagency coordination on Africa and the need for the intelligence community to realign resources. DOD officials highlighted the lack of legally binding requirements for agencies to coordinate, making AFRICOM's interagency process challenging. Close coordination with the State Department is crucial for AFRICOM's success in supporting U.S. foreign policy objectives in Africa. Observers have raised concerns about the expansion of U.S. military activity on the continent. In recent years, concerns have been raised about the potential for U.S. military efforts in Africa to overshadow diplomatic objectives. A Senate report highlighted the shift of funding and authority from civilian to military agencies, risking the weakening of the Secretary of State's role in setting foreign relations agendas. Former officials have emphasized the importance of AFRICOM contributing to, rather than defining, overall U.S. government strategy for the continent. Senator Richard Lugar suggested that AFRICOM could enhance the military's understanding of Africa. AFRICOM could help the U.S. military understand the complex and ever-changing region of Africa. Congress may oversee its operations to ensure they align with U.S. objectives. The history of U.S. military involvement in Africa includes the Wheelus Air Base in Libya from the 1940s to 1971. The U.S. military established a bomber base in Libya for missions to Europe and training purposes. Africa was not under U.S. military command until 1952, when North African countries were added to U.S. European Command. In 1960, Sub-Saharan Africa was included in Atlantic Command due to Cold War concerns. President Kennedy transferred responsibility for Sub-Saharan Africa to Strike Command in 1962. In 1971, Strike Command (STRICOM) was redesignated as Readiness Command (REDCOM), with responsibility for Africa dissolved. U.S. military involvement in Africa during the 1980s was driven by Cold War priorities, leading to repeated skirmishes with Libyan jets. This culminated in air strikes against Libya in 1986 under Operation El Dorado Canyon. After air strikes on military and civilian targets in Libya in 1986, U.S. policy towards Africa shifted towards a \"New World Order\" under President George H.W. Bush and later \"assertive multilateralism\" under President Bill Clinton. U.S. military involvement in Africa included deploying troops to Somalia for humanitarian operations in the early 1990s. Over 25,000 U.S. soldiers were deployed under UNITAF and later UNOSOM II, marking unprecedented military efforts on the continent. President George H.W. Bush led UNITAF in Somalia, with U.S. troops reduced under President Clinton. The battle of Mogadishu in 1993 resulted in casualties. U.S. forces withdrew in 1994 but deployed to Central Africa for humanitarian aid. In 1995, DOD stated little strategic interest in Africa. In the latter half of the 1990s, the U.S. military conducted limited contingency operations in Africa, including retaliatory missile attacks in Sudan and deploying forces off the coast of Liberia to assist in the civil war. The U.S. military has been involved in various operations in Africa, including providing training and support to African peacekeepers, conducting anti-piracy patrols off the coast of East Africa, and engaging in air strikes against terrorist targets in Somalia. Additionally, they have supported joint military operations against insurgent groups like the Lord's Resistance Army. The U.S. government is reviewing its strategy to address the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) threat. In March 2011, the United States began military operations in Libya under Operation Odyssey Dawn, supporting a multilateral effort to enforce a no-fly zone and protect civilians. NATO took over military operations in Libya on April 1 under Operation Unified Protector."
