    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Scientifically Identifying the Need for Critical Habitat Act\" and amends the Endangered Species Act to allow the designation of critical habitat for endangered or threatened species. It emphasizes the use of sound science and the best available data for decision-making. The text chunk amends the Endangered Species Act by defining key terms and specifying the use of scientific and commercial data. It also includes a conforming amendment to the table of contents. The text chunk establishes criteria for scientific studies to support listing species as endangered or threatened. It also requires field data observation for determining species status. The Secretary shall accept data from landowners obtained through field observation of species for inclusion in the rulemaking record. Additionally, sound science must be used in recovery planning as per the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The Secretary can accept scientific and commercial data to assist in recovery plan preparation. Data obtained will be considered by the recovery team and the Secretary for the plan. SEC. 4. PEER REVIEW. Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 is amended to include Independent Scientific Review Requirements for actions related to endangered or threatened species. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is amended to include Independent Scientific Review Requirements for actions related to endangered or threatened species. A qualified individual with expertise in biological sciences must provide scientific expertise on the species or relevant scientific expertise for decisions made by the Secretary. The Secretary must appoint independent scientific reviewers who have no conflicts of interest, are not involved in any related petitions or determinations, and have no financial interest in opposing the action. Recommendations for these reviewers will be sought from the National Academy of Sciences. Before finalizing any action, the Secretary must appoint 3 independent scientific reviewers from a list of qualified individuals. The reviewers will provide their opinion on the scientific information within 3 months and will be compensated for their review. Their selection and activities are not subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Recommendations for reviewers will be sought from the National Academy of Sciences.

The Secretary must allow anyone seeking authorization or funding from a Federal agency for an action subject to consultation to provide relevant information before a draft biological opinion is developed. This includes receiving information on the status of the species, threats, and conservation measures used to develop the biological opinion, and obtaining a copy of the draft biological opinion. Before the final biological opinion is issued, individuals can provide comments on the draft opinion and propose alternative solutions. If the Secretary does not include these alternatives in the final opinion, they must explain why to the individual. Public access to information is ensured for comments and information submitted regarding authorization or funding for an action, maintained by the Secretary and made available to the public, with specified exemptions."
