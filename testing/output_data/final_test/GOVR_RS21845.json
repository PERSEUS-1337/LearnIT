    "content": "The ADEA prohibits age discrimination in compensation and employment terms. The Third Circuit ruled that providing inferior benefits to Medicare-eligible retirees may be illegal age discrimination. The case was remanded to determine if the plan complied with the ADEA's equal-benefit or equal-cost provisions. The county was sued by retirees over 65 for offering inferior health benefits compared to younger retirees. The Third Circuit found age discrimination in the disparity of medical benefits based on Medicare eligibility at age 65. The Third Circuit concluded that age-based disparity in retiree health benefits is only lawful if it falls within the \"equal benefit/equal cost\" standard. The County of Erie's plan was found unlawful because older retirees had to pay a greater percentage of their premium than younger retirees. The trial court found that older retirees were provided inferior benefits due to unequal premium percentages and limited coverage options compared to younger retirees, violating the ADEA. The EEOC initially supported this position but later rescinded its policy on employer-sponsored retiree health plans in 2001 to further study the issue amid a decline in employers offering retiree health benefits. The EEOC found that concerns about the ADEA affecting employer-sponsored retiree health benefits led to reduced benefits for younger retirees or the elimination of retiree benefits altogether. The agency proposed amending the ADEA to protect retiree health coverage as a valuable benefit for older individuals. The EEOC proposed amending the ADEA regulations to exempt employer-sponsored retiree health benefits from ADEA requirements when retirees become eligible for Medicare or state retiree health benefits. This exemption aims to incentivize employers to maintain retiree health benefits. The EEOC proposed a rule to exempt employer-sponsored retiree health benefits from ADEA requirements, aiming to incentivize employers to maintain these benefits. Implementation was delayed in 2005 due to a court injunction, citing conflict with congressional intent and the ADEA. The court ruled that the EEOC has the power to issue rules within gaps left by Congress, but in this case, ambiguity was not allowed regarding the applicability of the ADEA to retiree health benefits. The EEOC's interpretation of the ADEA and retiree health benefits was challenged in court. The U.S. Supreme Court's Brand X decision emphasized deference to agency interpretations of ambiguous laws. The EEOC sought to align with Brand X in its legal proceedings. The EEOC challenged a court decision regarding its authority to issue a regulation on retiree health benefits. The district court reversed its decision, citing the Brand X ruling that allows for differing agency interpretations of statutes. Despite vacating its judgment, the court maintained an injunction on the proposed EEOC rule pending appeals. The Third Circuit upheld the EEOC's retiree health benefit rule based on exemption authority under \u00a7 9, allowing limited practices not otherwise permitted under the ADEA as long as they are 'reasonable' and 'necessary and proper in the public interest.' The EEOC's final rule, upheld by the court, allows employers to adjust retiree health benefits when retirees become eligible for Medicare without violating the ADEA. The rule aims to permit coordination of employer-provided retiree health coverage with Medicare eligibility, without encouraging the elimination of existing retiree health benefits. The final regulations allow employers to adjust retiree health benefits when retirees become eligible for Medicare without violating the ADEA. Employers can offer \"Medicare carve out plans\" to retirees but not to active employees. The exemption only applies to coordinating retiree health benefits with Medicare or a comparable state health plan. Other aspects of ADEA coverage and employment benefits are not affected by this exemption. The exemption allows employers to adjust retiree health benefits for Medicare eligibility without violating the ADEA. It applies to existing and new employee health benefit plans but not to active employees eligible for Medicare. The Supreme Court upheld the EEOC regulation on retiree health benefits, which remains in effect."
