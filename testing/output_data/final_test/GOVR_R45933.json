    "content": "The World Health Organization reported a new Ebola outbreak in eastern DRC in August 2018, following the end of a previous outbreak in the west. As of September 2019, there have been 3,175 cases and 2,119 deaths in the current outbreak. The outbreak is the 10th on record in DRC and the second largest ever. Cases have been concentrated in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, where conflicts have complicated control efforts. The number of new cases per week has slowly decreased since peaking in April 2019. The current Ebola outbreak in eastern DRC coincided with a tense political transition process, with delays in elections and opposition tensions. President Tshisekedi's inauguration in January 2019 led to negotiations with predecessor Kabila's coalition, delaying the formation of a new cabinet until August 2019. This complicated relations between national and local officials, potentially hindering the Ebola response efforts. Several factors have hindered Ebola control efforts in eastern DRC, including low awareness of Ebola symptoms, community distrust of health interventions, delayed visits to health facilities, and lapses in infection prevention control. Various disruptions such as attacks by militia groups, political protests, health worker strikes, and security force abuses have also impeded the response. In mid-September, violent attacks in Lwemba, Ituri Province led to the indefinite suspension of Ebola control activities, resulting in new cases stemming from unknown transmission chains and deaths occurring outside treatment centers. USAID Administrator Mark Green highlighted challenges in DRC's health care system, political tensions, and instability in containing Ebola. Reports of cases in major cities and cross-border cases in Uganda have raised concerns. Decades of corrupt rule have eroded trust in institutions among the Congolese people. Between June and August 2019, four cross-border Ebola cases were detected in Uganda. Concerns have now shifted to suspected cases in Tanzania, with WHO sending protective equipment and vaccines to the country. Tanzanian authorities deny any confirmed or suspected cases, but WHO recommends secondary confirmation testing for sick patients. As of September 21, no cases had received this testing. Neighboring countries with limited state capacity, such as South Sudan, Burundi, and Central Africa Republic, are also at risk for Ebola spread. Outbreak control and treatment activities for Ebola in countries like DRC and Central Africa Republic are challenging due to minimal state capacity and ongoing conflicts. DRC government employees and international organizations are leading efforts, with support from U.N. agencies, the World Bank, and foreign governments. Key protocols include infection prevention, patient management in Ebola Treatment Centers, fever surveillance, contact tracing, and community awareness. The WHO and DRC Ministry of Health released a strategic response plan to combat the Ebola epidemic in eastern DRC, seeking additional donor funds and international support. The plan aims to cost over $462 million, with $288 million allocated for the public health response. The strategic response plan to combat the Ebola epidemic in eastern DRC aims to cost over $462 million, with $288 million allocated for the public health response. The World Bank announced a $300 million contribution towards the plan, focusing on strengthening political commitment, operational support, community involvement, financial planning, and preparedness. The World Bank and WHO are seeking additional support for the Ebola epidemic in DRC. As of September 11, 2019, WHO had received less than $60 million of the $288 million needed for the public health response. The United States is the top donor, providing almost $158 million. DRC government employees and Congolese nationals are the primary responders on the ground. The DRC government has taken charge of the health response to the Ebola outbreak, with Congolese doctors and nurses leading the frontline efforts. President Tshisekedi transferred coordination responsibilities to an expert committee headed by Dr. Jean-Jacques Muyembe, who reports directly to the president. The government has provided health workers, hired local frontline workers, organized volunteers, and offered certain health services free of charge with donor support. Dr. Jean-Jacques Muyembe, an Ebola expert, was appointed by President Tshisekedi to lead the response in DRC. This led to the resignation of Health Minister Dr. Oly Ilunga due to a perceived loss of authority and disagreements over the Ebola response. Internal power struggles over policy and control of funds for Ebola response have emerged. An internal power struggle over policy and control of funds for Ebola response has led to the appointment of U.N. Emergency Ebola Response Coordinator David Gressly to enhance coordination and support efforts. Gressly is focusing on political engagement, financial tracking, humanitarian coordination, and preparedness planning in Goma and surrounding countries. The WHO has deployed 700 personnel to DRC for the Ebola outbreak, focusing on detection, isolation, community engagement, and health system strengthening. Regional readiness exercises and assessments are being coordinated in neighboring countries. Vaccination and disease surveillance efforts have been increased in Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi. The World Bank is also supporting the Ebola response effort. The World Bank has increased its support for the Ebola response effort in DRC by mobilizing up to $300 million, in addition to previous disbursements. The resources have funded free healthcare, essential medicines, hazard pay for health workers, and various other initiatives to strengthen the health system. The African Union Africa CDC has deployed voluntary responders to DRC and neighboring countries, including epidemiologists, anthropologists, and other experts. They have trained local health workers, set up laboratories, and provided equipment for Ebola response. USAID and CDC staff have also been deployed, with USAID announcing over $148 million in support. As of September 10, USAID had allocated $148 million for Ebola response in DRC and $9.8 million for neighboring countries. The funds were primarily from unobligated FY2015 International Disaster Assistance (IDA) funds. The United States is the top humanitarian donor to DRC and MONUSCO. USAID Administrator Green stated there is enough funding for fighting Ebola in DRC. The U.S. has allocated funds for fighting Ebola in DRC, with ongoing support from personnel in various locations. Strict movement constraints are in place due to security threats, leading to the withdrawal of personnel from the outbreak zone in September 2018. USAID has provided grant funding to NGOs and U.N. entities for Ebola response and preparedness activities. In October 2018, USAID deployed a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) to coordinate the U.S. response in support of the DRC government, the WHO, and other partners. USAID Ebola response funds have supported various activities including disease surveillance, infection prevention and control, safe burials, water and sanitation aid, medical supplies prepositioning, humanitarian coordination, and logistics. CDC personnel have provided technical support for disease surveillance, contact tracing, data management, infection control, risk communication, laboratory strengthening, and emergency management in DRC. The Department of Defense has provided laboratory training and partnered with Ugandan researchers for clinical Ebola vaccine trials. Security threats have caused temporary cessation of Ebola case management, interrupted contact tracing, and frustrated surveillance efforts in high-transmission areas. Numerous armed groups, including the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), are active in affected areas, leading to dangerous road travel with reports of militia attacks, armed robbery, and kidnappings. In April 2019, the Islamic State claimed responsibility for an incident. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for an attack on local soldiers previously attributed to the ADF, indicating emerging ties between the two groups. State security forces have been implicated in atrocities, including civilian massacres in Beni territory since 2014. Local mistrust of government officials and outsiders has led to community resistance to Ebola control efforts and attacks on health workers and facilities. Some communities in Beni and Butembo have opposed the DRC's central government, urging broader international support for political mediation and negotiated solutions. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of political mediation and engagement with opposition in addressing deep-seated political issues related to the Ebola outbreak in the DRC. There are concerns about outsiders profiting financially and international intervention driven by fear rather than concern for locals. WHO Director-General emphasized the need to avoid appearing as if they are only there for their own benefit. Local perceptions that the response to Ebola in the DRC is bringing cash into the region have led to threats against health workers. Donors are seen as more focused on preventing the spread of Ebola to their countries rather than helping Congolese communities, due to enduring health challenges like high maternal and infant mortality rates. Redirected health resources for Ebola control have caused frustrations, leading to interruptions in vaccination campaigns and limited containment of other outbreaks like measles and cholera. The Ebola outbreak in the DRC has claimed over 3,000 lives, with health workers facing challenges such as a cholera outbreak and inadequate facilities. Some health workers have been infected with Ebola due to lapses in infection prevention and control. The MoH, WHO, and partners are addressing issues in triage, case detection, and infection control. The WHO and partners are improving community engagement in Ebola response, leading to increased participation in vaccination and safe burial practices. Plans are in place to establish smaller patient transit centers closer to communities to enhance access to treatment. Replicating these activities in new hot spots remains a challenge. In August 2019, a clinical trial in DRC identified two strong Ebola treatments, leading to future patient treatment with these drugs. Congress allocated $5.1 billion for Ebola response in FY2015, with current outbreak funding drawn from unobligated IDA funds. In September 2019, $105.5 million of unobligated IDA funds were available for Ebola control. The U.S. leads in funding the Ebola response, but Congress may need to consider additional funding mechanisms. DRC's Tier III status under the TVPA triggers aid restrictions, which were not waived by President Trump in FY2019. President Trump did not waive restrictions for DRC, leading to aid limitations under the TVPA. IDA funds remain exempt from these restrictions, but concerns have been raised about the impact on humanitarian access in Ebola-affected areas. The USAID official testified before the Senate about restricted aid resources for Ebola control due to the TVPA. Two bills in Congress aim to authorize assistance for Ebola control efforts in DRC and neighboring states, bypassing TVPA restrictions. In 2019, a bill proposed $298.3 million in U.S. assistance for stabilization, global health, and economic aid to DRC, including areas affected by Ebola. Discussions have resumed on strengthening global health systems, with the U.S. and WHO launching the Global Health Security Agenda in 2014. The Trump Administration has continued support for this initiative. The White House released the United States Government Global Health Security Strategy in May 2019, supporting the extension of the Global Health Security Agenda through 2024. However, details on the extent of this support have not been fully disclosed. Congress is debating the U.S. role in global health security and funding levels for disease outbreak prevention. Funding for these efforts comes from USAID pandemic influenza and CDC global health protection line items. The House passed the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2020, and Health Extenders Act of 2019 (H.R. 4378) to authorize up to $20 million for Ebola preparedness and response activities. Other bills introduced include H.R. 2166 for U.S. engagement in the Global Health Security Agenda and H.R. 826 for research on neglected tropical diseases like Ebola."
