The provisions of this section do not apply to individuals who have participated in persecution based on certain criteria or pose a danger to the community.

Haiti is designated under the Immigration and Nationality Act for 24 months or until a democratically elected government is in place. Aliens from Haiti must meet specific requirements for eligibility. Aliens from Haiti meeting specific eligibility requirements can apply for temporary protected status if they have been continuously present in the United States since November 17, 1993, are admissible as immigrants, and register as required by the Attorney General. A registration fee may be required for this process. The Attorney General will reimburse State and local governments for costs related to Haitian nationals paroled into the US. Funding is allocated for the Community Relations Service and Cuban/Haitian migration program for fiscal years 1994-1996. Funds allocated for the Community Relations Service and Cuban/Haitian migration program for fiscal years 1994-1996 include $27,000,000 annually for the Community Relations Service and $6,000,000 annually for primary and secondary resettlement services for Cubans and Haitians paroled into the US. Additionally, a Cuban/Haitian Entrant Emergency Fund is established. Section 404 of the Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to establish a Cuban/Haitian Entrant Emergency Fund with an initial balance of $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1994 and subsequent years. This fund is to be used for Cubans and Haitians paroled into the United States for specific purposes. Funds authorized for assisting Cubans and Haitians paroled into the US under section 212(d)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act are to be used for processing, placement, and reception. If the funds exceed the estimate made by the Attorney General, and appropriations for the Cuban/Haitian Primary/Secondary Resettlement Program are insufficient, the funds shall be solely used for these purposes. The Attorney General must annually estimate the number of Cubans and Haitians to be paroled into the US under section 212(d)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, independently from budget requests for related programs. Factors considered include processing, placement, and reception. The Attorney General annually estimates the number of Cubans and Haitians to be paroled into the US under section 212(d)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, considering factors such as previous experience, current trends, and political circumstances in Cuba and Haiti."
