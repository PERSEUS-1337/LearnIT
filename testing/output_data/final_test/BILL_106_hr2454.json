    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Arctic Tundra Habitat Emergency Conservation Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purposes section. The Congress finds that the population of mid-continent light geese has grown significantly due to factors such as agricultural expansion, establishment of sanctuaries, and a decline in harvest rates. The population could reach over 6,800,000 breeding light geese in 3 years if no new wildlife management actions are taken. The Hudson Bay Lowlands Salt-Marsh ecosystem in Canada is being destroyed due to population growth of light geese. Approximately one-third of the essential habitat has been destroyed, one-third is on the brink of devastation, and the remaining one-third is overgrazed. The destruction of the Arctic tundra is negatively impacting various avian species, including Canada Goose, American Wigeon, Dowitcher, and others. The purpose of the Act is to reduce the population of mid-continent light geese by 50% by 2005 to protect the Arctic tundra. It aims to ensure the long-term conservation of these geese and the ecosystem that supports many North American migratory birds. The Act aims to control overabundant mid-continent light geese populations to protect the Arctic tundra and ensure the conservation of the ecosystem supporting North American migratory birds. The rules published by the Service on February 16, 1999, regarding the use of additional hunting methods to increase the harvest of mid-continent light geese and the establishment of a conservation order for their reduction shall have the force and effect of law. The Secretary will notify the public about these rules. This applies from the enactment of the Act until the effective date of new rules issued by the Service to control overabundant mid-continent light geese populations. The rules published by the Service on February 16, 1999, regarding hunting methods for mid-continent light geese will be in effect until new rules are issued. The Secretary has the authority to issue rules to regulate the taking of these geese under other laws. SEC. 4. COMPREHENSIVE MANAGEMENT PLAN. The Secretary must prepare a comprehensive plan for managing mid-continent light geese and conserving their habitat, including monitoring population levels, harvest recommendations, management strategies, and habitat conservation assessments. The Secretary is required to prepare a plan for managing mid-continent light geese and conserving their habitat, including population monitoring, harvest recommendations, management strategies, and habitat conservation assessments. Additionally, there is authorization for $1,000,000 to be appropriated annually for fiscal years 2000 through 2002 for conservation efforts and collaboration with Canada, States, and interested parties. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS.\n\n(1) Mid-continent light geese - Lesser snow geese and Ross' geese that migrate between Canada and specific U.S. states.\n\n(2) Secretary - The Secretary of the Interior.\n\n(3) Service - The United States Fish and Wildlife Service."
