    "content": "During the 112th, 113th, and 114th Congresses, reform-minded Senators tried to change Senate rules by majority vote on opening day, facing a supermajority hurdle. In 2015, a Senator emphasized the tradition of the majority asserting its right to amend rules at the start of a Congress. This highlights the challenge where a majority can amend rules, but reform advocates may need to navigate existing rules first. During the 112th, 113th, and 114th Congresses, reform advocates faced hurdles in changing Senate rules by majority vote on opening day due to existing rules requiring a supermajority to end debate. The repeated attempts at filibuster reform were driven by frustrations in passing civil rights legislation, with southern Members using procedural tactics to block measures. The idea that the Senate can change its procedures by majority vote on the opening day of a new Congress has been a recurring theme. The Senate's constitutional right to change procedures by majority vote on the opening day of a new Congress, specifically regarding the filibuster, is a key procedural characteristic. Examining past initiatives from 1953 to 1975 provides context for today's debates on this approach. The focus is on making it easier to constrain obstructive filibusters, with \"filibustering\" encompassing various acts to delay Senate proceedings. The filibuster in the Senate involves acts to delay and frustrate proceedings, such as objecting to unanimous consent requests and raising points of order. The right to engage in extended debate is a famous feature, highlighted in the movie \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" where a filibuster exposed wrongdoing and mobilized public opinion. Senators value extended debate for various reasons. Senators value extended debate in the Senate for reasons such as preventing bills they disagree with from becoming law, dramatizing issues for the public, protecting minority rights, ensuring thorough analysis of legislation, and checking overzealous Presidents. However, opponents argue that prolonged debate thwarts majority rule, promotes gridlock, delays or kills legislation, and blocks consideration of proposals with majority support. Senator Robert C. Byrd believes that open and unlimited debate is essential for safeguarding the liberties of a free people. Senator Byrd's views highlight the importance of extended debate in the Senate, which distinguishes it from the House of Representatives. Critics argue that filibusters go against the principle of majority rule. Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson also emphasized the importance of majority decision-making in governance. The Senate operates on the principle of majority rule, with supermajorities required in specific instances. Filibusters were not initially common and did not give the Senate a negative reputation. The Constitution and Senate rules do not define filibusters or set a time limit for debates. The Senate's history with filibusters dates back to the 19th century when unrestricted debate was not a major concern due to the Senate's smaller size and workload. However, in 1917, Rule XXII was adopted to allow a supermajority to end debate. Today, extended debate remains a significant issue in the Senate, as cloture requires a three-fifths majority to invoke, making it challenging to end talkathons. The Senate's Rule XXII requires a supermajority vote of 60 to invoke cloture and end debate on substantive issues and amendments. Recent proposals aim to revise Senate procedures to limit prolonged debate, reduce the time required to end debate, lower the cloture threshold, or require Senators to engage in a \"talking filibuster\" instead of other methods. The report focuses on amending Senate rules at the beginning of a new Congress, particularly on the \"constitutional option\" to change rules by majority vote without filibusters. Senate rules currently require a supermajority vote to end debate on proposals to amend chamber procedures. The report reviews past attempts to change Senate rules at the start of a new Congress, focusing on the nuclear option and cloture revision proposals from the 1950s to 1970s. It highlights key parliamentary and political challenges faced by advocates of rule changes. The report discusses past attempts to change Senate rules and how they may impact current efforts. It emphasizes the Senate's procedural and political factors, highlighting the chamber's unique procedural prerogatives for Senators. The Senate's unique procedural prerogatives allow Senators to stall or frustrate chamber action, especially near the close of a session. The Senate is currently highly polarized, making collaboration and compromise challenging across party lines. Factors hindering biparty cooperation in the Senate include divergent views between the two parties, intense electoral competitiveness, and the use of parliamentary tools by minority party Senators. This has led to difficulties in forming bipartisan coalitions on important issues, prompting calls for procedural reform, particularly regarding the filibuster. The filibuster is a target for procedural reform in the Senate as it is used to delay or prevent votes on measures with majority support. Former Senate Republican Whip Thomas Kuchel described it as irrelevant speechmaking to consume time and block legislation. Despite serving various purposes like informing colleagues and the public, filibusters can be difficult to stop once started. The Senate filibuster, difficult to stop, requires a three-fifths vote to end prolonged debate. Rule XXII allows for up to 30 more hours of post-cloture consideration before a vote can occur. The mere threat of extended debate can block action on measures, even with majority support. The Senate filibuster, requiring a three-fifths vote to end debate, poses a challenge for reform-minded Senators due to Rule XXII's two-thirds cloture requirement for changing Senate rules. This creates a \"Catch-22\" dilemma where mobilizing a majority for reform is not enough to achieve their objective. The Senate filibuster presents a challenge for reform-minded Senators due to Rule XXII's two-thirds cloture requirement for changing Senate rules. This requires a two-thirds supermajority to end a filibuster against a measure or motion to amend Senate rules before a majority vote on the revision itself can occur. The terms \"constitutional\" and \"nuclear\" are used interchangeably to describe changing Senate Rule XXII by majority vote to bypass the two-thirds cloture requirement. The term \"nuclear\" can apply to both options in this specific sense: the success of either the constitutional or nuclear option might trigger a parliamentary meltdown, an explosion of dilatory and obstructive tactics by Senators who vehemently oppose limitations on their ability to filibuster measures or matters. Both options might also use novel procedures to achieve their objectives. This report considers the two options separately, with the \"constitutional\" option referring to efforts at the start of a new Congress to amend Senate rules by majority vote, without regard to Rule XXII's two-thirds requirement for ending debate. Opponents argue that the Constitution does not explicitly grant the power to change rules by majority vote. The nuclear option refers to creating new precedents to prevent filibusters of specific measures in the Senate. It is a variant of the constitutional option applied during a congressional session, not at the start of a new Congress. The nuclear option involves creating new debate-ending precedents in the Senate to bypass the supermajority requirement for amending rules. This process can provoke strong reactions from Members, media, and the public as it goes against the usual legislative procedure. The Senate operates based on tradition and precedent, with precedents influencing the interpretation and application of Senate rules. The Standing Rules of the Senate can be amended by a majority vote, with Rule XXII's two-thirds vote requirement for cloture being a key issue. The Senate's constitutional rulemaking authority under Article I, Section 5 allows for amendments to the Standing Rules at any time. The Senate's Standing Rules can be amended by a majority vote, with Rule XXII's two-thirds vote requirement for cloture being a key issue. Two reform options - creating precedents or amending Senate rules - can lead to contentious floor struggles. Precedential change keeps the formal rule text unchanged but alters its application and interpretation in chamber proceedings. In 2005, Majority Leader Bill Frist faced Democratic filibusters against judicial nominees and considered changing Rule XXII through a precedent. In 2005, Majority Leader Bill Frist considered using the nuclear option to overcome Democratic filibusters against judicial nominees. He aimed to establish a Senate precedent by majority vote to end filibusters and confirm nominees. The strategy involved bringing a controversial nominee to the floor, facing a failed cloture vote, and then raising a point of order for a majority vote to invoke cloture, ultimately bypassing the two-thirds cloture requirement. The Senate's President, Vice President Dick Cheney, might sustain a point of order that could contradict Senate precedents. If unchallenged, it would set a new precedent, but the minority leader is likely to appeal. The majority leader would then move to table the appeal, affirming the Chair's ruling and ending debate on a judicial nomination. The bipartisan \"Gang of 14\" successfully reached a compromise to avoid the nuclear option of ending judicial filibusters by majority vote. Seven Democrats and seven Republicans agreed not to support forcing a vote on judicial nominations by means other than unanimous consent or Rule XXII. In return, Democrats promised not to filibuster certain pending judicial appointments. The bipartisan \"Gang of 14\" compromise averted a high-stakes parliamentary showdown over ending filibusters on judicial nominations. Senator Frist's unrealized plan for procedural change highlighted the importance of majority leader support and having a supporter presiding during floor proceedings. The importance of having a supporter presiding during floor proceedings is highlighted in the process of ending filibusters on judicial nominees. The majority leader should expect an appeal of the Chair's ruling, which can be tabled by a non-debatable motion agreed to by majority vote. The favorable ruling of the Chair is crucial for securing the desired precedent. The Senate majority leader faces challenges in parliamentary situations due to unlimited debate on appeals and the ineffectiveness of tabling motions. Reform-minded Senators argue for the ability to change procedural rules with a majority vote at the start of a new Congress. The cloture rule in the Senate is considered unconstitutional as it hinders the Senate from amending its rules. Democratic Senator Frank Church argued in 1969 that a new Congress allows for changes in procedures with a majority vote, bypassing rules from the previous Congress. Once rule XXII is accepted at the start of a new Congress, it becomes difficult to change due to the required two-thirds vote. Senator Church argued that the Senate can make rule changes with a majority vote at the start of a new Congress, challenging the traditional view of the Senate as a continuing body with unbroken traditions since the Second Congress. The continuing body doctrine emphasizes that the Senate always has a quorum to conduct business, with only one-third of its membership up for election every two years. The Founding Fathers enabled two-thirds of the Senate to operate as a continuing body by only electing one-third of the membership every two years. Long-standing practices, such as officers serving until successors are named and rules continuing from one Congress to the next, support this doctrine. Additionally, treaties, impeachment articles, and Senate rules are treated as continuing from the Second Senate onwards. The Senate rules are considered continuing from one Congress to the next, as stated in a 1959 amendment to Senate Rule V. However, there is debate over the validity of this theory, with some arguing that the Senate can change its rules by majority vote despite the carryover of members. The Senate rules are considered continuing from one Congress to the next, but there is debate over whether the Senate can change its rules by majority vote. Some argue that the Constitution allows each newly elected Senate to change its rules at the beginning of each session, overriding Senate Rule V. The Constitution allows each newly elected Senate to change its rules at the beginning of each session, overriding any fine-spun theory about a continuing body. In the 1950s, Senate reformers argued for the Senate's right to adopt its Standing Rules at the start of a new Congress without facing a supermajority hurdle. Their goal was to amend Rule XXII and eliminate the continuing body doctrine, influenced by changes made to Rule XXII in 1949. In the 1950s, Senate reformers sought to change Rule XXII to eliminate the supermajority requirement for adopting new Senate rules. Led by Senator Clinton Anderson, they believed invoking the constitutional option was the only way to achieve this goal without facing a filibuster. The Senate reformers in the 1950s aimed to change Rule XXII by eliminating the supermajority requirement for adopting new Senate rules. They rejected the nuclear option and focused on revising Rule XXII rather than all Senate rules. Various parliamentary topics were discussed repeatedly over the years during debates on revising Senate rules. The Senate reformers in the 1950s aimed to change Rule XXII by eliminating the supermajority requirement for adopting new Senate rules. On January 6, 1953, Senator Clinton Anderson moved for immediate consideration of new rules for the Senate of the Eighty-third Congress, arguing that the Senate was operating without rules at the time. Democratic Senator Paul Douglas contended that in the absence of Senate rules, general parliamentary law governed until a majority adopted new rules. Senator Anderson's goal was to retain the Senate's previous rules with one exception: amending Rule XXII to reduce the number required to invoke cloture. Majority Leader Robert Taft mentioned various ways to address Anderson's motion, including extended debate, a non-debatable motion to table, or raising a point of order. Taft argued that the Senate is a continuing body with continuing rules, and it was now suggested that the Senate must operate under Robert's Rules of Order or other parliamentary laws. Senator Taft argued that the Senate, as a continuing body, should operate under existing rules without the need to readopt them at the start of every new Congress. Supporters of majority cloture believed that the Senate can amend its rules by majority vote, despite the obstacle of Rule XXII preventing its amendment. Senator Humphrey argued that the Senate has the right to adopt its own rules on opening day, regardless of rules adopted by previous Senates. He emphasized that acquiescence to past rules does not mean the Senate has renounced its constitutional power to make its own rules. Majority Leader Taft, confident in tabling Anderson's motion, addressed these concerns by asserting the Senate's status as a continuing body and its ability to amend rules by majority vote. Senator Taft, confident in tabling Anderson's motion, defended the Senate's status as a continuing body and its ability to amend rules by majority vote. He emphasized tradition, precedent, and the Senate's power, stating that reformers can still protect against filibusters through proper procedures. Leader Taft ensured Senator Anderson's right to propose rules changes, but the Senate ultimately voted to table Anderson's motion by a wide margin (70 to 21). This decision maintained the existing Senate rules. Senator Anderson cited the Constitution in his motion for new rules, leading to a unanimous consent agreement for six hours of debate before the vote. Senator Wayne Morse suggested that the Senate address the issue of adopting new rules for the new Congress through specific parliamentary steps, while Senator Johnson disagreed with Morse's recommendation. Senator Johnson disagreed with Morse's recommendation on adopting new rules for the Senate at the beginning of the 85th Congress. He argued that voting on the motion to table was used in 1953 and implied a vote on changing Senate rules. The Senate later voted in favor of Johnson's tabling motion, but reform advocates received a detailed advisory opinion from Vice President Richard Nixon on the Senate's constitutional right to change its rules by majority vote at the start of a new Congress. Nixon's opinion addressed reconciling the Senate's role as a continuing body with the constitutional provision for staggered elections. The Vice President Nixon stated that any Senate rules from a previous Congress that prevent the majority in a new Congress from adopting their desired rules are unconstitutional. The Senate can only decide on the constitutionality of rules, and until a new Congress expresses otherwise, rules from the previous Congress remain in effect. Nixon argued that Senate rules from a previous Congress restricting the majority from adopting new rules are unconstitutional. Senator Richard Russell threatened to filibuster any proposed rule changes. Despite a procedural vote rejecting Anderson's motion, reformers received support from the Vice President. In the 86th Congress, reformers sought to change Senate rules by majority vote, with support from Vice President Nixon. The large Democratic victory in 1958 created a favorable climate for rules changes, with many new Democratic Senators sympathetic to reforms. Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson proposed a bipartisan filibuster rules change that was adopted unchanged, marking the first major change in a decade. On January 7, the 86th Congress saw the first major change in filibuster rules in a decade. Senator Johnson proposed a reform resolution (S. Res. 5) with bipartisan support to change the cloture requirement to two-thirds of those present and voting. The resolution also included a new clause in Senate Rule V to ensure rules continue from one Congress to the next unless changed. This was seen as a concession to Senator Russell and other southern Senators. Senator Johnson's action preempted Senator Anderson's motion to have the Senate take up for immediate consideration the adoption of rules for the 86th Congress. Johnson referred to the Senate's one-day rule and stated he would comply with the one-day written notice requirement if a Member objected to his request for immediate consideration of S. Res. 5. Senator Javits also played a role in the proceedings. Senator Johnson preempted Senator Anderson's motion for immediate consideration of adopting rules for the 86th Congress by invoking the Senate's one-day rule. Senator Javits supported Anderson and questioned the rules under which the resolution would be considered. Vice President Nixon clarified that the Senate rules allow a majority to cut off debate when changing or determining rules. Senator Johnson objected to Senator Anderson's motion to adopt Senate rules for the 86th Congress, leading to an adjournment to prevent any other motions from superseding his own. After objections from Senator Johnson, there was a discussion in the Senate about adopting new rules for the 86th Congress. Senator Anderson's motion was considered as a substitute for S. Res. 5, indicating Johnson had the votes to defeat it. Senator Johnson's strong indication of having the votes to defeat Senator Anderson's proposal and win adoption of S. Res. 5 was confirmed by Vice President Nixon. The Vice President emphasized the distinction between procedural rules at the beginning of a new Congress and during a Congress, stating that a majority can amend rules at the start of a new Congress. Senator Javits unsuccessfully attempted to remove the continuity of rules provision from S. Res. 5. Senator Mike Monroney, D-OK, warned against abandoning established Senate rules, stating that doing so would lead to chaos and allow a majority to silence the minority. He urged his colleagues not to support the Anderson motion, which he believed would rewrite the rule book and give too much power to a strong majority. Senator Monroney and Senator Thurmond expressed concerns about abandoning Senate rules, fearing it would lead to chaos and silence the minority. Senator Thurmond suggested using temporary parliamentary manuals until permanent rules were agreed upon, highlighting the time-consuming process. Senator Anderson modified his motion to address these concerns. The Senate adopted new rules, keeping all rules except Rule XXII. Reform-minded Senators dismissed concerns about chaos and minority silence. Senator Javits noted the House's quick rule adoption process. Senator Douglas believed the Senate could adopt new rules as efficiently as the House. The Senate adopted new rules, including changes to Rule XXII, allowing cloture with two-thirds of Senators present and voting, applying cloture to motions to consider rule changes, and affirming Senate rules continue. Majority Leader Johnson's tabling motion passed 60 to 36, and S. Res. 5 was adopted 72 to 22 on January 12. The 1950s debate on \"opening day\" rules changes featured issues that were also prominent in the 1960s and 1970s. Reformers encountered difficulty in getting Senate rules changed despite proposing reforms in 1953, 1957, and 1959. Amending Senate rules on opening day by majority vote proved challenging. However, history shows that with the right circumstances, unlikely changes can become possible. During the 1960s and 1970s, Senate reformers focused on amending Rule XXII, with most attempts failing except for the 1975 change. The civil rights struggle influenced the political context, leading to more Senators supporting cloture to achieve their objectives. The filibuster itself was evolving, with a significant increase in cloture votes from 1961 to 1971. The filibuster rule was adopted in 1971, leading to double and triple digit cloture votes becoming common in subsequent Congresses. Cloture was used for the first time to end a filibuster against the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Filibusters became a tool for Senators of all ideologies, with examples like Senator William Proxmire talking a bill to death in 1970. Concerns about executive power in defense and foreign policy also supported extended debate. During the 1961-1975 period, there was increased support for extended debate in defense and foreign policy areas to challenge presidential initiatives and protect congressional power. Efforts were made to revise the Senate's cloture procedure, with a focus on the political context and procedural issues influencing the outcome each year. The issue of civil rights was not prominent during the 1961 effort to revamp Rule XXII, but the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1960 was a reminder of the significant effort required. The enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1960 required significant effort to overcome opposition, with Senate debates lasting from February to April. Both Democratic and Republican platforms in 1960 supported filibuster reform, aiming for majority rule in Congress. A bipartisan group of Senators sought to amend Rule XXII instead of rewriting Senate rules entirely. The reformers opted for a narrower approach to changing the cloture rule, with two major proposals: one by Senator Anderson and Thruston Morton for cloture by three-fifths of those present and voting, and another by Senator Hubert Humphrey and Thomas Kuchel for a vote after 15 days of debate. The 1960 election of John F. Kennedy as President made Senate Democrats hesitant to start the 87th Congress with a divisive debate over revising the cloture rule. The Senate Democrats were divided over revising the cloture rule to protect JFK's \"New Frontier\" program. Despite reform-minded lawmakers arguing for rule changes, the majority leader referred the proposals to the Committee on Rules and Administration, chaired by Mansfield. This decision upset many reformers, leading to a vote that damaged their prospects for change. The reformers were aware that Vice President Johnson, who would soon take office, was not sympathetic to their cause. Senator Mansfield promised to bring the Anderson three-fifths cloture reform proposal to the Senate floor in September. Despite complaints from reformers about the timing, the majority leader proceeded with the proposal. A cloture motion was submitted to end prolonged debate, but on September 19, the Senate failed to reach an agreement. On September 19, the Senate failed to invoke cloture on the resolution. The bipartisan Senate leadership supported the reformers' goal to bring their resolutions before the Senate. Senator Anderson introduced S. Res. 4 on opening day, citing the Constitution's provision for each House to determine its rules. After introducing S. Res. 4, Senator Anderson requested immediate consideration for reducing cloture from two-thirds to three-fifths, but Senator Russell objected citing Senate Rule V. Senator Anderson also submitted a notice of motion to amend Rule XXII. The same procedure occurred with S. Res. 5, but Senator Russell objected to its immediate consideration as well. The Vice President noted that S. Res. 4 would lie over for one legislative day. The Vice President noted that S. Res. 4 would lie over for one legislative day under Senate Rule V. Majority Leader Mansfield adjourned the chamber to place the reform resolutions on the Senate's Calendar of Business. The resolutions are laid before the Senate during the morning hour, following routine morning business. If consideration of S. Res. 4 was not concluded within two hours, it would be returned to the General Orders calendar. On January 4, Senate Resolution 4 met the one-day advance notice requirements of Senate Rule V. Vice President Nixon presented the resolution to the Senate, which was then discussed by Senators before being placed on the calendar. Senator Javits inquired about the Senate proceeding under the Constitution. Senator Javits questioned the Senate's adherence to the Constitution regarding new chamber rules and the 2 o'clock rule. The Vice President explained the usual procedure for resolutions, but suggested proceeding without regard to the rule. Senator Humphrey motioned to consider S. Res. 4, leading to debates on filibuster reform and other topics. Majority Leader Mansfield announced the continuation of the day's debate. Majority Leader Mansfield concluded the day's debate and announced the usual morning hour on January 5, despite recessing the Senate. Senator Javits inquired about the effect on pending business, to which Mansfield explained that a recess would keep the resolutions in order for the morning hour. Vice President Nixon confirmed this. \"Opening day\" marks the official start of a new Congress after elections, according to reform advocates. Opening day in the view of reform advocates is a timely period for amending Senate rules by majority vote. The Senate can extend opening day over many days, weeks, or even the entire two-year Congress term. Vice President Nixon clarified that as long as no substantive business is conducted, the opening of a new Congress remains in effect, allowing the Senate to adopt its rules. Vice President Nixon clarified that the opening day of a new Congress still allows the Senate to adopt its rules under majority procedure. It would require unanimous consent to preserve this situation if other business intervened. Nixon mentioned that calling up a privileged resolution could change the procedural situation unless a unanimous consent agreement is reached. This ruling from the Chair differs from the advice of the Parliamentarian. The Vice President's ruling on the opening day of a new Congress allows the Senate to adopt rules under majority procedure. Calling up a privileged resolution could change the procedural situation unless a unanimous consent agreement is reached. The Chair's ruling, not entirely in accord with the Parliamentarian's advice, led to the majority leader withdrawing the resolution. The reformers were concerned about inadvertently acquiescing to all Senate rules from the previous Congress, which could bind them to Rule XXII's supermajority requirement. Lawmakers sought clarification on Senate actions to prevent automatic carryover of rules from one Congress to the next. Senator Richard Russell questioned Vice President Nixon on the constitutionality of this provision, to which Nixon deemed it unconstitutional. However, Nixon also discussed the Senate's status as a continuing body in his advisory opinion from 1957. The Chair's 1957 advisory opinion stated that the Senate is a continuing body and operates under rules adopted in previous sessions, but any rule inhibiting the majority's right to change or adopt new rules at the start of a new session is not valid. Senator Russell questioned the Vice President's opinion on the constitutionality of Senate rules, specifically regarding the use of the previous question motion to end debate on a reform resolution. Nixon stated that it would be the Chair's ruling, emphasizing the majority's right to make decisions on Senate rules. The Chair's ruling allows for the majority of Senators to adopt rules at the beginning of a session, including the right to bring matters to a vote by moving the previous question. Senator Russell questioned if Roberts Rules of Order would apply, to which the Chair mentioned they would be considered along with Senate procedures. The Vice President clarified that Roberts Rules would be used in conjunction with Jefferson's Manual, highlighting the use of the previous question motion to end debate. The Vice President clarified that a majority of Senators could end debate and bring rule changes to a vote by moving the previous question at the start of a new Congress. Proponents and opponents debated the continuous body doctrine in the Senate, with disagreements over the interpretation of Senate Rule XXV. Senator Russell highlighted the panels' power to act until their successors are appointed, while Senator Joseph Clark emphasized the appointment of standing committees at the beginning of each Congress. In the 1960s, reformers shifted their strategy to focus on adopting a new filibuster rule by majority vote at the start of each Congress. They relied on constitutional authority, Vice President Nixon's opinions, and Senate rules, excluding those deemed to obstruct the majority's will. Senator Russell disagreed with the Vice President's stance on which rules applied. Senator Russell disagreed with Vice President Nixon's stance on Senate rules, stating that either all rules should change or none should. Senator Clark suggested agreeing to disagree if they couldn't find common ground. Reform Senator Douglas proposed a procedural pathway to change rules at the start of each Congress, believing they had the necessary votes and support from the Vice President. At the start of a new Congress, reform Senators planned to change Senate rules with the support of Vice President Nixon. Their procedural plan included seeking recognition from the Chair, introducing a resolution to change Rule XXII, and asking for unanimous consent for its immediate consideration. The reform Senators planned to change Senate rules at the start of a new Congress with Vice President Nixon's support. They aimed to introduce a resolution to amend Rule XXII and request unanimous consent for immediate consideration. If no objection was raised, the resolution would be open for debate, but an objection was expected due to Senate rules requiring one legislative day's notice in writing for rule amendments. The Senator offering the motion would address the Chair, submit a written motion to amend a Senate rule, and request the notice to be read. The Senate would likely adjourn, not recess, to comply with the notice rule. Reform Senators aim to prevent waiving rights to amend Senate rules on opening day by objecting to transact substantive business or seeking unanimous consent. \"Opening day\" could last indefinitely until a Senate adjournment. Opponents could defeat the motion, refer it to the Committee on Rules and Administration, table the resolution, or raise a constitutional point of order. A filibuster can be launched against a resolution or the motion to call it up. Reform Senators may try to end debate, but face challenges without 67 votes to invoke cloture. The Chair must submit constitutional points of order to the Senate, even if Senate precedents are broken. The Chair is expected to make favorable rulings to facilitate changing Senate rules by majority vote, known as the constitutional option. This could involve ruling in favor of ending debate by majority vote, ignoring traditional precedents. An appeal could be made by opponents, but the Chair may recognize a reformer to table the appeal, establishing a new precedent. If the tabling motion was successful, the Senate could establish a precedent to end filibusters by majority vote on rule changes at the start of a new Congress. Senate reformers could close debate by majority vote on their reform resolution. The Chair's rulings play a crucial role in advancing Senate reform objectives. On September 15, Democratic and GOP Senators issued similar press releases criticizing the timing of bringing S. Res. 4 to the floor. Majority Leader Mansfield faced criticism for bringing S. Res. 4 to the floor amidst Senators eager to adjourn. Reformers were unhappy with Vice President Johnson's unsupportive stance and the requirement for a two-thirds vote to change rule XXII. Despite these challenges, on September 16, Mansfield moved for the Senate to consider S. Res. 4 for cloture by three-fifths majority. The Senate considered S. Res. 4 for cloture by three-fifths majority, despite facing opposition and criticism. Majority Leader Mansfield explained why the resolution was not favorably reported by the Rules Committee. He and Minority Leader Dirksen filed cloture to end debate on the measure. On September 19, the Senate voted not to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed, ending filibuster reform in the 87th Congress. The constitutional option was attempted again in the 88th Congress, but a resolution to permit three-fifths of Senators to invoke cloture was unsuccessful. Senator Anderson sponsored this resolution (S. Res. 9). During a 24-day filibuster, Southern Senators and allies blocked liberals' reform efforts to change Senate rules. Reformers tried to persuade Vice President Johnson to allow a majority vote to cut off dilatory debate on rule changes. Senator Anderson planned to move for majority vote to end debate on revising Rule XXII, but the constitutional option failed in the 87th and 88th Congresses. A reform Senator could use a nondebatable motion to table an appeal, creating a new Senate precedent to allow a majority to end debate on rules changes at the start of a new Congress. This would prevent further filibuster attempts on reforming Rule XXII. Majority Leader Mansfield aimed to focus the Senate on the rules debate. Majority Leader Mansfield announced that vacancies on committees would not be filled until rules controversies were resolved. He also stated that the Senate would meet six days a week, with extended sessions if necessary, to secure quorums quickly. The key question was whether Senate rules automatically carried over at the start of a new Congress. Senate rules, including the supermajority requirement for cloture, carried over from the previous Congress and governed proposals to change Senate rules. Majority Leader Mansfield, along with Minority Leader Dirksen, assured protection of members' rights regarding cloture reform. Senators Anderson and Humphrey planned to submit reform resolutions on January 14. The majority leader's decision on recess or adjournment at the end of a Senate session kept \"opening day\" active from a parliamentary perspective. The Senate recessed on January 9 and reconvened on January 14 when Senators Anderson and Humphrey introduced reform resolutions. The resolutions were delayed for one legislative day due to objections. The Senate adjourned on January 14 to comply with the layover requirement. The Senate then continuously recessed until February 7 when the motion to proceed to S. Res. 9 was addressed. On February 7, the Senate addressed the motion to proceed to S. Res. 9, which remained pending business until disposed of. Senator Russell asked Vice President Johnson three parliamentary inquiries to clarify the procedural situation. Senator Robertson yielded time to Senator Humphrey, who offered a substitute amendment to S. Res. 9 without debate. Senator Anderson's resolution was placed on the Calendar of General Orders, with plans to offer a motion to proceed to its consideration. Senator Robertson discussed the demerits of filibuster reform, deferring to Senator Russell before speaking. Senator Robertson deferred to Senator Russell before yielding to Senator Anderson for a motion on filibuster reform. Senator Russell, showing collegiality, allowed Senator Anderson to offer his resolution for consideration. The motion remained pending for weeks of debate. Senator Mansfield played a crucial role in filibuster reform by supporting cloture reform and ensuring fair parliamentary procedures. He prioritized the issue of extended debate in the Senate, even at the expense of legislative and executive business. His leadership was instrumental in keeping the focus on changes to Senate rules, making it difficult for opponents of reform to block revisions to the cloture rule. The Senate debate focused on the concept of the Senate as a continuing body, with Senators citing various sources to support this idea. Senator Russell argued that the Senate is a continuing body due to the staggered election of its members, while Senator Robertson emphasized the historical continuity of the Senate since its organization in 1789. The Senate debate centered on whether it is a continuing body, with Senators discussing its historical continuity and the right to amend rules regardless of this concept. Senator Anderson argued that the Senate's status as a continuing body did not affect its ability to change rules, a view supported by Senators Javits and Humphrey. The debate in the Senate revolves around whether it is a continuous body, with arguments for the carryover of rules based on the continuity of Senators. However, Senator Humphrey pointed out discontinuous aspects of the Senate, questioning the assumption that the carryover of two-thirds of the Senate always results in a majority in favor of the rules. This disagreement highlights the differing views on the continuity of Senate rules. The debate in the Senate centers on the continuity of Senate rules, with Senator Russell and Anderson supporters disagreeing on Rule XXII. Senator Russell criticized the reformers' plan to close debate on S. Res. 9, calling it \"extraordinary.\" Senator Anderson clarified that they support constitutional rules but reserve the right to vote on constitutionality. The reformers hoped Vice President Johnson would support the constitutional option when Senator Anderson moves to close debate. On January 28, Senator Anderson attempted to close debate on S. Res. 9 using the constitutional option, but Vice President Johnson disputed his authority to rule on a constitutional point of order. The Vice President questioned the authority of a Senator to rule on a constitutional point of order regarding the Senate rules. Senator Anderson raised the issue of amending Rule XXII as the first order of business in the Senate. Rule XXII was discussed during a debate in Congress, with Senator Keating questioning the Chair about the power to rescind a submission and render a ruling on a motion if dilatory tactics were used. Vice President Johnson asked for the authority for such actions, to which Keating inquired about ways to bring the motion to a vote. The Vice President noted the historical precedent of Presiding Officers having such authority since 1803. The Vice President, in response to Senator Keating's inquiry about ways to bring a motion to a vote, noted the historical precedent of Presiding Officers having the authority to rule on constitutional questions since 1803. Majority Leader Mansfield raised concerns about the Vice President potentially becoming a dictator of the Senate if he ruled on such questions. Senator Keating continued to press the point by asking about ways to terminate debate on the subject. Vice President Johnson identified four ways to do so. Senator Keating inquired about ways to terminate debate, and Vice President Johnson outlined four methods: a motion to table, agreement among Senators, cloture rule, or majority decision. Johnson emphasized that the power to cut off debate lies with the Senators, not the Chair. Senator Russell strongly rejected the idea of the Vice President having inherent power to end debate, calling it undemocratic and against free government principles. Senator Humphrey joined the debate, arguing about the right of a majority to change rules without being blocked by a minority. He questioned the constitutionality of endless debate and suggested using methods like the previous question or the Vice President's power to allow a majority to change Senate rules. Senator Humphrey and Senator Keating emphasized the need for the Vice President to use their constitutional authority to change Senate rules and prevent endless debate. They argued that the Presiding Officer must have the power to make rulings to maintain order and prevent tactics that undermine debate. The Vice President's authority to end debate and bring a matter to a vote in the Senate was debated. Senator Javits argued that the Chair is not required by law to submit a constitutional question to the Senate, despite precedents suggesting otherwise. GOP Senator Case urged the Vice President to help the Senate reach a conclusion, while the Vice President maintained his stance on not exercising authority he does not believe he has. Majority Leader Mansfield emphasized the Senate's autonomy in attending to its own business, while the debate on filibuster reform continued with Senators expressing strong opinions. GOP Senator George Aiken and others prioritized national defense and essential Senate business over the reform issue. On January 30, Senate leaders Mansfield and Dirksen proposed a unanimous consent agreement to resume consideration of a question regarding the Senate's right to terminate debate and proceed to an immediate vote on a rule change. After 3 hours of debate, the Senate would vote on tabling the question. The Senate proceeded to vote on tabling the question regarding cloture reform. Proponents and opponents discussed the consequences of adopting or rejecting the unanimous consent agreement (UCA). Senator Javits inquired about the implications of tabling the question, to which the Vice President clarified that the Senate would revert to the original motion. The Senate voted to table the question on cloture reform, with Senator Javits seeking clarification on the implications. After three hours of debate, the Senate voted 53 to 42 to table the question submitted by the Vice President. The Vice President then called for a vote on proceeding with Senate Resolution 9 for filibuster reform. Senator Mansfield expressed doubt about the Senate ever reaching a direct vote on S. Res. 9 due to potential dilatory motions by opponents. To expedite action and test Senators' sentiment, Majority Leader Mansfield announced a motion to table the motion to proceed to S. Res. 9, anticipating its failure. Senator Mansfield introduced a tabling motion to expedite action on S. Res. 9, but it failed. He then introduced a cloture motion to end debate on the resolution, stating that if it didn't receive enough votes, he would make a motion to adjourn. The tabling motion failed with 5 yeas and 92 nays, leading to a cloture vote the next day. Senator Mansfield introduced a cloture motion to end debate on S. Res. 9, stating that if the vote for cloture was less than 60, he would move to adjourn. The vote for cloture was 54 ayes and 42 nays. After the cloture motion was defeated, Senator Mansfield immediately moved to adjourn, which was approved with a vote of 64 to 33, ending filibuster reform for the 88th Congress. During the debate, two reform Senators questioned the establishment of a new Senate precedent by filibustering the motion to proceed. Senator Humphrey noted that it was unusual for any Senator to object to a motion to consider in the Senate. Senator Anderson supported Senator Humphrey's remarks, emphasizing the importance of allowing debates on proposed measures in Congress. He expressed concern that a new precedent had been set where filibusters would delay the consideration of bills, potentially hindering the Senate's efficiency. The bipartisan group of reform-minded Senators proposed changes to Rule XXII but were unsuccessful. The effort to revise the rule ended after the resolutions were referred to the Committee on Rules and Administration. The Senate's ability to invoke cloture on the Civil Rights Act of 1964 reduced the intensity for revising Rule XXII. The intensity for revising Rule XXII was not strong due to focus on the \"Great Society\" program. Senator Anderson planned to submit a resolution to amend Rule XXII, with assurances from Senator Javits. Senator Anderson introduced his resolution (S. Res. 6) for cloture by three-fifths of Senators voting, despite objections from GOP leader Dirksen. Senator Douglas also introduced a resolution for majority cloture (S. Res. 8). Senator Douglas submitted a notice of intent to amend Senate rules after an objection to the immediate consideration of his resolution. Majority Leader Mansfield clarified that routine business during the morning hour would not affect any proposed amendments to Senate rules. Senator Dirksen moved for S. Res. 6 to be referred to the Committee on Rules and Administration. Senator Douglas asked Senator Dirksen if he could offer his proposal before speaking, but Dirksen declined, focusing solely on S. Res. 6. A debate ensued on filibuster reform, with Senator Anderson proposing an amendment to refer the resolution to the Committee on Rules and Administration for a report by January 25, 1965, preserving existing rights. Senator Russell raised points of order against Anderson's motion, arguing it couldn't apply to resolutions not before the Senate. Senator Anderson's motion aimed to instruct the committee on resolutions not yet offered, which was challenged by Senator Russell as contrary to Senate rules. President pro tempore Carl Hayden ruled that the instruction to the committee was in order, but not the instruction to the Senate itself. The resolution under consideration was then sent to the calendar. The resolution under consideration now goes to the calendar under Senate rules. Senator Anderson moved to proceed to Senate Resolution 6, which was noted as debatable by Republican leader Dirksen. After a discussion on the Chair's ruling, Senator Douglas expressed concern over the ruling being inaudible and implied the end of \"opening day.\" The majority leader then recessed the Senate due to the escalating situation. The Senate was recessed until the next day due to controversy surrounding an inaudible ruling that upheld a point of order. Senator Russell believed the ruling was binding as no reform Senator appealed it, while Senator Douglas criticized the ruling as unfair. The possibility of adopting previous rules in full was discussed in relation to committee appointments. The Senate debated whether to adopt previous rules in full, including Rule XXII. Senator Douglas questioned if reform advocates would be bound by all Senate rules, but the Chair assured that constitutional rights would not be lost. Senator Russell believed the Chair's ruling was binding, while Senator Douglas advised against viewing it as such. The outcome of the discussion was unclear. The Senate debated the adoption of previous rules, including Rule XXII. Senator Douglas questioned if reform advocates would be bound by all Senate rules, but the Chair assured that constitutional rights would not be lost. Senator Russell believed the Chair's ruling was binding, while Senator Douglas advised against viewing it as such. The Chair's inaudible ruling was not overturned, leading to a discussion on the importance of Senators hearing rulings for appeals. The Senate recessed, and on January 11, Majority Leader Mansfield received unanimous consent to refer resolutions to the Committee on Rules and Administration for a report on March 9, 1965. Senator Anderson sought assurance that existing rights would be protected, to which Senator Mansfield confirmed. Senator Anderson mentioned that senatorial agreement was reached on Mansfield's request for unanimous consent. The committee issued a negative report on two resolutions in the 89th Congress, which were not further considered. A bipartisan group led by George McGovern and Thruston Morton proposed amending Rule XXII to allow cloture by three-fifths of those voting. Despite optimism for change, the attempt was unsuccessful. Notably, a parliamentary procedure called a \"compound motion\" was devised during this effort. A parliamentary procedure called a \"compound motion\" was devised to potentially amend Rule XXII by majority vote at the beginning of a Congress. Reformers and opposition leaders strategized after the 1966 elections. Majority Leader Mansfield stated no business would be conducted before the State of the Union message. Reform Senators secured assurances to protect the rights of every Senator regarding Rule XXII amendments. The reformers aimed to establish the principle that each new Congress could adopt its own rules by majority vote. Reform Senators aimed to adopt new Senate rules by majority vote at the start of a new Congress, ensuring that revisions would not be nullified by legislative business. They sought to end filibusters on rule changes without supermajority requirements, emphasizing the precedence of Article I, Section 5 of the Constitution over Rule XXII. Senator Russell, the opposition leader, questioned the need for such changes. Senator McGovern introduced S. Res. 6 to change the cloture requirement from two-thirds to three-fifths, but faced objection due to Senate rules requiring resolutions to lie over for a day unless there is unanimous consent. GOP Senator Kuchel introduced S. Res. 7 to allow an absolute majority to invoke cloture, leading to debate among Senators. Vice President Humphrey clarified Senate rules, and Majority Leader Mansfield scheduled S. Res. 6 for discussion on a new legislative day. During the morning business period, amendments were filed to S. Res. 6 and S. Res. 7, but were not acted upon. Senator Russell discussed the deficiencies of S. Res. 6 and the uniqueness of the Senate as a deliberative body before Senator McGovern moved for the Senate to consider the resolution. Senator McGovern moved for the Senate to consider Senate Resolution 6, emphasizing the need for cloture reform. He later sought to end debate on the motion, proposing a two-hour time limit that was objected to by Senator Dirksen. Despite efforts to achieve unanimous consent, a compound motion with two directives sparked debate. Senator McGovern proposed a compound motion to implement the constitutional option for cloture reform, emphasizing it would not set a precedent. The motion aimed to close debate on Senate Resolution 6 by following constitutional procedures for a yea-and-nay vote and two hours of debate. Senator McGovern proposed a motion for cloture reform on Senate Resolution 6, with two hours of debate and a yea-and-nay vote. Senator Russell and Vice President Humphrey discussed the motion's division and raised points of order against it. Minority Leader Dirksen argued that the motion was out of order and not a constitutional question. The Vice President disagreed with Senator McGovern's motion for cloture reform, stating it went against Senate rules and parliamentary procedure. He raised constitutional questions and submitted the matter for Senate consideration. Majority Leader Mansfield and others questioned the Vice President, revealing the reformers' strategy to end debate on the motion. If Dirksen's point of order was tabled by a simple majority, it would establish a significant precedent. If Dirksen's point of order was tabled by a simple majority, it would establish the \"propriety\" of McGovern's motion. The pending business would then be the motion to proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 6. If the Senate tabled the point of order, there would be two hours of debate followed by a vote on the motion to proceed. Vice President Humphrey emphasized that if the motion to table was agreed to, the Senate would be bound by the instructions in McGovern's motion. At least four procedural votes were possible, all to be decided by majority vote. At least four procedural votes were possible, all to be decided by majority vote of the Senate: (1) on the motion to table the point of order; (2) on the first part of McGovern's basic motion\u2014implementing Senator Russell's earlier request for a division of the resolution; (3) on the proviso in McGovern's motion to allow two hours of debate; and (4) on the motion to take up S. Res. 6. Senator McGovern's motion was controversial, with opponents criticizing it as cloture by a simple majority and destructive of Senate rules, while proponents argued that the Senate would determine its course of action. During the debate, motions could be made in order of preference as per Senate rules. Reform Senator Clifford Case dismissed concerns about setting bad precedent, emphasizing the Senate's constitutional right to change its rules. Senator Javits noted the potential for presiding officers to act arbitrarily, ignoring Senators and rushing votes. The discussion highlighted fears of future tyranny within the Senate. Senator McGovern's motion to table the Dirksen point of order was rejected by a vote of 37 yeas and 61 nays. The Senate voted to sustain the point of order by a 59 to 37 vote, leading to Majority Leader Mansfield's intent to adjourn the Senate and return S. Res. 6 to the calendar. On January 19, Senator Mansfield planned to renew the motion to proceed to S. Res. 6 and file cloture with Senator Dirksen and Senator McGovern. A bipartisan group of 31 Senators submitted a cloture motion on January 19. On January 24, there was debate on invoking cloture, with Senator Mansfield emphasizing the need for a vote on the substantive issue and Senator Dirksen stating no public outcry for changing the two-thirds rule for cloture. Senator Mansfield and a bipartisan group of 31 Senators submitted a cloture motion on January 19 for S. Res. 6. Despite no public outcry for changing the two-thirds rule required to invoke cloture, 53 Senators voted to end debate on the motion, falling short of the two-thirds supermajority needed. Senator Mansfield considered submitting a second cloture motion but deemed it unnecessary after the initial vote. Senator Mansfield adjourned the Senate, returning S. Res. 6 to the Calendar of General Orders, ending consideration of reform resolutions. Senator McGovern argued against the Senate being a continuing body, stating that only two-thirds carry over from Congress to Congress. He refuted the idea that rules carry over with the Senate, emphasizing the impact of newly elected Senators. The newly elected Senators may change the majority view of the rules, as illustrated by the shifting of the Senate from party to party over the years. Senator McGovern raised the idea that a national calamity could affect Senate operations, leading to a situation where the membership is not carried over. Senator Holland opposed the resolution, stating it would destroy Rule XXII. Senator Holland and Senator Thurmond argued against the proposed resolution to reform the filibuster rules, emphasizing the importance of maintaining the stability and continuity of the Senate as a body. Senator Ervin criticized the idea that rules could be changed by majority vote at the beginning of each session, calling it an absurdity. The Senate debated changing the cloture rule from two-thirds to three-fifths of Senators present and voting. Reform-minded Members sought support for the three-fifths change to Rule XXII. Support for modifying Rule XXII was significant, particularly for the three-fifths change. Senators Hart and Javits decided not to introduce their majority cloture proposal, aiming to consolidate strength in the Senate behind the 60 percent amendment. Their fundamental objective was to establish the principle that the Senate can change its own rules at the start of each Congress without being bound by those rules. Senator Church noted Senator Anderson's absence in leading the fight for the three-fifths change due to heavy Senate responsibilities. Additionally, Vice President Hubert Humphrey was still in office until Republican Spiro Agnew assumed the role of President of the Senate. Spiro Agnew assumed the role of President of the Senate on January 21. Senator Church introduced S. Res. 11 to change Senate rules at the start of a new Congress. Vice President Humphrey's role was significant in laying out a procedural strategy for reformers' objectives. The 91st Congress opened on January 3, with Majority Leader Mansfield announcing that no bills or resolutions would be introduced until after the President's State of the Union address. At the opening of a new Congress, a resolution was submitted to amend Senate rule XXII. Senator Church's motion to amend Senate rules was objected to by Senator Holland, causing the resolution to be delayed for one day. Senator Javits inquired about the impact of the proposed amendment on constitutional rights. The Chair rejected the suggestion that opening day conferred special rights, stating that it is unnecessary to protect any constitutional right as it can be asserted at any time. Senator Mansfield adjourned the Senate to meet a one-day layover requirement and subsequently recessed it through January 28. Senators generally accepted that \"opening day\" could extend for several days during consideration of S. Res. 11. Senators generally accepted that \"opening day\" could extend for several weeks. On January 10, Senator Hart moved for the consideration of Senate Resolution 11, which aimed to amend Rule XXII to reduce the cloture requirement to three-fifths. Senator Church defended the resolution, emphasizing the need to empower a majority of Senators to adopt cloture rules without hindrance from minority factions. He clarified that the Senate is not a continuing body in the larger sense. Senator Church argued that the Senate is not a continuing body and emphasized the need for a majority of Senators to adopt cloture rules without hindrance from minority factions. Senator Holland criticized S. Res. 11, stating that it could set a precedent for a transient majority to change any Senate rule, which he deemed a \"real disaster.\" Senator Holland criticized S. Res. 11, stating that granting sweeping power to a mere majority would be a real disaster, damaging the Senate's prestige and weakening its ability to ensure stability in the government. He argued that the Senate should follow regular procedures, including consideration by the Committee on Rules and Administration, as the Founding Fathers intended the Senate to provide stability to the government. Senator Javits emphasized that the Senate has the constitutional authority to change any rule by majority vote at the start of a new Congress, arguing that rules hindering this are against the Constitution. He stated that reformers accept all Senate rules except those that undermine the majority's authority to act. Senator Javits argued for the Senate's constitutional authority to change rules by majority vote, stating that reformers accept all rules except those that hinder the majority's ability to act. Senator Holland disagreed with this approach, finding it unusual that reform Senators would accept all rules except the one requiring adherence to Senate procedures. Senator Javits and Senator Holland disagreed on the Senate rule that carries over from Congress to Congress. Javits argued for the Senate's authority to change rules by majority vote, while Holland found it unusual that reform Senators would accept all rules except the one requiring adherence to Senate procedures. Vice President Humphrey was prepared to rule on whether the Senate can amend its rules at the beginning of a Congress. The cloture motion filed by Senator Church and colleagues aimed to bring debate to a close on S. Res. 11. Senator Church questioned the Vice President on the outcome if a majority, but less than two-thirds, voted in favor of cloture, highlighting a constitutional question on the validity of rule XXII. The Chair clarifies the requirement for an affirmative vote by two-thirds of the Senate before considering a proposed change in the rules, emphasizing the Senate's right to determine or change its rules. The Chair clarifies the two-thirds requirement of rule XXII for cloture on Senate Resolution 11 to amend the rule at the opening of a new Congress. The Vice President faces questions from Senators after outlining the parliamentary procedure. The Vice President faced opposition from Senators, including Senator Holland, who criticized his proposed ruling on Rule XXII. Other Senators expressed dismay with the Chair's decision, with Senator Talmadge questioning the Senate's status as a continuing body. The Vice President faced opposition from Senators, including Senator Holland, who criticized his proposed ruling on Rule XXII. Senator Talmadge questioned the Senate's status as a continuing body, and challenged the Vice President's authority to gag Senators. The Vice President clarified that he did not say Rule XXII was unconstitutional, but wanted the Senate to decide on its constitutionality. The Chair clarified that the question posed challenges the constitutionality of rule XXII, not that the rule itself is unconstitutional. Senators can test the rules for constitutionality, and the Senate's rules can be changed by a majority at any time. The Vice President emphasized that cloture proceedings were not being contested. The Vice President explained that the Senate can change its rules by majority vote, but rule XXII requires a two-thirds vote to limit debate. The Senate can establish any rule it wants by majority vote, including those requiring more than a bare majority to silence Senators. The Vice President explained that the Senate can change its rules by majority vote, but rule XXII requires a two-thirds vote to limit debate. Other Senators criticized the Vice President's planned ruling, arguing that it would give him too much power over the Senate. Vice President Humphrey defended his position, stating that the Senate should decide the constitutional question by majority vote. On January 16, Senators voted 51 yeas and 47 nays to invoke cloture on Senate Resolution 11, deciding the constitutional issue by majority vote. The Vice President's decision led to majority cloture on Senate Resolution 11, but Senator Holland appealed, arguing against the Chair's authority. The Senate voted 45 yeas to 53 nays, overturning the Chair's ruling and continuing the debate on the motion to proceed. The sudden reversal in the Senate's decision on cloture was influenced by six Senators changing their positions, with uncertainty surrounding the reasons. Majority Leader Mansfield's stance on cloture and Minority Leader Dirksen's reminder of the Republicans' minority status played a role in the vote changes. Nixon assured that the freedom of the Senate would not be compromised. Six Senators supported bringing the debate on unlimited debate to a vote but disagreed on changing the filibuster rule by a simple majority. Vice President Humphrey introduced a method for reformers to use the constitutional option at the start of a Congress. This \"Humphrey precedent\" allowed for cloture to be invoked with further debate under Rule XXII. The Senate faced a cloture motion to end debate on a resolution, with the possibility of changing rules by majority vote at the start of a new Congress. Senator Church filed the motion, requiring two-thirds of Senators to end debate. The constitutional question of whether a majority suffices to limit debate at the beginning of a Congress was raised. The Senate voted on a motion to limit debate at the start of the 91st Congress, but fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to invoke cloture. Senators Church and Pearson introduced a resolution to reduce the threshold to three-fifths of those present and voting. The reformers argued that a majority at the beginning of a new Congress has the right to change Senate rules. Reformers were optimistic about amending Rule XXII to allow for easier cloture. Majority Leader Mansfield supported reform, noting opposition softening after a logjam in the previous Congress. Despite gaining strength, efforts to modify Rule XXII fell short, with four unsuccessful cloture attempts over six weeks. Four unsuccessful attempts to invoke cloture on amending Rule XXII were made over six weeks, with majority support but not the required two-thirds. Opposition to reform was led by Senators James Allen and Sam Ervin, who argued that extended debate protects minority rights and ensures small states' voices are heard. They also claimed the filibuster was necessary to challenge the executive's growing power. The filibuster was seen as essential to challenge the executive branch's power, especially during the Vietnam War. Liberal Senators also used the filibuster to block unwanted legislation. In the 92nd Congress, debate on amending Senate rules was postponed, and Senator Church introduced S. Res. 9 under Rule XIV. Senator Church introduced S. Res. 9 to amend Senate rules, which will be considered and debated the next legislative day. Vice President Agnew presented S. Res. 9 to the Senate the following day, and it will be subject to debate until the end of the morning hour before going to the calendar. Senator Church introduced S. Res. 9 to amend Senate rules, which will be debated the next legislative day. The Vice President presented the resolution, leading to a debate on modifying Rule XXII. After the morning hour, the resolution was moved to the calendar. Senator Pearson then motioned for consideration of S. Res. 9, which was postponed to the next legislative day by Senator Allen. Allen discussed the issues with S. Res. 9 in detail. Senator Allen criticized S. Res. 9 and highlighted the benefits of extended debate, noting that the Senate continued to transact business without major disruptions. He described the debate as a benign and benevolent filibuster, emphasizing that Senators had no trouble bringing up other matters for consideration. Senator Allen defended extended debate and criticized S. Res. 9, highlighting the Senate's ability to transact business without major disruptions. He emphasized that Senators could bring up other matters for consideration without objection. Senator Allen and Senator Byrd, who opposed filibuster reform, had conflicting goals regarding procedural control on the Senate floor. Senator Byrd and Senator Allen engaged in a competitive procedural exchange on the Senate floor regarding the implications of recessing or adjourning the Senate. Senator Byrd requested a recess until the following Tuesday, which Senator Allen questioned, leading to a discussion about the possibility of morning business and special allocations of time. Senator Allen and Senator Byrd debated the impact of recessing versus adjourning the Senate, specifically focusing on the limitations on speeches during a legislative day. Senator Byrd explained that recessing allows for routine morning business without changing the morning hour, while Senator Allen highlighted the restriction on the number of speeches a Senator can make within a legislative day. Senator Byrd and Senator Allen discussed the difference between recessing and adjourning the Senate, with Senator Allen questioning the impact on the motion to proceed to Senate Resolution 9. Senator Allen expressed no objection to the change from adjournment to recess, highlighting the potential limitations on the number of speeches a Senator can make within a legislative day. During the morning hour at 2 p.m., the motion to proceed to S. Res. 9 would not die and would continue to be debatable. Anti-filibuster Senators were notably absent in the debate on S. Res. 9, with Senator Church offering a cloture motion to end debate. Senator Ervin inquired about the cloture motion. Senator Ervin questioned the validity of the cloture motion to end debate on S. Res. 9, stating that there was no actual debate to close as proponents of the resolution were absent. Senator Church acknowledged Ervin's point. During the debate on S. Res. 9, Senator Ervin noted the burden on opponents due to lack of engagement from filibuster reformers. Proponents eventually advocated for the resolution, with minimal debate possibly due to familiarity with opposing arguments and a light legislative calendar. During the debate on S. Res. 9, reformers focused on private discussions with key figures like Vice President Agnew and Senators to enhance their chances of success. However, Vice President Agnew stated he had no intention of issuing advisory opinions on hypothetical cases, which was seen as a setback for the reformers. Senator Javits urged Vice President Agnew to follow the Humphrey precedent of 1969 regarding cloture rules in the Senate. Agnew did not accept the suggestion, leading to a debate on whether the Senate is a continuing body with continuing rules. This debate would determine the process for amending Rule XXII and potentially ending filibusters. Senator Allen challenged the reformers' view that the Senate is not a continuing body by questioning the need to amend Rule XXII. He argued that accepting the continuity of Senate rules implies the necessity of rule XXII to end debate, which requires a two-thirds vote. Without rule XXII, there is no right to cut off debate, so the reformers must accept and amend this rule they claim does not exist. Senator Allen emphasized the Senate's full adherence to its rules in the context of the reform proposal. Senator Allen emphasized the Senate's adherence to its rules, stating that they carry forward unless amended. He argued against the idea of the Senate not being a continuing body and the need to establish new procedural rules each Congress. Proponents of revising Rule XXII disagreed with this view. The debate in the Senate revolves around the idea of whether the Senate is a continuing body bound by procedural rules from previous sessions. Some Senators argue that only those who served in the First Congress have the right to adopt rules by majority vote. Others, like Senator Hart, question the logic of allowing past Senators to inhibit the current Senate in establishing rules. Senator Fulbright clarifies that the current Senate is not inhibited, as all that is needed is a two-thirds majority to make changes. Senator Javits argues for bypassing the filibuster process by having the Vice President rule that debate has gone on long enough. He believes that a majority vote should be sufficient to close debate, contrary to Rule XXII requiring a two-thirds majority. Senator Javits argues for bypassing the filibuster process by having the Vice President rule that debate has gone on long enough. A majority of the Senate voted to close debate, but the majority leader urged colleagues to reject the appeal, warning that it could set a precedent for cutting off debate on any issue. The appeal was ultimately tabled, ending the reform effort to amend Senate Rule XXII. Several reform advocates had a change of heart regarding Rule XXII, with Senator Cranston stating he would vote to keep it unchanged. Senator Church argued for retaining Rule XXII, highlighting the increased use of filibusters by Senators. Many Senators were frustrated with the difficulty of invoking Rule XXII under the two-thirds present and voting standard. The 1970s saw a rise in the use of the filibuster by Senators from different ideological backgrounds, no longer solely associated with racial inequality. Senators began using the filibuster more regularly to achieve their legislative goals, leading to an increase in cloture motions. This shift in perception towards the filibuster resulted in more flexibility among Senators previously staunchly in support of it. In the 1973-1974 period, procedural developments and a perception that cloture was too difficult led to reform efforts in the 94th Congress. Following the 1974 mid-term elections, a Democratic majority in the Senate worked with Vice President Nelson Rockefeller to lower the cloture threshold to three-fifths of the membership. Senators Mondale and Pearson led the push to reduce the number required to invoke cloture from two-thirds to three-fifths of Senators present and voting. The debate on S. Res. 4 in the 94th Congress aimed to lower the cloture threshold to three-fifths of Senators present and voting. This reform sought to discourage filibusters and encourage scheduling of legislation for floor consideration. The contentious debate lasted seven weeks and ended with adoption of the reform. The debate on S. Res. 4 in the 94th Congress ended with adoption of a compromise proposal after a contentious seven-week battle between Senator Allen and Majority Whip Byrd. Senator Allen dominated floor proceedings with Majority Whip Byrd countering his tactics. Senators Mondale and Pearson were initially floor managers but were replaced by Senator Byrd. Vice President Nelson Rockefeller played a controversial role in supporting Mondale and Pearson. Vice President Nelson Rockefeller supported reformers' objectives through his rulings, sparking criticism and creating a hostile mood in the chamber. Senate approved a compromise requiring three-fifths of all Senators to end prolonged debate. Senator Mondale submitted S. Res. 4 with bipartisan co-sponsors to amend Rule XXII on the opening day of the 94th Congress. Senator Mondale and Majority Leader Mansfield ensured that supporters of the resolution to amend Rule XXII would not be prejudiced by any delays in the Senate proceedings. Mansfield aimed to preserve the reformers' \"opening day\" status even if an adjournment occurred. The Senate adjourned on January 14 to ensure compliance with S. Res. 4. The Senate adjourned on January 14 to comply with chamber rules, enabling the consideration of S. Res. 4 the next legislative day. Majority Whip Byrd received unanimous consent on January 16 to proceed with the resolution on January 17. Debate on S. Res. 4 was allowed until the close of business or 6 p.m. Senator Pearson initiated the debate on January 17. Senator Pearson led the debate on January 17, arguing for changing cloture rules to three-fifths of those present and voting. Senator Mondale criticized filibusters blocking important legislation and questioned the Senate's ability to change rules uninhibited by the past. Senator Mondale argued that the Framers did not require a two-thirds vote for Senate or House rules, indicating a majority should suffice. He highlighted the Constitution's protections for minorities and emphasized the need for debate and decision-making in parliamentary institutions. Senator Mathias noted the current two-thirds cloture standard hinders efficient decision-making. Senator Allen challenged the views of reformers regarding the two-thirds cloture standard, arguing that the Senate is a continuing body and does not need to adopt new rules at the start of each Congress. He contended that proposals to amend Senate rules should follow existing provisions and questioned when the beginning of a session truly ends. Senator Allen criticized the Mondale-Pearson approach to changing Senate rules, calling it a \"backdoor\" method. He questioned the reformers' selective use of Rule XXII, rejecting the idea of invoking cloture by majority vote. Senator Allen also dismissed the advisory opinions of Vice Presidents Nixon and Humphrey on the matter. Senator Mondale's motion to amend Rule XXII for limiting debate was not agreed to by the Senate, with Senator Allen criticizing the reform Senators for trying to impose a \"gag rule.\" The motion fell to be renewed at another time as per Senate precedents. In the days following an unacted-upon motion to proceed dying with a Senate adjournment, little floor action occurred on filibuster reform until February 20. Senator Javits emphasized the Vice President's role in issuing favorable rulings on amending Senate rules by majority vote. Vice President Rockefeller surprised many with rulings that favored the Mondale-Pearson initiative, leading to actions by various Senators. On February 19, Senator Byrd received unanimous consent for a reform proponent to call up S. Res. 4 the next day. Senator Pearson then offered a motion to amend rule XXII of the Senate rules, calling for an end to debate on the resolution. Key proceedings took place on various dates in February and March, shaping the eventual outcome of the Mondale-Pearson initiative. Senator Pearson's compound motion aims to establish a unique cloture procedure to bring S. Res. 4 to the Senate floor. The motion includes three key parts: consideration of a motion to proceed to S. Res. 4, immediate end of debate on the motion to proceed with a majority vote, and a subsequent vote on adoption of the motion to proceed without further debate. Senator Pearson's compound motion, if adopted, would only be in order at the start of a Congress when the Constitution authorizes the Senate to create its rules by majority vote. Senator Mondale emphasized that at the beginning of a Congress, the majority has the right to determine its own rules. The 1959 rules change was criticized as \"bootstrap language\" by Senator Mondale, who stated that it cannot bind future Senates due to constitutional restrictions. Majority Leader Mansfield argued that the Pearson motion seeks to diminish the uniqueness of the Senate and relegate it to the status of any other legislative body. The majority leader opposed Senator Pearson's motion to invoke cloture by a simple majority vote, stating it would drastically alter the concept of the Senate. Vice President Rockefeller reviewed the issue's history and indicated he would follow past precedents in his decision. The Vice President interpreted the senatorial decision as approval of the compound motion and submitted a constitutional question to the Senate for debate. Senator Javits argued that the Constitution should take precedence over rules in reform efforts. The reform effort, supported by Senator Kennedy and Senator Javits, focused on the importance of majority rule in government and the Constitution. Vice President Rockefeller's responses to parliamentary questions sparked controversy, particularly regarding the Senate's decision on ending debate. Vice President Rockefeller confirmed that the point of order raised by Senator Pearson challenges the motion to end debate by Senator Kansas. If the point of order is tabled, it would imply Senate's approval of the motion to end debate, leading to an immediate yea-and-nay vote. Tabling the point of order would allow Senator Pearson's motion to proceed for an immediate majority vote. The motion to proceed would be put to an immediate vote by a majority without further debate. Senators Allen, Byrd, and Thurmond challenged the Chair's views, with concerns about cutting off debate with a single motion. Senator Byrd argued against the Chair's probable ruling and urged Senators to support the majority leader's point of order. The Chair interpreted the motion as self-executing, meaning that if the point of order is tabled, the motion to shut off debate is not debatable. Senators disagreed, arguing that the motion should still be debatable according to Senate rules and precedents. The Chair stated that the Senate can shut off debate on a motion by a majority vote, but it is not required to do so immediately without debate. Senators disagreed on the procedure, with some arguing for the constitutional right to amend rules by majority vote. At the start of a new Congress, a Senate precedent was established by majority vote, rejecting a point of order and upholding a compound motion. Senator Mondale emphasized the importance of following the general rules of the Senate. Senator Allen used parliamentary shrewdness to challenge a motion in the Senate, leading to a debate on a constitutional question. Vice President Rockefeller agreed that the motion was debatable, allowing for further discussion on the matter. Senator Allen's procedural maneuver in the Senate led to the adjournment of the session, thwarting reformers' plans to proceed with a resolution. Despite the setback, Senate GOP Whip Robert Griffin noted that proponents could have challenged the adjournment to keep the motion alive. The reformers needed to regroup and plan their next move after being surprised by the turn of events. The procedural maneuver by Senator Allen led to the adjournment of the session, thwarting reformers' plans. Despite this setback, reformers achieved two key goals: acceptance of a simple majority to cut off a filibuster against a rules change and Vice President Rockefeller's ruling supporting the constitutional option. This ruling was a significant precedent in Senate history. The Senate accepted the constitutional option for the first time, leading to a battle over Rule XXII. Senator Allen dominated the debate and sent a motion to proceed to S. Res. 4, causing intense procedural battles. The Senate accepted the constitutional option for the first time, leading to a battle over Rule XXII. Senator Allen dominated the debate and sent a motion to proceed to S. Res. 4, causing intense procedural battles. Debate may continue until ended as per Senate Rule XXII. The Vice President must submit any question of order to the Senate for decision. Senator Mondale cited the Constitution and made a motion to end debate on the pending motion without further discussion or amendments. Senator Mondale's motion to supplant Senator Allen's pending motion was met with a point of order from Majority Leader Mansfield, leading to a procedural battle in the Senate. Senator Allen also raised a point of order, stating that the entire resolution was out of order. Senator Allen raised a point of order stating that the resolution was out of order, leading to a series of procedural actions in the Senate. Senator Mondale then motioned to table Mansfield's point of order, prompting a flurry of parliamentary maneuvers and frustrations from the majority leader. After cloture has been invoked, Senators can continue to suggest the absence of a quorum or make motions to recess or adjourn indefinitely, as long as there is intervening business. Senator Allen even forced a vote to table his own motion, which was rejected by the Senate. The Vice President then submitted the critical question to the Senate regarding the majority leader's point of order on Senator Mondale's motion invoking the Constitution. The Senate upheld the legitimacy of the compound motion to close debate on the motion to proceed to S. Res. 4. Senator Allen's motion to reconsider the vote was tabled. Senator Harry Byrd criticized the Vice President's role as presiding officer. The Chair's rapid questioning and refusal to recognize some senators led to an angry Senate debate two days later. The Senate recessed from February 24 to March 3, keeping motions by Senators Allen and Mondale pending. Various delaying tactics were used on Mondale's motion to end debate on Allen's motion. Senator Mathias noted the significance of the debate dominated by opponents of S. Res. 4. Control of the Senate floor during the debate on filibuster reform was contentious, with Vice President Rockefeller having to navigate between proponents and opponents. Senator Allen and his allies used delaying tactics such as quorum calls and privileged motions, while Mondale and his allies countered with successful votes to table these motions. The back-and-forth continued as new delaying tactics were introduced. On a fateful day for the Senate and the Vice President, Senator Allen and his allies employed new delaying tactics. Many Senators were frustrated by parliamentary maneuvers, and the Vice President's actions changed the Senate's mood. Lawmakers sought private negotiations for a compromise, with Senator Long proposing a reduction in the cloture threshold. The triggering event involved the Vice President's failure to recognize the first addressing Senator. Many Senators were frustrated by delaying tactics during the Senate's consideration of a motion to proceed to S. Res. 4. GOP Senator Charles Mathias successfully moved to table Senator Allen's motion to postpone consideration of the resolution by one month. Majority Leader Mansfield renewed a motion to expedite Senate action, challenging the point of order raised by Senator from Minnesota. The Vice President submitted the constitutional question to the Senate for debate and determination. The Vice President submitted the constitutional question to the Senate for debate. Senator Allen and Senator Brooke sought recognition from the Chair, leading to a vote to table Mansfield's point of order. The Senate agreed by a vote of 46 to 43, upholding the principles of the constitutional option. The Senate voted to table the point of order, affirming the motion to end debate and proceed to a vote. Senator Long criticized the Vice President for not recognizing Senator Allen's parliamentary inquiry. Senator Long criticized the Vice President for not recognizing Senator Allen's parliamentary inquiry, stating that the Presiding Officer does not own the Senate and can't ignore members seeking recognition. Long also mentioned ongoing bipartisan efforts to amend Rule XXII. Other Senators both rebuked and defended the Vice President's actions, with the Vice President apologizing to Senator Allen for any unintended discourtesy. The Vice President apologized to Senator Allen for any unintended discourtesy, stating that Senate rules do not require the presiding officer to recognize a senator for a parliamentary inquiry. Senator Long disagreed, citing a Senate precedent that every Senator has the right to recognition. Majority Whip Byrd emphasized the importance of recognizing senators seeking recognition. Majority Leader Mansfield suggested replacing Rule XXII with a \"constitutional\" three-fifths majority vote. The compromise resolution introduced by Majority Whip Byrd required three-fifths of the Senate present and sworn to invoke cloture, a two-thirds vote of those present and voting for rules changes, and reversed three precedents established earlier. Senator Byrd introduced a resolution to amend Senate rules, aiming to address the parliamentary challenges and the push to change cloture rules. Senator Griffin supported Byrd's proposal. Senator Byrd introduced a resolution to amend Senate rules, supported by Senator Griffin. Senator Roman Hruska motioned to reconsider a previous vote, with Senator Mondale announcing his stance. Senator Allen remained opposed to Rule XXII changes. The Senate held crucial votes at 4 p.m. At 4 p.m., the Senate held important votes back-to-back, including reconsidering the Mansfield point of order. The Senate reversed its earlier action and rejected the motion to table Mansfield's point of order. The Senate did not vote to sustain Mansfield's point of order, leading to debate and controversy. The successful reversal votes seemed to signal Senators' willingness to reconsider decisions. The Senate held important votes, including reconsidering the Mansfield point of order. The successful reversal votes signaled Senators' willingness to reconsider decisions. Senator Byrd filed a cloture motion to end debate on Senator Allen's pending motion. The Senate adjourned for five minutes by a 44 to 15 vote insisted upon by Senator Allen. Senator Byrd stated the desire for the resolution to come over under the rule. Senator Allen and his allies wanted to run out the clock on the legislative day. Senator Allen and his allies used dilatory tactics to prevent the presiding officer from laying the joint leadership reform resolution before the Senate. This included proposing an amendment for the Lord's Prayer in the Senate's Journal and asking about Senator Helms' vote after roll call. The issue raised by Senator Allen during the debate was formally addressed the next day, as some Senators would only vote for the compromise if previous precedents were reversed. Senator Allen and his allies used dilatory tactics to prevent the joint leadership compromise, insisting on reversing previous precedents set on February 20, 24, and 26. Despite the Senate's debate on the motion to proceed to S. Res. 4, Senator Allen highlighted the Senate's votes on March 3 to reconsider the tabling of the Mansfield point of order, ultimately leading to a rejection of the tabling (40 yeas to 51 nays). Senator Allen argued that the Senate did not take the crucial next step to sustain the Mansfield point of order against the Mondale compound motion, contending that precedents upholding reformers' objectives were still viable. He claimed that Senator Byrd's actions on March 3 removed the point of order from the floor, making it dead and no longer before the Senate. Allen and Senator Helms emphasized in a letter to all Members that the precedent for majority vote cut-off of debate had not been reversed. Senator Allen's contention was important as the majority vote cut-off of debate precedent was not reversed, and the February 26 point of order was never acted on. Senator Byrd argued that the Senate reversed its previous vote on the Mansfield point of order, leading to different interpretations depending on one's perspective. Despite the adjournment killing the point of order, supporters of the leadership compromise were not obligated to go along with it. The adjournment killed the point of order, but the anticipated adoption of cloture on the motion to proceed to S. Res. 4 would make it the \"unfinished business.\" Minority Whip Robert Griffin viewed Senator Allen's arguments as technical, while some Senators recommended voting to sustain Mansfield's point of order. The Senate voted 53 to 43 to sustain Mansfield's point of order before the pending cloture vote. The Senate voted 53 to 43 to sustain Mansfield's point of order, erasing the precedent of majority cloture established two weeks before. Senator Byrd ensured the vote would be recorded in the Congressional Record. The Senate invoked cloture on the motion to proceed to S. Res. 4 by a vote of 73 to 21. Senator Allen and other Senators criticized the filibuster reform effort. The motion to take up S. Res. 4 was agreed to by a 69 to 26 vote. Senator Byrd submitted S. Res. 93 as a complete substitute for S. Res. 4, which was agreed to. He then submitted a cloture motion to end debate on S. Res. 4, as amended. Another cloture motion was filed to end prolonged debate on S. Res. 4, as amended. Senator Byrd filed another cloture motion to end prolonged debate on S. Res. 4, as amended, as a precautionary measure. The Senate voted (73 to 21) for cloture on S. Res. 4, as amended, after considering various amendments and motions. Majority Leader Mansfield expressed dismay at the recent parliamentary turmoil on the Senate floor. Senator Mansfield expressed dismay at the recent parliamentary turmoil in the Senate, criticizing the behavior of some members as childish. Despite his plea for responsibility, Senator Stennis and Allen defended their actions, using parliamentary maneuvers to delay action on S. Res. 4. Senator Byrd attempted to expedite roll call votes to 10 minutes instead of 15, but Senator Allen objected. Byrd noted that dilatory tactics were still possible during the post-cloture period. Despite numerous procedural moves, it was clear that Mondale-Pearson had enough votes to pass S. Res. 4. Senator McClure acknowledged this, stating it was time to end the parliamentary wrangling after 50 days of debate. After 50 days of debate, Senator Allen and Senator Mondale expressed contrasting views on the need to stop parliamentary wrangling and proceed to a final vote on S. Res. 4. Senator Allen criticized the idea of compromising on principle, while Senator Mondale emphasized the importance of ending the deadlock. The Senate faced controversy over rules changes, with some Senators bypassing the two-thirds requirement for cutting off debate by using a debate-chokeoff motion. This led to a nondebatable, nonamendable, and nonreferrable measure being brought before the Senate, with the Vice President's cooperation. Senator Mondale emphasized the importance of reforming Rule XXII to make the Senate more efficient and democratic. He highlighted the acceptance of establishing rules by majority vote at the beginning of a new Congress. Senator Mondale emphasized the constitutional right of a majority to modify Senate rules at the start of a new Congress, despite actions taken on March 3 and March 5. He cautioned against giving those actions much significance, stating they cannot erase the previous affirmative votes on tabling. Mondale highlighted private negotiations among Senators that led to a supermajority consensus. Several reform Senators, including Senator Dick Clark, reluctantly agreed to a compromise proposed by joint leadership despite having the necessary votes to pass Senate Resolution 4 without compromise. The resolution was ultimately agreed to by a 56 to 27 vote. It is usually difficult to amend Senate rules, especially those affecting the chamber's deliberative character. When amending Rule XXII, there is a conflict between the right to debate and the right to decide, minority protection versus majority rule. Finding a balance between these values is challenging, especially with complex issues requiring extensive debate. The threat of extended debate, like a \"silent\" filibuster, can stall action on various issues in a crowded Senate agenda. A \"silent\" filibuster can stall action on various issues in a crowded Senate agenda. It is challenging to determine the motives behind prolonged debate, whether to educate or block legislative issues. Opening day initiatives to amend Senate rules often reveal sharp divisions among Senators. The new Congress can amend Senate rules by majority vote, with some Senators wanting to impose constraints on unlimited debate. Others argue that Senate rules should be followed as the Senate is a continuing body. Key concerns for Senators include protecting minority views, encouraging bipartisanship, and challenging the White House agenda. The fate of the constitutional option in altering Rule XXII in the Senate hinges on key elements such as the support of the presiding officer, the majority leader, a united majority, and strategic procedural maneuvers. Senate champions of change and elections bringing in lawmakers supportive of reform are crucial. Historical rulings from the Chair can either aid or impede Senate reform efforts, as seen in Vice President Richard Nixon's advisory opinions in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Vice President Richard Nixon's advisory opinions on Senate rules provided encouragement to reform Senators. In 1963, Senator Anderson sought cloture reform based on the Constitution, but Vice President Lyndon Johnson posed a question to the Senate regarding the right to terminate debate and proceed to a vote on a rule change. In 1969, Vice Presidents Humphrey and Rockefeller played contrasting roles in Senate rule changes. Humphrey supported reformers by strategically setting conditions for changing Rule XXII, while Johnson's decision favored anti-reformers. Constitutional questions are traditionally debated in the Senate, not decided by presiding officers. Humphrey's collaboration with reformers led to a resolution to reduce the number of Senators required for cloture, sparking opposition talkathons. Opponents launched a talkathon against the motion to proceed to the proposed change. Reformers filed cloture on the motion to proceed to the reform resolution. The Vice President clarified that a majority vote, not two-thirds, would invoke cloture on the reform resolution, establishing a new precedent. The Chair's ruling could establish a new precedent for majority cloture in the Senate, allowing a majority to amend rules at the start of a new Congress. Vice President Humphrey's cloture precedent was quickly overturned on appeal. The Senate could bypass supermajority requirements at any time during a Congress to create a new precedent for majority cloture. The Chair's ruling could set a new precedent for majority cloture in the Senate, allowing a majority to amend rules at the start of a new Congress. If 51 Senators vote to uphold the ruling, majority cloture could be achieved. The Presiding Officer's decision in 1969 showed that a majority can invoke cloture, potentially bypassing supermajority requirements. The Chair's ruling could establish a new precedent for majority cloture in the Senate, allowing 51 Senators to reject an appeal and sustain the ruling. Unlike the requirement of a \"friendly presiding officer\" mentioned by Senator Byrd, the presiding officer in 2013 ruled according to precedent, not upholding Majority Leader Reid's point of order. The majority leader's support or opposition to reformers' objectives could be crucial in determining the final outcome. The Majority Leaders, from Taft to Mansfield, played crucial roles in allowing reformers time to propose changes to Rule XXII in the Senate. Taft set a reasonable time limit for considering rule changes, while Mansfield provided ample debate opportunities and protected reformers from previous Senate rules. Mansfield favored amendments to Rule XXII but strongly opposed majority cloture, ensuring that the \"opening day\" extended over several days and weeks. Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson brokered two major changes to Rule XXII in 1959, allowing cloture to be invoked by two-thirds of those voting and applying the two-thirds requirement to proposals to change the rule. Additionally, a continuity of rules provision was added to Rule V, stating that Senate rules would continue from one Congress to the next unless changed. Johnson persuaded traditional opponents of filibuster reform to support these changes. The fate of filibuster reform proposals depends on the mobilization of a cohesive majority willing to battle for their procedural aims. Senator Byrd noted that with friendly rulings and party leader support, a majority can achieve their goal of amending Senate rules by majority vote. Unity is crucial to achieve the desired end, as opponents will engage in dilatory practices to block reform efforts. Today's opponents and proponents of amending Rule XXII are likely to enlist outside support to advance or block filibuster reforms. A procedural and strategic plan is essential for achieving reform goals, considering various factors that could affect strategy and options. This plan may involve consulting with the Vice President and the Senate. Options for advancing filibuster reform include consulting with key stakeholders such as the Vice President, Senate parliamentarian, party leaders, and allies. Reform advocates must consider the Vice President's stance, potential absence, and the President pro tempore's view. Preparation is crucial, including determining the level of support among Senators and their willingness to actively participate in advocating for reforms. Various procedural options exist, but success is not guaranteed. The Anderson Approach suggests introducing a resolution to update Senate rules at the start of each new Congress, aiming to strengthen the institution's governing capacity. Success is uncertain, but it could prompt a discussion on the importance of updating the rulebook every two years. If successful, this plan could gradually move the Senate towards majority rule. The Anderson plan aims to move the Senate towards majority rule, but traditional Senate practices may require ample debate before voting. Opponents argue it would fundamentally change the Senate's character. Senator McGovern also proposed a reform resolution in 1967, facing filibustering, and later suggested closing debate after two hours for a vote on his reform. In 1969, Senators Church and Pearson introduced a reform resolution in the Senate, which faced lengthy debate. A cloture motion was offered, and the Vice President's ruling on cloture was rejected by the Senate. In 1971, a fourth failed cloture vote occurred on the Church-Pearson motion to proceed. In 1971, Senator Javits appealed the Chair's ruling on the failed cloture vote for filibuster reform, suggesting a majority vote to decide the outcome. Senator Mondale and Pearson proposed a motion in 1975 to end debate on the motion to proceed and allow a vote without further debate, which was met with a point of order. The Senate faced parliamentary maneuvers and tensions as reformers tried to push through changes to Rule XXII. Despite initial victories, the compound motion was ultimately defeated, leading to the adoption of acceptable reforms. Other issues raised in past reform efforts were not decisive. The Senate reformers faced challenges in pushing through changes to Rule XXII, with debates on the length of \"opening day\" proceedings and the possibility of changing Senate rules during a legislative session. The reformers saw \"opening day\" as a crucial opportunity to overcome supermajority hurdles, citing constitutional and House practices to support their position. Senator Byrd suggested using the nuclear option to change Senate rules by majority vote, which could be done at the beginning, during, or end of a legislative session. The critical challenge for reformers is mustering the votes to achieve their goals, as seen in every attempt at Senate rules reform. Each side had reasonable positions on this topic. The Senate is a continuous body with two-thirds of Members carrying over from one Congress to the next. Impeachments, treaties, and resolutions also carry over. Senate committees remain constituted from the previous Congress. Senate rules continue from Congress to Congress unless changed. Reformers in the 1950s wanted to rewrite rules at the start of each new Congress, similar to the House. Reformers in the 1950s proposed rewriting Senate rules at the start of each new Congress, similar to the House, but this idea has not gained enough support. Instead, focus remains on reforming Rule XXII (cloture) to address provisions inhibiting majority rule. Senator Anderson acknowledged the potential debate over which parliamentary manual would govern the Senate until new rules are adopted. The Senate can easily adopt new rules at the start of each new Congress by following general parliamentary law. The process involves committee review, floor consideration, and potential revisions to Rule XXII (cloture). Rule XXII has been revised multiple times between 1917 and 1975, with changes to the threshold required to invoke cloture. Between 1949 and 1975, Rule XXII underwent formal changes regarding the threshold needed to invoke cloture. In 1949, two-thirds of the entire membership was required, and cloture could not be applied to motions to change Senate rules. In 1959, two-thirds of Senators present and voting were needed, and cloture could be applied to rule change proposals. By 1975, three-fifths of all Senators were required for cloture, with a two-thirds vote still needed to close debate on rule amendments. Senator Allen and Democratic Senators Abourezk and Metzenbaum played key roles in shaping post-cloture procedures in 1975 and 1977. In 1977, Senators Allen, SD, and Metzenbaum, OH, introduced amendments to Rule XXII to address post-cloture filibusters. These amendments limited post-cloture debate time to prevent delays in final legislative action. The amendments aimed to close loopholes that allowed for dilatory tactics, such as reading amendments, appeals, and quorum calls, which could prolong the process significantly. In 1977, Democratic Senators Abourezk and Metzenbaum used dilatory tactics to filibuster an energy bill supported by President Jimmy Carter, leading to revisions to Rule XXII. Senator Allen and allies also engaged in a post-cloture filibuster in 1976. Abourezk and Metzenbaum employed a post-cloture filibuster to delay Senate action on President Carter's national energy plan for 13 days by pre-filing over 500 amendments and objecting to unanimous consent requests. They demanded multiple roll-call votes on a single amendment, causing further delays. Abourezk and Metzenbaum used procedural tactics to delay Senate action on President Carter's national energy plan for 13 days. They demanded roll-call votes on amendments to tie up the Senate. Senator Byrd implemented a strategy to rule out dilatory amendments and counter the filibuster. Senator Byrd enlisted Vice President Mondale's help to rule out dilatory amendments during Senate cloture on October 3, 1977. Mondale upheld Byrd's point of order, stating that once cloture is invoked, no dilatory or non-germane amendments are allowed to ensure prompt action on pending measures. Senator Byrd enlisted Vice President Mondale's help to rule out dilatory amendments during Senate cloture on October 3, 1977. Mondale upheld Byrd's point of order, stating that once cloture is invoked, no dilatory or non-germane amendments are allowed to ensure prompt action on pending measures. Senator Abourezk appealed the decision but lost on a 79 to 14 vote, leading to a pre-arranged plan where the Vice President recognized only the majority leader to call up over 30 Metzenbaum amendments in rapid succession, all of which were quickly ruled out of order. Despite objections from other Senators, the Chair's rulings were not appealed, causing chaos on the Senate floor. On February 22, 1979, the Senate amended Rule XXII to restrict post-cloture filibusters by imposing a 100-hour cap on all post-cloture consideration. Other revisions included limiting the number of amendments a Senator could call up and dispensing with the reading of any amendment after cloture was invoked. These changes were a significant achievement of the 1979 amendment to Rule XXII. After cloture was invoked, the amendment had to be available in printed form at the desk of each Senator for at least 24 hours. Majority Leader Byrd was committed to ending the post-cloture filibuster, citing its negative impact on the Senate and national interest. He highlighted the procedural steps leading to the post-cloture filibuster and expressed concern over the lack of an effective Rule XXII. Senator Byrd introduced resolution S. Res. 9 in the 96th Congress to reform Senate procedures, including post-cloture procedures. Republican Senators were concerned about reducing the minority's role. Byrd and GOP leader Howard Baker formed a committee to find a compromise. The key recommendation was to consider post-cloture reforms separately in resolution S. Res. 61. Senator Byrd introduced resolution S. Res. 61 to address post-cloture procedures, emphasizing the need to prevent filibusters that go against the will of the Senate majority. He stated that if unanimous consent could not be reached, he would consider the constitutional option to change Senate rules at the start of a new Congress. Byrd rejected the notion that Senate rules automatically carry over from one Congress to the next without changes. Senator Byrd introduced resolution S. Res. 61 to address post-cloture procedures and prevent filibusters against the Senate majority's will. He emphasized the need for the Senate to have the power to change its rules at the start of a new Congress, rejecting the idea that rules automatically carry over from one Congress to the next. Byrd argued that the Senate should have the right to change its rules, as supported by past rulings and votes. Senator Byrd introduced resolution S. Res. 61 to address post-cloture procedures and prevent filibusters against the Senate majority's will. He emphasized the Senate's power to change rules at the beginning of a new Congress, based on recent bitter experiences. By continually recessing the Senate, Byrd kept the chamber in the same legislative day, allowing for unanimous consent agreements to proceed with specific amendments. The Senate adopted resolution S. Res. 61 on February 22, by a 78 to 16 vote, ending the \"opening day\" and avoiding a filibuster confrontation. Senator Byrd clarified that only relevant amendments to post-cloture provisions would be allowed, and if not resolved by 6 p.m. on February 22, the Senate would move on to consider the remaining general provisions of S. Res. 9. The Senate amended Rule XXII to reduce post-cloture consideration time from 100 hours to 30 hours, limiting delaying tactics during filibusters. The Senate amended Rule XXII to reduce post-cloture consideration time from 100 hours to 30 hours, limiting delaying tactics during filibusters. Minority Leader Byrd and Majority Leader Robert Dole were advocates of rules changes to improve Senate efficiency, including limiting debate on motions to two hours. Negotiations on televising Senate sessions involved differing opinions on rules changes and television. Some senators feared television would restrict their right to prolonged debate. The Senate voted to televise its floor proceedings gavel-to-gavel over C-SPAN and capped post-cloture consideration to 30 hours. The resolution authorized a Senate-owned television system for public broadcast. The Senate resolution allowed for public broadcast of floor proceedings and limited post-cloture consideration to 30 hours. Changes were made to cloture procedures in 2013, including permanent amendments and temporary standing orders. The Senate resolution in 2013 made changes to cloture procedures, including a new bipartisan cloture motion requiring signatures from party leaders and Senators not affiliated with the majority or minority party. This motion added a new paragraph to Rule XXII but has not been used yet. The Senate resolution in 2013 introduced changes to cloture procedures, including a new bipartisan cloture motion. This motion, if invoked, eliminates the 30 hours of post-cloture consideration and streamlines the process of taking a House message to conference into a single debatable motion. The Senate resolution in 2013 introduced changes to cloture procedures, including a new bipartisan cloture motion that streamlines the process of taking a House message to conference into a single debatable motion. This motion allows for a consolidated or compound motion for the Senate to authorize a conference, which is still subject to a filibuster but can be limited to two hours of debate if cloture is invoked. The Senate resolution in 2013 introduced changes to cloture procedures, including a new bipartisan cloture motion that streamlines the process of taking a House message to conference into a single debatable motion. This motion allows for a consolidated or compound motion for the Senate to authorize a conference, which is still subject to a filibuster but can be limited to two hours of debate if cloture is invoked. The resolution also included temporary standing orders to minimize filibusters on motions to proceed and limit post-cloture debate on certain nominations. In 2013, the Senate resolution introduced changes to cloture procedures, including a new bipartisan cloture motion. Majority Leader Reid used the nuclear option to allow a majority to end debate on presidential nominees, except for Supreme Court nominees. In 2005, the \"Gang of 14\" prevented the nuclear option to end Democratic filibusters against President Bush's judicial nominees. Newer Democratic Senators wanted to reform the filibuster procedure due to generational change and heightened polarization in the Senate. This highlighted a clear generation gap on the wisdom of changing filibuster rules. The nuclear option was used on November 21, 2013, to change filibuster rules in the Senate, which was considered a significant event in procedural history. The catalyst for this action was the Senate's refusal to confirm three judicial nominees to the D.C. Circuit Court, a crucial court in the nation. Support for the nuclear option had been growing among some Senate Democrats for months or even years. The Senate faced a filibuster over confirming three judicial nominees to the D.C. Circuit Court, a crucial court in the nation. Senators debated the workload of the court and the ideological balance of its judges, with GOP Senators arguing against adding more judges. GOP Senators disputed claims of obstructionism towards President Obama's judicial nominees, highlighting that more nominees were confirmed by the 112th Senate than in previous Congresses. Democratic Senators argued for confirming three nominees to the circuit court, with President Obama supporting the use of the nuclear option to overcome obstruction. The majority leader emphasized the need for efficient debate without prolonged delays. In November 2013, Majority Leader Reid established a new Senate precedent to end filibusters on executive and judicial nominees, except for Supreme Court nominees, citing years of obstruction by Republican colleagues in filling vacant seats on the DC Circuit. Key Senate procedures were involved in this decision. In 2013, Senator Reid established a new Senate precedent to end filibusters on executive and judicial nominees, except for Supreme Court nominees. This involved non-debatable motions to proceed, reconsider, and vote, without allowing any intervening debate. Senator Reid used Senate procedures to effectuate this precedent after a failed cloture vote on Patricia Millet's nomination to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. Senator Reid established a new Senate precedent in 2013 to end filibusters on executive and judicial nominees, except for Supreme Court nominees. After a failed cloture vote on Patricia Millet's nomination to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, Senator Reid used non-debatable motions to proceed, reconsider, and vote. Despite his efforts, the motion to invoke cloture did not receive the required 60 votes. Senator Reid then raised a point of order that a majority vote should suffice for cloture on nominations, except for Supreme Court nominees. In 2013, Senator Reid established a new Senate precedent to end filibusters on executive and judicial nominees, excluding Supreme Court nominees. The President pro tempore overruled Reid's point of order, leading to a non-debatable appeal vote that overturned the ruling. This vote set a new majority cloture precedent for most presidential nominees. Senator McConnell then challenged the new precedent by raising a point of order that nominees are fully debatable unless 60 votes are obtained to invoke cloture. In 2013, a new Senate precedent was set for cloture on nominations, excluding the Supreme Court, requiring a majority vote. Senator McConnell appealed the ruling of the Chair, which was upheld by a vote of 52 yeas to 48 nays. Cloture on the Millett nomination was invoked with 55 yeas to 43 nays, sparking tension between parties. Senate Democrats pushed for further changes to the filibuster, emphasizing the need to eliminate it for legislation as well as nominations. In contrast, Senate Republicans criticized the majority leader's actions as a power grab, highlighting the longstanding tradition of the filibuster in the Senate. The move was seen as a significant shift in the Senate's character, giving the majority party more control over the legislative process. The Senate majority can now amend rules by majority vote, creating a precedent for changing Senate rules with a simple majority instead of a two-thirds supermajority. Senate Republicans delayed action on presidential nominees by using post-cloture time for consideration. The Senate majority set a new precedent by using post-cloture time for nominations, employing parliamentary tactics, and increasing approval of the President's nominees. Democrats criticized minority obstructionism and believed in adapting rules for Senate efficiency. The Senate majority set a new precedent by using post-cloture time for nominations, employing parliamentary tactics, and increasing approval of the President's nominees. Democrats criticized minority obstructionism and favored majority rule for legislation and nominations, with the possibility of using the \"nuclear option\" if necessary. President Obama gained greater influence in securing Senate approval of nominations, benefiting from the new precedent. Confirmation of executive and judicial candidates who align with the President's policy outlook now only requires a majority vote in the Senate to end debate. This new process poses a political risk for both parties, as majority control could lead to the confirmation of nominees who share their philosophy. The GOP's control of the Senate has sparked discussions about the appointment of more conservative judges, while Democrats prefer majority rule over continued obstruction. Following the 2014 mid-term elections, Senate Democrats and the White House claim a slowdown in judicial nominee approvals, while Senate Republicans argue that nominations are progressing at a similar pace to previous lame duck presidents. Senate Democrats are concerned that GOP-controlled committees are delaying President Obama's nominees, potentially leading to the increased use of tactics like the \"blue slip\" process to block nominations. The Judiciary Committee's long-standing blue slip policy allows home-state Senators to block committee action on judicial nominees by not returning their blue slips or returning them with a negative recommendation. This policy dates back to 1917 and gives Senators the power to slow or stop nominations they object to. The Judiciary Committee's blue slip policy allows Senators to block judicial nominees by not returning positive blue slips. Some chairs require both state Senators' approval. Minority party Senators can hinder nominations, and committee filibusters can be ended by majority vote with at least one minority party member's support. The Judiciary Committee's blue slip policy allows Senators to block judicial nominees. Committee filibusters can be ended by majority vote with at least one minority party member's support. In the 114th Senate, a ratio of 11 to 9 was the majority to minority Members on Judiciary. There was discussion among Members when the new Congress began on January 6, 2015. When the new Congress began on January 6, 2015, the GOP Senate majority debated whether to retain the 2013 precedent of majority cloture on nominees or return to the 60-vote requirement. Republicans were divided on the issue, with some wanting to restore the supermajority requirement for presidential nominees. There was also discussion about applying majority cloture to legislation repealing the Affordable Care Act, with even contenders for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination divided on the issue. Senate Majority Leader McConnell favored \"regular order\" and supported review by the Committee on Rules and Administration, but opposed using the nuclear option to end the Senate's supermajority requirement. He and many Senators believed the filibuster protected the minority and prevented the Senate from becoming like the House with majority party dominance. On the opening day of the 114th Congress, two minority party Senators introduced S.Res. 20 to assert the Senate's right to adopt or amend rules by majority vote. The proposal included ideas to improve Senate operations, such as creating a process for rule changes at the start of each legislative session and expediting the creation of conference committees. The Senate's rules and precedents give significant procedural powers to each Senator, regardless of party. History shows that senatorial delay can be beneficial in blocking hastily conceived measures. Two GOP Senators proposed making all nominations subject to a simple majority, but no action has been taken since. The Senate is structured to promote deliberation, protect minorities, and allow for filibusters to extract information or reach compromises. Daily life in the Senate is filled with filibusters, threats of extended debate, and cloture votes. The Senate operates like 100 nations with the power to disrupt proceedings. Senators grapple with the need for rule changes despite valuing unlimited debate. The filibuster and Rule XXII have evolved over time, with Rule XXII initially serving a symbolic purpose. Since 1917, filibusters, cloture votes, and Rule XXII have become common in the Senate, with debates focusing on the balance between the right to debate and the right to decide. Rule XXII is significant as the only formal rule to limit debate, with revisions to cloture votes and post-cloture debate time occurring over the years. Discussions often revolve around protecting minority rights versus majority decision-making, the Senate's uniqueness, and the intent of the Framers. Rule XXII revisions typically occur when a determined majority is frustrated by the 60-vote cloture hurdle, leaders craft a successful strategy for change, and a public relations strategy is used to explain the necessity of the revision. Other relevant factors include the election of change-oriented lawmakers and crises. The Senate rules and practices may need modernization to better meet current challenges and enhance its governing capacity as a co-equal branch of government. Some Senators believe the system is working as intended, while others see the need for changes due to lawmakers exploiting procedures for personal or political gain. Some Senators believe the Senate rules and practices need modernization to enhance its governing capacity, as lawmakers may exploit procedures for personal or political gain. Suggestions include reviving norms and values to strengthen civility, cross-party compromise, and policy-focused debate. Ultimately, procedural context shapes how decisions are made and if certain procedures hinder addressing national problems, changes may be necessary. The Senate may need procedural changes to address national problems effectively. Senator Phil Hart's 1971 comment on the Senate's inaction causing unrest still resonates today. Thomas Jefferson's belief in institutions evolving with the times supports the idea of Senate modernization. The Senate must adapt to handle a growing workload and complex issues, determining its own pace of change. The Senate constantly undergoes change in response to events, issues, and crises. New Members bring additional energy and ideas every two years. Procedural changes are common, but there is a conflict in reform initiatives between preserving traditions and enhancing policymaking performance. Senator Byrd emphasized the Senate's role as an independent source of wisdom and judgment. The Senate has evolved to require 60 votes for approval of many measures, reflecting a lack of bipartisanship. Change may occur with favorable sentiments and votes from Senators, driven by constituents and outside groups. Determination, patience, and hard work are essential for resolving disagreements among the nation's diverse demographics, geography, and ideologies. Senator Everett McKinley Dirksen, a Republican minority leader, highlighted the challenge of harmonizing the diverse personalities in the U.S. Senate to resolve disagreements among Senators and parties."
