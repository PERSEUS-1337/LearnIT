The Biodiesel Promotion Act of 2003, also known as the Act, offers incentives for biodiesel use as a fuel through a new section in the Internal Revenue Code. The biodiesel fuels credit is determined based on the biodiesel mixture credit, which is calculated by multiplying the biodiesel mixture rate by the number of gallons of qualified biodiesel mixture used by the taxpayer in a taxable year. The biodiesel mixture rate varies depending on the type of biodiesel mixture used. The Biodiesel Promotion Act of 2003 provides incentives for biodiesel use as a fuel through a new section in the Internal Revenue Code. The biodiesel fuels credit is determined based on the biodiesel mixture credit, which varies depending on the type of biodiesel mixture used. The qualified biodiesel mixture is a mixture of diesel and biodiesel V or biodiesel NV sold by the taxpayer producing such mixture for use as a fuel. The Biodiesel Promotion Act of 2003 incentivizes biodiesel use as a fuel through a new section in the Internal Revenue Code. The qualified biodiesel mixture is a mixture of diesel and biodiesel V or biodiesel NV sold by the taxpayer producing such mixture for use as a fuel in their trade or business. The Biodiesel Promotion Act of 2003 incentivizes biodiesel use as a fuel through a new section in the Internal Revenue Code. Biodiesel V used in the production of a qualified biodiesel mixture requires certification from the producer. No credit is allowed for casual off-farm production. The credit amount may be reduced to account for any excise tax exemption benefits. The Biodiesel Promotion Act of 2003 defines biodiesel V as monoalkyl esters of long chain fatty acids from virgin vegetable oils for diesel engines. Biodiesel NV is derived from nonvirgin vegetable oils or animal fats. Registration requirements apply to biodiesel V. The terms 'biodiesel V' and 'biodiesel NV' must meet registration requirements set by the EPA under the Clean Air Act and ASTM D6751. If a credit was claimed for biodiesel V or NV used in making a qualified biodiesel mixture, a tax will be imposed if certain conditions are met. If biodiesel is separated from a mixture or used in a way other than as fuel, a tax is imposed based on the biodiesel mixture rate and the number of gallons. All relevant laws and penalties apply to this tax as if imposed under section 4081. Taxpayers can elect to not apply the biodiesel fuels credit for any taxable year by following specific regulations set by the Secretary. The election can be made or revoked within a 3-year period from the last date to file the tax return for that year. The process of making or revoking the election must comply with regulations prescribed by the Secretary. The biodiesel fuels credit under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 can be elected not to be applied for any taxable year following regulations set by the Secretary. This election can be made or revoked within a 3-year period from the last date to file the tax return for that year. The credit is treated as part of the general business credit and has specific regulations for carryback before January 1, 2003. The biodiesel fuels credit under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 has specific regulations for carryback before January 1, 2003, and cannot be carried back to a taxable year before that date. Amendments have been made to various sections of the Code to reflect this regulation. Amendments have been made to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, including adding a new item after section 40. Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 include a new section on biodiesel used as fuel, with effective date after December 31, 2002. Additionally, there is a reduction in motor fuel excise taxes on biodiesel V mixtures under Section 4081, with a new subsection added for qualified biodiesel mixtures. The new section on biodiesel fuel in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 establishes tax rates for qualified biodiesel mixtures based on the percentage of biodiesel V in the mixture. Definitions from section 40A apply, and certain rules also apply to this subsection. Certain rules similar to those in subsection (c) apply for the new biodiesel V mixtures section in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Conforming amendments are made to sections 4041 and 6427 of the Code to accommodate the tax rates for qualified biodiesel mixtures with biodiesel V. The amendment adds a new subsection (p) regarding biodiesel V mixtures to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. It specifies that a person using diesel fuel to produce a qualified biodiesel mixture with biodiesel V will receive a payment from the Secretary. The effective date for these amendments is for fuel sold after December 31, 2002, and before January 1, 2006. Additionally, funds are transferred from the Commodity Credit Corporation to the Highway Trust Fund to ensure no harm is done. The Secretary of the Treasury will transfer funds from the Commodity Credit Corporation to the Highway Trust Fund to offset reductions in receipts due to amendments made by this section."
