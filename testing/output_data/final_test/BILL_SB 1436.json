    "title": "SB 1436",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 54953 of the Government Code is amended to require all meetings of a local agency's legislative body to be open to the public. Teleconferencing may be used for meetings, following all legal requirements. Teleconferencing may be used for all purposes in connection with any meeting within the subject matter jurisdiction of the legislative body, with all votes taken during a teleconferenced meeting being by rollcall. Teleconferencing for local agency meetings must protect statutory and constitutional rights, with agendas posted at all teleconference locations. A quorum of members must participate from within the agency's jurisdiction, and the public must have the opportunity to address the legislative body directly at each teleconference location. For local agency meetings, teleconferencing allows members in different locations to connect electronically for audio or video meetings. No secret ballots are allowed, and all actions taken by the legislative body must be publicly reported with each member's vote or abstention noted. Prior to final action, the legislative body must orally report a summary of recommendations on salaries or compensation for a local agency executive during an open meeting. This does not affect the public's right to access related records under the California Public Records Act. When a health authority conducts a teleconference meeting, members outside the jurisdiction can count towards a quorum if at least 50% of the required members are present within the authority's boundaries. The authority must provide a teleconference number for participation. Members of a health authority can meet in person or via teleconference within or near the authority's jurisdiction. Teleconference meetings must adhere to all meeting requirements. A health authority includes specific entities created under certain sections of the Welfare and Institutions Code and advisory committees to county sponsored health plans with 12 or more members. This provision will be in effect until January 1, 2018. The Legislature declares that an amendment to the Government Code allows for increased public access to local agency meetings. This act aims to ensure more Californians can participate in legislative body meetings. No reimbursement required by this act for local agencies or school districts as any costs incurred would be within the scope of legislative mandate."
