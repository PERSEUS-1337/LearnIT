    "content": "The Act is titled the \"International Child Labor Elimination Act of 1996\". It includes findings related to child labor. The Congress finds that international conventions recognize the right of children to be protected from economic exploitation and hazardous work, with minimum age requirements for employment set at completion of compulsory schooling or 15 years. The Forced Labor Convention, in effect since 1930, prohibits most forms of forced labor, including child labor. The International Labor Organization estimates 100-200 million child workers globally, with over 95% in developing countries. In 1995, 13.2% of children aged 10-14 were economically active. Reliable statistics on child workers under 10 are lacking but their numbers are significant. Many children in developing countries are forced into debt-bonded and slave labor in hazardous industries, despite international and domestic prohibitions. The United Nations and International Labor Organization report tens of millions of child slaves globally, mainly in agriculture, domestic work, and the sex industry. Children are involved in various forms of labor such as agriculture, domestic work, the sex industry, and manufacturing. Child labor often prevents access to education and denies employment opportunities to adults. The most abusive forms of child labor violate basic human rights and must be eradicated. Identification of foreign countries and industries that use child labor in producing goods. The Secretary of Labor will identify countries and industries that allow child labor or do not effectively enforce laws against it. Sanctions will be imposed on these countries and industries as per section 4 of the Act. Exemptions from prohibitions on activities of certain agencies apply to business entities that can prove they do not use child labor in their products. Prohibition on assistance for foreign countries that use child labor in producing goods. Prohibition on providing certain types of assistance to foreign countries identified for child labor in producing goods under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. The Arms Export Control Act prohibits sales or financing, while the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act restricts the provision of agricultural commodities. The Export-Import Bank of the United States is prohibited from providing guarantees, insurance, or credit extensions to foreign governments or business entities identified for child labor under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. The Overseas Private Investment Corporation is restricted from engaging in activities in industries identified by the Secretary of Labor. Multilateral assistance involves the Secretary of the Treasury instructing international financial institutions on using their voice and vote. The United States opposes international financial institutions using funds for industries identified by the Secretary of Labor, unless the President certifies it is in the vital national interest. The United States opposes international financial institutions funding industries identified by the Secretary of Labor, unless the President certifies it is in the vital national interest. Additionally, a statement is required to weigh the risk of child labor against the risk to the vital national interest of the United States. The President will issue regulations to implement the Act. $10,000,000 is authorized for the United States to support the International Labor Organization's efforts to eliminate child labor. Definitions are provided.
