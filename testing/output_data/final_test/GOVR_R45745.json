    "content": "Since the end of World War II, the US has supported a close partnership with Europe, known as the transatlantic relationship. This includes NATO and ties with the EU and countries in Western and Central Europe. The US sees this partnership as crucial for national security and economic policy. NATO was formed in 1949 by the US to enhance transatlantic security, while support for European integration aimed to promote reconciliation and economic cooperation. The US has supported a close partnership with Europe since the end of World War II, focusing on NATO, EU ties, and European integration to promote reconciliation, economic recovery, and democratic systems. US officials viewed NATO and European integration as crucial during the Cold War to deter the Soviet threat. Today, 22 countries belong to both NATO and the EU, with US-Europe cooperation in establishing an open international trading system. Congress has played a key role in shaping the transatlantic partnership post-Cold War. Many Members of Congress support NATO's evolution to confront security threats outside alliance territory and advocate for NATO and EU enlargement to Central and Eastern Europe. They are interested in deepening transatlantic economic ties through trade liberalization and regulatory cooperation. Some members express concerns about European military dependence on the US and may oppose European policies on certain issues. US-European relations have had ups and downs over the decades. President Trump's approach to U.S-European relations has raised concerns in Europe due to his transactional view of NATO, focus on defense spending, and criticism of EU trade practices. Policy divisions have also emerged on issues like trade policies, arms control, and nonproliferation. The Trump Administration's policies towards Europe aim to strengthen the transatlantic partnership to address common challenges in a competitive world. They support NATO's collective defense clause and efforts to deter Russia, while seeking to address trade barriers with the EU. Despite some positive outcomes like increased European defense spending, U.S-European relations are under strain. European policymakers are concerned about the lack of consistency in U.S. policies, particularly regarding NATO and the EU. There is growing anxiety in Europe about the credibility and reliability of the United States as a partner. This comes amidst various challenges in Europe, including Brexit, support for populist parties, rule of law issues in countries like Poland and Hungary, economic struggles in France, Italy, and Spain, migration pressures, terrorism threats, a resurgent Russia, and trade concerns. The EU is grappling with migration pressures, terrorism threats, a resurgent Russia, and a competitive China. Concerns arise about the ability of European allies in NATO or the EU to be effective partners for the US. The US faces divisions on political, social, and economic issues, with some anti-establishment sentiments and worries about globalization and immigration. President Trump's \"America First\" policy suggests a shift towards isolationism. Experts note a growing trend towards an America First approach in U.S. foreign policy since the end of the Cold War. The collapse of the post-World War II consensus on America's global security role has implications for transatlantic relations and the U.S.-led global order. Younger Americans and Europeans may not prioritize a close transatlantic relationship as previous generations did. Despite periodic difficulties, U.S. and European policymakers value a close transatlantic partnership for geostrategic and economic interests. Benefits include U.S. leadership in NATO, support for European integration, and maintaining peace and stability in Europe. U.S. engagement has helped foster democratic and prosperous European allies that support U.S. foreign policy. The close transatlantic partnership between the U.S. and Europe supports U.S. foreign policy preferences, bolsters global leadership, and helps limit malign influences in the region. Both sides face common international challenges and share similar values and policy outlooks. Cooperation between the U.S. and Europe, built on trust and decades of collaboration, is unique in international relations. The United States and Europe have a strong economic relationship, accounting for one-fifth of U.S. total trade in goods and services. They are each other's largest source and destination for foreign direct investment, generating over $5 trillion per year in foreign affiliate sales and employing about 9 million workers on both sides of the Atlantic. Together, they have created and maintained the current rules-based international trading system. The United States and Europe have a strong economic relationship, accounting for a significant portion of global GDP and FDI. This economic clout enables them to lead in setting global rules and standards. However, there are concerns about European defense spending, U.S. military presence in Europe, EU regulatory barriers to trade, and lack of a single voice on foreign policy issues. The EU lacks a single voice on foreign policy issues, complicating U.S.-EU cooperation. Some in the U.S. argue that a close partnership requires compromise, while European officials complain about U.S. dominance and expectations of automatic support. European leaders, particularly in France, have aspired to build up the EU as a global power to check U.S. influence. Most European governments have not supported developing the EU as a counterweight to the United States. The transatlantic partnership, grounded in mutual benefits, has seen the United States as the driving force behind NATO's creation in 1949. U.S. leadership of NATO has been crucial for peace, stability, and support from 28 allies with advanced militaries. NATO proponents in the United States highlight the strategic benefits of U.S. leadership in NATO, including the ability to station forces and nuclear weapons in Europe for quick access to other regions. They emphasize NATO's unique platform for international military coalitions with an integrated command structure. Critics, including President Trump, have raised concerns about European allies' low defense spending and reliance on U.S. security guarantees, leading to an imbalanced burden-sharing arrangement. The United States, under President Trump, has been vocal about NATO being a \"bad deal\" and has pushed for increased allied defense spending. This stance has led to defense spending increases across the alliance. Despite criticism, the Trump Administration emphasizes a commitment to European security and stability in its policies. The 2017 National Security Strategy and 2018 National Defense Strategy reaffirm the United States' commitment to NATO's Article 5 collective defense clause. The Administration views NATO as crucial for deterring Russia and has requested increased funding for military deployments in Europe. Despite some European allies expressing concerns about President Trump's commitment to NATO, the United States leads NATO troops in Poland and deploys a Brigade Combat Team in eastern member states. European allies refute President Trump's claims about NATO and emphasize their contributions to various global military operations, including in Afghanistan. They stress the importance of solidarity with the US, citing their involvement in NATO's longest operation in history. NATO allies view their contributions in Afghanistan as a demonstration of solidarity with the United States and a testament to their value in achieving shared security objectives. Almost one-third of coalition fatalities in Afghanistan have been from NATO members and partner countries. NATO faces challenges in managing a resurgent Russia, with divergent views among allies on the threat posed by Russia and the appropriate role for NATO in addressing security challenges. NATO allies rely on the United States for key military capabilities in interventions. Concerns exist about President Trump's negative rhetoric affecting alliance cohesion. The alliance has a history of U.S. support since 1950. The United States has been a strong supporter of the European integration project, backing EU enlargement to promote peace, prosperity, and democracy in Europe. This support extends to countries like Turkey and the Western Balkans for similar reasons. The US has also supported NATO allies with key military capabilities, but concerns exist about President Trump's negative rhetoric affecting alliance cohesion. Over the past 25 years, U.S.-EU relations have deepened despite differences like the 2003 Iraq war. The U.S. looks to the EU for partnership on foreign policy and security, promoting peace in regions like the Balkans and Afghanistan. Cooperation with the EU bolsters U.S. positions and objectives, including joint sanctions on Russia and counterterrorism efforts. The EU and US have historically cooperated on various global issues, but President Trump's negative views on the EU have strained relations. Trump supports Brexit and questions the EU's future, calling them a \"foe\" in trade. The EU is concerned about US trade policies, including tariffs, and doubts the US's reliability as a partner. Many in the EU question the United States' reliability as a partner in global trade rules and standards. The Trump Administration may prioritize bilateral trade deals over EU relations, with interest in a free trade agreement with the UK post-Brexit. President Trump's views on the EU have strained relations, with concerns about US trade policies and doubts about partnership reliability. Many analysts suggest that President Trump's critical views of the EU are shaped by a preference for working bilaterally with nation-states rather than in international or multilateral forums. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo criticized multilateralism in a speech in Brussels, questioning if the EU prioritizes the interests of countries and citizens over bureaucrats in Brussels. This stance was seen as a rebuke of the EU, although skepticism towards multilateral institutions is not unique to the Trump Administration. The EU is critical of the Trump Administration's \"America First\" foreign policy, particularly regarding decisions to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris Agreement. The Administration's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital is also seen as undermining efforts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. EU officials believe certain policies are damaging relations with the U.S., while Administration officials argue that EU actions are also problematic. The EU's policies are straining relations with the United States, particularly regarding trade negotiations and defense initiatives. US officials are concerned about the EU's lack of understanding of the Iran threat and potential competition with NATO. The EU launched a defense pact in 2017, causing anxiety for previous US administrations. The Trump Administration's criticisms of EU defense spending and PESCO have led to tensions. Some U.S. officials fear that PESCO could hinder U.S.-European defense cooperation and sales. They believe that internal EU challenges may prevent it from focusing on key U.S. priorities like Russian aggression and terrorism threats. In 2016, UK voters favored leaving the EU, triggering complex withdrawal negotiations. UK remains divided on Brexit type, with Parliament rejecting the negotiated agreement three times. Key sticking point is the \"backstop\" issue. The UK has negotiated with the EU three times, with a key sticking point being the \"backstop\" for the Irish border. The EU offered a six-month extension for the UK to exit by October 31, 2019. Despite Brexit, the UK aims to maintain strong ties with the US and NATO. Analysts predict continued cooperation in areas like counterterrorism, intelligence, and global security challenges. UK officials emphasize that Brexit does not mean isolationism. UK officials emphasize that Brexit does not mean isolationism and the UK intends to remain a global leader in various areas. President Trump has expressed support for Brexit and the Trump Administration plans to launch U.S.-UK trade negotiations post-Brexit. Some in Congress are concerned about Brexit's impact on the Northern Ireland peace process. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi stated that Brexit weakening the peace accord would hinder a U.S.-UK FTA. Brexit could also affect certain U.S. strategic interests. Brexit could have a significant impact on U.S. strategic interests, particularly in relation to Europe and the EU. The UK is a key economic and military power within the EU and a close partner to the U.S. Some believe the U.S. may lose an advocate in the EU for policies that align with U.S. goals. Concerns have been raised that the UK's departure could weaken the EU as a partner for the U.S. due to its diplomatic and military capabilities. The UK's departure from the EU could weaken the EU as a partner for the U.S. due to its diplomatic, military, and economic clout. The UK has been a key driver of certain EU initiatives and a leading voice for robust EU sanctions against Russia. U.S. officials have urged the EU to focus more on addressing shared external challenges like terrorism and instability. Brexit has led to internal preoccupation within the EU and the loss of British personnel with expertise. Some analysts believe Brexit could result in a more integrated EU without UK opposition. Concerns have been raised about the EU's new defense pact, PESCO, without UK leadership. The EU's new defense pact, PESCO, raises concerns about potential infringement on NATO's role in European security without UK leadership. The United States emphasizes strong leadership in addressing common foreign policy and security challenges with Europe, particularly in managing Russia's assertiveness. U.S.-EU cooperation, such as imposing sanctions on Russia for aggression in Ukraine, is seen as crucial in preventing divisions across the Atlantic. The EU has welcomed U.S. efforts to maintain sanctions on Russia, despite concerns about potential negative impacts on EU business and energy interests. U.S. and European policies towards Russia are aligned, with the U.S. endorsing new NATO initiatives to deter Russian aggression and increasing its military presence in Europe. Sanctions on Russia for its actions in Ukraine and other malign activities continue to be supported by the United States. The United States and European countries share concerns about Russian cyber activities and influence operations. Some allies advocate for a stronger military presence in Central and Eastern Europe and maintaining pressure on Russia through sanctions, while others emphasize a dual-track approach of deterrence and dialogue. The United States and European countries have concerns about Russian cyber activities and influence operations. A key point of contention is the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, with the Trump Administration and many Members of Congress opposing it due to fears of increased European energy dependence on Russia and negative impacts on Ukraine. Germany, Austria, and other supporters see it as a commercial project to increase gas supply to Europe. The Trump Administration announced the suspension of U.S. participation in the INF Treaty, with European leaders largely agreeing that Russia is violating the treaty. NATO supports the U.S. decision, but European officials are concerned about a potential arms race and its impact on European security. Following the U.S. decision, Russia also suspended participation in the treaty and announced plans to develop new nuclear-capable missiles. European officials are troubled by the collapse of the INF Treaty and the U.S. decision to develop new nuclear-capable missiles. They fear potential divisions within NATO and negative impacts on alliance cohesion. Concerns also arise regarding tensions affecting the renewal of the New START treaty with Russia. Additionally, U.S. officials are increasingly worried about China's strategic foothold in Europe through unfair trade practices and investments in key industries and infrastructure. Chinese investment in the EU has significantly increased, reaching $30 billion in 2017 across various sectors. The Trump Administration and some European governments are concerned about Huawei's involvement in building 5G networks, as it could compromise network security and intelligence-sharing with the United States. Despite warnings, some allies like the UK and Germany are open to Chinese companies bidding on 5G contracts but emphasize the need for strict security standards. Some analysts fear Chinese economic influence through 5G contracts could lead to leverage over European countries, affecting foreign policy alignment and preventing a unified EU stance on China. Vulnerability to this leverage is seen in smaller EU and non-EU Balkan countries, with Italy's participation in China's Belt and Road Initiative cited as evidence. The Trump Administration lobbied Italy against joining the BRI, but US officials are hopeful for collaboration with Europe on security and economic issues posed by China. EU members France and Germany support stricter regulations on Chinese investment in Europe. The European Commission and EU's High Representative characterized China as an economic competitor and systemic rival. US Ambassador to the EU called for cooperation between the US and Europe. In a February 2019 interview, U.S. Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland urged the U.S. and EU to collaborate in countering China economically, militarily, and from an intelligence perspective. However, some analysts doubt the feasibility of U.S.-European cooperation on China due to differing security interests and views on China as an economic rival. European governments and the EU are concerned about escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran, which have strained U.S.-European relations, particularly regarding the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. The EU considers the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran (JCPOA) a major foreign policy achievement that prevented Iran from developing nuclear weapons. The EU worked closely with the Obama Administration to negotiate the JCPOA and imposed strict sanctions on Iran between 2010 and 2012, aligning U.S. and European approaches on Iran. The Trump Administration wants the EU to abandon the JCPOA and reimpose sanctions on Iran, citing concerns about Iran's behavior. The EU agrees with U.S. concerns about Iran but believes these issues should be addressed separately. The EU supports the JCPOA and has launched INSTEX to facilitate trade with Iran. Some in the EU are concerned about Iran's commitment to the agreement. Amid Iran's announcement in early May 2019 that it would no longer abide by JCPOA restrictions, the EU urges Iran to stay in the agreement. European governments were alarmed by President Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria without consulting European partners, raising concerns about transatlantic cooperation. European allies were urged by U.S. officials to maintain ground forces in Syria after the U.S. withdrawal. The UK and France declined the request, and other European countries were hesitant to take on the risks without U.S. presence. The U.S. plans to keep a residual force in Syria to encourage European involvement, but it is uncertain if European governments will agree. In December 2018, reports indicated the Trump Administration was considering reducing troop presence in Afghanistan, causing concern among European allies. European allies expressed surprise and concern over reports of a possible drawdown of U.S. forces in Afghanistan. Despite ongoing negotiations with the Taliban, U.S. officials denied plans for a reduction. European officials emphasized the need for close coordination with allies in any troop reduction. Experts question NATO's mission viability without U.S. participation. The U.S. Defense Department is discussing future military plans with European allies. Public opposition to European military involvement in Afghanistan may lead to a potential winding down of NATO's mission. Some European officials object to being excluded from peace talks with the Taliban despite their military contributions and development aid to Afghanistan. The United States has strengthened counterterrorism cooperation with European governments and the EU since 2001, focusing on improving security in various areas. Both sides view this cooperation as essential in combating terrorism, particularly in recent years against the Islamic State and foreign fighters. The Trump Administration continues to prioritize this cooperation. The Trump Administration values cooperation with European governments and the EU, but tensions have arisen over repatriating European fighters from Syria and Iraq. Some European countries are hesitant to bring back Islamic State fighters and their families due to security risks. Analysts are concerned about potential rifts between the United States and Europe on counterterrorism strategies. The EU was dismayed by the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement in 2017. The EU is committed to the Paris Agreement despite the U.S. withdrawal in November 2020. President Trump cited disadvantages to U.S. businesses and workers but expressed openness to renegotiation. The EU rejects renegotiation and plans to work with U.S. entities still supporting the accord. The EU has taken on a greater role in stewardship of the agreement, and in 2018 stated it would not finalize FTAs with countries not ratifying the Paris Agreement, potentially impacting U.S.-EU trade discussions. The EU remains committed to the Paris Agreement despite the U.S. withdrawal, intensifying cooperation with China. Some EU countries face challenges in meeting emission reduction targets, with resistance to formalizing more ambitious goals. U.S.-EU trade and investment ties are significant, with total trade reaching $1.3 trillion in 2018 and transatlantic FDI totaling over $5 trillion in 2017. The transatlantic economy has over $5 trillion in foreign direct investment, with the EU accounting for more than half. Despite low tariffs on average, there are still barriers to trade and investment. Efforts have been made to enhance trade ties and regulatory cooperation between the U.S. and EU, but tensions have risen under the Trump Administration's trade policy. The Trump Administration's trade policy prioritizes reducing U.S. trade deficits through unilateral tariff measures and a critical view of international economic cooperation. EU officials are concerned about the U.S.'s skepticism of the WTO and potential shift away from international cooperation. Discussions on WTO reform are ongoing, including changes to the dispute settlement system. The U.S. is monitoring EU trade policies on data protection, digital trade, and corporate tax avoidance penalties, which it sees as trade barriers. The Trump Administration blames the EU, especially Germany, for \"unfair\" trade practices. The Trump Administration blames \"unfair\" trade practices by the EU, particularly Germany, for the U.S. merchandise trade deficit. In 2018, the U.S. had a $110 billion deficit with the EU, with a $170 billion deficit in merchandise trade outweighing a $60 billion surplus in services trade. President Trump criticizes the U.S.-EU auto trade imbalance, citing tariffs on cars. The role of \"unfair\" trade practices in driving trade deficits is disputed, with EU leaders arguing the trade relationship is fair and mutually beneficial. U.S. MNE affiliates in Europe had $2.8 trillion in sales in 2016. European MNEs had $2.8 trillion in sales, while European affiliates in the US had $2.2 trillion in sales. President Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from the EU, citing national security concerns. The EU initially received a temporary exemption but failed to negotiate a permanent exemption. European leaders view the tariffs as unjust due to close political ties. The EU responded with retaliatory tariffs against the US. The EU imposed retaliatory tariffs on selected U.S. products like Kentucky bourbon and Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Both sides are pursuing cases in the WTO. The Section 232 investigation on automobiles strained relations, with the outcome being significant to proposed U.S.-EU trade negotiations. President Trump found that U.S. imports of motor vehicles threaten national security but opted for a negotiated solution. The U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) is tasked with negotiating agreements with the EU, Japan, and other countries to resolve trade disputes. Frictions may increase due to the long-standing Boeing-Airbus cases in the WTO, with both sides proposing countermeasure tariffs to address subsidies in the civil aircraft industry. A final WTO assessment is expected soon. The Trump Administration notified Congress of new U.S. trade agreement negotiations with the EU to address trade tensions. The proposed talks aim to address tariffs and nontariff barriers for goods, services, agriculture, government procurement, and intellectual property. Uncertainty remains over the scope of the negotiations. The EU seeks limited negotiations to address tariffs, nontariff barriers, and subsidies on industrial products, excluding agriculture. The negotiations aim to defuse tensions and avoid pitfalls of wide-ranging T-TIP negotiations. The United States and EU plan to launch negotiations to eliminate tariffs, nontariff barriers, and subsidies on non-auto industrial goods, boost trade in services, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medical products, and U.S. soybeans. They also aim to enhance strategic cooperation on energy, standards and regulations, and address unfair trade practices and WTO reform. Progress has been made in increasing EU imports of soybeans and LNG from the U.S., with ongoing regulatory cooperation in pharmaceuticals, medical products, and chemicals. The United States and EU plan to launch negotiations to eliminate tariffs and barriers on industrial goods, services, and agricultural products. President Trump's threats of tariffs have created uncertainty in the negotiations, especially regarding agriculture. The path forward is unclear due to differences in scope and potential trade restrictions. The EU and US plan to negotiate to eliminate tariffs and barriers on industrial goods, services, and agricultural products. The US opposes excluding agriculture from the talks, while the EU sees it as a sensitive issue due to differences in laws and regulations. Potential auto tariffs and ongoing EU-UK Brexit negotiations may impact the willingness of both sides to engage in negotiations. The ongoing EU-UK negotiations over Brexit and proposed U.S.-UK FTA negotiations raise questions about the future of trade policies. Concluding U.S.-EU trade negotiations may take time, with uncertainties on meeting congressional expectations and TPA requirements. Brexit complicates matters by removing the UK's voice on trade liberalization in the EU, while France opposes talks due to climate change concerns. Successful negotiations could help resolve tariff standoffs and rebuild trust amid shifts in U.S. trade policy under the Trump Administration. The potential U.S.-EU Free Trade Agreement (FTA) could have commercial and strategic significance, shaping global trade rules and addressing mutual concerns like China's trade practices. Failure in negotiations may lead to escalating trade tensions, but alternative avenues for engagement, such as regulatory cooperation and sectoral agreements, could be explored. The transatlantic relationship, based on alliances with democratic partners, has been crucial for the past 70 years. The U.S. values its partnership with Europe through NATO and U.S.-EU ties for security, stability, and global influence. Despite occasional tensions, the transatlantic partnership continues to serve U.S. strategic and economic interests. The Trump Administration emphasizes the importance of a prosperous and stable Europe for shared defense interests, but calls for increased European preparedness for great power competition. President Trump urges NATO allies to increase defense spending to share the security burden. President Trump's focus on defense and burden-sharing with U.S. allies, particularly within NATO, has led to increased demands for higher defense budgets. His efforts have also pushed the EU to address U.S. trade concerns, resulting in agreements to boost purchases of soybeans and LNG. Despite concerns, some officials downplay worries about a weakening U.S. commitment to the transatlantic partnership. The Trump Administration has shown support for NATO efforts and European partnerships, aiming to address global security challenges. Critics, however, question the consistency of the U.S. commitment to the transatlantic partnership. Critics argue that the Trump Administration's policies towards NATO, the EU, and key allies are damaging the transatlantic partnership and creating uncertainty about U.S. commitment to European security. Some suggest that tying U.S. commitment to NATO to defense spending harms the credibility of the U.S. security guarantee and weakens U.S. leadership in the alliance. President Trump's transactional view of NATO is seen as detrimental to transatlantic cohesion. Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, NATO invoked Article 5 and European allies supported U.S. forces in Afghanistan. European support for U.S. and NATO missions in Afghanistan may be more about standing as allies with the U.S. than about their own security concerns. There are concerns about future cohesion as European allies may not follow U.S. leadership, as seen in their reluctance to keep forces in Syria after a U.S. troop withdrawal. This division is seen as a win for Russia, undermining the transatlantic partnership and strengthening Russia's influence in Syria. Some European leaders worry about potential U.S. global disengagement and argue that Europe must be better prepared to address regional and international challenges on its own. EU efforts to reduce European dependence on the United States include trade agreements with other countries and regions, enhancing defense cooperation, and calls for a \"European army\" by French President Emmanuel Macron. German Chancellor Angela Merkel supports the idea of a European army to complement NATO. Some believe the transatlantic partnership will endure despite growing uncertainty about the future U.S. role in the world. Some experts believe that despite tensions, the EU will work with the Trump Administration and maintain relations with the US. The EU and US share similar values and will continue to cooperate on common interests like countering terrorism. The United States and the EU cooperate on issues like countering terrorism, cybersecurity, and WTO reform. Speaker Pelosi reaffirmed commitment to the transatlantic alliance, NATO, and the EU. Congress shows bipartisan support for the strong transatlantic partnership. During the Trump Administration, bipartisan support in Congress for NATO has been strong, with legislation passed to reaffirm U.S. support for the alliance. This support has been seen as a response to President Trump's criticisms of NATO. Congressional actions, such as passing H.R. 676 to limit the president's ability to withdraw from NATO unilaterally, demonstrate a commitment to the transatlantic partnership. In early 2019, Members of Congress urged the Trump Administration to reinstate the EU's diplomatic mission status to the United States after it was downgraded in late 2018. This action was seen as a demonstration of continued U.S. support for the EU, with visits to Brussels and key European capitals, the reestablishment of the EU Caucus in the House, and participation in the Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue. In late 2018, the State Department downgraded the EU's diplomatic status to that of an international organization. Congress has traditionally valued U.S.-European trade relations. Some Members are concerned about tariffs imposed by the Trump Administration on EU imports, leading to potential debate on modifying the President's authority. Additionally, some Members share the Administration's criticisms of certain European policies. Some Members of Congress are concerned about European defense spending levels and potential EU initiatives that could compete with NATO. There is also worry about growing Chinese influence in Europe and European efforts to protect business interests from U.S. secondary sanctions. Congressional opposition exists to projects like the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which could increase European dependence on Russian gas. Some Members support including agriculture in new U.S.-EU trade talks. Congress may need to assess how the transatlantic relationship promotes U.S. interests and the impact of Administration policies on the U.S.-European partnership. The Administration's policies have implications on the U.S.-European partnership in the short and long term. Congress may need to examine NATO's future, alliance cohesion, burdensharing, future threats, and costs and benefits for the United States. Congress also has a direct interest in monitoring U.S.-EU trade agreement negotiations and implementing legislation for a potential final trade agreement. The implications of Administration trade and tariff policies on U.S.-EU economic relations are of interest to Congress. The EU is facing internal and external challenges, including leadership changes. Congress should consider how these issues may impact the EU's future development and U.S.-EU cooperation. Brexit's implications for U.S.-UK and U.S.-EU relations, as well as for NATO and the Northern Ireland peace, should also be examined. Congress may need to assess implications for U.S.-UK and U.S.-EU relations, NATO, and the Northern Ireland peace process post-Brexit. Additionally, there is interest in potential U.S.-European cooperation on Russia and China, considering concerns about their global influence."
