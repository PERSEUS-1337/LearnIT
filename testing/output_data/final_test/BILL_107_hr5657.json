    "content": "The Act titled \"Fairness to Contact Lens Consumers Act\" ensures availability of contact lens prescriptions to patients. The \"Fairness to Contact Lens Consumers Act\" mandates that prescribers must provide patients with a copy of their contact lens prescription upon completion of a fitting. Prescribers cannot require patients to purchase lenses from them or pay additional fees for the prescription. Additionally, prescribers must provide or verify the prescription to anyone designated by the patient. SEC. 3. EXPIRATION OF CONTACT LENS PRESCRIPTIONS.\n\nA contact lens prescription shall expire based on state law, one year after fitting completion, or as specified by the prescriber for the patient's ocular health.\n\nSEC. 4. CONTENT OF ADVERTISEMENTS AND OTHER REPRESENTATIONS. SEC. 4. Content of advertisements and representations prohibits the sale of contact lenses without a prescription. SEC. 5. Prohibits prescribers from waiving liability for contact lens accuracy. SEC. 6. Violations treated as FTC Act violations. SEC. 7. Actions by states. The attorney general of a State can bring a civil action in federal court to address violations of the Act, seeking injunctions, compliance enforcement, damages, or other appropriate relief after providing notice. The attorney general of a State must provide written notice and a copy of the complaint to the Federal Trade Commission before filing an action, unless it is not feasible, in which case notice and the complaint must be provided at the same time as filing. The attorney general must notify the Federal Trade Commission before filing an action, and the Commission has the right to intervene in the action and be heard on any matter that arises. The attorney general can still exercise powers conferred by state laws for investigations and administering oaths. The Federal Trade Commission can conduct investigations, administer oaths, and compel witnesses or evidence. No State can initiate an action if the Commission has already done so. Actions can be brought in a district court meeting venue requirements, and process can be served where the defendant is an inhabitant or can be found. SEC. 8. STUDY AND REPORT. The Federal Trade Commission will conduct a study on competition in the sale of prescription contact lenses, examining state laws on verification, prescriber compliance, enforcement, and the impact of verification standards on competition. The Federal Trade Commission will study the impact of state laws on verification, prescriber compliance, and enforcement on competition in the sale of prescription contact lenses. This includes examining the effect of laws on ocular health, compliance by sellers, brand name prescriptions, and any other issues affecting competition. The Commission will consult the FDA on these matters and submit a report within 9 months of the Act's enactment. Upon enactment of this Act, the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission will submit a report to Congress on the study required. SEC. 9. EFFECT ON OTHER LAW. This Act does not affect FDA rules, state laws on medicine practice, contact lens fitting, or prescription requirements. SEC. 10. DEFINITIONS. The term \"contact lens fitting\" refers to the process that starts after an eye examination and ends when the prescriber is satisfied with the fit. It may include determining lens specifications, evaluating the fit, and follow-up examinations. The term \"prescriber\" refers to an ophthalmologist, optometrist, or other authorized person for contact lens prescriptions. A contact lens prescription is issued by an ophthalmologist, optometrist, or authorized person, containing patient details, examination date, issue and expiration dates, suitability notation, and necessary parameters for manufacturing. The contact lens prescription must include the prescriber's contact information, expiration date, and necessary details for lens manufacture. The Act will take effect 30 days after its enactment."
