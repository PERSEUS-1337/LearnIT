    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"United States-Japan Export Development and Technological Competitiveness Act of 1994\". The Congress finds that the United States trade deficit with Japan in 1993, along with Japan's current account surplus, highlights the imbalanced state of Japan's international economic relations. The closed nature of the Japanese market to foreign products is evident in low sales and investment penetration by foreign companies compared to Japanese penetration in the US market. Despite being a major market for manufactured goods, Japan had low foreign sales and investment percentages in 1992. In 1992, foreign corporate affiliates accounted for 17% of sales and 20% of assets in the US economy, with Japanese affiliates contributing 4.8% of sales and $594 per capita in investment. This contrasts with Japan, where only 1.2% of sales and 0.9% of assets were from foreign companies, with US affiliates accounting for 0.7% of sales and $89 per capita in investment. Japanese affiliates have a much higher sales and investment penetration in the US compared to US affiliates in Japan. The imbalance in sales and investment between foreign corporate affiliates in the US and Japan is significant. The blame for this lies with the Japanese Government's restrictive policies on trade and capital flow. To improve the US-Japan relationship and global economy growth, these barriers must be removed. United States trade policies towards Japan need to change to focus on export expansion and technological competitiveness. One way to assist US industry in overcoming barriers in Japan is to establish US industrial and service sector association representative offices in Japan. The establishment of US industrial and service sector association representative offices in Japan is crucial for overcoming barriers and increasing exports to Japan. Currently, only three nonagricultural US industry associations have full-time offices in Japan, relying on partial funding from the Market Development Cooperator Program. Expanding this program will greatly enhance US exports to Japan and improve awareness of competitive opportunities in the Japanese market. Expansion of the Market Development Cooperator Program in Japan will enhance US exports and increase awareness of competitive opportunities in the Japanese market. Authorization of Appropriations for the Department of Commerce in fiscal year 1995 to increase US industry associations in Japan participating in the Market Development Cooperator Program and expand trade promotion activities. Reports to Congress required on the program. The Secretary of Commerce must report annually to Congress on the progress of implementing the Market Development Cooperator Program and funding allocation to recipients in Japan. TITLE II--UNITED STATES EXPORT DEVELOPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY CENTER IN JAPAN\n\nSEC. 201. SENSE OF CONGRESS. United States Trade Relations With Japan: Congress emphasizes the need for equitable economic relations with Japan, ensuring US companies can enter and expand in the Japanese market, monitoring technological developments for their impact on US competitiveness, and supporting US industry in disputes. The Congress emphasizes the need for equitable economic relations with Japan, supporting US industry in disputes, and promoting US products in the Japanese market. An Export Development and Technology Center in Tokyo would facilitate these goals and enhance US competitiveness in Japan. The Export Development and Technology Center in Tokyo aims to coordinate responses to Japanese scientific and technological developments, provide information on the high costs of living in Japan, correct misperceptions of US products in the Japanese media, create jobs in the US, and help US industries in the Japanese market. The Export Development and Technology Center in Tokyo aims to promote US interests to the Japanese Government, business community, and public, monitor Japanese scientific and technological developments related to US industrial competitiveness and national security, increase access for US products in the Japanese market, and house offices for export-oriented US industry associations. The Export Development and Technology Center in Tokyo centralizes data collection and analysis of Japanese science and technology trends, assesses their implications for US industrial competitiveness, and provides office facilities for the US Foreign Commercial Service in Japan. Feasibility study on establishing a US Trade Development and Technology Center. The Secretary of Commerce will conduct a feasibility study on establishing a US Government-owned Export Development and Technology Center in Tokyo, Japan. A report on the study must be submitted to relevant committees within 180 days. Views from various individuals and groups will be solicited during the study. The Secretary of Commerce will conduct a feasibility study on establishing an Export Development and Technology Center in Japan, involving key government officials, the Government of Japan, trade associations, and other relevant individuals or entities. The report will analyze various aspects of the study within 180 days. The analysis will focus on the potential usefulness and desirability of the center for US industry and government, expanding the Market Development Cooperator Program to provide financial support to industry associations in the Center, and requiring US industry participants to promote US goods in Japan and monitor Japanese industry developments. The possibility of industry advisory staff at the center needing expertise in Japanese business and technology, industry representative offices requiring fluency in Japanese language, nonclerical personnel being US citizens, determining the best locations for the center, and considering a US-owned construction firm for building the center. The United States-owned construction firm licensed to do business in Japan may be involved in the management and oversight structure of the center. The total cost, cost-sharing arrangements, liaison facility in Washington, DC, architectural design, and operational costs are also key considerations for the center. Additionally, the possibility of conference rooms and a small auditorium within the center is being discussed. The curr_chunk discusses the facilities within the center, including conference rooms, an auditorium, a reference center, and a small library. It also mentions security requirements and compliance with US Government laws."
