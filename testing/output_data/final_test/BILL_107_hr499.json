    "content": "AMENDMENT OF CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY ACT: The act is amended to include a new section on child handgun safety devices. The Consumer Product Safety Commission must establish a safety standard for handgun locks within 12 months of initiating a rulemaking proceeding, as mandated by the amended Consumer Product Safety Act. The Commission may extend the 12-month period for good cause. The consumer product safety standard for gun locks must be effective 6 months after the final standard is promulgated. Gun locks must be difficult for children to deactivate and prevent handgun discharge unless the lock is deactivated. Certain provisions of the Act do not apply to the rulemaking. Section 30(d) of the Act does not apply to the rulemaking process. Section 11 of the Act does not apply to consumer product safety standards. Certain chapters of title 5 and the National Environmental Policy Act do not apply to this section. State laws are not affected by this section. The section allows individuals to comply with State laws unless they conflict with this section and provide greater protection to children regarding handguns. Enforcement of consumer product safety standards will be under this Act. Definitions include 'child' as under 13 years old and 'handgun lock' as any device. The term 'handgun lock' refers to a device that prevents a handgun from firing unless deactivated or removed. The definition of 'handgun' includes any firearm taxable under specific codes. Terms like 'licensed importer', 'licensed manufacturer', and 'licensed dealer' are defined in accordance with existing laws. The Consumer Product Safety Act is amended to include a conforming amendment regarding handgun locks. Sec. 38 of the Consumer Product Safety Act authorizes $2,000,000 for the Consumer Product Safety Commission to implement child handgun safety devices."
