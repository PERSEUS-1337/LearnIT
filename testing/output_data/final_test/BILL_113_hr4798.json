    "content": "The Act is titled the \"United States-Israel Alzheimer's Disease Cooperation Act\". It includes findings related to Alzheimer's disease. The Congress recognizes the importance of further research into Alzheimer's disease and acknowledges the strong alliance between the United States and Israel. Various cooperative scientific research programs between the two countries have led to significant advancements in fields such as life sciences, medicine, and agriculture. Israeli scientists are leading research in Alzheimer's disease, and enhanced cooperation between the United States and Israel in this field would benefit both countries. Grants for Alzheimer's disease research are discussed in Section 3. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a grant program to support research on tools, treatments, and cures for Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Projects eligible for funding must further this research and involve a partnership between a for-profit business, academic institution, National Laboratory, or nonprofit entity in the United States. The Secretary will establish a grant program for Alzheimer's disease research involving partnerships between entities in the US and Israel. Applicants must submit applications following procedures set by the Secretary and advisory board. The advisory board established under the grant program for Alzheimer's disease research will provide periodic performance reviews to the Secretary. It will be composed of 3 members appointed by the Secretary, including a representative of the Federal Government and members selected from nominees provided by the United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation and the United States-Israel Binational Industrial Research and Development Foundation. The Secretary may accept, retain, and use funds contributed for carrying out this section without further appropriation or fiscal year limitation. Grant recipients must submit a report within 180 days of project completion detailing fund usage and project success evaluation. Grants will be awarded under this section. The grant program under this section is for unclassified projects by the US and Israel, with a termination after 7 years. $3,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2015-2021, in addition to other funds accepted."
