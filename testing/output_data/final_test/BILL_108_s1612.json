    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Homeland Security Technology Improvement Act of 2004\" and includes a section on the Homeland Security Technology Transfer Program. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended to establish a multi-agency technology transfer program for State and local law enforcement agencies. The program involves research and development of new technologies in cooperation with the Office of Domestic Preparedness. The program involves research, surveys, tests, and evaluations of new technologies to enhance law enforcement agencies' capabilities in countering terrorist threats. Collaboration with State and local law enforcement agencies, the advisory committee, and other relevant offices is essential for supporting these activities. The Secretary has the authority to enter agreements and coordinate with other Federal agencies to maximize the effectiveness of technologies, equipment, and information. A comprehensive list of available technologies, equipment, and information is provided to the Office for Domestic Preparedness for a technology transfer program. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended to include a Technology, Equipment, and Information Transfer Program administered by the Director of the Office for Domestic Preparedness. The Director of the Office for Domestic Preparedness, in coordination with the Under Secretary for Science and Technology, establishes a technology transfer program to provide counterterrorism technology, equipment, and information to State and local law enforcement agencies based on available technologies and identified needs. The Secretary establishes a technology transfer program to provide counterterrorism technology, equipment, and information to State and local law enforcement agencies. This includes accepting applications, reviewing them with an advisory committee, and transferring approved technology, equipment, and information to improve homeland security capabilities. The Director of the Office for Domestic Preparedness establishes an advisory committee of retired and active State and local law enforcement officers to advise on the homeland security technology transfer program. The program can be expanded to transfer technology to first responders other than law enforcement agencies with approval from the Secretary. The technology, equipment, and information transfer program budget is limited to 10% for administrative expenses. $50,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2005 to 2014 for this program. The Senate passed S. 1612 on February 4, 2004, establishing a technology, equipment, and information transfer program within the Department of Homeland Security."
