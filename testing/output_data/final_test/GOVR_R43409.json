The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is also mentioned as an alternative to raising the minimum wage, providing income supplements to low-wage workers with children. The 113th Congress is considering raising the federal minimum wage to $10.10 per hour in three steps. There is a debate over whether increasing the minimum wage or expanding government aid through programs like SNAP is more effective in helping low-income families. This report focuses on how minimum wage and tax-transfer policies impact the income of workers from different family types. The report examines how minimum wage and tax-transfer policies affect the income of workers from various family types, including single childless workers, workers supporting married couples, single mothers with children, and married couples with children. It highlights the differences in policies between families with and without children, providing illustrations and background information on the topic. The report discusses the impact of minimum wage and tax-transfer policies on workers' income, focusing on full-time, full-year minimum wage workers. It provides illustrations of gross earnings and net income after taxes and SNAP benefits at both the current minimum wage and the proposed $10.10 minimum wage. The report also addresses the policy implications of addressing poverty through minimum wage and federally-funded earnings. This report discusses the implications of addressing poverty through the minimum wage and federally-funded earnings supplements. It does not consider all potential taxes and benefits for minimum wage workers, such as housing assistance and TANF. State taxes and benefits are also not included. Health care benefits and subsidies, including those provided under the Affordable Care Act, are excluded as well. The analysis does not take into account the Fair Labor Standards Act. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) establishes the federal minimum wage for covered workers, with certain exceptions for workers with disabilities or youth workers. Since 1938, the minimum wage has been raised 22 times, most recently in 2007 to $7.25 per hour. Increases in the minimum wage have not kept up with consumer inflation since the late 1960s. Since the late 1960s, the minimum wage has not kept up with consumer prices, leading to a decline in purchasing power for minimum wage workers. Approximately 3.6 million workers, or 4.7% of all hourly paid workers, earn at or below the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. Some may earn below this due to exemptions or misreporting. States can also set their own labor standards different from federal statutes. States can set labor standards different from federal statutes, including minimum wage laws. If a state has a higher minimum wage than the federal rate of $7.25 per hour, the state law applies. As of January 1, 2014, 21 states and the District of Columbia had minimum wage rates above the federal rate, ranging from $7.40 to $9.32 per hour. Some states have minimum wages lower than the federal rate, in which case FLSA-covered workers would receive the federal minimum wage. In states with minimum wage rates below the federal rate or no requirement, only individuals not covered by the FLSA are subject to those lower rates. Full-time work at the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour yields $15,080 annually before taxes. Earnings vary based on hours worked and wage rate. Family circumstances impact the standard of living for minimum wage workers. The 2014 poverty guidelines reflect the financial need of larger families, with gross earnings from full-time, year-round work impacting poverty-level income for different family types. For example, a single full-year, full-time worker earning the federal minimum wage has gross earnings above the poverty guidelines for one person but below for a family of two or more. The economic well-being of families is determined by net income, which is the amount of money available after taxes and government benefits. While gross earnings from full-time, year-round minimum wage work exceed poverty-level income for a single, childless person, they fall short for other family types. Taxes like Social Security and federal income tax can reduce take-home pay, with higher-earning families taxed at a higher rate. Low-income workers are significantly impacted by the current federal tax system. The federal tax system impacts low-income workers significantly, especially in terms of deductions, exemptions, and credits that determine if they owe federal income tax. Refundable tax credits like the EITC and child tax credit provide benefits to families even without regular income tax liability. Need-tested programs, such as SNAP, are based on financial need, with benefits decreasing as incomes rise. Payroll tax liabilities remain constant regardless of family circumstances. In 2014, payroll tax liabilities are determined by the tax rate and gross earnings, with a worker facing a 7.65% rate for Social Security and Medicare taxes. A full-time minimum wage worker would pay $1,154 in payroll taxes. Federal income tax liabilities vary based on family characteristics and other income, deductions, exemptions, and credits. The personal exemption for 2014 is $3,950, and taxable income depends on deductions taken by the taxpayer. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) was first enacted in 1975 as a temporary measure to offset payroll taxes during an economic downturn. It has since been made permanent and expanded through various tax reforms. The EITC is a refundable credit paid to low-income families with children based on their earnings over a tax year. It is the largest form of cash assistance for such families. The EITC provides a maximum credit based on the number of children, with amounts ranging from $496 for workers with no children to $6,143 for families with three or more children. The \"phase out\" thresholds determine when the credit begins to reduce and completely phases out, with single individuals without children losing the credit at $14,590, while families with children can receive it at higher income levels. The Child Tax Credit was created in 1997 and now provides up to $1,000 per child. The credit is refundable, allowing taxpayers with no federal income tax liability to receive the Additional Child Tax Credit. To qualify, a taxpayer must earn at least $3,000, with the credit equal to 15% of earnings above that amount, up to $1,000 per child. The SNAP program helps low-income households buy food by providing benefits based on 30% of their net income. SNAP benefits cover the gap between 30% of net income spent on food and the cost of a nutritious diet. Administered by state and local offices, SNAP is funded by the federal government and serves various household types. Able-bodied adults without children face time limits on benefits unless they work or participate in employment activities. SNAP benefits are based on federal rules for income and deductions. The net income of individuals working at minimum wage is affected by federal policies. This section illustrates the impact of minimum wage, federal taxes, and SNAP benefits on families' net income in relation to poverty guidelines. It calculates the net income for different family types based on full-time, full-year work at minimum wage. The net incomes of families working at minimum wage are influenced by federal taxes and SNAP benefits. Assumptions are made to calculate taxes and benefits based on family circumstances. Families with children receive larger earnings supplements from the federal income tax system compared to those without children. Table 3 displays gross earnings, tax liabilities, tax credits, and SNAP benefits for full-time minimum wage workers. The net income of full-time, year-round minimum wage workers varies based on family circumstances. A single person with no children has net income below gross earnings and qualifies for a small SNAP benefit. A worker supporting a childless couple has a slightly higher net income than gross earnings. A single mother with two children receives significant tax credits and SNAP benefits, resulting in a net income above gross earnings. However, a worker supporting a spouse and one child has a lower net income compared to the single mother with two children due to the dependency of tax credits on the number of children in the family. The net income of full-time, year-round workers varies based on family circumstances. Federal taxes and SNAP benefits help mitigate differences in net income relative to poverty level among different family types. Single mothers with two children have the highest net income to poverty ratios, followed by married couples with one child. Minimum wage workers supporting childless couples may still have net income slightly below poverty. Pending legislation aims to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour. The pending legislation aims to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour in 2016. This section analyzes the impact on gross and net income of this increase, comparing it to the current minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. Consumer prices are expected to rise, reducing the purchasing power of income earned at the current minimum wage. The purchasing power of income earned at the current $7.25 per hour minimum wage will decline between 2014 and 2016. The proposed $10.10 per hour minimum wage would result in lower purchasing power in 2016 compared to if it was raised to that level in 2014. Inflation affects taxes and benefits for minimum wage workers in 2016 compared to 2014. Federal income tax exemptions, deductions, brackets, and the EITC are adjusted for inflation annually. SNAP income eligibility and benefits are also adjusted for cost-of-living changes each year. Table 4 displays gross earnings and projected net income for a full-year, full-time minimum wage worker by family type under the current $7.25 minimum wage in 2016. The table in 2016 shows similar patterns to 2014 for families under the $7.25 minimum wage. EITC and SNAP benefits increase in 2016, but inflation erodes purchasing power. Gross earnings and net income remain the same, but inflation reduces their value. The table in 2016 shows a decline in gross earnings and net income relative to the federal poverty guidelines between 2014 and 2016. Despite some mitigation from the federal income tax system and SNAP benefits, workers would still experience a loss in purchasing power. A minimum wage of $10.10 per hour would result in gross annual earnings of $21,008 for a full-year, full-time worker in 2016. An increase in the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 per hour would boost gross earnings by $5,928 annually. However, net income would increase by a lesser amount due to rising tax liabilities. Higher income levels can lead to reduced SNAP benefits or ineligibility for the program. The impact of the wage increase on net incomes varies by family type, with federal income tax liabilities rising for workers without children. Federal income tax liabilities increase for workers without children, while those with children continue to owe no federal income taxes. The EITC is eliminated for childless families and reduced for single mothers with two children. Married couples with one child remain eligible for the maximum EITC. The child credit is raised for single mothers with two children to $2,000. Increasing the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 per hour boosts gross earnings, but the net income increase is less due to tax liabilities. The difference in net income increase between a single, childless person and a single mother with two children is due to the dollar value of benefits from the tax system and SNAP. The single person without a child receives the least benefits, allowing them to keep a greater share of their earning increases. In contrast, the single mother with two children receives the most benefits, resulting in a smaller net income increase when her income rises. The single mother with two children receives the highest government aid among the family types examined in the table, resulting in the highest net income. She keeps 63% of an earnings increase, facing a higher implicit \"tax rate\" compared to higher income families. Increasing the minimum wage would affect net incomes of minimum wage workers relative to poverty-level income. Increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour in 2016 would boost all family types' incomes above the poverty level. It would also change the relationship of different family types relative to the poverty line. The net income of the single worker with no children working full-time at the minimum wage would be the greatest relative to poverty under the proposed minimum wage. Table 8 compares net income relative to poverty in 2014 at the current minimum wage and in 2016 at both the current and proposed minimum wage levels. The proposed minimum wage hike would increase income-to-poverty ratios in 2016 compared to 2014 for full-time minimum wage workers. Single workers without children earning minimum wage already have income above the poverty line in 2014. However, families with children would still be below the poverty line with one minimum wage earner. The federal tax system and SNAP program supplement earnings for low-income families, lifting net income above poverty. Only minimum wage workers supporting a spouse and no children have net income below poverty. Increasing the federal minimum wage to $10.10 could help raise incomes and reduce reliance on government benefits. Raising the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour would increase incomes for full-time workers, even after considering tax liabilities and reduced government benefits. Congress must consider the impact on employment and targeting those most in need. Increasing the minimum wage could lead to higher incomes for families at a lower government cost. The effects of minimum wage increases on earnings are debated among economists. Some argue that potential disemployment effects could negate the benefits of an increase. The competitive model of the labor market suggests that minimum wage increases may lead to reduced employment as firms base their hiring decisions on wage rates and product prices. The competitive model of the labor market suggests that firms may reduce employment in response to minimum wage increases, as they cannot set prices for their products. Non-competitive models predict negligible or positive employment effects if firms can adjust through other means like charging higher prices or improving operational efficiencies. The Minimum Wage Study Commission (MWSC) was created by Congress in the late 1970s to review the costs and benefits of the federal minimum wage. Their 1981 findings showed that a 10% increase in the minimum wage led to a 1% to 3% reduction in teenage employment, while the effects on adult employment were less clear. This consensus view suggested small employment effects for teenage workers and an uncertain impact on adult employment. Researchers studied the effects of state-level minimum wage rates above the federal rate using \"natural experiments\" and case studies. Economists David Card and Alan Krueger found little to no employment effects of minimum wage increases in a case study comparing New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Their research in the 1990s and early 2000s showed that recent minimum wage increases did not have the negative employment effects predicted by traditional models. In the 2000s, reviews and meta studies examined the research on minimum wage. Economists Neumark and Wascher found a lack of consensus on the effects of minimum wage increases, but most studies indicated negative employment effects. Their own work consistently supports negative employment effects of minimum wage increases, aligning with the standard competitive labor market model. In a meta-study of studies from 1972 to 2007, Doucouliagos and Stanley reviewed 1,474 empirical estimates of minimum-wage elasticity of employment in 64 studies. The evidence supports the Card-Krueger finding of an insignificant employment effect from minimum-wage raises, aligning with alternative labor market models. Recent studies have refined methodological approaches to estimate the effects of minimum wage increases by considering heterogeneity in employment growth across states and over time. These studies suggest that once regional and local differences in employment trends are accounted for, any negative effects of minimum wage laws become insignificant. Overall, the estimates indicate no detectable employment losses from recent minimum wage increases in the United States. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) assessed the impact of a $10.10 per hour minimum wage increase, estimating a reduction in employment by 500,000 workers. They also considered a $9.00 per hour increase, which would result in a smaller reduction of 100,000 workers. CBO noted uncertainty in these estimates and stated that the proposed $10.10 per hour increase is larger than most studied increases. The literature on the effects of the minimum wage is vast and often contradictory. Recent studies suggest little to no negative employment effects of minimum wage increases, challenging previous consensus. The debate over the impact of proposed minimum wage increases is likely to continue, with the minimum wage being seen as a \"blunt instrument\" for reducing poverty. A minimum wage increase to $10.10 per hour would impact different family types in varying ways, with federal tax and benefit policies supplementing incomes based on family circumstances. The CBO reported that such an increase would raise the earnings of 16.5 million workers. An increase in the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour would boost the earnings of 16.5 million low-wage workers in 2016, totaling $31 billion. However, only 19% of this increase would benefit families below the poverty level. The CBO also projected a reduction of 900,000 people in poverty by 2016, a 2% decrease compared to current law. Businesses may respond to the wage hike by raising prices or cutting profits. Raising the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour could lead to price increases and reduced profits for businesses. However, it may not significantly impact most minimum wage workers or poverty, as adjustments for inflation would shield workers from price hikes. An alternative to addressing poverty among the working poor is to increase earnings supplements through programs like the EITC and SNAP. Federal policy has increasingly relied on these measures to assist low-income families, especially those with children. Since the 1980s, bipartisan support has been seen for income tax credit and reducing the income tax burden. President Reagan praised the 1986 Tax Reform Act for benefiting working poor and families. President Clinton emphasized the importance of rewarding work with the 1993 tax bill, expanding the EITC to lift working families out of poverty. These measures aim to assist low-income families, particularly those with children. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) has bipartisan support and is considered part of the American creed. It helps reduce poverty among children and families by increasing income. In 2010, the EITC, child credit, and a temporary tax credit reduced child poverty by about 30%. Considerations include federal budget costs, work incentives, and the annual nature of EITC benefits. Recently, there has been increased attention to the federal budget costs of low-income aid, with a focus on the costs of \"welfare\" programs. The Heritage Foundation has highlighted these increased costs, and new rules adopted by the House of Representatives require budget resolutions to include information on spending for \"direct means-tested programs.\" Program spending for selected low-income cash and food assistance programs for the nonelderly and nondisabled in FY2011 totaled $103 billion. In FY2011, $103 billion of the $142 billion in assistance provided by selected programs went to families with earnings. SNAP and TANF pay benefits to families with and without earnings, with a portion going to households with earnings. An increase in the minimum wage could reduce benefits to low-income households, but potential cost savings may be offset by job loss and new spending on benefits. The CBO report in February 2014 analyzed the impact of raising the federal minimum wage to $10.10 per hour. It stated that budget deficits would likely be lower in the first decade after the increase, with slightly higher deficits in the following decades. Need-tested benefits decrease as family income rises, and total income does not increase by $1 for every $1 earned. The EITC and child credit provide an earnings bonus at lower income levels, acting as work incentives for low earners and families with children. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and child credit act as work incentives for low earners and families with children. Concerns arise about work disincentives as benefits phase out at higher earnings levels, potentially leading to high implicit marginal tax rates. Research on earnings supplements focuses on a worker's decision to participate in the labor force and how many hours to work once in it. Research on earnings supplements focuses on a worker's decision to participate in the labor force and how many hours to work. Studies show that earnings supplements increase labor force participation, but there is less focus on the impact on hours worked. While the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) has little effect on reducing hours for those already working, there is evidence that earnings supplements can reduce hours for some. For more information on implicit marginal tax rates, refer to the Appendix. The EITC and child credit boost income once a year through tax refunds, impacting family well-being. Research shows EITC income is spent on bills, debt, and large items like durable goods and vehicles. EITC expansions do not reduce employment but increase work effort for beneficiaries. EITC expansions increase work effort, especially for single mothers, by inducing more people into the labor force. However, this may lead to lower wages as more workers become available, resulting in shared benefits between workers and firms. Some workers may see reduced net incomes due to the impact on wage rates, particularly childless workers. The EITC benefits are not equally distributed among workers, with childless workers receiving a small credit. President Obama and Senator Murray have proposed expanding the EITC for childless workers. Despite minimum wage increases since 1981, the real value has declined, leading to a need for government earnings subsidies like the EITC. The expansion of earnings subsidies, such as tax credits benefiting families with children, has been a key component of welfare reforms. However, this has not benefitted all groups, particularly those without children. The pending minimum wage legislation raises questions about government intervention to address poverty among low-wage workers. Minimum wages and earnings supplements are seen as alternative policies to raise incomes, but they also have potential drawbacks and impact workers in different family types differently. The recent literature discusses the interaction between minimum wage and earnings-supplement policies, considering them as alternative or complementary policies to address poverty. Lower-income workers may face explicit and implicit taxes, creating work disincentives. Receipt of assistance from multiple need-tested programs may exacerbate these disincentives. Workers face both explicit and implicit taxes on their earnings. Explicit taxes include payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare, totaling 7.65% of earnings. Additionally, need-tested assistance programs may impose an implicit tax on working individuals, balancing income adequacy and personal responsibility. Under need-tested assistance programs, households with minimal income may qualify for benefits that are reduced as earnings increase, known as the benefit reduction rate (BRR). This reduction can be seen as an implicit tax on earned income, with SNAP benefits being reduced by 24 cents on every dollar earned. Combined with FICA payroll taxes, a worker receiving SNAP may face a combined 31.65% marginal tax on earnings. The EITC is structured differently. The EITC provides an \"earnings bonus\" to specified workers over lower-earnings ranges, up to a specified earnings level and maximum credit amount, before it begins to phase-out at higher earnings levels. The credit represents a \"negative income tax\" for eligible recipients, providing money back from the government either as a refund or a reduction in federal income tax liability. The EITC provides an \"earnings bonus\" to specified workers over lower-earnings ranges, up to a specified earnings level and maximum credit amount, before it begins to phase-out at higher earnings levels. It represents a \"negative income tax\" for eligible recipients, providing money back from the government either as a refund in excess of federal income tax liability or as a reduction in federal income taxes owed. Figure A-2 illustrates the structure of benefits, tax credits, and explicit taxes relative to earnings, including SNAP, EITC, ACTC, CTC, FICA payroll taxes, and regular federal tax liability. The curr_chunk discusses income markers for different wage levels, indicating points where federal tax liability, EITC phase-out, and SNAP benefits are affected. The curr_chunk discusses income markers for different wage levels, showing when federal tax liability, EITC phase-out, and SNAP benefits are impacted. The figures illustrate the annual net and gross income for a single parent with one child, relative to full-time work at different wage rates. The curr_chunk discusses implicit tax rates and their effects on net income based on changes in gross earnings. Implicit marginal tax rates can either discourage or encourage work at specific earnings levels. Implicit tax rates can either discourage or encourage work based on changes in gross earnings. At lower earnings ranges, the EITC benefit increases with increased earnings, resulting in negative marginal implicit tax rates. Conversely, at higher income ranges, the EITC is reduced as gross earnings increase, leading to positive implicit marginal tax rates on earnings. Marginal tax rates would vary with different margins used. Average implicit tax rates represent the gain in net income from transitioning from non-work to work at a specified level of gross earnings. Average implicit tax rates impact individuals' decisions to work, while marginal implicit tax rates affect choices regarding hours or weeks of work. Workers with fixed schedules may have limited flexibility to adjust their hours according to their preferences."
