    "title": "AB 2333",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 490.5 of the Penal Code is amended to include mandatory fines of $50 to $1,000 for first-time petty theft convictions involving merchandise from a merchant or library materials. Additionally, imprisonment in the county jail for up to six months may also be imposed. If an unemancipated minor commits petty theft, the merchant or library facility involved may take action. Parents or legal guardians can be held liable for damages caused by their unemancipated minor's misconduct, with fines ranging from $50 to $500. They may also be responsible for the retail or fair market value of stolen merchandise or library materials. Parents or legal guardians can be held liable for damages caused by their unemancipated minor's misconduct, with fines ranging from $50 to $500. Recovery of damages for stolen merchandise or library materials can be pursued in court, with a maximum limit of $500 per action. The provisions in this subdivision provide additional civil remedies for merchants and individuals, allowing them to pursue other civil remedies. Section 1714.1 of the Civil Code does not apply here. If an adult or emancipated minor unlawfully takes merchandise from a merchant or library materials, they are liable for damages ranging from $50 to $500, plus costs. They must also pay the retail or fair market value if the items are not recovered in good condition. Legal action can be taken in small claims court or any appropriate court. These provisions are in addition to other civil remedies available to merchants and individuals. In lieu of fines, a person may perform court-designated public services to satisfy the assessed fine at minimum wage prevailing in the state. All fines collected under this section shall be distributed in accordance with Penal Code Sections 1463 and 1463.1. A county can allocate up to 50% of fines to the county superintendent of schools for programs that discourage shoplifting, theft, and burglary in local school districts. The funds will be administered by the county superintendent of schools and allocated to school districts within the county. The county superintendent of schools can allocate funds for educational projects in school districts within the county. Merchants and theater owners are allowed to detain individuals suspected of theft or unauthorized recording on their premises. A person employed by a library facility can detain someone suspected of unlawfully removing books or materials. They can use a reasonable amount of nondeadly force to prevent escape or property loss. During the detention, any items believed to be unlawfully taken can be retained. Items in plain view can be examined by the merchant, theater owner, or library employee to determine ownership. A merchant, theater owner, or library employee can request a person to surrender any item believed to be unlawfully taken from the premises. If the person refuses, a limited search of their immediate possessions can be conducted to recover the item. Upon surrender or discovery of the item, the detained person may be asked to provide proof of their true identity. If a person refuses to surrender or cease operation of a video recording device in a theater, the theater owner can refuse admission, request the person to leave, and offer a refund. If the person continues to interfere, they may be deemed to be obstructing lawful business. A peace officer can search a person arrested for theft and their immediate possessions. In a civil action, a merchant can defend detaining or arresting a person if they had probable cause to believe the person stole merchandise and acted reasonably. In civil actions resulting from detention or arrest by a theater owner or library employee, it is a defense if there was probable cause to believe the person was recording without permission or stealing library materials, and if the actions taken were reasonable. \"Merchandise\" refers to personal property displayed for retail sale by a merchant. The terms \"merchant\" and \"theater owner\" are defined, and \"book or other library materials\" encompass various forms of written or printed material found in library facilities. The term \"library facility\" includes public libraries, educational institutions, museums, and public record repositories. Library facilities must display a sign at their entrance and exit as specified. State law allows for the detention of individuals suspected of committing \"library theft\" to prevent the theft of books and library materials (Penal Code Section 490.5). State law allows merchants to offer suspected thieves a precomplaint diversion program instead of arrest. The Legislature acknowledges varying strip search practices in California, some violating privacy rights after minor offenses. The Legislature aims to protect constitutional rights by limiting strip and body cavity searches for prearraignment detainees arrested for minor offenses or minors detained prior to a hearing. This does not apply to individuals in the custody of certain departments. In this section, definitions for body cavity, physical body cavity search, strip search, and visual body cavity search are provided. It states that individuals may be subjected to patdown searches, metal detector searches, and thorough clothing searches upon arrest to discover concealed weapons and contraband substances before being placed in a booking cell. A person arrested for a misdemeanor or infraction offense shall not undergo a strip search unless there is reasonable suspicion of concealing contraband, with written authorization required. The authorization for strip searches must be obtained from the supervising officer with specific reasons provided. A person arrested for a misdemeanor or infraction not involving weapons, drugs, or violence cannot be held in the general jail population unless they are not cited and released, not released on their own recognizance, and unable to post bail within three hours. The person arrested for a misdemeanor or infraction not involving weapons, drugs, or violence cannot be housed in the general jail population unless unable to post bail within three hours. They can only be placed in the general population in a documented emergency with prior authorization. A person arrested for a misdemeanor or infraction offense cannot be subjected to a physical body cavity search without a search warrant issued by a magistrate. The authorization and search warrant must be recorded in the agency's records and made available upon request to the person searched or their authorized representative. Persons conducting strip searches or body cavity searches must not touch certain areas of the person being searched. A physical body cavity search must be done in sanitary conditions by qualified medical personnel. The searcher must be of the same sex as the person being searched, except for physicians or licensed medical personnel. Strip, visual, and physical body cavity searches must be conducted in a private area. Unauthorized searches are a misdemeanor. Legal rights for damages or relief are not limited by this section. Any person harmed by a violation of this section can sue for damages, including punitive damages, equitable relief, and attorney's fees."
