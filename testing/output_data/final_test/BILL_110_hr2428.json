    "content": "The Biofuels Research Initiative Act of 2007, also known as the \"Biofuels Research Initiative,\" amends the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 to include research, extension, and educational programs on biobased energy technologies and products. The programs established under this section aim to enhance national energy security, promote agricultural diversification and environmental sustainability, boost economic diversification in rural areas, and improve coordination in bioenergy and biomass research and development. The Secretary of Agriculture shall establish programs to provide grants to lead land-grant universities for regional consortiums to enhance national energy security, promote agricultural diversification, and improve coordination in bioenergy and biomass research and development. The Secretary of Agriculture will provide grants to lead land-grant universities for regional consortiums based on specific criteria. Universities must have expertise in germplasm development and production logistics to be part of the consortium. The Secretary of Agriculture will provide grants to lead land-grant universities for regional consortiums based on specific criteria. Universities must have expertise in germplasm development, production logistics, economic and policy analysis, environmental assessment, facilities, and academic and research capabilities in various fields related to bioenergy production systems. The Act focuses on regional consortium groups for bioenergy production systems, with specific criteria for universities to receive grants. Regional consortium groups include the North-central consortium and the Southeastern consortium, each composed of specific states. The Act establishes regional consortium groups for bioenergy production systems, including the North-central consortium and the Southeastern consortium. The Southeastern consortium includes Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands. The South-central consortium includes Arkansas, Colorado, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. The Western consortium includes Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and other US territories. The Act establishes regional consortium groups for bioenergy production systems, including the Northeastern consortium composed of multiple states. Funds allocated to the consortium should primarily support excellence in science, engineering, and economics to promote specified purposes through relevant educational programs. The regional university consortium shall provide grants to land-grant colleges and universities for research, extension, and educational programs on technology development, with a minimum of 30% of funds allocated for each purpose. University consortiums conduct multi-institutional and multi-State research, extension, and educational programs on technology implementation. They cannot recover indirect costs when making grants to other land-grant colleges and universities. Each consortium, in cooperation with other institutions and private industry, develops and submits a plan for addressing bioenergy, biomass, and gasification research priorities at the State and regional levels for grant approval by the Departments of Agriculture and Energy. The Bio Energy Consortium, established under SEC. 9012, collaborates with institutions and private industry to address bioenergy, biomass, and gasification research priorities at the State and regional levels for grant approval by the Departments of Agriculture and Energy. The Secretary of Agriculture will establish a Bio Energy Consortium led by 5 universities to advance biomass for energy. The universities will organize talents and expertise nationwide, address priority issues, and develop biomass technologies. An External Advisory Group will also be formed. The Bio Energy Consortium and 5 lead universities will be advised by an external advisory group comprised of regional stakeholders with a broad range of expertise. They will submit annual reports defining their research, extension, and teaching programs and accomplishments. $50,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2008 to 2017 for this purpose."
