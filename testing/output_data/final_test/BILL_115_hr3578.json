    "content": "The \"Expungement Act of 2017\" allows for the expungement of criminal records for certain nonviolent offenders under a new subchapter in the United States Code. The \"Expungement Act of 2017\" permits individuals convicted of nonviolent offenses to petition for expungement under specific requirements outlined in the subchapter. This includes defining nonviolent offenses as those without the use of weapons or violence, and detailing the procedure, effects, and conditions for expungement. The Expungement Act of 2017 allows individuals with nonviolent offenses to seek expungement if they meet certain criteria, such as having no violent convictions, completing all court requirements, staying drug-free for a year, and undergoing rehabilitation if required by the court. Sec. 3633 outlines the procedure for expungement, allowing individuals to file a petition in court for expungement of their conviction. The United States Attorney may submit recommendations within 60 days, and the court will consider evidence from both the petitioner and the Government before making a decision. The court will rule on the petition for expungement after considering the petitioner's eligibility and weighing their interests against justice and public safety. If denied, the person can file a new petition after one year. Expungement will restore the individual to their pre-arrest status in the eyes of the law, with no disqualifications or statements affecting their criminal records. Upon expungement of a criminal record, the individual is not required to disclose the expunged conviction. This does not disqualify them from any lawful activity and they are not guilty of perjury for not disclosing the arrest or criminal proceedings. All official records, including references to the arrest, are expunged or sealed. The expungement of a criminal record results in the removal of all references to the arrest, criminal proceedings, and outcomes. The Department of Justice retains a nonpublic record for court use only. Additionally, a nonpublic index of expunged records is maintained by the Department of Justice for law enforcement purposes. The expunged records are kept in a nonpublic index by the Department of Justice for law enforcement use. Authorized disclosure includes access for the accused or their designated agent, prosecutors, law enforcement agencies, courts, agencies issuing gun licenses, and potential employers. ``(3) any prospective city, State, or Federal employer or agency involved in investigating and prosecuting under criminal or civil statutes, including employers of police or peace officers, must be provided with all records obtained and given a chance to explain. Punishment for improper disclosure applies to those who knowingly violate this provision.`` ``(c) Punishment for Improper Disclosure.--Any person who knowingly disseminates information about an expunged conviction other than the offender may face a fine or imprisonment up to one year, or both. Expunged records will be restored as public records and can be used in court proceedings if the individual is convicted of a new offense.'' Expungement provisions under the Act apply to individuals convicted of an offense before, on, or after the enactment date."
