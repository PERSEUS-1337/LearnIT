The United States has been engaged in military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq since 2001 and 2003, respectively. Congress has appropriated over $1 trillion for the Department of Defense, State Department, and medical costs related to these operations. Over 90 percent of the funds were allocated for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Department of Defense has received supplemental appropriations for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, designated as emergency funding. The Congressional Budget Office and Congressional Research Service find it challenging to estimate future costs due to limited information provided by the Department of Defense on incurred costs and lack of key factors data. Since the beginning of the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, over 2,000,000 members of the United States Armed Forces have served. More than 4,400 members have been killed in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and over 1,400 in Operation Enduring Freedom. Additionally, over 1,620 members have suffered amputations, and more than 243,685 veterans have been treated for mental health conditions, with over 66,900 diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Approximately 178,876 veterans have a confirmed traumatic brain injury diagnosis, with 46 percent of veterans seeking treatment at a Department of Veterans Affairs hospital or clinic. The Independent Review Group identified traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, severe burns, and traumatic amputations as the signature wounds of the current conflicts, stating that recovery can take months or years. The President, along with contributions from the Secretaries of Defense, State, and Veterans Affairs, must submit a report to Congress estimating the long-term costs of Operation New Dawn and Operation Enduring Freedom under different deployment scenarios. The President, in collaboration with other key officials, is required to submit a report to Congress estimating the long-term costs of Operation New Dawn and Operation Enduring Freedom based on various deployment scenarios, including force levels and expected deployment durations.

The President must provide estimates for the number of troops deployed in support of Operation New Dawn and Operation Enduring Freedom, including breakdowns by regular and reserve components. Additionally, the report should include the number of service members expected to serve multiple deployments, as well as the use of contractors and private military security firms in these operations. The report must include estimates for the number of veterans suffering from PTSD, traumatic brain injury, and in need of prosthetic care due to amputations from service in Iraq and Afghanistan. It should also cover pending VA claims, disability compensation seekers, and the total number of Armed Forces members killed or wounded in these operations.
