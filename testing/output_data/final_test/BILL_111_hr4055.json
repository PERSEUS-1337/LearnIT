    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Honest Opportunity Probation with Enforcement (HOPE) Initiative Act of 2009\". Congress acknowledges that crime imposes significant costs on victims and communities, as well as taxpayers. States spent over $50 billion on corrections in fiscal year 2008, with a large portion of crime and prison occupancy linked to illicit drug consumption. Addressing the drug habits of supervised offenders is crucial in reducing drug consumption in the United States. One in 100 adults is incarcerated, and 1 in 31 is under criminal justice supervision, including probation. The majority of individuals under supervision are on probation in their communities. Failure to complete probation terms contributes to prison admissions. Controlling drug use among probationers reduces drug consumption, crime rates, and taxpayer burdens. Innovations in offender supervision show promising results. Innovations in offender supervision, such as Hawaii's HOPE initiative, have shown success in reducing drug use, crime, and recidivism. If replicated in multiple jurisdictions, these programs could have broader benefits in shrinking the market for illegal drugs and reducing profits. Innovations in offender supervision, like Hawaii's HOPE initiative, have successfully reduced drug use, crime, and recidivism, potentially shrinking the market for illegal drugs and profits of drug trafficking organizations. The HOPE initiative grants aim to reduce drug use, crime, and recidivism, potentially impacting the market for illegal drugs and drug trafficking organizations. The Attorney General may establish a competitive demonstration grant program to award grants to State, tribal, and local courts for probation programs that reduce drug use, crime, and recidivism through swift, predictable, and graduated sanctions. Up to 20 grants can be awarded, selected based on strong proposals, evaluation designs, and geographic diversity. To be eligible for a grant under this section, a State, tribal, or local court must submit an application describing the program, a long-term strategy for implementation, consultation with government entities, and key partners involved. The program must identify key partners such as judges, court administrators, probation officers, and law enforcement. It should also collect data on individuals enrolled, drug testing frequency, sanctions for violations, and time to issue sanctions. The program must conduct an unbiased comparison of outcomes between participants and probationers not in the program, including drug test rates, appearance rates, probation modifications, revocations, arrests, time in jail, and correctional costs. They should partner with an independent advisor to design the demonstration program and identify the comparison group. The grant awarded under this section is to establish probation programs that identify high-risk individuals, notify them of program rules, conduct drug screening, and monitor compliance with probation terms. The probation program aims to enforce rules with immediate arrest for violations, sanctions for absconders, rewards for compliance, substance abuse treatment for drug users, and termination for non-compliance. The probation program includes immediate arrest for violations, sanctions for absconders, rewards for compliance, substance abuse treatment for drug users, and termination for non-compliance. The demonstration program also involves revocation of probation for those who repeatedly break rules and pose a danger to public safety. Coordination meetings are held for key partners, and grantees must calculate cost savings resulting from reduced incarceration. The Attorney General evaluates cost savings from reduced incarceration and reinvestment in grant programs. The Attorney General evaluates cost savings from reduced incarceration and provides guidance for reinvestment in grant programs. An entity is selected to serve as the evaluation coordinator for the HOPE initiative, analyzing measures and outcomes of demonstration programs and ensuring consistent tracking of progress. Aggregate data from all programs is made available to each program and the Attorney General. The Attorney General shall annually report to Congress on the results of the HOPE initiative. $25,000,000 is authorized for grants awarded under this section for fiscal years 2010 through 2014, with $500,000 available each year for coordination activities by the Attorney General."
