The California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority consists of seven members, including the Director of Finance, Chairperson of the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission, President of the Public Utilities Commission, Controller, and Treasurer who serves as the chairperson. Other members include two state legislators appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules and the Speaker of the Assembly as nonvoting members. Each member can designate a deputy or clerk to represent them at meetings. The Treasurer convenes the first meeting of the authority. Section 26011.8 of the Public Resources Code is amended. Section 26011.8 of the Public Resources Code is amended to promote California-based manufacturing, jobs, advanced manufacturing, and environmental goals through financial assistance for projects. The authority may approve projects for sales and use tax exclusion to achieve these objectives. The amended Section 26011.8 of the Public Resources Code defines \"Project\" as tangible personal property used for processing recycled feedstock or in the production of advanced manufacturing, transportation technologies, or alternative source products. \"Recycled feedstock\" refers to materials that have completed their intended end use and product lifecycle. The authority evaluates project applications based on criteria such as developing manufacturing facilities in California and purchasing equipment for those facilities. Notice of project application availability and deadlines is published by the authority. Soil amendments may include compost, fertilizing material, gypsum, or phosphatic sulfate gypsum for promoting plant growth and improving crop quality. The authority evaluates project applications based on criteria such as anticipated benefits to the state, creation of new jobs, environmental impact, unemployment rates, and other relevant factors. Project applications for financial assistance are approved at a public hearing by resolution. The Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office will report on the effectiveness of the program, evaluating factors such as jobs created, businesses in California, state revenue generated, and types of advanced manufacturing utilized. The exclusions for approved projects under this section shall not exceed $200,000,000 per calendar year, with any unallocated amount rolling over for one year only. The authority will study the effectiveness and cost benefit of the sales and use tax exemption for advanced manufacturing projects, including job creation, costs per job, and salaries. The study will also analyze the economic impact without the tax exemption and must be submitted to the Legislature by January 1, 2017. Before January 1, 2015, the authority must submit an interim report to the Legislature on the program's efficacy, including recommendations for improving job creation and eligibility criteria for manufacturing types. Collaboration with the Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office is allowed for the report preparation. The section will be in effect until January 1, 2021, and will be repealed unless a later statute extends the date. The sale of tangible personal property from approved projects before January 1, 2021, will be excluded from sales and use taxes. This act provides for a tax levy and will take immediate effect."
