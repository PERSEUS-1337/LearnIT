    "content": "Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, insurance coverage for terrorism losses changed. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA) was passed by Congress to address the disruption in the insurance market. TRIA created a temporary Terrorism Insurance Program to provide government reinsurance for terrorism losses, allowing the private industry time to develop capacity for covering terrorism risk. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) requires insurers to offer terrorism coverage but does not mandate commercial policyholders to purchase it. The program was extended in 2005 and 2007, with changes focused on reducing government exposure by increasing event size thresholds, insurer deductibles, and post-event recoupment. The 2007 reauthorization expanded coverage to include domestic terrorism acts. The program expired in 2014, with initial thresholds requiring $5 million in insured losses for TRIA coverage. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) requires $5 million in insured losses for coverage. Once thresholds are met, the government covers 85% of losses with insurers retaining 15%. No premiums are charged, and the Secretary of the Treasury recoups government outlays through a surcharge on insurance policies. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) requires $5 million in insured losses for coverage, with the government covering 85% of losses. Representative Michael Grimm introduced H.R. 508 to extend the program until the end of 2019, amid uncertainty about the insurance market's reaction to the program's expiration. The bill, H.R. 1945, introduced by Representative Bennie Thompson, aims to extend the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act program until the end of 2024. It also proposes to extend the deadline for mandatory recoupment until September 30, 2024, and includes the Secretary of Homeland Security as the lead authority for certifying acts of terrorism. H.R. 2146, introduced by Representative Michael Capuano, seeks to reauthorize the existing TRIA program for 10 more years until 2024. It also extends the deadline for mandatory recoupment until September 30, 2027, and requires reports on market conditions for terrorism risk insurance in 2017, 2020, and 2023. Senator Charles Schumer's bill, S. 2244, aims to extend the current TRIA program for seven more years until December 31, 2021, while reducing the federal loss sharing amount. S. 2244 aims to extend the TRIA program for seven more years until December 31, 2021, decrease federal loss sharing gradually, increase insurance marketplace retention amount by $2 billion per year, and extend mandatory recoupment dates by seven years. The Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs marked up S. 2244 on June 3, 2014, with amendments including changes to mandatory recoupment provisions, a Treasury study on certification processes, and a GAO study on insurer premiums.

The House Committee on Rules reported a rule making in order the House floor consideration of S. 2244 with amendments to extend the program, decrease federal loss sharing, increase program trigger and insurance marketplace retention amounts, extend mandatory recoupment dates, and require recoupment of 140% of federal payments.
