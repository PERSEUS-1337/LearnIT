    "content": "The L-HHS-ED Appropriations Act, 2005 was enacted on December 8, 2004, providing $144.0 billion for discretionary programs. The Senate proposed $145.9 billion while the House proposed $143.1 billion for FY2005. The FY2005 budget request for L-HHS-ED programs was $142.9 billion. Data on FY2004 and FY2005 appropriations are based on the FY2005 L-HHS-ED conference report. The FY2005 House and Senate appropriations were based on specific bills. The FY2005 conference amounts do not include cuts required elsewhere. The FY2004 amounts are post-reduction and based on the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004. The report describes the President's FY2005 appropriations proposal for L-HHS-ED programs and compares it to FY2004 amounts. It tracks legislative action and congressional issues related to the FY2005 L-HHS-ED appropriations bill. The report focuses on issues related to the FY2005 L-HHS-ED appropriations bill, particularly discretionary programs. It does not cover mandatory programs like Medicare or Social Security. The L-HHS-ED bill is known for its controversy due to its funding size and program scope. Relevant budget terms and funding resources are provided in the appendices. The L-HHS-ED appropriations bill is significant due to issues like restrictions on federal funds for abortion, stem cell research, and human cloning. It provides a large portion of discretionary funds for domestic federal programs. In FY2004, it accounted for $140.9 billion (17.9%) of the total federal discretionary budget authority. The L-HHS-ED appropriations bill summarizes major funding changes proposed for FY2005, including discretionary and mandatory appropriations. Table 2 shows aggregate measures of final FY2004 and proposed FY2005 appropriations, including program level and current year appropriations. Program level appropriations include advance funding for future years. Current year appropriations represent discretionary appropriations in a given bill for the current year, plus discretionary appropriations enacted in prior years. Advance appropriations are funds that become available after the fiscal year they are enacted for. Scorekeeping adjustments are made for special funding situations, monitored by the Congressional Budget Office. Two summary measures used are program level appropriations and current year appropriations. The President's FY2005 budget request was submitted shortly after the FY2004 appropriations were signed into law. Congressional consideration of appropriations requests focuses on proposed funding changes, especially those exceeding $100 million compared to the previous year. The FY2005 budget request includes a $142.9 billion discretionary appropriations for L-HHS-ED, a 2.2% increase from FY2004. The Department of Labor programs saw an increase of $181 million for job training programs under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998. In FY2005, the Department of Labor requested $12.0 billion in discretionary appropriations, a 1.7% increase from FY2004. Funding for existing WIA programs would be reduced by $159 million. The Department of Health and Human Services proposed increases for various programs, including $727 million for NIH, $219 million for Community Health Centers, $195 million for SAMHSA, $109 million for CMS Program Management, $112 million for LIHEAP, $169 million for Head Start, $112 million for Abstinence Education, and $101 million for Safe and Stable Families activities. Requested decreases included reductions of $283 million for Health Professions. In FY2005, the Department of Health and Human Services requested $63.2 billion in discretionary appropriations, with proposed increases for various programs including $1.0 billion for ESEA Title I Grants, $1.0 billion for Special Education Grants, and $0.8 billion for Pell Grants. Requested decreases included reductions of $283 million for Health Professions other than nursing, $153 million for CDC, and $147 million for CSBG. In FY2005, the Department of Health and Human Services requested $63.2 billion in discretionary appropriations, with proposed increases for various programs including ESEA Title I Grants, Special Education Grants, and Pell Grants. Proposed decreases included reductions for Health Professions, CDC, and CSBG. The Education Act (IDEA) received $0.8 billion, with additional funding proposed for Reading First State Grants, Striving Readers Initiative, and Mathematics and Science Partnerships. Reductions were proposed for the Fund for the Improvement of Education, Perkins Vocational Education program, and the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education. Funding elimination was proposed for the Even Start program, Comprehensive School Reform Demonstration, and Smaller Learning Communities programs. A discretionary funding increase was requested to support the creation of a unified discretionary account for federal student aid programs. In FY2005, the Department of Health and Human Services requested $63.2 billion in discretionary appropriations, with proposed increases for various programs including ESEA Title I Grants, Special Education Grants, and Pell Grants. The budget proposed an increase of $520 million for Administrative Expenses at the Social Security Administration (SSA), and an initial $100 million for an SSA Medicare Reform Contingency Fund. The budget would not have provided a two-year advance appropriation for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) for FY2007. The House Committee on Appropriations reported its version of the FY2005 L-HHS-ED appropriations as H.R. 5006 (H.Rept. 108-636) on September 7, 2004. The House approved 11 amendments, including a provision to prevent DOL from enforcing parts of its new overtime rules. An additional restriction on federal funds for abortion was added, known as the \"Weldon Amendment.\" The House bill would have provided $143.1 billion for L-HHS-ED programs for FY2005. The House bill for FY2005 L-HHS-ED appropriations differed from the President's request in various details. For DOL programs, funding for WIA programs would be lower than requested and provided in FY2004. Overall, the bill would allocate $11.7 billion for DOL programs, less than requested and FY2004. For HHS programs, Health Professions activities and SAMHSA would receive less funding than requested. CSBG would receive more funding than requested. The House bill for FY2005 L-HHS-ED appropriations provided additional funding for CSBG and PHSSEF, totaling $63.2 billion for HHS programs. For ED programs, funding for ESEA programs was lower than requested, while Even Start and Smaller Learning Communities received funding. The bill eliminated the Innovative Education Block Grant and provided more funding for Perkins Vocational Education programs. The bill did not approve the President's request for the administrative reclassification of student loans, allocating $57.7 billion for ED programs. The House bill for FY2005 L-HHS-ED appropriations allocated $57.7 billion for ED programs, $0.4 billion more than requested. The bill also provided $10.5 billion for related agencies, $0.2 billion more than requested. The Senate version of the appropriations included a provision to prevent DOL from enforcing certain parts of its regulations. The Senate bill for FY2005 L-HHS-ED appropriations includes provisions to prevent DOL from enforcing certain parts of its new overtime rules. It would provide $145.9 billion for programs, higher than the House amount of $143.1 billion and the President's request of $142.9 billion. The bill also includes $12.2 billion for WIA programs, with $250 million allocated for the WIA Community College Initiative. The Senate bill for FY2005 L-HHS-ED appropriations would have provided $12.2 billion in discretionary appropriations for DOL programs, $64.5 billion for HHS programs, and $746 million for ED programs. It included additional funding for Health Care-related Facilities, CDC, NIH, and ESEA programs. The bill did not move the Weatherization Assistance program from the FY2005 Interior appropriations to the L-HHS-ED bill. The Senate bill for FY2005 L-HHS-ED appropriations included additional funding for ESEA programs, IDEA grants, and postsecondary education. It proposed $58.8 billion for ED programs, $10.5 billion for related agencies, and eliminated the Even Start program. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005, signed into law on December 8, 2004, combined nine FY2005 appropriations bills into one omnibus bill. Division F of the act allocated funds for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies. The House and Senate approved the conference report on H.R. 4818, with additional L-HHS-ED funds included in Section 119 of Division J. The House and Senate agreed on H.Con.Res. 528 on December 6, 2004, to amend H.R. 4818. Spending limits were met by reducing appropriations by 0.80% in FY2005 for all programs except Defense, Military Construction, and Homeland Security. This reduction saved approximately $3.5 billion. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act included a 0.80% reduction in appropriations to save $3.5 billion. The reductions were applied to various programs, including administrative expenses for L-HHS-ED programs. The exact reduction for each program was to be determined by the Office of Management and Budget and individual agencies. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act included a 0.80% reduction in appropriations to save $3.5 billion, with reductions applied to various programs. The FY2005 discretionary amount at the program level is $144.0 billion, $4.2 billion more than FY2004, with some programs funded above the President's FY2005 request and others below FY2004 levels. Funding changes of at least $100 million occurred for certain programs, with DOL's WIA programs seeing an increase of $217 million. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act included a 0.80% reduction in appropriations to save $3.5 billion, with reductions applied to various programs. DOL's WIA programs saw an increase of $217 million in funding. The conference agreement provides increased funding for HHS, CDC, NIH, LIHEAP, Head Start, and ED programs such as ESEA, IDEA, and Pell Grants. Overall, the conference agreement provides $64.2 billion in discretionary appropriations, $2.0 billion more than in FY2004. The conference agreement for the FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $57.0 billion in discretionary appropriations for the Department of Education, with a $192 million decrease for Educational Technology State Grants. Additionally, the agreement includes a $10.6 billion allocation for Related Agencies, with a $467 million increase for the SSA Limitation on Administrative Expenses compared to FY2004. P.L. 108-447 also modifies programs and activities for L-HHS-ED and requires a traditional format for DOL congressional budget justifications in FY2006. Section 213 extends refugee status for persecuted religious minority groups from Iran. Section 219 delays enforcement of a new HHS regulation on Medicare's classification of hospitals. Section 307 clarifies student eligibility for Pell Grants in Palau. Section 508 expands abortion restrictions for federal programs and governments. The \"Weldon Amendment\" prohibits certain reprogramming of L-HHS-ED funds, including new program initiation and existing program elimination. Other proposals were considered but not included in the final FY2005 L-HHS-ED conference agreement. The earmarking of funds for specific projects in appropriations bills has become a topic of contention for Congress and the Administration, extending to L-HHS-ED projects. Earmarks designate a specific amount for a specific recipient, bypassing competitive distribution but requiring standard federal procedures. The President has urged their elimination. The President has urged the elimination of congressional earmarks in appropriations, but Congress has continued the practice. Earmarks in L-HHS-ED appropriations have increased over the past decade. The total annual L-HHS-ED appropriation, earmarked amount, and number of earmarks are shown in Table 3. The budget authority for annual L-HHS-ED appropriations is determined through a two-stage congressional budget process. The House and Senate may set spending totals through leadership arrangements when a budget agreement is not reached. These totals, known as 302(a) allocations, are discretionary funds available for annual appropriations. In FY2005, the House agreed to a conference report establishing $821 billion as the allocation ceiling for discretionary budget authority. The Senate has yet to act on this resolution. The House and Senate set spending totals through leadership arrangements when a budget agreement is not reached. In FY2005, the House established a $821 billion allocation ceiling for discretionary budget authority. The appropriations committees then allocate these funds among their subcommittees for the annual appropriations bills. These allocations, known as 302(b) allocations, must not exceed the 302(a) discretionary allocation. This process enforces budget discipline. The 302(b) allocations are the basis for enforcing budget discipline, subject to adjustment during the year. Advance appropriations, like the $400 million for CPB in FY2006, serve various objectives such as providing long-term budget information to recipients. The contentious aspect of advance appropriations involves how they are counted in budget ceilings. They avoid the 302(a) and 302(b) allocation ceilings for the current year but must be counted in the year they become available for obligation. This procedure uses part of what will be counted against the allocation ceiling in future years. For example, the FY1999 and FY2000 annual L-HHS-ED appropriations bills provided significant increases in advance appropriations for discretionary programs, stabilizing at approximately $19 billion in FY2000 and increasing to $21.5 billion in FY2003. In FY2000, advance appropriations for L-HHS-ED programs stabilized at approximately $19 billion, increased to $21.5 billion in FY2003, and returned to $19.3 billion in FY2004. The President's budget proposed eliminating advance appropriations in FY2002, but the Congress rejected the proposal. For FY2005, advance appropriations remained at $19.3 billion. In FY2000, advance appropriations for L-HHS-ED programs stabilized at approximately $19 billion, increased to $21.5 billion in FY2003, and returned to $19.3 billion in FY2004. The President's budget proposed eliminating advance appropriations in FY2002, but the Congress rejected the proposal. For FY2005, advance appropriations remained at $19.3 billion. The appropriations bills combine mandatory and discretionary funds, with changes typically made through authorizing committees and omnibus reconciliation bills. The discretionary budget authority under the L-HHS-ED appropriations has increased significantly from $85.4 billion in FY2000 to an estimated $139.5 billion in FY2004. This represents a 63.3% increase in funds over the five-year period. Adjusted for inflation, the total has grown by 52.3%. The L-HHS-ED portion of the federal total budget authority has also increased from 14.6% in FY2000 to an estimated 16.0% in FY2004. The L-HHS-ED portion of the federal total budget authority increased from 4.7% in FY2000 to an estimated 5.9% in FY2004. The FY2005 budget request for discretionary appropriations at the Department of Labor was $12.0 billion, with the House bill proposing $11.7 billion and the Senate bill proposing $12.2 billion. The enacted amount is $12.1 billion for mandatory DOL programs. The President's FY2005 budget request for the Department of Labor included changes in funding for various programs, with a significant increase in funding for the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA). The request also allocated funds for new WIA initiatives, such as the Community College Initiative. However, funding for existing WIA programs saw a decrease compared to the previous year. The Senate bill differed from the President's budget request for WIA programs in FY2005. It allocated $5.4 billion, $265 million more than the House amount and $52 million more than requested. $250 million was provided for the Community College Initiative, while other proposed initiatives were not funded. In FY2005, the Senate bill allocated $5.4 billion for WIA programs, $217 million more than FY2004 and $36 million more than requested. The Community College Initiative received $250 million, with $125 million directly provided and $125 million taken from the Secretary's Reserve for the WIA Dislocated Worker program. Section 13(a)(1) of the FLSA exempts certain employees from minimum wage and overtime pay requirements. The Department of Labor (DOL) proposed a revision to the qualifying tests for workers to be classified as bona fide employees. The final rule, effective from August 23, 2004, established an earnings threshold of $23,660 annually for automatic overtime pay protection. Workers earning over $100,000 and performing executive, administrative, or professional functions are likely exempt. Those earning between $23,660 and $100,000 are evaluated on a case-by-case basis depending on their specific duties. The proposed revision by DOL faced immediate contention despite general support for an increase in the earnings threshold. The DOL proposed a revision to the qualifying tests for workers, establishing an earnings threshold of $23,660 annually for automatic overtime pay protection. There is support for increasing the threshold, but redefining the duties test has been more contentious. The House agreed to prevent DOL from implementing the redefinition of the overtime duties test, while the Administration opposed this amendment. The Administration strongly opposes any restriction on DOL enforcement of the new overtime rule and would recommend a veto if such restrictions are included in the final bill. The House and Senate bills had similar restrictions, but the FY2005 L-HHS-ED conference agreement eliminated them, allowing DOL to enforce its revised regulations. For more information, refer to CRS Report RS21946 and CRS Report RL32088. The Statement of Administration Policy against the DOL enforcement prohibition can be found at http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/legislative/sap/108-2/hr5006sap-h.pdf. The curr_chunk provides information on various CRS reports related to labor standards, unemployment benefits, and workforce investment programs in the 108th Congress. The reports cover topics such as overtime pay requirements, White-Collar exemptions, and job training programs. The reports are authored by individuals whose names have been scrubbed for anonymity. The Workforce Investment Act (WIA) program overview and FY2006 funding details for Title I training programs are provided by [author name scrubbed]. The Department of Labor's appropriations for FY2005 and FY2004 at the Department of Health and Human Services are compared, with the Senate bill proposing $64.5 billion and the enacted conference amount set at $64.2 billion. Mandatory HHS programs funded in FY2004 included Grants to States for Medicaid at $189.3 billion. In FY2004, HHS was funded at $298.1 billion, with key allocations for Medicaid, Medicare Trust Funds, Foster Care, Adoption, Family Support Payments, and Social Services Block Grant. The FY2005 budget request focused on increased support for medical research, Community Health Centers, substance abuse, and children and family services programs, while reducing funding for selected health professions and community services. Discretionary spending increases were requested for programs like the National Institutes of Health. The NIH received $27.8 billion in FY2004, more than doubling from $13.6 billion in FY1998. Additional funding was proposed for Community Health Centers and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. An increase was also requested for Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Program Management. In FY2004, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Program Management received $2.6 billion. Proposed increases include $112 million for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, $169 million for Head Start, $112 million for Abstinence Education, and $101 million for the Promoting Safe and Stable Families program. The President's FY2005 budget also included a decrease of $283 million for Health Professions programs other than nursing. In FY2004, Health Professions activities other than nursing were funded at $294 million. The Health Care-related Facilities and Activities program, funded at $372 million, would have been eliminated for construction and renovation projects. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) would have been reduced by $153 million. The Community Services Block Grant would have seen a decrease of $147 million. The House bill differed from the President's budget request for HHS programs. Health Professions activities other than nursing would have received $269 million, $258 million less than requested. SAMHSA would have been funded at $3.3 billion, $159 million less than requested but $36 million above the FY2004 level. The Senate bill proposed funding for various HHS programs, including $628 million for the Community Services Block Grant, $2.4 billion for the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund, $372 million for Health Care-related Facilities and Activities, $4.5 billion for the CDC, and $28.9 billion for the NIH. These amounts differed from the House bill and the previous year's funding levels. Under the FY2005 conference agreement, several HHS programs see a change in funding from FY2004 to FY2005. Community Health Centers receive $1.7 billion, Health Care-related Facilities and Activities receive $485 million, the CDC is funded at $4.5 billion, the NIH receives $28.6 billion, LIHEAP receives $2.2 billion, and Head Start is funded. In FY2005, funding for SAMHSA increased by $61 million compared to FY2004, totaling $3.3 billion. However, this amount was $134 million less than requested. Additionally, $2 million was allocated for SAMHSA to expand the TeenScreen program in Florida to screen and treat teenagers at risk for mental disorders, in response to the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health recommendations. The Congress has not amended restrictions on federal funds for abortions since FY1999, but these provisions may be revisited during appropriations. The Hyde Amendments limit the use of funds for abortions, with Medicaid being the largest program affected. The 103rd Congress allowed federal funding for abortions in cases of rape or incest. The Hyde provisions, extended by P.L. 105-78, prohibit federal funds for managed care packages with abortion coverage, except in cases of rape, incest, or life endangerment. Funding restrictions continued from FY1999 to FY2004, with additional restrictions proposed in FY2005. The final version of the appropriations measure included the House proposal known as the \"Weldon Amendment,\" which prevents health care entities from being required to provide abortion services. President Bush allowed federal funds for research on human embryonic stem cells but limited funding to existing stem cell lines with potential medical benefits. Only 21 out of 78 federally eligible stem cell lines are currently available for research, raising concerns about quality and availability. Some scientists advocate for new stem cell lines, potentially including those derived from cloned embryos, despite ethical issues surrounding embryo destruction. Legislation since FY1997 has restricted NIH funds from creating human embryos for research or using embryos in research. The issue may be revisited during appropriations discussions. The prohibition on using federal funds for research involving human embryos has been in place since FY1997, affecting primarily the NIH. The restriction, introduced by Representative Jay Dickey, remains unchanged in the FY2005 L-HHS-ED appropriations. The current provision can be found in \u00a7509 of the FY2005 L-HHS-ED appropriations, Division F of P.L. 108-447. For more information, refer to CRS reports on Stem Cell Research, Human Cloning, and Legal Issues Related to Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research. The curr_chunk provides a list of CRS reports on various topics such as legal issues related to human embryonic stem cell research, charitable choice, child care issues, energy efficiency, federal research and development funding, and head start. The reports are authored by different individuals. The curr_chunk lists CRS reports on topics including federal research and development funding, Head Start, U.S. international HIV/AIDS spending, human cloning, low-income home energy assistance, maternal and child health block grant, public health system, teen pregnancy prevention, and social services block grant. The curr_chunk provides details on various CRS reports and budget appropriations for the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Education. The FY2005 budget request for discretionary appropriations at the Department of Education was $57.3 billion. The FY2005 budget request for the Department of Education was $57.3 billion, with the House bill proposing $57.7 billion and the Senate bill proposing $58.8 billion. The enacted amount is $57.0 billion, with an increase in federal support for education being a priority. The budget request included an increase in funding for various programs authorized by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The FY2005 budget request for the Department of Education included increases in funding for ESEA programs. An additional $1.0 billion was requested for ESEA Title I, Part A Grants to LEAs, $1.0 billion for Special Education Part B Grants to States under IDEA, and $0.8 billion for the Pell Grant program. The FY2005 budget request for the Department of Education included an increase of $818 million for federal student aid programs, offset by savings of $795 million. Additional funding was requested for Reading First State Grants, Striving Readers Initiative, and Mathematics and Science Partnerships. Funding for Even Start program and Comprehensive School Reform Demonstration program would have been decreased or terminated. The FY2005 budget for the Department of Education proposed changes in funding for various programs. The Comprehensive School Reform Demonstration program, Fund for the Improvement of Education, Perkins Vocational Education program, Smaller Learning Communities, and Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education would have faced reductions or eliminations. The House bill differed from the President's budget request, with ESEA programs funded at $24.6 billion in FY2005. Even Start program would have received $227 million in funding. The FY2005 budget for the Department of Education proposed changes in funding for various programs. Even Start would have been funded at $227 million, $20 million less than the FY2004 amount. The Innovative Education Block Grant would have been reduced to $20 million. Perkins Vocational Education programs would have been funded at $1.3 billion, $322 million more than requested. Smaller Learning Communities would have been funded at $101 million. The Senate bill proposed funding education programs at $25.3 billion, $694 million more than the House bill and $553 million more than requested. ESEA Title I Part A Grants to LEAs would receive $13.5 billion, $116 million more than the House bill. Even Start funding would be eliminated, while Comprehensive School Reform Demonstration would be funded at $234 million. Under the FY2005 conference agreement, several ED programs would see a change in funding from FY2004 to FY2005 of at least $100 million. The aggregate funding level for all ESEA programs is $24.6 billion, with Title I Part A Grants to LEAs funded at $12.8 billion. Educational Technology programs have been eliminated under the request. IDEA Part B Grants to States would receive $11.2 billion, and FIPSE would be funded at $158 million. In FY2005, Educational Technology State Grants receive $500 million, $192 million less than FY2004. IDEA Part B Grants to States are funded at $10.7 billion, $607 million more than FY2004. Pell Grants receive $12.5 billion, $458 million more than FY2004. IDEA is a federal program assisting states and school districts in providing education to children with disabilities. Congress authorized state payments up to 40% of the national average per-pupil expenditure for children with disabilities. In FY2005, funding for IDEA Part B Grants to States is $10.7 billion, which falls short of the 40% federal share promised for children with disabilities. An additional $11.6 billion would be needed to reach the authorized maximum. Amendments to IDEA in 2004 will base future grants on changes in average per-pupil expenditure and student population growth rates. The Pell Grants program provides financial assistance to eligible undergraduate students based on financial need. The funding level for Pell Grants has been a continuing issue, with program costs depending on the maximum award and number of eligible recipients. The exact number and total amount of Pell awards cannot be determined until all students have claimed an award, and appropriations for Pell Grants make funds available for two full fiscal years. For more information, refer to CRS Report RL32085 on Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funding trends. The Pell Grants program provides financial assistance to eligible undergraduate students based on financial need. Appropriations for Pell Grants allow for funding flexibility over two fiscal years to address shortfalls and surpluses. The ED Budget Service estimates a shortfall of $3.6 billion for FY2004, growing to $4.0 billion under FY2005 funding. Funding flexibility provisions exist for L-HHS-ED programs to address program years differing from the federal fiscal year. The Pell Grants program provides financial assistance to eligible undergraduate students based on financial need, with appropriations allowing for funding flexibility over two fiscal years. This budgetary procedure, known as \"forward\" or \"multi-year\" funding, is accomplished through funding provisions in the L-HHS-ED appropriations bill, allowing additional time for school officials to develop budgets in advance of the school year. Pell Grants for undergraduates are supported by appropriations from one fiscal year for the following academic year. Unlike elementary and secondary education programs, Pell Grant funds are available for obligation for two fiscal years. Advance appropriations allow funds to become available for the next fiscal year. The funding provisions discussed include a possible three-month delay in forward funding, which would reclassify the appropriation as an advance appropriation. This change would impact programs minimally at the service level, as most expenditures for a standard school year occur after the funds become available. The delay in availability of funds for a standard school year may shift from forward funding to advance appropriation, impacting the scoring of discretionary appropriations. For more details, refer to CRS Report RS20441 and CRS Report 98-720. The 108th Congress reauthorization proposals for adult education, student financial aid programs, vocational education, disadvantaged education, limited English proficient students, family literacy programs, and the Pell Grant program under the Higher Education Act are covered in various CRS reports. The curr_chunk provides information on various CRS reports related to education reauthorization, funding trends, and major provisions under acts like the Higher Education Act and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The curr_chunk lists CRS reports on education reauthorization, funding trends, and major provisions under acts like the Higher Education Act and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. It includes reports on K-12 teacher quality, Reading First, Title III and Title V of the Higher Education Act, Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act, School Choice legislation, Trio and GEAR UP Programs, and 21st Century Community Learning Centers. The FY2005 budget request for discretionary appropriations for L-HHS-ED Related Agencies was $10.3 billion, $0.2 billion more than FY2004. The House and Senate bills proposed $10.5 billion, but the enacted amount is $10.6 billion. Mandatory programs for related agencies in FY2004 were funded at $35.9 billion, mainly for the Supplemental Security Income program. The President's FY2005 budget would have changed discretionary spending for several programs by at least $100 million. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting was also provided funding. The FY2005 L-HHS-ED bill would provide FY2007 funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), despite the President's request not including it. Previous appropriations include $400 million for FY2006, $390 million for FY2005, and $378 million for FY2004. An increase of $520 million was proposed for SSA Administrative Expenses, with an additional $100 million for an SSA Medicare Reform Contingency Fund. The House bill would have differed from the President's budget request by at least $100 million for two programs, including the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) and the SSA Medicare Reform Contingency Fund initiative. The Senate bill would have differed from the House bill by at least $100 million for one program, specifically the SSA Limitation on Administrative Expenses. The funding levels for these programs varied between the House bill, Senate bill, and the President's budget request. The SSA Limitation on Administrative Expenses is funded at $5.7 billion, $53 million less than requested but $467 million more than in FY2004. Various reports on federal aid to libraries, social security benefits for noncitizens, social security reform, and funding levels for VISTA and the Senior Volunteer Service Corps are available. Some L-HHS-ED related agencies may not have websites with FY2005 budget information. The curr_chunk lists various government agencies and their respective websites, including the Corporation for National and Community Service, the Social Security Administration, and the United States Institute of Peace. The curr_chunk discusses appropriations details for L-HHS-ED related agencies during the 108th Congress, including various proposals and continuing resolutions for FY2005. The Senate passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004, providing most of the FY2004 appropriations for L-HHS-ED programs. Several continuing resolutions were also passed for temporary FY2005 appropriations until December 8, 2004. The FY2005 continuing resolutions provided temporary appropriations for L-HHS-ED programs from October 1, 2004, through December 8, 2004. Funding was based on FY2004 conditions and program authority, with restrictions on new initiatives and spending levels. Special provisions were made for programs with high spend-out rates. In 2004, continuing resolutions were passed to fund L-HHS-ED programs until December 8, 2004. The resolutions extended funding from P.L. 108-309, which included provisions for the HHS Strategic National Stockpile. The stockpile was funded at a rate not to exceed $450 million. In October 2004, P.L. 108-366 extended Higher Education Act programs through FY2005. Two supplemental appropriations, P.L. 108-303 and P.L. 108-324, provided funds for hurricanes in 2004 and 2005, including $50 million for disaster-related services in L-HHS-ED activities. In October 2004, P.L. 108-324 allocated funds for disaster relief services related to hurricanes, including $50 million for aging, social, and health services under the Public Health and Social Service Fund. The provisions were added to the Military Construction Appropriations Act, 2005, and signed into law as P.L. 108-324. The FY2005 budget resolution proposed total discretionary budget authority of $821 billion. The FY2005 budget resolution proposes a total discretionary budget authority of $821 billion, representing a 4.2% increase from FY2004. The Senate version includes a reserve fund for higher education, specifically for the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act of 1965. Funding assumptions for selected programs are outlined in the report language, with discretionary appropriations for specific departments and agencies to be determined through the enactment of appropriations. The Senate Committee on the Budget proposed adding up to $1.0 billion in new FY2005 budget authority for the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act of 1965. Additionally, they suggested adding $5.0 billion for the period FY2005-FY2009. If measures were taken to eliminate the shortfall in Pell Grants, up to $3.7 billion could be added to the total budget authority. The conference agreement did not include any special provision for the Pell Grants shortfall but allowed for a $5.0 billion increase for HEA reauthorization from FY2005 to FY2009, contingent on finding matching offsets elsewhere. On March 25, the House passed a bill (Roll Call no. 92, 215-212) and on March 29, inserted provisions of H.Con.Res. 393 in S.Con.Res. 95. A conference report, H.Rept. 108-498, was passed on May 19, 2004. Representative David Obey introduced a bill on June 1, 2004, to increase funding for Education for the Disadvantaged, School Improvement, Special Education, and Student Financial Assistance, including raising the maximum Pell Grant to $4,500 from $4,050. The bill aims to increase the maximum Pell Grant to $4,500 from $4,050, offsetting the cost by reducing tax reductions for high-income earners. H.R. 4473, the Educational Opportunity for the 21st Century Department of Education Appropriations Act, 2005, was referred to the House Committee on Appropriations and the House Committee on Ways and Means. Funding for L-HHS-ED activities in FY2004 was delayed, with seven appropriations bills combined into an omnibus bill providing funds for L-HHS-ED programs. The omnibus bill provided funds for L-HHS-ED programs in FY2004 through a series of continuing resolutions. The H.R. 2673 conference report was passed by both the House and Senate, signed into law as the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004. To meet spending limitations, reductions in discretionary spending were included. For more information, refer to CRS reports RS21684 and RL31803. The H.R. 2674 conferees included reductions in discretionary appropriations as requested by the President. The defense reduction required a rescission of $1.8 billion from unobligated balances related to anti-terrorism funding, while the non-defense reduction required a decrease of 0.59% from domestic discretionary appropriations. This yielded an estimated $2.8 billion in savings. The FY2004 Consolidated Appropriations Act required a 0.59% reduction in discretionary appropriations for each account and item. The exact reductions were left to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and individual agencies to determine. OMB had to report the amount of each rescission within 30 days of the bill's enactment. The FY2004 Consolidated Appropriations Act mandated a 0.59% reduction in discretionary appropriations for each account, with OMB required to report the amount of each rescission within 30 days of enactment. Additionally, Section 515 of the bill required a $50 million reduction in funds for L-HHS-ED administrative expenses, to be reported by OMB within 15 days. The final post-reduction amounts approved by OMB are included in the tables in this report. Terminology and web resources related to budget terms are also provided. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and make payments for specified purposes. Appropriations represent the amounts agencies can spend during a specified period. There are different types of appropriations such as regular, supplemental, and continuing. Budget authority includes appropriations, borrowing authority, and contract authority, as well as the subsidy cost of direct loans and loan guarantees. The budget resolution is a concurrent resolution passed by both Houses of Congress, setting forth the congressional budget for at least five fiscal years. It includes various budget totals and functional allocations. Discretionary spending is budget authority provided in annual appropriations acts, while entitlement authority is the authority to make payments to eligible recipients, funded by either annual or permanent appropriations acts. Forward funding is budget authority that becomes available after the beginning of the fiscal year. Mandatory (direct) spending includes budget authority provided in laws other than appropriations, entitlement authority, and the Food Stamp program. Rescission is the cancellation of budget authority previously enacted. Scorekeeping tracks and reports on congressional budgetary actions. Supplemental appropriation is additional budget authority provided in an appropriations act. Websites for budget and appropriations information can be found on specific agency sites listed in relevant sections of reports. House and Senate Committees also provide information on budget and appropriations. The budget authority for all federal programs in FY2004 is estimated at $2,345.3 billion, with L-HHS-ED departments and related agencies accounting for $1,213.4 billion. This represents 51.7% of the federal total. The discretionary funding provided by the L-HHS-ED bill is $139.2 billion, which is 5.9% of the federal budget. In FY2004, L-HHS-ED departments and related agencies accounted for $1,213.4 billion, representing 51.7% of the federal total budget. The L-HHS-ED appropriations subcommittees have control over $139.2 billion in discretionary funds, while mandatory programs make up $331.9 billion of the budget. Changes in funding levels for these programs are typically made through amendments to authorizing legislation. Changes in funding levels for L-HHS-ED agencies are typically made through amendments to authorizing legislation rather than annual appropriations bills. Mandatory programs like Supplemental Security Income, Black Lung Disability payments, and Medicare/Medicaid receive general fund support. Other appropriations bills only contribute a small portion of L-HHS-ED agency funding, with some agencies and programs being funded by non-L-HHS-ED sources. For example, the HHS Food and Drug Administration is funded by the Agriculture Appropriations. The Administration, HHS Indian Health Service, CNCS, CDC, NIH, and other agencies receive funding from various appropriations bills, including Agriculture, Interior, L-HHS-ED, and VA-HUD. Total funding amounts vary for each agency, with NIH receiving the highest amount at $27.8 billion in FY2004. The NIH is primarily funded under L-HHS-ED ($27.8 billion in FY2004) and receives additional funds for environmental health sciences activities. A significant portion of L-HHS-ED agency funds are received automatically without congressional intervention from permanent appropriations and trust funds. Major programs in this category include Unemployment Compensation, Medicare, TANF, Student Loans, and Social Security benefits. Jurisdictional changes were made to relevant programs in the L-HHS-ED bill in 2004. The subcommittee jurisdiction for various programs in the L-HHS-ED bill was modified in FY2005. The U.S. Institute of Peace was moved to Commerce-Justice-State appropriations, while the Weatherization Grants program and the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled were transferred to L-HHS-ED. The Senate Committee on Appropriations did not accept these changes, but the conference agreement on H.R. 4818 transferred the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled to L-HHS-ED appropriations. Severely Disabled transferred from Transportation-Treasury to L-HHS-ED appropriations. U.S. Institute of Peace moved from L-HHS-ED to Commerce-Justice-State appropriations. Weatherization Assistance program transferred from Interior appropriations to Division J, Other Matters, of P.L. 108-447."
