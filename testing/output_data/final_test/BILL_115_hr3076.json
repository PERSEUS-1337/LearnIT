    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Creating Advanced Streamlined Electronic Services for Constituents Act of 2018\" or the \"CASES Act\". The \"Creating Advanced Streamlined Electronic Services for Constituents Act of 2018\" emphasizes the importance of congressional offices in assisting constituents with agency inquiries. It suggests simplifying the process through electronic forms under the Privacy Act to enhance access and efficiency of government services. Additionally, OMB guidance on electronic consent forms is recommended. The Director will issue guidance within a year of the Act's enactment, establishing standards for agencies to develop electronic identity proofing and authentication processes for consent forms and record access. This includes creating a template for electronic consent forms. The Act requires agencies to accept electronic consent forms that are properly identity proofed and authenticated. It also allows agencies to provide an online link to a consolidated portal. The Director (or designee) will operate a consolidated online portal for electronic consent forms to be submitted to any agency from a single website. The portal will prioritize privacy and may include additional functions to improve implementation. The Director may utilize an existing website or portal, such as the one established under section 552(m) of title 5, United States Code, to meet the requirements. Each consent form submitted through the portal will be assigned a consent identifier for tracking purposes. Additionally, a function will be operated to allow congressional offices to provide publicly available assistance. The Director will ensure that a publicly available online portal auto-populates information about congressional offices and sends a consent identifier when a consent form is submitted. Each agency must comply with the guidance within one year. The Director will ensure compliance with guidance within one year, including definitions for agency, individual, record, consent identifier, and Director. No additional funds are authorized for carrying out the requirements of this Act, which will be funded using existing authorized amounts."
