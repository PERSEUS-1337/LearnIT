    "content": "A \"Dear Colleague\" letter is official correspondence sent by a Member, committee, or officer of the House of Representatives or Senate to other congressional offices. It is used to encourage support or opposition to a bill, provide information on legislation, events, or changes in congressional operations. Member-to-Member correspondence in Congress has a long history, with letters like the \"Dear Colleague\" being used to seek support for legislative actions. For example, Representative Abraham Lincoln wrote to his colleagues in 1849 to seek authorization to introduce a bill to abolish slavery. In 1913 and 1916, \"Dear Colleague\" letters were used by Representatives to communicate with their colleagues in Congress. The letters outlined respect for the President and explained legislative amendments. Congress now uses the Internet and electronic devices for distributing legislative documents. In the contemporary Congress, Members use electronic devices to distribute \"Dear Colleague\" letters, supplementing or replacing paper forms. This electronic communication has sped up the distribution process. Members in the House can choose to send letters through internal mail, the electronic e-\"Dear Colleague\" system, or both. Regardless of the method, letters must address official business and be signed by a Member or officer of Congress. Members often send letters to recruit cosponsors for their measures, a practice that has become more important. The House rules regarding cosponsors were amended in the 90th Congress, allowing unlimited cosponsors. \"Dear Colleague\" letters must be on official letterhead, signed by a Member or officer of Congress, and accompanied by a cover letter with distribution instructions. 475 paper copies are needed for distribution in the House. Distribution of \"Dear Colleague\" letters in the House requires specific quantities for different groups, ranging from 475 for all Members to 700 for all House mail stops. Senate distribution requires a separate cover letter and quantities of 110 for Senators only and 135 for Senators and committees. Congressional offices create and photocopy their letters for distribution. The House introduced a web-based e-\"Dear Colleague\" distribution system on August 12, 2008, replacing the email-based system. Members and staff can compose e-Dear Colleagues online and manage their subscriptions to receive them based on individual interests. The e-Dear Colleague system allows House Members and staff to subscribe and send letters based on individual interests. They can choose up to 32 issue areas and sign up for Republican or Democratic distribution lists. The system also allows searching for letters by session, date, issue area, and keyword or bill number. The process for delivering paper letters remains unchanged. The e-Dear Colleague system enables House Members and staff to send letters by entering email address, office type, title, selecting distribution lists, associating with issues, uploading content, and confirming before sending. The \"Dear Colleague\" letter is sent to individuals who have selected to receive it in specific issue areas. Electronic versions sent before August 12, 2008, are stored in a public folder accessible to House Members and staff, while those sent after are archived on the House e-\"Dear Colleague\" website. In the Senate, letters are written on official letterhead but there is no central distribution policy. Senators create their own letters and have them reproduced at the Senate Printing Graphics and Direct Mail Division. The \"Dear Colleague\" letters are reproduced at the Senate Printing Graphics and Direct Mail Division and then delivered to the Senate Mailroom with specific distribution instructions. Distribution numbers for these letters are set by the Senate, with different quantities allocated to Senators, committees, joint leadership, and Senate officers. The decision to send these letters electronically is left to individual Senate offices, as there is no central distribution system for electronic versions."
