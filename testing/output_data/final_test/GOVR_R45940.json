    "content": "The World Trade Organization's Agreement on Agriculture aims to establish a fair agricultural trading system by achieving binding commitments in market access, domestic support, and export subsidies. The United States, as a WTO member, has generally met its commitments, including spending limits on farm program outlays. The report examines whether the United States might exceed its WTO spending limit for farm program outlays, focusing on direct payments to producers. This includes a review of WTO rules and disciplines on farm program spending. The report discusses how changes to U.S. farm programs under the 2018 farm bill and ad hoc direct payments may impact U.S. compliance with WTO commitments. It also analyzes current projections for farm program outlays and the possibility of exceeding the spending limit. The report focuses on the potential violation of WTO commitments by exceeding spending limits on market-distorting farm support programs. WTO member nations have agreed to limit spending on these policies, and the AoA outlines the rules for determining potential trade distortions and reporting costs transparently to the WTO. The report discusses potential violations of WTO commitments related to exceeding spending limits on market-distorting farm support programs. Domestic farm subsidies under the AoA are measured using the \"Aggregate Measure of Support\" (AMS), which includes product-specific and non-product-specific support. Some programs are not subject to spending limits under WTO commitments, and the United States agreed to establish ceilings for their non-exempt AMS. The WTO members agreed to set spending limits for non-exempt AMS, known as the amber box. The U.S. has a fixed amber box spending ceiling of $19.1 billion since 2000. Exceeding this limit could lead to challenges under WTO dispute settlement rules. Certain farm support programs may be exempt from the amber box limit if they meet specific criteria, such as being minimally trade-distorting or having offsetting features to limit production. The U.S. Department of Agriculture implements farm programs that provide payments directly to producers, classified as AMS. These programs may qualify as blue box programs if they have offsetting features to limit production. AMS outlays must be small relative to output to avoid being included in the amber box. Timing of outlays across crop, calendar, or marketing years can also influence total AMS spending. The Market Assistance Loan (MAL), Agricultural Risk Coverage (ARC), Price Loss Coverage (PLC), Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC), and sugar programs, authorized by the 2014 farm bill, were modified in the 2018 farm bill for crop years 2019-2023. Outlays under these programs are categorized as product-specific AMS or non-product-specific AMS. Permanent disaster assistance programs include Livestock Forage Disaster Program (LFP), Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP), Tree Assistance Program (TAP), and Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honeybees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program (ELAP), with payments coupled to producer choices and notified as product-specific AMS. The federal crop insurance program provides premium. The federal crop insurance program provides premium subsidies to producers, which are notified as product-specific AMS. Premium subsidies are a percentage of a policy's total premium and vary with insured units, coverage levels, and crop values. USDA has notified crop insurance premium subsidies to the WTO as product-specific AMS since 2012. Ad hoc programs authorized by the Secretary of Agriculture, such as trade assistance programs, are outside of Congress and use the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) Charter Act for payments in support of U.S. agriculture. USDA has not yet notified any trade assistance payments to the WTO or announced the WTO classification for such payments. Payments under U.S. conservation programs are generally considered non-market-distorting and notified as green box. The United States implements various farm support programs through different agencies using mandatory funding. Changes made since early 2018 may face scrutiny from WTO members. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized traditional support programs with modifications that could affect their treatment under WTO rules. The bill shifts safety net outlays towards coupled programs. The 2018 farm bill shifted farm safety net outlays towards coupled programs, raised support levels, expanded crop insurance coverage, and increased MAL rates for program crops. This weakened payment limit restrictions and increased potential premium subsidy outlays. The 2018 farm bill increased the probability of triggering coupled MAL payments during market price declines but reduced the maximum potential payment under the decoupled PLC program. The bill also removed MAL benefits from counting against annual USDA producer payment limits and raised support levels for dairy producers under the DMC program, which operates without payment limits. The 2018 farm bill made changes to payment programs, including the Margin Protection Program and ARC and PLC programs. Coupled payments can impact producer choices and may lead to challenges under the WTO's dispute settlement process. ARC and PLC programs are partially decoupled from producer behavior but are partially coupled to market conditions. The 2018 farm bill made changes to payment programs, including ARC and PLC programs. ARC and PLC payments are partially decoupled from producer behavior but partially coupled to market conditions, in compliance with WTO rules. ARC uses a moving average formula based on historical prices and yields, reflecting market conditions when prices are above PLC reference prices. PLC, on the other hand, uses a fixed reference price, potentially distorting markets when prices are below the reference price for extended periods. Payments are based on historical acres rather than current planted acres, partially decoupling them from current crop choices. The 2018 farm bill introduced changes to ARC and PLC programs, with payments partially decoupled from producer behavior and partially coupled to market conditions. ARC uses a moving average formula based on historical prices and yields, while PLC uses a fixed reference price. Payments are based on historical acres rather than current planted acres. Two changes to the PLC program include the option for producers to update program yields and an escalator provision that could potentially raise a covered commodity's effective reference price. The 2018 farm bill also specifies changes to the ARC program, including the use of trend-adjusted yield. The 2018 farm bill introduced changes to ARC and PLC programs, with payments partially decoupled from producer behavior and partially coupled to market conditions. ARC will use a trend-adjusted yield to calculate its revenue guarantee, potentially raising revenue guarantees for producers. Producers have the option to switch between ARC and PLC coverage on a commodity-by-commodity basis in 2019 and 2020, and annually for each of 2021, 2022, and 2023. The 2018 farm bill introduced changes to ARC and PLC programs, allowing producers to switch between ARC and PLC coverage annually for 2021, 2022, and 2023. The programs have payment limits, with some programs exempt from these limits, offering potential unlimited benefits for individual farmers. The 2018 farm bill introduced changes to ARC and PLC programs, allowing producers to switch coverage annually. Higher DMC and MAL support levels increase potential program payments during market downturns. Weak market conditions trigger payments under MAL, while DMC payments are triggered by low milk prices. Disaster payments are triggered by natural disasters. The bill expanded the definition of family farm to include more relatives for eligibility. The 2018 farm bill maintained payment limits and AGI criteria unchanged. The U.S. sugar program provides indirect price support through MAL loans, with limits on sugar supply and imports. USDA reported the sugar program's market price support cost at $1.5 billion in 2016. The USDA reported the implicit cost of the sugar program at $1.5 billion in market price support. Federally subsidized crop insurance is available for over 100 agricultural commodities, with premium subsidies covering 63% of the cost since 2014. Premiums and subsidies vary based on policy type, insured unit, and coverage level, and are coupled to producer behavior. USDA declares premium subsidies in annual notifications to the WTO as product-specific direct support outlays. The USDA has declared premium subsidies as product-specific direct payments to producers under the WTO domestic support outlays. The 2018 farm bill expanded the federally subsidized crop insurance program, allowing for separate policies for grazed and mechanically harvested crops. Annual USDA premium subsidies count against the U.S. amber box spending limit but may be excluded at the commodity level. The Secretary of Agriculture initiated two ad hoc trade assistance programs in 2018 and 2019. The USDA initiated two ad hoc trade assistance programs in response to foreign trade retaliation targeting U.S. agricultural products. The first package, announced in July 2018, was valued at up to $12 billion and targeted selected agricultural commodities. The second package, announced in May 2019, was valued at up to an additional $16 billion and targeted an expanded list of commodities. These packages include the Market Facilitation Program (MFP) and the Food Purchase and Distribution Program (FPDP) to provide direct payments to producers and purchase unexpected surpluses. The Food Purchase and Distribution Program (FPDP) and Agricultural Trade Promotion (ATP) program aim to purchase surplus commodities for redistribution and develop new export markets for U.S. farm products. The trade assistance programs are valued at $28 billion over two years, with the majority allocated to MFP payments. The exact WTO spending classification is unknown, but past practice can provide insight. The FPDP and ATP programs for 2018 and 2019 are expected to be implemented similarly, with USDA outlays historically considered green box compliant. Trade promotion programs like ATP do not involve direct payments to producers and are not notified under domestic support. The MFP programs have raised questions due to their large outlays and differing structures in 2018 and 2019, which may affect their WTO classification based on how payments are made to individual producers. The USDA's MFP payments for 2018 are determined based on each farm's harvested production of eligible crops times a fixed payment rate. Payments to dairy are based on historical production, while hog payments use midyear inventory data. These payments are likely to be classified as coupled, product-specific AMS and count against the U.S. annual spending limit. As of August 22, 2019, $8.59 billion in MFP payments had been distributed to producers. The USDA's MFP payments for 2018 are determined based on each farm's harvested production of eligible crops times a fixed payment rate. Payments are allocated to dairy, hogs, corn, sweet cherries, and almonds. The FY2019 Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Act altered the AGI requirement for MFP payments. Product-specific payments can distort the market in favor of commodities with higher payments. USDA is making MFP payments for the 2019 trade assistance program under a different formulation to avoid potential WTO challenges. The USDA is making MFP payments for the 2019 trade assistance program using a county-level weighted approach, avoiding product-specific identification. Payments are tied to planted acres but not specific crops, potentially making them non-product-specific AMS. The United States delays notifying farm program support outlays, potentially hindering WTO compliance for 2018 and 2019. Analysis of farm program payments aims to assess compliance with spending limits. The United States is facing questions regarding compliance with its amber box spending limit of $19.1 billion, particularly with the addition of large MFP payments in 2018 and 2019. Key questions include how USDA will classify MFP payments, how market conditions will evolve in 2019, the final value of total U.S. farm output in 2019, the impact of market conditions on ARC and PLC payments, and the potential continuation of the U.S.-China trade dispute into 2020. The 2018 MFP payments are product-specific AMS, while the 2019 MFP payments are non-product-specific AMS. Different de minimis exemptions will be important for evaluating compliance in 2018 and 2019. Data from various sources are used to analyze potential WTO compliance of U.S. farm program spending for 2017, 2018, and 2019. Actual USDA program outlays are used whenever available, with projected spending data from CBO baseline used when actual data is unavailable. The 2018 MFP payments are product-specific AMS, while the 2019 MFP payments are non-product-specific AMS. CRS projects final MFP payments for 2018 at $8.7 billion and $14.5 billion for 2019. U.S. amber box spending for 2018 is projected at over $14 billion, fitting within the spending limit of $19.1 billion. Soybeans and wheat are projected to receive large product-specific outlays. Large product-specific outlays to soybeans, wheat, cotton, and peanuts exceed de minimis exemptions, contributing to a large amber box projection for 2018. In 2019, MFP payments are expanded to $14.5 billion, potentially approaching or exceeding the $19.1 billion amber box spending limit. U.S. compliance with WTO spending limits in 2019 depends on non-product-specific outlays compared to the de minimis threshold. In 2019, total U.S. farm output is projected to be $378 billion, with non-product-specific outlays reaching $18.92 billion, exceeding the de minimis exemption threshold. This would result in total U.S. amber box outlays of $24.039 billion, surpassing the $19.1 billion spending limit. In an alternative scenario, total U.S. farm output is projected at $380 billion, leading to a minor increase in total output value. In scenario 2, total U.S. farm output is projected to be $380 billion, with non-product-specific outlays of $18.92 billion exempted from the amber box spending limit. This results in total U.S. amber box outlays of $5.119 billion, within the spending limit. Uncertainties remain regarding crop yields for corn and soybeans in 2019 due to delayed planting and late crop progress. The uncertainty surrounding corn and soybean yields in 2019 due to delayed planting and late crop progress could impact market prices. A continuation of the U.S.-China trade dispute may also affect commodity markets. Lower market values could lead to larger program payments under ARC and PLC, potentially exceeding the 2019 spending limit. The U.S. may exceed its spending limit in 2019 due to factors like the U.S.-China trade dispute and uncertain market conditions. Excessive payments could result from MFP payments added to traditional farm programs. Compliance with WTO limits is sensitive to market conditions and valuations. The U.S. may exceed its spending limit in 2019 due to factors like the U.S.-China trade dispute and uncertain market conditions. Compliance with WTO limits is sensitive to market factors and valuations, with the resolution of the trade dispute potentially leading to higher commodity prices and output values. The AoA outlines rules for countries to assess trade-distorting policies, calculate costs, and report them to the WTO transparently. Domestic support, measured as Aggregate Measure of Support (AMS), includes direct and indirect aid to agricultural producers. This encompasses revenue support, input subsidies, and marketing-cost reductions, measured at national and subnational levels. Producer-paid fees are deducted from AMS, and support should be calculated close to the point of sale, preferably at the farm gate. The AoA outlines rules for countries to assess trade-distorting policies and report them transparently to the WTO. Domestic support, measured as Aggregate Measure of Support (AMS), includes direct and indirect aid to agricultural producers. AMS encompasses product-specific and non-product-specific support. Certain AMS outlays may be exempt from WTO spending limits if they comply with criteria defined under the green or blue box, or if their sum is small enough to be deemed benign under the de minimis exemption. Non-exempt AMS outlays are classified as \"amber box\" spending and subject to a strict limit of $19.1 billion annually. The WTO's AoA classification structure limits U.S. amber box outlays to $19.1 billion annually, encouraging countries to prioritize green and blue box compliant programs. Green box programs, like food assistance and environmental initiatives, are not subject to spending limits. The U.S. reported $119.5 billion in green box outlays in 2016. In the 2016 crop year, evaluating program outlays for green box exemption involves assessing payment triggers. Fully decoupled payments based on independent criteria qualify for green box exemption, while payments linked to producer behavior or market conditions do not qualify. Blue box programs are market-distorting but production-limiting, with supply-control features. Blue box programs have supply-control features that offset trade-distorting effects and are not subject to spending limits. The United States has not reported any program spending under the blue box criteria since 1995. De Minimis Exemptions from AMS Programs include exemptions that prevent certain program outlays from counting against spending limits. Product-specific and non-product-specific exemptions are available. Exemptions from AMS programs include product-specific and non-product-specific outlays. Product-specific outlays are linked to specific commodities and may be excluded if they are less than 5% of the commodity's production value. Non-product-specific outlays are decoupled from specific commodities and are evaluated against the total value of U.S. agricultural output. Product-specific payments are directly tied to farmer behavior and may count against the amber box ceiling. They could be excluded from the total AMS spending if they are less than 5% of the specific commodity's output value. Coupled or partially coupled, non-product-specific payments are based on a formula that pools multiple commodities, where farmers only need to produce one to be eligible for the full payment. The full county payment could be notified as coupled, non-product-specific AMS, including ARC and PLC outlays on base acres. Payments on generic base under the 2014 farm bill were commodity-specific. Payments based on historical measures may be partially decoupled, non-product-specific. WTO members must submit annual notification reports of domestic support program spending for compliance with WTO commitments. The WTO requires annual notification reports of domestic support program spending from its members. The U.S. submitted its most recent notification in 2018 for the 2016 crop year, categorizing most support outlays as indirect and compliant with green box criteria. These notifications are public documents available for review and challenge by other members or third parties. In 2016, the United States reported $16 billion in AMS outlays, with $12.2 billion in de minimis exemptions. This reduced the amber box spending to $3.8 billion against the $19.1 billion limit. Non-product-specific outlays of $7.4 billion were exempted due to being below the 5% threshold of $17.8 billion based on the total U.S. agricultural output of $355.5 billion. The United States utilized product-specific de minimis exemptions to stay within its amber box spending limits in 2016. Outlays of $7.4 billion were exempted from counting against the limit, along with $4.8 billion in product-specific exemptions, including corn. This aided in U.S. compliance with the spending limits since 1995. Since 2002, the United States has utilized de minimis exemptions to exclude substantial AMS spending from counting against the amber box limit. The non-product-specific de minimis exemption threshold is measured as a share of the total value of U.S. agricultural output, with an average threshold of $18.8 billion from 2010 to 2016. The notification of amber box outlays has changed over the years to facilitate compliance, particularly for federal crop insurance subsidies. Since 2010, non-product-specific de minimis exemptions have averaged $4.8 billion annually, compared to product-specific exemptions of $3.8 billion. In 2011, the largest non-product-specific exemption reached $7.5 billion in net crop insurance indemnities. Starting in 2012, USDA began notifying crop insurance premium subsidies for each insured commodity as product-specific. Since 2012, over $5 billion in product-specific crop insurance premium subsidies have been exempted each year. Product-specific de minimis exemptions surpassed non-product-specific exemptions in 2012 and 2013 due to high farm prices. However, starting in 2014, non-product-specific exemptions exceeded product-specific exemptions again under program changes authorized by the 2014 farm bill. Annual ARC and PLC outlays averaged $6.7 billion during 2014-2016, with $4.7 billion for ARC and $2.0 billion for PLC."
