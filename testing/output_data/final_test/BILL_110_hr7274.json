    "content": "The Act of 2008 is known as the \"Concussion Treatment and Care Tools Act\" or the \"ConTACT Act\". Congress finds that concussions are mild traumatic brain injuries with long-term effects not well understood. Approximately 3.8 million concussions related to sports and recreation occur in the US annually. There is an increased risk of subsequent brain injuries for those with a history of concussions. Repeat concussions can slow recovery or lead to long-term issues, and in rare cases, result in second impact syndrome, causing brain swelling, permanent damage, and death. Recurrent brain injuries and second impact syndrome are preventable. Many national organizations have adopted concussion management guidelines, leading to confusion and debate. SEC. 3. CONCUSSION MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES WITH RESPECT TO STUDENT ATHLETES. Part B of title III of the Public Health Service Act is amended by inserting after section 317T the following: \"SEC. 317U.
