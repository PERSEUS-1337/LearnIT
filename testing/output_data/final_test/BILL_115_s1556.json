The \"Authorized Rural Water Projects Completion Act\" establishes the Reclamation Rural Water Construction and Settlement Implementation Fund and defines key terms such as \"Fund,\" \"Indian tribe,\" \"rural water project,\" and \"Secretary.\" The Reclamation Rural Water Construction and Settlement Implementation Fund is established in the Treasury of the United States, consisting of deposited amounts and interest earned. Within the Fund, there are accounts for the Rural Water Project and Reclamation Infrastructure. Deposits are made to the Fund. The Secretary of the Treasury shall deposit $115,000,000 annually in the Reclamation Rural Water Construction and Settlement Implementation Fund from 2018 to 2038. $80,000,000 goes to the Rural Water Project Account, and $35,000,000 to the Reclamation Infrastructure and Settlement Implementation Account.

The Reclamation Rural Water Construction and Settlement Implementation Fund receives $115,000,000 annually from 2018 to 2038. $80,000,000 is allocated to the Rural Water Project Account, and $35,000,000 to the Reclamation Infrastructure and Settlement Implementation Account. No amounts can be deposited if it would increase the deficit. SEC. 104. EXPENDITURES FROM FUND.
