    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Telework Tax Incentive Act\". The Congress finds that billions of dollars are spent annually on transportation needs. Congestion on roads costs over $63 billion in lost work time and fuel consumption. On-road vehicles contribute 34% of nitrogen oxides emissions. Teleworking could eliminate pollutants, save gas, free up personal time, and reduce maintenance costs. Teleworking could lead to a decrease in congestion and vehicle miles traveled, resulting in annual savings of $500 million in maintenance and infrastructure costs. The average American daily commute is 49 minutes for a 24-mile round-trip, totaling 100 hours per year. Changes in work patterns have led to a decrease in parental time available outside of paid work. Currently, 60 percent of the workforce is engaged in information work, allowing for decentralized paid work. Approximately 40 million Americans could benefit from teleworking. Estimates suggest that around 40 million Americans are currently teleworking. SEC. 3. CREDIT FOR TELEWORKING. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to include a new section for a teleworking credit. The new section in the Internal Revenue Code allows eligible taxpayers to claim a credit for qualified teleworking expenses, capped at $500 per teleworker for a full taxable year. The credit is reduced proportionally for individuals teleworking for less than a full year. The new section in the Internal Revenue Code allows eligible taxpayers to claim a credit for qualified teleworking expenses. An individual is considered to be in a teleworking arrangement if subject to it for any day of the month. Definitions include an eligible taxpayer as someone working under a teleworking arrangement and a teleworking arrangement as working remotely for at least 75 days per year. The new section in the Internal Revenue Code allows eligible taxpayers to claim a credit for qualified teleworking expenses. Telework is defined as performing work using electronic information technologies to reduce or eliminate the commute to a traditional worksite. Qualified teleworking expenses include furnishings and electronic equipment used for teleworking. The tax credit for teleworking expenses is limited based on the amount of tax liability. The tax credit for teleworking expenses is limited by the sum of allowable credits and the tentative minimum tax for the taxable year. Any excess credit can be carried forward to the next taxable year. Special rules include reducing the basis of property by the credit amount and potential recapture by the Secretary through regulations. The Secretary can recapture the benefit of any credit for property no longer eligible. No credit for property used outside the US or if taxpayer elects not to apply. No double benefit allowed. Conforming amendments are made to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 regarding the credit under section 30B. Amendments include changes to sections 1016, 55(c)(3), and 6501(m) of the Code.
