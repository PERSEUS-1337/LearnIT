National Guard and reserve retirees, known as Gray Area Retirees (GARs), do not receive the same federal benefits until they reach age 60. The National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2010 provided TRICARE Standard coverage for certain retired reserve members under 60. This report examines VA and DOD benefit eligibility for National Guard and reserve members, the status of GARs, and related legislation. Eligibility for VA benefits may vary for Guard and reserve members compared to regular military. The Guard serves both domestically and abroad, tracing its origins to colonial militias. The National Guard and reserves are military organizations that can be deployed for missions at home and abroad. Members may serve in Iraq and Afghanistan, and retire after 20 years of service. Federal benefits for retirees start at age 60. The \"Gray Area Retirees\" are members of the Guard or reserves who transfer to the retired reserve after 20 years of service but have not yet reached the age of 60. They are still subject to being called up to active duty until they reach 60, at which point they are entitled to Department of Defense benefits. Gray Area Retirees (GARs) are members of the Guard or reserves who transfer to the retired reserve after 20 years of service but are still subject to being called up to active duty until they reach 60. At that age, they are entitled to Department of Defense benefits, VA disability compensation, VA health care, VA home loan eligibility, VA burial and memorial benefits, and conversion of SGLI to Veterans Group Life. Gray Area Retirees (GARs) are members of the Guard or reserves who transfer to the retired reserve after 20 years of service but are still subject to being called up to active duty until they reach 60. At that age, they are entitled to Department of Defense benefits, VA disability compensation, VA health care, VA home loan eligibility, VA burial and memorial benefits, and conversion of SGLI to Veterans Group Life. Additionally, GARs' surviving spouses are eligible for annuities under certain conditions. The legislation provides coverage to surviving spouses of Gray Area Retirees (GARs) who did not decline participation in the military Survivor Benefit Plan. VA benefits for veterans include health care, education, home financing, life insurance, burial benefits, and financial benefits like disability compensation and pensions. Eligibility for VA benefits requires being a veteran or a survivor/dependent of a veteran. Not every military service member is considered a \"veteran\" for VA benefits. For VA benefits, being a \"veteran\" is defined as serving in the military and being discharged under conditions other than dishonorable. Criteria like discharge status, active service, time of service, and length of duty determine eligibility. Guard and reserve members may struggle to meet the \"active duty\" and \"length of service\" requirements, making them ineligible for VA benefits. Guard and reserve members must serve a minimum of 24 continuous months on active duty to qualify for VA benefits. Serving on regular active duty makes them eligible for the same benefits as other veterans. Otherwise, Guard and reserve duty is not considered \"active duty\" unless the servicemember was disabled or died from a duty-related injury. Guard and reserve members may qualify for VA benefits if they have served the full period for which they were called to duty, even if it is less than 24 months. Eligibility is determined on a case-by-case basis by the VA after reviewing the individual's military service records. The VA determines eligibility for benefits on a case-by-case basis by reviewing military service records. The statutory definition of \"veteran\" is not precise, giving the VA discretion. TRICARE is the DOD's health benefits program for active duty servicemembers, retirees, and their families, providing access to healthcare services worldwide. Prior to the National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2010, General and Flag Officers were not eligible for TRICARE health benefits until they reached the age of 60. However, they could purchase the TRICARE Retiree Dental Program before retirement. Retired reserve members between 60 and 64 receiving retirement pay are automatically eligible for TRICARE Standard or TRICARE Extra, and can enroll in TRICARE Prime if available in their area. At age 65, reservists receiving retirement pay must enroll in Medicare. Upon reaching age 65, reservists receiving retirement pay must enroll in Medicare Part B to retain TRICARE coverage, which converts to TRICARE for Life (TFL). TFL covers all TRICARE beneficiaries entitled to Medicare Part A and with Medicare Part B coverage based on age. There are no enrollment fees for TFL, and the catastrophic cap is $3,000 per fiscal year per family. TRDP also remains available. Section 705 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 provided TRICARE Standard (TS) coverage for certain retired reserve members under 60 years old who are qualified for non-regular retirement. In the 112th Congress, legislation was proposed to authorize space-available travel on military aircraft for retired reserve members on the same basis as active-duty personnel. Additionally, there were bills introduced to recognize certain reserve members as veterans under the law, but without entitlement to benefits. Detailed eligibility criteria for retired reserve members are available on the TRICARE website."
