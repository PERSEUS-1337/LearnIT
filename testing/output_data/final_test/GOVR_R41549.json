    "content": "The United States has been developing missile defense systems for decades, initially focusing on protecting against nuclear-armed ballistic missiles from the Soviet Union. In recent years, the aim has shifted to countering the ballistic missile threat from rogue states like North Korea and Iran. Deploying interceptors in Alaska and California to address North Korea's threat, the Bush Administration also initiated discussions with NATO allies in Central and Eastern Europe to establish a \"third site\" on the European continent in response to Iran's ballistic missile program. The administration sought NATO endorsement for a limited missile defense system as an alliance capability. In January 2007, the Bush Administration began negotiations with Poland and the Czech Republic to deploy a ground-based missile defense system in Europe by 2013 to guard against a potential threat from Iran. The plan included 10 interceptors in Poland and radar in the Czech Republic. This proposal raised concerns in Europe about provoking Russia and undermining NATO solidarity. Agreements were negotiated but not ratified by the end of the Bush Administration. In September 2009, the Obama Administration announced plans to cancel the Bush Administration's ground-based missile defense system in Europe and instead deploy a regional BMD capability known as the Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA). The PAA would be based on expanding existing BMD sensors and interceptors, such as the Navy's Aegis BMD system. Despite the Defense Department's confidence in existing systems, some observers doubt the effectiveness of the PAA. The plan is expected to evolve over the next decade to include BMD capabilities against medium- and long-range Iranian ballistic missiles, with hopes of NATO adoption and Russian involvement. NATO plans to establish a BMD capability with facilities in Romania and Poland by 2015 and 2018. Russia initially criticized the Obama plan but later showed openness to cooperation. Russian Foreign Minister called for a joint analysis of missile proliferation risks. Turkey may host U.S. missile defense radar. NATO has been considering two missile defense efforts, one tactical and the other strategic. The Active Layered Theater Ballistic Missile Defense (ALTBMD) is designed to defend NATO-deployed forces against short- and medium-range ballistic missiles. This system will consist of lower- and upper-tier missile defense systems, battle management, communications, command and control, intelligence, early warning sensors, radars, and interceptors. NATO member states will provide sensors and weapon systems, while NATO will develop the overall capability. NATO member states will provide sensors and weapon systems for the ALTBMD, while NATO will develop the BMC 3 I component and integrate the systems into a coherent, NATO-wide Theater Missile Defense capability. The first major contract was awarded in 2006 to develop a TMD test bed in The Hague, which became operational in 2008. NATO expects the system to be fully operational by 2018. Missile defense development within NATO has been a slow process, with a feasibility study initiated in 2002 and completed in 2005. The study concluded that long-range ballistic missile defense is technically feasible. There were discussions about the placement of U.S. facilities in Eastern Europe under the Bush Administration's plan and whether it would align with a future NATO missile defense system. Some policymakers suggested that any anti-missile system in Europe should be established solely under NATO auspices rather than bilaterally with just two NATO partners. Under NATO auspices, the Bush Administration preferred not to work bilaterally. NATO defense ministers agreed to study a complementary anti-missile capability in 2007. Former NATO Secretary General supported the U.S. plan. The Bush Administration hoped NATO would adopt its missile defense as an alliance capability. At the 2008 NATO summit in Bucharest, the Bush Administration pushed for the adoption of its missile defense system as an alliance capability. The Summit Declaration recognized the threat of ballistic missile proliferation and stated that the proposed U.S. system would significantly contribute to the alliance's protection. NATO also aimed to integrate U.S. assets with its own missile defense efforts and develop options for anti-missile defense of alliance territory not covered by U.S. installations by the 2009 summit. The 2008 NATO summit in Bucharest endorsed the Bush Administration's missile defense project, aiming to strengthen NATO-Russia missile defense cooperation and address proliferation risks from Iran and North Korea. The Summit Declaration was seen as a breakthrough document, with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice praising it. National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley declared the debate on rogue state ballistic missile threats ended. In December 2008, NATO foreign ministers reiterated support for missile defense, highlighting agreements with Czech Republic and Poland. They also called on Moscow to avoid confrontational statements and threats to Allies and Partners. Representative Ellen Tauscher emphasized cooperation with NATO in missile defense proposals. At the 2009 NATO summit in Strasbourg, France, missile defense cooperation with Russia was a key condition for some allies' support. The Summit Declaration reaffirmed the Bucharest Summit's conclusions on missile defense but called for more work to address missile threats in a prioritized manner. The Council in Permanent Session was tasked with studying architecture alternatives, including the ALTBMD program. In December 2009, NATO foreign ministers praised the Obama Administration's approach to missile defense. In December 2009, NATO foreign ministers praised the Obama Administration's revised missile defense plan and expressed willingness to cooperate with Russia on the issue. NATO and Russia formed a working group to study the issue, with hopes of having a joint system by 2020. NATO Secretary General emphasized missile defense as an opportunity for Europe to invest in common defense. In July 2010, NATO Secretary General aimed to have the Obama Administration's missile defense plan adopted as an alliance capability and hoped for Russia's participation. Russia was invited to the Lisbon summit in November to discuss cooperation on missile defense. Despite initial Russian concerns, President Medvedev attended the meeting and NATO officially identified territorial missile defense as a core alliance objective. NATO adopted missile defense as a core alliance objective in response to ballistic missile proliferation threats. The Summit Declaration emphasized the importance of missile defense in overall defense posture, based on principles of Allied security, solidarity, and equitable burden-sharing. Turkey's influence led to the omission of specific threats, with a focus on maintaining stable relations with Iran. The program will expand existing ALTBMD for territorial missile defense development. The development of territorial missile defense is a core objective for NATO in response to ballistic missile threats. Alliance leaders have tasked NATO staff with developing consultation and control arrangements for missile defense by March 2011, with an action plan to be drafted by June 2011. The alliance's new Strategic Concept highlights the growing threat of ballistic missile proliferation and emphasizes the protection of alliance territory against missile attacks as a key element of collective defense. NATO also aims to enhance cooperation with Russia in areas of shared interests, including missile defense. In October 2010, Secretary General Rasmussen estimated the cost of the territorial missile defense plan at 200 million euros over 10 years, with an additional 800 million euros for upgrading the existing ALTBMD program. The funding for these programs will be shared among all 28 NATO member states and will come from the common NATO budget. Individual countries will also be responsible for supporting the deployment of their own interceptors and sensors. However, a NATO industry advisory group warned in December 2010 that the cost could exceed the initial estimate. The NATO industry advisory group warned in December 2010 that the cost of the missile defense plan could exceed the early estimate, requiring a significant investment by NATO for a new command-and-control architecture approach. The alliance has not yet provided actual cost estimates, but the Bush and Obama Administrations sought NATO involvement in a common missile defense system due to the serious threat posed by Iran acquiring a ballistic missile capability. NATO decided to adopt the system at the Lisbon summit after endorsing missile defense in summit declarations. Some analysts argue that NATO's decision to adopt a common missile defense system at the Lisbon summit was in response to a unilateral U.S. initiative to deploy missile defense facilities in Europe. This move raised concerns about NATO's collective defense responsibility and the prospect of U.S.-commanded defenses operating alongside Article 5 defense. However, there were positive factors motivating alliance members to accept the proposal, such as the need for protection against the security threat posed by rogue states with ballistic missiles. NATO's decision to adopt a common missile defense system at the Lisbon summit was driven by the need for protection against the security threat posed by rogue states. This cooperation would strengthen transatlantic relations and symbolize the American commitment to defending the continent. Participation in a missile defense project could also bring economic benefits to European defense industries. NATO's decision to adopt a common missile defense system at the Lisbon summit was driven by the need for protection against rogue states. Secretary General Rasmussen emphasized the importance of cooperation with Russia in missile defense. However, concerns have been raised about the feasibility of territorial missile defense and its impact on nuclear deterrence strategy. The French government initially worried about the effect on their nuclear posture. Financial constraints may also pose challenges for European allies in implementing a missile defense system. Financial crisis and spending constraints among European allies may raise future burden sharing issues in NATO. Concerns have been expressed over command and control arrangements, with Russia potentially reversing its support if it feels its nuclear deterrent value is compromised. The NATO-Russia Council endorsed cooperation in missile defense at the Lisbon summit, agreeing to pursue joint ballistic missile threat assessments and continue dialogues on theater missile defense cooperation. The NRC is tasked with developing a comprehensive Joint Analysis for future missile defense cooperation. The NATO-Russia Council endorsed cooperation in missile defense at the Lisbon summit, with Russia approving involvement of technicians in planning. President Medvedev emphasized the need for a strategic partnership, while the US rejected constraints on their missile defense plans. Prime Minister Putin warned of deploying new missile systems if Moscow's nuclear deterrent is compromised. The progress will be reviewed at the June 2011 NRC Defence Ministers meeting. Russia may have felt compelled to cooperate on missile defense to protect itself from new threats to its borders. Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov indicated that Russian acceptance and participation in NATO missile defense would be crucial for improved Russia-NATO relations. NATO and the United States are seeking ways to engage Russia in partnership on BMD. Russian President Medvedev emphasized the importance of reaching an agreement with Washington on missile defense to avoid a new arms race that financially-strapped Russia cannot afford. NATO member states are expected to contribute to the PAA, with future cooperation extending beyond just offering land for interceptors and radar. Allies in the PAA will provide air, land, or sea-based platforms for sensors and interceptors. The U.S. Navy's Aegis system will be used initially, with plans for more advanced versions of interceptor missiles to be based on land in Poland and Romania. Radar and sensors will be strategically placed for defense. PAA plans to use radar and sensors placed in closer proximity to the threat, with some European NATO countries already having their own BMD capabilities. Countries like Italy, Germany, France, the UK, Denmark, Spain, Greece, and the Netherlands have partnered with the United States in developing air and missile defense systems like MEADS and Patriot missiles. Additionally, some countries participate in U.S. sea-based BMD efforts. The House FY2011 National Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 5136) would impose restrictions on the Administration's PAA similar to those on the Bush plan, limiting procurement or deployment of U.S. defenses in Europe until technology is proven effective. It also requires host government ratification and a report on alternative BMD systems for Europe. The House bill (H.R. 5136) imposes restrictions on the Administration's PAA, limiting procurement or deployment of U.S. defenses in Europe until technology is proven effective. It also requires host government ratification and a report on alternative BMD systems for Europe. Additionally, the bill declares U.S. policy that future versions of the Standard missile deployed under the PAA should be able to intercept long-range ballistic missiles from Iran targeting the United States. The Senate bill (S. 3454) similarly expresses the sense of Congress on the need for effective U.S. BMD systems without restrictions from New START. Senator Kyl proposed an amendment (S.Amdt. 4634) related to this issue. Senator Kyl proposed an amendment (S.Amdt. 4634) in late November 2010 to set U.S. policy towards the Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) for national missile defense. The amendment aligns with existing U.S. law and supports current Administration plans for BMD coverage of NATO Europe and the United States. On December 22, 2010, the House and Senate Armed Services Committees approved a Joint Explanatory Statement endorsing the Senate provision on effective U.S. BMD systems. The Explanatory Statement includes Senate provisions on BMD issues related to the European PAA, limits on funds for construction and deployment of land-based interceptors until host nation approval, and a national security waiver authority. It also mentions limitations on funds for the land-based portion of the European PAA until Congress receives an independent assessment. The provisions aim to support the successful implementation of the European PAA and missile defense interceptor production. President Obama signed the FY2011 National Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 6523) into law (P.L. 111-383) on January 7, 2011, which includes provisions related to the European PAA and authorizes a shared early warning program with the Czech Republic."
