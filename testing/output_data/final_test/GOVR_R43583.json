    "content": "In recent decades, increased coordination between federal law enforcement agencies and state/local counterparts is needed due to criminals exploiting borders for criminal operations, utilizing advanced technologies to globalize their activities. Jurisdictional lines limit law enforcement efforts, while criminal networks have become less hierarchical and more networked. Criminal networks have evolved to be less hierarchical and more networked, posing challenges for law enforcement. Federal agencies have adapted by using task forces and fusion centers to address border security threats and overcome jurisdictional limitations. The Department of Justice Inspector General has highlighted the challenge of coordinating among law enforcement agencies. Counterdrug and counterterrorism task forces have roots dating back to the 1970s in New York City, fostering cooperation among federal, state, and local investigators. The first federally led counterdrug task force was created in response to drug traffic in metropolitan New York, covering all levels of drug trafficking. Its mission was to control the illicit sale and distribution of narcotics through investigative and prosecutive action. The task force led to the creation of DEA's State and Local Task Force Program, which incentivized state and local police participation through monetary inducements. The DEA's State and Local Task Force Program provides funding for investigative expenses and manages task forces staffed by DEA special agents and state/local officers. Joint Terrorism Task Forces, led by the FBI, coordinate federal counterterrorism investigations nationwide, with roots in New York City in the late 1970s. In the late 1970s, the FBI and NYPD had a tense relationship due to competition in high-profile investigations, including terrorism cases. Lack of cooperation between the NYPD Arson and Explosion Unit and the FBI's Terrorist Squad hindered efforts to combat terrorism. The JTTF concept was created in 1980 to combine NYPD and FBI resources for counterterrorism efforts, stemming from a project targeting bank robbers. Initially, the lack of cooperation between agencies hindered investigations, leading to the formation of the New York JTTF with 12 FBI agents and 12 NYPD officers. A memorandum of understanding detailed the task force's operations. The JTTF was established in 1980 to merge NYPD and FBI resources for counterterrorism, with a MOU outlining federal rules, funding from the FBI, shared information, and federal deputization of NYPD officers. This model continues in current federal JTTF iterations, showcasing the layered U.S. police system at local, state, and federal levels. The police system consists of layers of law enforcement at local, state, and federal levels, facing challenges from jurisdictional overlap. Task forces are created to address these issues by bringing together agencies with similar missions but different operational jurisdictions. Multijurisdictional Task Forces (MJTFs) are collaborative law enforcement efforts involving multiple agencies with jurisdiction over different areas, aimed at addressing drug control or violent crime issues. These task forces improve communication, share intelligence, and coordinate activities to efficiently target offenders operating across jurisdictional boundaries. They enhance law enforcement's ability to combat criminals exploiting jurisdictional boundaries and can counter various threats posed by criminal networks. Task forces, like the Border Enforcement Security Task Force (BEST) initiative led by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), focus on countering criminal organizations threatening border security. The first tunnel task force was established in San Diego in 2003 to target criminal networks exploiting the U.S.-Mexican border through underground tunnels. This task force, a partnership between ICE, DEA, U.S. Border Patrol, state law enforcement, and Mexican counterparts, was later incorporated into ICE's BEST initiative in 2006 to enhance multilateral law enforcement efforts. In 2006, the San Diego Tunnel Task Force uncovered a sophisticated cross-border tunnel connecting Otay Mesa, CA, with Tijuana, Mexico. The tunnel was nearly six football fields long, equipped with lighting, ventilation, and an electric rail system. Authorities seized 17,292 pounds of marijuana and 325 pounds of cocaine, worth over $10 million. This was the largest tunnel found in San Diego in two years, highlighting challenges of overlapping jurisdiction and investigative authority. Various agencies, including the FBI, DEA, ATF, and ICE, investigate illegal gang activities like drug and human trafficking. Collaborations such as MOUs, task forces, and fusion centers are used to enhance information sharing. The FBI's Violent Gang Safe Streets Task Forces and the National Gang Intelligence Center work with federal, state, and local law enforcement to investigate crimes related to gangs. The National Gang Intelligence Center (NGIC) coordinates intelligence information for law enforcement investigations on conspiracy and firearms violations. Various federal agencies, including the FBI, DEA, ATF, and ICE, collaborate along the Southwest border to counter criminal and security threats. Task forces and fusion centers enhance information sharing for investigating illegal gang activities like drug and human trafficking. The challenges of understanding the breadth of task force activity in a geographic region include the lack of a central repository for information, making it difficult to measure cooperation and identify overlapping efforts. It is also unclear how to determine if certain areas require more task forces. The Executive Branch responses to issues like drug trafficking and terrorism could inform congressional policy making. Congressional policy makers may request a complete accounting of task forces in the Southwest border region. CRS compiled a dataset of task forces and intelligence sharing bodies within 150 miles of the border with Mexico from 2010-2013. Approximately 200 task forces were identified, but this list is not exhaustive. Task forces combating drug trafficking or terrorism, including those focused on gangs, violent crime, public corruption, fugitives, and money laundering, are depicted on a map by CRS. The map shows task forces clustering around major urban areas, but their actual territories and responsibilities are not clear from open source information. This raises questions about potential overlap or competition between task forces in the same area. The FBI-led JTTFs are core nodes managing federal counterterrorism investigations at the local level, with clearly defined task force responsibilities. Collaboration in law enforcement involves bridging jurisdictional lines and pooling resources, such as the HIDTA program for drug trafficking. The HIDTA program provides assistance to law enforcement agencies in critical drug trafficking regions, with each region governed by its own Executive Board. The Boards have the discretion to design initiatives tailored to local conditions and respond quickly to changes in drug trafficking threats. The Executive Board of the Southwest border HIDTA facilitates counterdrug initiatives in five regions. Criminal organizations have diversified into activities like kidnapping and corruption. The OCDETF program coordinates multiple agencies to investigate these criminals. The OCDETF program targets major drug trafficking and money laundering organizations, involving federal agencies like the DEA, FBI, ATF, and others. These agencies collaborate with state and local law enforcement to prioritize cases in line with Administration priorities. Deputy Attorney General Cole's guidance in an August 2013 memorandum emphasized focusing DOJ resources on combating major drug traffickers over individual marijuana users, despite marijuana remaining illegal under federal law. This approach prioritizes investigating and prosecuting criminal enterprises involved in drug trafficking as a central DOJ priority. During the past decade, law enforcement cooperation has greatly increased in the area of information sharing through the development of fusion centers owned and operated by state and local entities. These centers are supported by the federal government and are notable for their relevance to federal policing, reflecting a national priority on counterterrorism post-9/11. After 9/11, fusion centers were established to facilitate information sharing among federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies, focusing on counterterrorism and crime issues. These centers analyze threat information related to their geographical areas, adhere to baseline standards for operations, and are supported by the Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies. Congress mandated their creation to enhance homeland security efforts. Fusion centers, established post-9/11, support information sharing among federal, state, and local agencies for counterterrorism and crime issues. They are staffed by a mix of personnel and handle information from all levels of government and private sector data. Fusion centers, part of the National Network of Fusion Centers recognized by DHS, play a crucial role in national domestic counterterrorism policing. The development of these centers post-9/11 reflects shifts towards proactive policing strategies, the importance of state and local law enforcement in homeland security, and the need for information sharing among law enforcement entities. Fusion centers are seen as vital components in proactive domestic policing, utilizing intelligence to understand and combat threats. They bring agencies together to assess threat information and are considered a proactive tool in fighting global terrorism. The National Network of Fusion Centers facilitates the sharing of terrorism, homeland security, and law enforcement information at state, local, regional, and national levels. The rise of fusion centers post-9/11 highlights the crucial role of state and local law enforcement in homeland security, particularly in thwarting terrorist plots. The Obama Administration recognizes the value of state, local, and tribal entities as force multipliers in counterterrorism efforts. While foreign intelligence sources may provide leads on terrorists, domestic policing is essential for uncovering homegrown threats, especially since 2009. Since 2009, domestic policing has become crucial in countering the homegrown terrorist threat, as highlighted in national strategies. The focus is on Al Qaeda and its affiliates, with the homeland designated as a primary area of emphasis. A poll in 2012 showed that over 65% of individuals in fusion centers viewed homegrown \"jihadi individuals or organizations\" as the greatest terror threat. The focus on combating domestic terrorism threat has broadened to include all elements of national power, with fusion centers expanding their missions to encompass all-crimes and all-hazards. This shift has not abandoned the counterterrorism mission, but rather aligns with a national trend towards a broader approach. Fusion centers are encouraged to adopt an all-crimes and all-hazards approach to address precursor crimes with national security implications. Fusion centers have evolved to adopt an all-crimes and all-hazards approach to enhance collaboration with local police and non-law enforcement partners, potentially increasing access to state and local resources. They have played a crucial role in institutionalizing information sharing between the federal intelligence community and state/local law enforcement post-9/11, centralizing and formalizing intelligence exchange networks. The El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) was established in 1974 to collect and disseminate information on drug, unauthorized immigrant, and weapon smuggling. It evolved its mission post-9/11 to address new threats, highlighting the importance of coordination efforts along the Southwest border. EPIC, established in 1974, evolved post-9/11 to include counterterrorism in its mission. It operates as an \"all-threat center\" with a 24/7 watch program providing tactical intelligence. The BEST initiative, addressing drug trafficking-related crime, established a cross-border task force in Mexico in 2009 for transnational cooperation. The BEST initiative, established in Mexico in 2009, supports joint investigations of drug trafficking and other criminal activities. Specific task force initiatives have been developed to counter new threats, such as underground drug smuggling tunnels. ICE established tunnel task forces in San Diego and Nogales in response to the increase in tunnel detection along the Southwest border. Law enforcement in California and Arizona have detected high rates of subterranean tunnel construction, with San Diego and Nogales showing differences in tunnel complexity. Task forces and partnerships have been established to address these threats, with the HIDTA program providing assistance to critical drug trafficking regions since 1988. The HIDTA program, established in 1990, has expanded to 28 designated areas in the US and its territories. It assesses evolving drug trafficking threats, designates HIDTAs, and allocates resources to initiatives. Task forces and fusion centers collaborate legislatively or administratively to address drug trafficking. The National Drug Intelligence Center (NDIC) was officially created in 1993 through the Department of Defense Appropriations Act. It was established to provide drug-related intelligence to support law enforcement operations. The NDIC received funding in FY1991 and was located in Johnstown, PA. The FBI's Safe Streets Violent Crime Initiative, established in 1992, focuses on combating violent street gangs and drug-related violence. Task forces, involving federal, state, and local investigators, aim to dismantle criminal enterprises from street-level thugs to gang leaders. The FBI operated over 220 Safe Street task forces in 2011, with a focus on gangs. Additionally, Safe Trails Task Forces handle crime on Indian reservations. Since 9/11, the FBI has increased the number of Safe Streets task forces by nearly one-third. In August 2012, the San Gabriel Valley Safe Streets Task Force led an investigation resulting in the indictment of 27 individuals involved in a methamphetamine distribution conspiracy linked to a Mexican drug trafficking organization. The FBI highlighted the defendant's control over methamphetamine importation from Mexico to the United States, where it was sold on the streets of Los Angeles County. The BEST initiative, established in 2005 as a partnership between ICE, CBP, and other law enforcement entities, was a response to violence in the region. The BEST program was established in 2005 in response to violence along the U.S.-Mexican border. It has since grown to include 35 task forces, with 13 located along the Southwest border. The program was formally authorized by the 112th Congress through the Jaime Zapata Border Enforcement Security Task Force Act. The legislation outlines how BEST units may be established and requires a report on their effectiveness in reducing drug trafficking and other crimes along U.S. borders. Task forces or fusion centers may be dissolved due to factors such as lack of funding, duplicative missions, waning threats, and allegations of corruption. The Panama Unit, a special anti-narcotics squad in South Texas, was disbanded in January 2013 after four officers were indicted for aiding drug traffickers. The disbanding was led by Hidalgo County Sheriff Lupe Trevino, whose son was one of the indicted officers. The National Drug Intelligence Center (NDIC) also closed in June 2012, with concerns about overlapping functions with other agencies. The National Drug Intelligence Center (NDIC) faced funding cuts and closure due to perceived duplicative functions with other agencies. The Administration proposed reducing funding by $9.0 million in FY2012, leading to its closure in June 2012. Congress allocated $20.0 million for closure and reassignment of functions. In FY2013, the Administration suggested transferring NDIC functions to the DEA, but received no appropriations. The decision-making process for closing or defunding coordinating units lacks a uniform metric. The effectiveness of task forces and intelligence sharing centers is evaluated based on specified goals, objectives, and established metrics. Evaluation can be done through internal reviews, congressional oversight, and various channels. Grading law enforcement coordination is a pervasive issue nationwide, highlighted in this report through an examination of evaluation metrics. The complexity of evaluating coordination efforts along the Southwest border is highlighted due to the involvement of multiple federal agencies with different missions, authorities, and resources. Establishing valid and reliable metrics for assessing these cooperative efforts may be challenging, as there are no uniform metrics at the federal level for evaluating task forces or federal strategies. The report suggests an inverted pyramid-style framework for measuring the success of federal law enforcement task forces in meeting national-level law enforcement strategies. Key questions include the integral role of task forces, linking task force results to national strategies, and comparing task force work across different agencies. The report proposes evaluating federal law enforcement task forces to determine their effectiveness in meeting strategic goals and comparing their performance across different agencies and within specific task forces. This includes assessing duplication of efforts, success rates of different types of task forces, and cooperation within task forces. The effectiveness of cooperation between officers from different agencies in law enforcement task forces and intelligence sharing bodies is assessed by measuring inputs, outputs, and outcomes. This evaluation can help determine the success or failure of law enforcement strategies involving task forces. Outputs in law enforcement refer to the measurable activities and services produced by agencies, such as investigations, arrests, convictions, and seizures. However, outcomes are more challenging to quantify but are considered more meaningful in assessing the success of law enforcement strategies. Key outcomes in law enforcement, such as maintaining public safety, protecting national security, reducing criminal activity, and building public trust, represent the impacts of police agencies and task forces on communities. Inputs, outputs, and outcomes of task forces can indicate efficiency in the investigative process, with examples including resource allocation for arrests and monitoring arrest rates. Task forces themselves can be viewed strategically in this context. Task forces are inputs targeting specific threats identified by federal agencies and their state and local partners. While law enforcement often measures output, such as drug seizures, it can be challenging to correlate these outputs to outcomes like border security. Outputs do contribute to outcomes, but establishing direct correlations between the two can be complex. Figure 3 elaborates on inputs, outputs, and outcomes in federal policing efforts in the Southwest border region. Strategies heavily rely on task forces and collaboration, with a focus on evaluating the impact of billions of dollars in federal funding. The evaluation of law enforcement coordination in federal policing efforts in the Southwest border region focuses on determining success based on task force work and impact. Strategies emphasize collaboration and the use of federal funding to reduce the flow of illicit drugs and associated violence. The Southwest Border Counternarcotics Strategy relies on indicators to measure success, such as drug, currency, and firearm seizures. The strategy aims to enhance criminal intelligence and information sharing capabilities in the region. The Southwest Border Counternarcotics Strategy aims to enhance information sharing by increasing access to relevant criminal intelligence databases. However, simply increasing access may not necessarily lead to improved information sharing, raising questions about the quality of information and utilization by investigators. The Southwest Border Counternarcotics Strategy aims to enhance information sharing by increasing access to relevant criminal intelligence databases. Task forces impacting strategies should ideally reflect federal priorities and support specific strategies, but the effectiveness of this support may need to be evaluated with established metrics. Establishing metrics for success in Southwest border task forces and intelligence sharing centers is crucial to evaluate both output and outcome. Distinguishing between output and outcome metrics is important for assessing the effectiveness of task forces in meeting specific strategies, such as the National Drug Control Strategy's goals. ONDCP has initiatives in disrupting domestic drug activities to reduce illicit drug consumption and its consequences in the United States. ONDCP has initiatives in disrupting domestic drug activities to reduce illicit drug consumption and its consequences in the United States. The Performance Reporting System (PRS) is designed to appraise the effectiveness of this Strategy, particularly relevant to countering drug trafficking on the Southwest border. The PRS outlines three measures to assess progress in disrupting domestic drug trafficking and production. The Performance Reporting System (PRS) evaluates the effectiveness of ONDCP initiatives in disrupting domestic drug activities. It focuses on measures like the number of dismantled criminal groups linked to CPOTs and RPOTs, as well as meth lab incidents. However, the connection between these measures and the reduction in drug trafficking and production is not clearly defined. ONDCP acknowledges potential errors in the logic model linking program actions to desired results. Policy makers and Administration officials may question how measures in the Performance Reporting System (PRS) track to changes in the drug threat and how resources are allocated to inputs that impact outcomes. Federal agencies continuously review their activities to assess the strength and success of collaborative efforts, including those along the Southwest border. Annual reviews are conducted by federal agencies to assess their activities and programs, such as the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF) program. These reviews aim to evaluate program goals, challenges, and performance indicators, particularly in reducing drug supply and trafficking-related violence in the United States. Internal challenges include resource allocation issues and balancing personnel and operational costs. The OCDETF program faces challenges in uniting agencies with differing priorities, inconsistent data collection procedures, and measuring program successes. External struggles include resource diversion, budget constraints, international law enforcement relationships, and criminals' use of technology. The DOJ uses performance indicators to evaluate program progress and adjusts them as needed. The DOJ uses performance indicators to evaluate the success of the OCDETF program, which includes measures related to investigations of drug trafficking organizations, financial investigations, targeting leadership positions, and enhancing coordinated investigations. These indicators help in assessing program effectiveness and identifying areas for improvement. The DOJ uses performance indicators to evaluate the success of the OCDETF program, including measures related to investigations of drug trafficking organizations and financial investigations. The program helps in articulating successes and areas for improvement to Members of Congress, but may not fully capture the broader outcomes of the program. Department-level Offices of Inspectors General are responsible for inspecting and reporting on potential waste, fraud, abuse, and misconduct in department and agency programs. The DOJ utilizes various task forces such as VCIT, MET, SSTF, and RFTF, each led by different agencies focusing on violent crime. The OIG found a lack of coordination among these task forces, except for anti-gang task forces. There are varying levels of coordination between DOJ component agencies, with no follow-up assessment conducted by the OIG. In 2011, DHS implemented an annual assessment of fusion centers to evaluate their capabilities and the National Network of Fusion Centers (NNFC). The assessment involves a self-assessment by fusion centers and validation by an interagency team led by DHS. The NNFC progress is measured using a maturity model with four rungs, and 75% of fusion centers must meet criteria to climb a rung. In 2011, the NNFC was assessed as fundamental, with over 75% of fusion centers meeting criteria for their mission. In 2012, the NNFC moved up a rung, indicating implementation of plans and procedures. Congress evaluates center coordination through oversight hearings, committee reports, GAO, and other mechanisms. HIDTA program has been reviewed using these tools. The Senate Committee on Appropriations requested GAO to examine HIDTAs' efforts in linking investigations to international drug traffickers. GAO found that targeting local drug traffickers linked with international organizations on the CPOT list was a valid strategy for HIDTAs to achieve their goal of reducing drug trafficking in their regions. GAO has also investigated other law enforcement coordination issues within the HIDTA program. The GAO highlighted cooperative efforts like HIDTAs, which provide access to law enforcement databases and event deconfliction services. Congressional oversight has scrutinized HIDTA program elements, task force models, and information sharing activities to streamline coordination and information sharing among federal, state, and local agencies. Oversight is a valuable tool for legislators to gather information on law enforcement coordination, policy makers debate how to enhance program performance and efficiency. Congressional reports evaluate collaborative law enforcement efforts, such as fusion centers, critiquing assessment processes and emphasizing the need for measuring effectiveness. Stakeholders struggle to measure the value of fusion centers for homeland security, especially in counterterrorism. A Senate investigation found no terrorist threats uncovered or plots disrupted by fusion center reporting from 2009 to 2010. Congressional focus on law enforcement and intelligence failures like 9/11 and Nidal Hasan. Investigations into law enforcement and intelligence failures, such as 9/11 and the Fort Hood assault, raise questions about task force operations and information sharing. Evaluating collaborative programs can be challenging due to multiple committees having jurisdiction over certain issues. Different committees, like Homeland Security and Judiciary, may have varying focuses on ensuring law enforcement effectiveness in combating criminal networks. Budget hearings and oversight hearings can evaluate law enforcement effectiveness in countering criminal networks. The House Committee on Appropriations received testimony from the Director of ONDCP regarding the activities of regional HIDTAs, with some Members questioning if these activities align with authorized goals of focusing on drug trafficking."
