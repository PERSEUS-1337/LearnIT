    "content": "The three main methods of receiving television signals are broadcast, cable, and direct broadcast satellite (DBS). Broadcast TV is free and received through antennas, while cable and DBS offer packages for a fee. The FCC reports 107 million TV households in the US, with 88% subscribing to an MVPD service. Cable serves 75% of subscribers, DBS serves 22%, and the rest use other MVPD services. Cable and satellite provide more programming choices and better signal quality than broadcast TV, but can be expensive. Congress promotes competition in the MVPD market to control cable TV rates. The Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act, passed in 1999, aimed to balance the interests of broadcast, satellite, and cable industries to ensure access to free local TV programming and expand consumer choices. Congress promotes competition in the MVPD marketplace to control cable TV rates. The Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act (SHVA) of 1999 allowed satellite companies to retransmit broadcast network programming to households unable to receive signals via antennas, protecting local programming and network affiliates. The SHVA of 1999 allowed satellite companies to retransmit distant network signals to unserved households through a compulsory copyright license, setting royalties paid to copyright owners by the satellite companies. This license, codified in \ufffd119 of the Copyright Act, was renewed for another five years in 1994. The SHVIA of 1999 extended the compulsory copyright license for satellite companies to retransmit distant network signals, which was renewed in 1994. It also allowed satellite companies to offer \"local-into-local\" service, exempted them from retransmission consent requirements, and created a royalty-free compulsory copyright license for local-into-local satellite signals. EchoStar offered local-into-local in 160 of the 210 Designated Market Areas by November 30, 2004. EchoStar and DirecTV offered local-into-local services in various Designated Market Areas. SHVIA allowed unserved households to receive distant network signals, distinguishing between local and distant signals based on the broadcast network television affiliate's market area. Eligibility for distant network signals is determined by \"White Areas\" and \"Grade B\" Signals. Determining eligibility for receiving distant network signals via satellite is complex and based on the FCC's \"Grade B\" signal intensity standard. Only consumers in unserved households, where broadcast TV reception is poor or non-existent, can receive these signals. The FCC uses computer models like the Individual Location Longely-Rice (ILLR) to predict signal intensity and determine eligibility. Congress mandated the use of the Grade B standard in SHVA and SHVIA, with the FCC confirming its use in 2000. The Individual Location Longely-Rice (ILLR) model predicts signal intensity at specific households for satellite companies transmitting distant network signals. Court challenges arose due to companies delivering signals to ineligible consumers, leading to a 1998 ruling affecting over 2 million consumers. Congress \"grandfathered\" illegal signal recipients unable to receive Grade A signals, while new subscribers must follow original rules. Exceptions exist for certain users like recreational vehicles and commercial trucks. Under SHVIA, consumers using C-band satellite dishes on RVs or commercial trucks, or those illegally receiving distant network signals, could continue until December 31, 2004 if they did not receive Grade B signals from local affiliates. Grandfathered subscribers using C-band dishes before October 31, 1999 are exempt from the five-year limitation and can receive signals indefinitely. Waivers are available for consumers who believe they cannot receive Grade B signals despite predictive models. The Satellite Home Viewer Extension and Reauthorization Act (SHVERA) was passed by Congress on November 20, 2004, allowing consumers in rural areas to request a waiver for receiving distant network signals via satellite. This remains controversial despite the availability of local-into-local service, as some consumers seek greater programming choices or wish to watch network programming airing at different times in various U.S. time zones. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 4818, P.L. 108-447) was a compromise between different bills in the House and Senate. The main focus was on extending the compulsory copyright license, which was set to expire on December 31, 2004. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act extended the compulsory copyright license, which was set to expire on December 31, 2004. Satellite subscribers faced losing access to distant network signals if the license was not extended. Copyright owners, represented by the MPAA, opposed the compulsory licenses, arguing for negotiation of royalties. Prices for cable and satellite licenses are set differently, with the satellite license price last set in 1997 at 27 cents per subscriber per year. Satellite companies objected to the significant price increase compared to cable companies. The SHVERA extended the distant network signal license for five more years, with differing opinions from stakeholders on royalty rates and license permanency. The MPAA advocated for increased rates, while the SBCA wanted a permanent license. The NAB preferred a five-year extension limited to areas without local-into-local service. The SHVERA extended the license for another five years, allowing parties to agree on royalty rates or use a CARP process. Subscribers must choose between local-into-local or distant network signals. Existing subscribers in white areas can continue to receive both signals, while new subscribers cannot receive distant signals once local-into-local is available. White areas are transitioning from analog to digital signals. The television industry is transitioning from analog to digital signals, with a focus on defining \"digital white areas\" for satellite companies to provide distant digital network signals to unserved households. The NAB disputes claims of broadcasters moving slowly on digital TV, leading to complex wording in the final version of SHVERA. Subscribers meeting certain conditions regarding analog or digital local-into-local service will be considered unserved for digital TV signals and receive distant digital signals. Satellite companies can retransmit local station signals back into the DMA from which it originated, as mandated by SHVIA. DMAs often cross state borders, allowing consumers in one state to receive programming from another state. SHVERA allows subscribers in certain states to receive additional network stations via satellite signals, based on DMA boundaries. Subscribers in New Hampshire can receive signals from the one network station licensed in the state, while subscribers in Vermont can receive signals from any network station licensed in the state. Subscribers in four Oregon counties can receive signals from any network station licensed in neighboring states. Counties in a neighboring state can receive signals from any network station licensed in Oregon. Subscribers in two adjacent Mississippi counties (Wilkinson and Amite) in a DMA primarily composed of counties in another state can receive network stations from the state capital (Jackson). SHVERA also allows satellite companies to retransmit out-of-market \"significantly viewed\" stations based on viewership thresholds. EchoStar's policy in some areas requires consumers to get a second satellite dish for all local programs due to different orbital satellites. EchoStar's policy in some areas requires consumers to get a second satellite dish for all local programs, which has been criticized as discriminatory by the NAB and others. However, EchoStar argues that there is no cost for the second dish, the channels all appear on the TV program guide, and no special steps must be taken by the consumer to access those programs once the second dish is installed. SHVERA requires satellite companies to offer all local channels on a single dish within 18 months of the law's enactment."
