    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Federal Aviation Administration Research, Engineering, and Development Act of 2002\". Authorization of appropriations is also included. The \"Federal Aviation Administration Research, Engineering, and Development Act of 2002\" authorizes specific amounts for fiscal years 2003 and 2004 to improve aviation safety, air traffic control efficiency, reduce environmental impact, and enhance mission support. For fiscal year 2005, $287,000,000 is allocated for various purposes including improving aviation safety, air traffic control efficiency, reducing environmental impact, and enhancing mission support. SEC. 3. COORDINATION OF NATIONAL AVIATION SAFETY AND SECURITY RESEARCH PROGRAMS. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Federal Aviation Administration, and Transportation Security Administration must develop and submit an updated integrated civil aviation research and development plan by June 30, 2003. This plan will outline the aviation research and development requirements, roles, and responsibilities of each agency. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Federal Aviation Administration, and Transportation Security Administration are required to develop an updated integrated civil aviation research and development plan by June 30, 2003. This plan will outline the research requirements and responsibilities of each agency, as well as steps to facilitate the transfer and adoption of new technologies in an operational environment. The Federal Aviation Administration will continue a research program to improve airfield pavements by awarding grants to nonprofit foundations. The goal is to enhance the design, construction, and repair of concrete and asphalt airfield pavements for increased safety and durability. The program does not take precedence over safety, security, or other aviation research programs. The Federal Aviation Administration will review and adjust standards for asphalt and concrete airfield pavements to meet the 20-year-life requirement. A report on the review and any adjustments made will be submitted to relevant committees within one year of the enactment of the Act. The House of Representatives Committees on Transportation and Infrastructure and Science will be involved in transportation matters. The House of Representatives Committees on Transportation and Infrastructure and Science will be involved in transportation matters. SEC. 6. AIR TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVE. The Federal Aviation Administration and National Aeronautics and Space Administration will work together on a national initiative to develop an air traffic management system focusing on security, safety, and capacity needs. The system aims to improve aviation services, utilize a system of systems approach, and create a common information network for all users. The Federal Aviation Administration and National Aeronautics and Space Administration will collaborate to develop an air traffic management system with a focus on security, safety, and capacity. The implementation will involve developing system performance requirements, determining an optimal operational concept, utilizing new tools for system performance validation, ensuring technology readiness, and creating a transition plan for implementation into the National Airspace System. SEC. 7. ASSESSMENT OF WAKE TURBULENCE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. The Federal Aviation Administration Administrator will collaborate with the National Research Council for an assessment of the FAA's proposed wake turbulence research and development program. The assessment will evaluate research goals, objectives, program effectiveness, schedule, and resource requirements, as well as the roles of other federal agencies like NASA and NOAA. The Federal Aviation Administration Administrator will collaborate with the National Research Council for an assessment of the wake turbulence research and development program. A report on the assessment results will be provided to relevant committees within a year of the enactment of this Act. $500,000 is authorized for the FAA Administrator for fiscal year 2003 for this purpose. The Federal Aviation Administration may conduct research to develop analytical tools for certification methods and reduce costs. They may also establish a research program on cabin air quality and conduct a review of airport delays at specific airports. Passed the Senate on November 18, 2002. Attest: JERI THOMSON, Secretary."
