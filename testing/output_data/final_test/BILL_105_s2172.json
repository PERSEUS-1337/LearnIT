    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Whale Conservation Fund Act of 1998\". It includes findings related to whale conservation. Congress finds that whale populations in US waters are valuable ecologically, scientifically, economically, and aesthetically. They are integral to marine ecosystems, support a lucrative whale watching industry, and hold cultural significance for Native Americans. Some whale populations are in the process of recovery, including the northern right whale. Some whale populations, like the northern right whale, are at risk of extinction due to various human activities such as ship traffic, fishing, oil exploration, pollution, and habitat changes. Conservation efforts face challenges related to international boundaries and the size of whales. The conservation of whales faces challenges such as low reproductive rates, offshore habitats, and the need for long-term conservation programs. The Secretary of Commerce has research and regulatory responsibility for whale conservation under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972. The heads of Federal agencies and the Marine Mammal Commission have related research and management activities under the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act. Insufficient funding is available for necessary whale conservation and recovery activities, prompting the need to facilitate the use of funds from non-Federal sources. The National Whale Conservation Fund is established to address the lack of funding for whale conservation and recovery activities, allowing for the use of funds from non-Federal sources. The National Fish and Wildlife Establishment Act is amended to allow the Foundation to establish a national whale conservation endowment fund for research, management, and educational programs supporting whale populations in the United States. The Foundation can accept gifts for this purpose and deposit funds into the endowment fund. The Foundation can raise funds for the national whale conservation endowment fund by entering into arrangements for design, copyright, production, marketing, or licensing of various items. The Secretary of Commerce may transfer civil penalties received under the Marine Mammal Protection Act to the Foundation for deposit in the endowment fund. The Foundation can receive funds for the national whale conservation endowment fund from civil penalties under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. The Directors of the Board ensure proper deposit of these amounts. Congress intends for the Foundation to prioritize funding projects that conserve endangered whale populations, such as the northern right whale. The Foundation prioritizes funding projects for endangered whale populations and consults with relevant agencies in carrying out actions funded by the national whale conservation endowment fund."
