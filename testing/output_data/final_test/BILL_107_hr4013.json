    "content": "The \"Rare Diseases Act of 2002\" may be cited as the official title of this Act. The \"Rare Diseases Act of 2002\" acknowledges that rare diseases affect small patient populations, typically less than 200,000 individuals in the US. Despite the urgent need for treatments, the prescription drug industry did not prioritize research or marketing for these diseases, leading to a lack of access to effective medicines for the 25,000,000 Americans suffering from over 6,000 rare diseases and disorders. The National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) was founded in the 1970s to advocate for patients with rare diseases. The Orphan Drug Act, passed in 1983, provided financial incentives for the development of orphan drugs, leading to the creation of over 220 new orphan drugs. Since the enactment of the Orphan Drug Act, over 220 new orphan drugs have been approved in the US, with 800 more in the research pipeline. Despite the Act's success, rare diseases need more focus in biomedical research. The National Institutes of Health received increased funding for research, but funding for rare diseases has not seen significant growth. To address this, the Department of Health needs to take action. The Department of Health and Human Services has proposed the establishment of regional centers of excellence for research on rare diseases to increase national investment in diagnostics and treatments. The NIH Office of Rare Diseases is established at the National Institutes of Health under Title IV of the Public Health Service Act. The Office of Rare Diseases is established within the NIH, headed by a Director appointed by the Director of NIH. The Director's duties include recommending research agendas and promoting coordination for rare diseases. The Director of the Office of Rare Diseases at NIH promotes coordination among research institutes, supports research on rare diseases, and encourages the establishment of a centralized information clearinghouse for rare and genetic diseases. The Director of the Office of Rare Diseases at NIH prepares reports on research and education activities for rare diseases, advises on projects to be conducted, and submits annual reports to Congress on rare disease research. The Director of the Office of Rare Diseases at NIH advises on projects, liaises with organizations, and defines rare diseases as affecting less than 200,000 people in the US. Authorization of appropriations is also specified. SEC. 4. Rare Disease Regional Centers of Excellence established under Title IV of the Public Health Service Act. The Director of the Office of Rare Diseases may enter into cooperative agreements and grants with public or private nonprofit entities to support regional centers of excellence for clinical research, training, and demonstration of methods for rare diseases. The agreements and grants must comply with policies set by the Director of NIH. The Director of the Office of Rare Diseases coordinates activities with other national research institutes and agencies related to rare diseases. Federal payments under cooperative agreements or grants can be used for staffing, operating costs, patient care, clinical training, and public information programs. The Director of the Office of Rare Diseases coordinates activities related to rare diseases with other national research institutes and agencies. Support for a center under subsection (a) may be for up to 5 years, with possible extensions for additional 5-year periods based on peer review recommendations. Authorization of appropriations is set at $20,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2003 to 2006. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
