The EFV program, intended to replace the AAV, was cancelled in 2011 after $3 billion in funding. The Marine Corps cancelled the EFV due to cost growth and poor performance, leading to the development of the Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV) to replace the AAV. The Marine Personnel Carrier (MPC) is also being developed as a mobile platform for Marines ashore, with a swim capability. The Marine Personnel Carrier (MPC) program was put on hold in 2013 due to budget constraints, with doubts raised about the need for both the ACV and MPC. The Marines require a personnel carrier with enhanced amphibious capabilities, different from the U.S. Army's requirements. Analysts question the necessity of the MPC in light of ongoing land conflicts and evolving anti-access technologies. The Department of the Navy and DOD studied the need for large-scale amphibious operations in response to doubts about the Marines' role in such operations. The study emphasized the importance of maintaining amphibious capabilities for global defense. Marine Corps leadership sees the ACV and MPC as essential for this capability, with Congress responsible for funding these programs. Congress plays a key role in overseeing and funding weapon systems programs, including the ACV for the Marines. Concerns include the ACV's ability to support both amphibious and onshore operations, the necessity of a strong amphibious assault capability for national security, and the cost implications. The current AAV used by the Marines since 1971 is becoming increasingly difficult to operate and maintain, with capabilities shortfalls in water and land mobility performance. The AAV has capabilities shortfalls in water and land mobility, lethality, protection, and network capability. The LAV-25 is an armored vehicle armed with a 25 mm chain gun and a 7.62 mm machine gun, but is not fully amphibious. The Marine Corps identified the need for a new Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV) to transport and protect infantry forces. The ACV must be able to self-deploy from amphibious shipping, carry a Marine infantry squad, and operate in various terrains. The Marine Corps requires a new Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV) with capabilities for sustained operations in different terrains. The vehicle should have speed, range, and protection similar to the M-1A1, accommodate nine marines and two crew members, and include a stabilized machine gun for engaging enemy infantry and light vehicles. The 2011 Request for Information outlined the operational requirements for the MPC, including a robust tactical swim capability and the ability to operate at 6 knots in the sea. The Marine Corps is in need of a new Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV) that can operate on land with M-1A1s, provide protection from various threats, fire anti-structure and anti-armor missiles, and accommodate existing command and control systems. The Navy is developing the Expeditionary Advance Base Operations (EABO) concept to address concerns about facing advanced adversaries in 2025. Expeditionary Advance Base Operations (EABO) is a naval concept focused on creating a resilient forward basing infrastructure to counter adversary long-range precision fires. EABs provide a dispersed and mobile alternative to traditional fixed forward bases, mitigating the threat posed by advanced adversary weaponry. Expeditionary Advance Bases (EABs) provide a resilient and mobile infrastructure for naval operations in challenging environments, supporting Joint Force Maritime Component Commander (JFMCC) and Fleet Commanders in sea control. EABO enhances situational awareness, fires, and logistical support for dispersed forces, leveraging joint capabilities for decisive operations. The EABO Concept enables US naval forces to exercise 21st Century naval operational art, meet new enemy A2AD threats with new capabilities, and operate in close and confined seas. Marine Corps amphibious assault operations could see a significant shift with the adoption of EABO, including the need for new weapon systems to counter long-range missile threats. Marines are exploring ways to create temporary \"bubbles\" for safe landings, and current weapons systems may need modifications to align with EABO operational concepts. In June 2013, the Marines paused the MPC program due to budget constraints and focused on the ACV and JLTV. In March 2014, they decided to revive the MPC as ACV Increment 1.1, acquiring 200 vehicles. Plans include developing ACV Increment 1.2, a tracked version, acquiring 470 vehicles, and studying high water speed capabilities. A connector will be needed for ship-to-shore transport. Plans for ACV Increment 1.1 include entering the acquisition cycle in FY2016, awarding prototype contracts in FY2018, and entering low-rate initial production. The Marines released an RFI for ACV Increment 1.1 with required capabilities such as operating in two feet wave height, high survivability, operating in four to six feet plunging surf, and integrating weapon stations. The Marines released a draft RFP for ACV Increment 1.1, seeking industry input on program milestones, delivery schedules, and cost savings opportunities. The RFI included a requirement for 16 prototype vehicles to be delivered nine months after contract award, with a cost estimate of $5-6 million per vehicle. Plans were for two companies to be involved in the project. The Marines released a draft RFP for ACV Increment 1.1, seeking industry input on program milestones, delivery schedules, and cost savings opportunities. Two companies were planned to build 16 prototype vehicles each for testing. Companies competing for the contracts included BAE Systems, General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS), Lockheed Martin, and Scientific Applications International Corporation (SAIC). The ACV 1.1 was envisioned as an eight-wheeled vehicle capable of carrying 10 Marines and a crew of 3, costing between $4 million to $7.5 million per copy. Mobility requirements included traveling 3 nautical miles from ship to shore, negotiating 2-foot waves, traveling at 5 to 6 knots in calm seas, and keeping up with the M-1 Abrams tank once ashore. Proposals were due in April 2016, with plans to award two EMD contracts for 16 vehicles each to be delivered in November 2016. The Marines planned to award two EMD contracts for 16 vehicles each to be delivered in November 2016. In 2018, they would down select to one vendor and start full production. The Marines aim to acquire 204 ACV 1.1s, allocated to different units. The Deputy Commandant testified that the Acquisition Objective for the ACV 1.1 remained at 204 vehicles, providing lift for two infantry battalions. Full Operational Capability (FOC) for ACV 1.1 is planned for. The Marine Corps awarded contracts to BAE Systems and SAIC to develop ACV 1.1 prototypes for evaluation. Each company is to build 16 prototypes, with plans to down select to a single vendor in 2018. Initial operational capability (IOC) is expected by the end of 2020, and all ACV 1.1 vehicles are planned to be fielded by summer 2023. Plans are to equip six battalions with ACV 1.1s and 392 existing upgraded AAVs. Both BAE and SAIC have a history with amphibious vehicles. ACV 1.1 is intended to have some amphibious capability but would rely on ship-to-shore connectors. BAE and SAIC are developing ACV 1.2 prototypes with improved amphibious capabilities. BAE's prototype can carry 13 Marines, travel 11.5 miles at 7 mph in water and 65 mph on land, with a V hull design for protection. SAIC's version can carry 11 Marines, travel 7 mph in water, and also has a V hull design. Both companies plan to produce their prototypes and incorporate blast-mitigating features. SAIC's ACV 1.1 prototype can accommodate 11 Marines and features a Common Remote Weapons System. GDLS protested the award of the ACV 1.1 contract to BAE and SAIC, but GAO denied the protest. The protest delayed the program by 45 days, but the Marines still anticipate fielding the ACV 1.1 on time. BAE and SAIC delivered their prototypes in December 2016 and February. BAE and SAIC delivered their ACV 1.1 prototypes in December 2016 and February 2017, respectively. Early delivery may lead to incentive fee awards. EMD testing started in March 2017 for an eight-month duration. The Marines sent down select RFPs in December 2017. Operational testing was planned for January 2018, with a contract winner expected to be announced in June 2018 for the delivery of 204 ACV 1.1s over four years. GAO submitted a report on the ACV program to Congress in April 2018, reviewing cost estimates, schedules, test results, and production readiness. The first version of the Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV 1.1) is meeting development cost goals with no major delays. The Marine Corps is advised to wait for specific Manufacturing Readiness Levels before entering production. DOD partially agrees with the recommendation. The Marine Corps selected BAE Systems to produce the ACV, with an initial contract valued at $198 million for 30 vehicles to be delivered by autumn 2019. Eventually, 204 vehicles will be delivered under the ACV 1.1 phase, with a total project expected to deliver 700 vehicles worth $1.2 billion. In December 2018, BAE Systems was awarded a $140 million contract modification to build 30 ACVs for Lot 2, with deliveries expected in summer 2020. In the December 2018 FY2018 Annual Report, the ACV-equipped unit demonstrated maneuverability in desert and littoral environments, including water mobility. Reliability data showed performance below the growth curve, with BAE vehicles at 24.9 hours MTBOMF. No major redesign is needed, and the ACV section succeeded in 15 of 16 missions. The ACV section successfully completed 15 out of 16 missions, showcasing its ability to navigate various terrains and operate effectively with tanks and light armored vehicles. Recommendations include modifying the infantry troop commander's station for easier movement, assessing recovery assets for the ACV, and exploring ways to prevent steering/suspension damage from battlefield debris. The successor to ACV 1.1, the ACV 1.2, is envisioned to have a ship-to-shore requirement of 12 miles. The ACV 1.2, successor to ACV 1.1, aims to achieve a ship-to-shore threshold of 12 miles to enhance naval vessel protection during Marine operations. Prototypes demonstrated satisfactory water mobility in high surf conditions, meeting ACV 1.2 capability requirements. The consolidation of increments one and two was approved for continuous ACV production to replace the AAV. The next milestone is the Full Rate Production decision in the third quarter. The ACV program is on track for Full Rate Production decision in the third quarter of FY 2020, with plans for an ACV 2.0 capable of high water speeds and land operations alongside tanks and light armored vehicles. This new variant is seen as a placeholder for future developments in marine operations. The FY2020 ACV budget request includes funding for ACV 1.1 Full Rate Production (FRP) Lot 3 of 56 vehicles, related items procurement, and research and development efforts for ACV 1.2 MRV test articles and Vehicle Protective System trade study. Marines did not request ACV Overseas Contingency operations (OCO) funding in FY2020. The consolidation of ACV 1.1 and ACV 1.2 variants could lead to cost savings and impact the timeline for replacing AAVs. It raises questions about acquiring additional ACVs and the effects on the ACV 2.0 program. Adoption of Expeditionary Advance Base Operations (EABO) by the Navy and Marine Corps may also influence the ACV program. The adoption of Expeditionary Advance Base Operations (EABO) by the Navy and Marine Corps could potentially impact the ACV program by requiring changes to vehicle features, affecting acquisition timelines and costs, and potentially modifying procurement quantities of ACVs."
