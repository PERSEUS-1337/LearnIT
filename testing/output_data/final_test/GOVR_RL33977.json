    "content": "The economy entered a recession in 2007, with some signs of growth but high unemployment. International migration typically decreases during economic crises, and the impact of the recent recession on immigration remains uncertain. Policy reforms are being debated amidst economic challenges, with employers still seeking skilled workers regardless of nationality. The debate over increasing employment-based immigration in the United States continues, with proponents arguing it is essential for economic growth while opponents fear negative impacts on salaries and working conditions for U.S. workers. Some suggest a moratorium on foreign worker visas, questioning the need for them during high unemployment. The Immigration and Nationality Act restricts admission for immigrants seeking skilled or unskilled labor without certification from the Secretary of Labor. The Secretary of Labor must certify that there are not enough U.S. workers available and that hiring the alien will not harm American workers' wages or working conditions. The Department of Labor oversees the foreign labor certification program to prevent displacement of U.S. workers. The Department of Labor oversees the foreign labor certification program to prevent displacement of U.S. workers. Many foreign nationals entering the U.S. for employment are not subject to a labor market test, but some temporary foreign employees are covered by labor market tests. The DOL adjudicates labor attestations for various temporary worker categories. Congress passed the Foran Act in 1885, prohibiting the importation of aliens for labor in the U.S. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 authorized visas for aliens with high educational attainment or specialized experience to work in the U.S. The act required certification from the Secretary of Labor to ensure no adverse effects on U.S. workers' wages and working conditions. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 established labor certification to protect U.S. workers' wages and working conditions. The 1965 reform required employers to file labor certification applications, which are now overseen by the Employment and Training Administration for aliens seeking legal permanent residency. Foreign labor certification is a national activity within ETA, and the INA conditions the admission of employment-based immigrants on labor market tests. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 established labor certification to protect U.S. workers' wages and working conditions. The law denies entry to aliens seeking to work without proper labor certification, covering aliens coming to live as LPRs. Any alien seeking to enter the U.S. for labor must have the Secretary of Labor certify that there are not enough qualified workers available and that their employment will not harm U.S. workers' wages and conditions. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 established labor certification to protect U.S. workers' wages and working conditions. It sets numerical limits and preference categories for immigrant admissions and adjustments for legal permanent resident (LPR) status. The law prioritizes admission based on family relationships, needed skills, and geographic diversity. The statutory worldwide level for LPRs is 675,000 annually, with categories for family-sponsored immigrants, employment-based preference immigrants, and diversity immigrants. Employment-based preference categories include priority workers with extraordinary abilities, professionals with advanced degrees, skilled workers, special immigrants like religious workers, and investors. Congress amended the INA in 1990 to raise the level of employment-based immigration. In 1990, Congress amended the INA to increase employment-based immigration levels. The law expanded preference categories and reduced the cap on unskilled workers. Currently, annual admission of employment-based preference immigrants is limited to 140,000. LPR admissions for employment-based preferences have exceeded ceilings in recent years. In FY2007 and FY2008, the number of employment-based LPRs in extraordinary and exceptional categories increased, especially among those with advanced degrees. Despite a decrease in FY2009, the first preference extraordinary category saw a slight rise. Processing delays in 2003 led to a significant reduction in the number of LPRs admitted. In FY2007 and FY2008, there was an increase in employment-based LPRs in extraordinary and exceptional categories, especially among those with advanced degrees. Processing delays in 2003 led to a significant reduction in the number of LPRs admitted. Additionally, extra 64,421 LPR visas were rolled over to the FY2004 employment-based categories, creating a spike. Employers petition with USCIS to hire immigrant workers, who must file an I-140 for the alien seeking to immigrate. USCIS adjudicators determine if the prospective LPR meets job qualifications and INA preference category. BIA decisions have impacted employment-based immigration law by clarifying statutory language, while USCIS is guided by BIA decisions and former INS Operations Instructions. Employment-based immigrants applying through the second and third preferences must obtain labor certification, listed in Schedule A or B. The employer must show extensive recruitment efforts if there is no labor shortage. Key elements are crucial for LCA approval. Efforts are required to obtain certification for labor-based immigrants in the second and third preferences. Key elements for LCA approval include the availability and qualification of U.S. workers, the impact on U.S. workers, prevailing wages, and recruitment processes. Before PERM regulations, employers filed ETA 750 forms with state Employment Service offices for Alien Employment Certification. SWAs processed LCAs and played a role in recruitment and wage data collection. Before the implementation of PERM regulations, employers had to file a permanent labor certification application with the SWA serving the area of intended employment. They were required to actively recruit U.S. workers for at least 30 days and report lawful job-related reasons for not hiring any referred qualified U.S. worker within 45 days. If the employer believes no qualified U.S. workers are available, the application is sent to an ETA processing center for review. If no qualified U.S. workers are found, a permanent labor certification is issued to the DHS and DOS. Before procedural reforms, there was a backlog of over 300,000 LCAs in 2003 with an average processing time of 3\u00bd years. The PERM regulations were published in December 2004 to streamline the labor certification process and reduce fraudulent filings. All LCAs for aliens becoming LPRs are now processed through PERM, with national processing centers in Chicago and Atlanta handling applications. SWAs no longer play a significant role in the LCA adjudication process, except for determining prevailing wages and maintaining job orders. PERM offers a 10-page attestation-based form that can be submitted electronically to further streamline the process. PERM streamlines the labor certification process with a 10-page attestation-based form that can be submitted electronically or by mail. Employers must register to receive a PIN and password, and recruitment requirements must be met before filing. Exceptions exist for certain recruitment requirements. The PERM process streamlines labor certification with a 10-page form for competitive recruitment of college teachers and Schedule A occupations. Audit letters may be requested by Certifying Officers, with specific requirements for professional occupations. DOL aims for 45-60 day adjudication with less discretion given due to regulatory reforms. The PERM process provides specific recruitment and documentary requirements, limiting COs' discretion in determining compliance. COs have three choices: certify, deny, or audit applications. There are 24 major nonimmigrant visa categories and over 70 specific types. Some visas are for employment-based temporary admission, with \"guest worker\" referring to temporary foreign workers in low-skilled jobs. Various temporary visas allow foreign nationals to work in the US. Foreign nationals employed in the United States do not require an LCA filing for certain visas. The H visa categories, such as H-1B for professional workers and H-1C for nurses, require an LCA. Temporary workers from Canada and Mexico enter on TN visas under NAFTA. Seasonal workers enter with H-2A or H-2B visas, with numerical restrictions on annual admissions for H-1B, H-1C, and H-2B visas. The H-1B, H-1C, and H-2B visas have numerical restrictions on annual admissions. Most H-1B workers are exempt from the ceiling. There is no limit on H-2A worker admissions. L visas are for intracompany transferees with executive, managerial, or specialized knowledge roles. The alien must meet job qualifications and have been employed by the firm for at least six months in the preceding three years. The E-class visas (E-1, E-2, E-3) are for treaty traders, investors, and Australian professionals respectively, requiring a treaty between the US and the foreign national's country. E-1 allows substantial trade, E-2 involves substantial capital investment, and E-3 is limited to Australian citizens. The E-3 visa is a temporary work visa for Australian citizens, usually issued for two years at a time. It mirrors the H-1B visa and requires employment in a specialty occupation. Other visa types include J visas for cultural exchange participants, Q visas for structured exchange programs, O visas for individuals with extraordinary abilities, and P visas for internationally recognized athletes or entertainers. The P visa is for internationally recognized artists, athletes, or entertainers with a lower standard of achievement than the O visa. It allows entry to the US temporarily for performing purposes, with individual athletes able to stay up to five years at a time. Aliens working in religious vocations enter on R visas. USCIS has proposed regulations to define \"religious denomination\" for religious groups or communities governed by ecclesiastical government. The denomination must share common beliefs, worship practices, doctrines, and have established places of worship. Temporary employment-based visas issuance increased over the past decade but dropped in FY2009. The category with the largest percentage increase from FY1994-FY2007 was H and NAFTA workers. The H and NAFTA workers category saw the largest percentage increase at 340.6%, followed by R visas at 216.7%, E and L visas at 144.3%, and O and P visas at 104.5% through FY2007. However, visas issued to H and NAFTA workers dropped by 33.4% from FY2007 to FY2009. E and L visas fell by 18.7%, and J and Q visas decreased by 8.1%. Only O and P visas remained steady, dipping by 1.7%. These statistics are from the Department of State Consular Affairs Bureau, reflecting labor market demand but not the actual number of temporary foreign workers in the U.S. The number of foreign temporary employment-based visa holders entering the United States increased from 1.3 million in FY1999 to 2.0 million in FY2009. The OIS admissions data show a significant rise in entries, with H-1 visa entries decreasing by 12.2% and H-2 visa entries increasing by 202.0%. The discrepancy between visa issuances and admissions numbers is due to multiple entry visas for multiple years. The OIS data shows that H, L, and E visas have higher percentages than Consular Affairs data due to longer validity periods. Professional and managerial visa holders exhibit circular migration patterns. OIS admission data do not reflect the actual number of foreign workers in the US. Employers must apply for labor certification before filing petitions to bring in foreign workers. LCAs are required for LPRs. Employers must apply for labor certification to bring in foreign workers under H, L, and E visas. The determinations for H workers are made by DOL's Employment and Training Administration on behalf of the Secretary of Labor. The INA requires employers to certify the lack of qualified U.S. workers and ensure that the employment of foreign workers will not harm U.S. workers' wages and working conditions. H-2A and H-2B LCAs include a job offer used in recruitment activities for both U.S. and foreign workers. Effective January 2009, prospective employers must engage in specified recruitment activities when filing the LCA for H visas, primarily for temporary workers in specialty occupations like H-1B nonimmigrants. These nonimmigrants must demonstrate the required education and work experience to USCIS, with DOL approving the labor attestation before the petition is processed. The H-1B visa allows for a maximum stay of six years, with the employer needing to submit an H-1B labor attestation form as the first step. This form includes attesting to paying the nonimmigrant the prevailing wages, providing suitable working conditions, and confirming no strike or lockout situations. The H-1B visa requires employers to provide a copy of the Labor Condition Application (LCA) to bargaining unit representatives or post it at the work site. H-1B dependent employers must meet additional labor market tests, attest to trying to recruit U.S. workers, offer comparable compensation packages to H-1B workers, and not displace U.S. workers. Employers recruiting H-1C nurses must also attest to significant efforts to recruit and retain U.S. registered nurses. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 requires companies receiving TARP funding to follow labor recruitment rules for hiring foreign workers on H-1B visas. The H-2A program allows temporary admission of foreign agricultural workers if U.S. workers are not available. The H-2A visa program allows temporary admission of foreign agricultural workers if U.S. workers are not available. Unlike other nonimmigrant visas, the H-2A visa is not subject to numerical restrictions and is valid for up to one year initially, with a maximum stay of three consecutive years. Employers must conduct an affirmative search for U.S. workers and ensure that admitting alien workers will not harm the wages and working conditions of U.S. workers. New regulations require employers to attest to full compliance with program requirements under the threat of penalties. Under new regulations, employers of H-2A workers may file petitions specifying only the number of positions sought. DOL published a Notice of Proposed Suspension of the H-2A Final Rule in March 2009. Employers were expected to comply with regulations effective January 17, 2009. In February 2010, a new H-2A final rule was published. The H-2A visa aims to protect workers from exploitive situations and prevent displacement of domestic workers by alien workers. Employers must provide benefits to their temporary agricultural workers. Employers must provide their H-2A workers with benefits including transportation, housing, necessary tools, and meals. The housing must meet federal standards and be inspected by DOL. The H-2A program requires employers to provide meals and facilities for workers, workers' compensation insurance, and exempt them from certain labor laws. The H-2B program allows temporary admission of foreign workers for non-agricultural work when U.S. workers are unavailable. The H-2B program allows temporary admission of foreign workers for non-agricultural work when U.S. workers are unavailable. An approved H-2B visa petition is generally valid for an initial period of up to 10 months, with an alien's total period of stay as an H-2B worker not exceeding three consecutive years. Regulations effective January 19, 2009, expanded the definition of temporary or seasonal jobs to last up to three years, allowing more sectors like construction firms and shipyards to utilize H-2B workers. Employers can file unnamed petitions specifying only the number of positions. Employers of H-2B workers may file petitions specifying the number of positions sought without identifying individual aliens. They must apply for certification from the DOL to show that U.S. workers are not available and that hiring alien workers won't harm U.S. workers. H-2B employers attest to trying to recruit U.S. workers at prevailing wages but are not subject to certain requirements like the AEWR and providing housing. Labor market tests and immigration-related protections are summarized in Table 1 for employers seeking foreign temporary workers. For H temporary workers, employers must meet wage and working condition requirements to ensure no adverse effects on U.S. workers. Enforcement of violations varies across visa categories, with responsibilities assigned to DHS, DOJ, and DOL. The Secretary of Labor certifies employment for LPRs to prevent negative impacts on wages and working conditions. The DOL Certifying Officer refers potentially fraudulent LCAs for employment-based LPRs to DHS or DOJ for investigation. DOL can revoke the LCA and debar an employer for violations. The WHD investigates H-1B labor attestation complaints and can assess back wages, civil penalties, and other remedies for violations. The WHD may conduct random investigations of employers found to have willfully violated the INA, with a DOL administrative law judge deciding cases if a hearing is requested. DHS has the authority to charge a fee for H-1B visa fraud detection. The Secretary of Labor can impose penalties to ensure employer compliance with employment terms. Funding is authorized for enforcement of LCAs for H-2A workers. The INA authorizes funding for DOL to enforce employment terms. The WHD enforces violations, while DHS handles H-2B labor certifications and fraud prevention fees. DHS can delegate penalty authority to DOL for H-2B violations like LCA non-compliance or misrepresentation. Recently, DHS delegated penalty authority to WHD for H-2B violations. The WHD has been delegated authority to impose penalties for H-2B violations, including non-compliance with LCAs. Funding for foreign labor certification has fluctuated over the years, with efforts to reduce backlogs and processing times. PERM's online filings have helped in reducing LCA processing times. PERM's online filings have reduced LCA processing times and Congress has increased funding for federal administration of LCAs to address workload and backlog issues. Congress has not authorized DOL to collect fees for processing LCAs, despite USCIS funding coming from fees for adjudication and naturalization services. The Clinton and George W. Bush Administrations sought authority to charge user fees for processing LCAs, but Congress did not approve. The President's FY2011 Budget proposes $65,648,000 for foreign labor certification, with $50,519,000 for federal administration and $15,129,000 for state grants. This is a decrease from previous years but still an increase from FY2008. The budget also seeks legislative authority to charge user fees for processing LCAs for certain foreign workers. The Department of Labor (DOL) deals with specific types of foreign workers on various visa types. The DOL budget justifications suggest that discretionary budget requests could be reduced or eliminated once fees are enacted. Limited data is available on funding for enforcing labor condition applications (LCAs) and investigating employers hiring temporary foreign workers. DOL receives a share of fees collected by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for visa fraud detection and prevention. The Department of Labor (DOL) receives a share of fees for visa fraud detection and prevention. DOL used a portion of these funds for investigating industries that employ low-wage foreign workers during the George W. Bush Administration. Congress did not revise the law to allow these funds to be used for investigations into low-skilled employment, leading to the rescinding of the funds. Detailed data on unexpended investigation fees for H-1B, H-2B, and L visas is not provided by DOL. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 110-161) includes a rescission of $102,000,000 in unobligated funds collected under the Immigration and Nationality Act. The Department of Labor proposed a higher rescission amount based on account receipts to ensure funds for fiscal year 2008. However, only $30,000,000 was rescinded in FY2008, with discrepancies addressed in the FY2009 appropriation. The Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 (H.R. 1105, P.L. 111-8) includes a rescission of $97,000,000 in unobligated funds collected under the Immigration and Nationality Act. The Department of Labor will still have enough funds for enforcement activities. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 (P.L. 111-117) addresses this issue by allowing the Department of Labor to use funds for wage and hour enforcement programs focusing on industries employing nonimmigrants. The INA authorizes funding for DOL to enforce LCAs for H-2A workers, but detailed funding data is not available. Concerns about multinational firms hiring foreign workers on H-1B and L visas at lower salaries have led to an additional fee for companies with over 50% of employees on these visas, which some argue is discriminatory. The Emergency Border Security Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2010 increases filing fees for L and H-1B visas for companies with over 50% of employees on these visas. The additional fees are in effect until September 30, 2014. The H-1B and L Visa Fraud Prevention and Detection Fee Account receives fees, while additional fees go to the Treasury's General Fund for border security funding. Criticisms of the foreign labor certification process include employer frustration with its responsiveness and concerns about safeguards for U.S. workers. Some argue that certain professional employees are similar to H-1B workers but face different requirements. Advocates argue that temporary foreign workers face long waits for visas, making them vulnerable to exploitation. The debate on the labor market test for foreign workers includes using economic indicators to determine which occupations can import foreign workers. Supporters of this approach believe it would prioritize the national economy over individual employer preferences. The debate over using economic indicators to regulate foreign worker admissions arose during the immigration reform debate in the 110th Congress. Proponents argue it would protect U.S. workers, while opponents fear it could lead to firms relocating or outsourcing. With the U.S. economy recovering, focus is on attracting the \"best and the brightest\" individuals to the country. The global competition for foreign workers with advanced degrees and high-level skills has expanded beyond H-1B visas to include revisions to permanent employment-based preferences. Some propose creating expedited pathways for foreign STEM students to become LPRs without a job offer. However, concerns have been raised about an oversupply of scientists and engineers graduating from U.S. universities. The effectiveness of current labor market tests for hiring foreign workers is being questioned in light of these competing perspectives on talent acquisition. Some advocate more flexible approaches to bringing foreign workers into the labor market based on national economic needs. Others argue that immigration laws are not the most decisive factors for talented migrants, as various factors contribute to the flows of highly skilled individuals seeking better pay, career advancement, and research opportunities. The United States offers better research funding, infrastructure, and opportunities to work with top scientists for mobile talent. Some argue that labor market tests for hiring foreign workers aim to prevent employer abuses rather than influence migration decisions. Critics suggest that current labor market tests are inflexible, burdensome, and may lead to litigation expenses for employers. They propose streamlining the process to speed up hiring foreign workers and reduce government involvement. Some argue for streamlining the attestation process to speed up hiring foreign workers and reduce government involvement, while others express concerns about the integrity of labor market tests for jobs that do not require a baccalaureate education and skilled work experience. Opponents of new regulations fear weakened protections for vulnerable workers in exploitative industries. Proponents argue that collective bargaining agreements can help develop labor market tests for foreign workers. They claim that some employers prefer foreign workers due to lower demands on wages and working conditions, potentially leading to a reliance on temporary foreign workers. Concerns have been raised about abuses of H-1B visas and the need for additional controls to protect U.S. workers. Critics warn that self-reporting by employers in the attestation process may lead to non-meritorious applications. The AFL-CIO and others criticize the current system for relying on self-reporting by employers in the attestation process, which they believe does not adequately protect U.S. workers. Concerns have been raised about Certifying Officers' lack of familiarity with local labor markets and centralized decision-making potentially harming American workers. The Department of Labor argues that COs have sufficient knowledge to administer the program effectively and will adjust the audit mechanism in the new system as needed. The Bush Administration retains authority to make changes to the audit mechanism. Many practitioners and observers argue that the PERM program is susceptible to fraudulent filings and abuse, calling for tighter controls and increased audits to ensure program integrity. The American Council of International Personnel (ACIP) has criticized PERM's audit and enforcement procedures, stating that they are not effective deterrents to fraud. GAO has also reported potential abuses in the H-1B petition process, recommending more controls. The GAO has recommended more controls to protect workers and prevent abuses in the H-1B visa process. A recent investigation found that 13% of H-1B files were fraudulent and 7% had technical violations. The DOL asserts that critics underestimate their ability to detect fraud but acknowledges it as a serious issue. They promise to aggressively pursue fraudulent applications. The Bush Administration considered cross-checking employer identification numbers to identify fraudulent applications for visas. Some practitioners argue that the PERM system fails to protect U.S. workers and only targets a small subset of employers. However, others believe that PERM's streamlining reforms enhance enforcement and program integrity, according to DOL Assistant Secretary Emily Stover DeRocco. Some practitioners express concerns about PERM regulations favoring large companies over small businesses due to lack of resources. DOL clarifies that certain types of aliens are ineligible, including small business investors. The Administration emphasizes that a small business investor is not an occupational category. The Department of Labor clarifies that small business investors are not eligible for labor certification. Foreign workers with unique skills may qualify under certain conditions. Stories have emerged of U.S. workers being replaced by foreign workers with fewer benefits, sometimes asked to train their replacements. H-1B dependent employers face additional requirements to deter subcontractors hiring H-1B workers. Some employers argue that expedient access to contingent workers, including foreign nationals with specialized skills, is crucial for staying competitive in the global marketplace. They are concerned that labor market tests for visas may limit firms' flexibility in hiring the necessary caliber of workers. Observers worry that intra-company transferees on L-1 visas should only be admitted after ensuring they are comparable to U.S. personnel. Some argue that L-1 visa holders should only be admitted if they do not negatively impact U.S. personnel, especially for mid-level managers and specialized workers. Critics believe that multinational corporations have an unfair advantage by bringing in lower-cost foreign employees. On the other hand, supporters of current laws say it is crucial for multinational firms to assign top personnel to U.S. facilities as needed, without delays from labor market tests. They warn that making it harder for these firms to do business in the U.S. could be counterproductive. The regulations for foreign workers entering the U.S. have remained largely unchanged since 1952. The immigration process into the United States has been governed by the same provisions since 1952, with some policy adjustments. The labor certification process costs employers $10,000 per immigrant. Current provisions are visa-specific with different standards for occupations and sectors. Critiques exist for recruiting foreign workers with specialized expertise and no skills. Legislation to reform the INA may update labor market tests, but consensus on this may hinder immigration reform."
