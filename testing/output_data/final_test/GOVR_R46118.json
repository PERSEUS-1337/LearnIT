    "content": "Post-disaster mitigation is debated among scholars, researchers, and policymakers for its effectiveness before or after an incident. The rationale for post-disaster mitigation includes targeting areas prone to recurring disasters, seizing the opportunity during reconstruction to implement mitigation measures, introducing structural changes during the recovery phase, supporting a \"build back better\" approach, and providing funding after an incident. Mitigation funding after an incident is easier to administer compared to pre-disaster projects, which require competitive scrutiny. Some argue that pre-disaster mitigation is more effective as it can address vulnerable areas not covered by post-disaster efforts and reduce recovery costs significantly. Mitigation funding can significantly reduce recovery costs. A study by the National Institute of Building Sciences found that for every $1 spent on mitigation grants by FEMA, there is a $6 return of avoided losses in the future. Congress passed P.L. 106-24 in 1999 to include a Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) pilot program, authorizing SBA to provide low-interest loans to small businesses for implementing mitigation measures. The SBA PDM pilot program was created to provide low-interest loans to small businesses for mitigation techniques in support of FEMA's formal mitigation program. The program aimed to prevent future damages to businesses by emphasizing disaster prevention over response and recovery activities. The House report on H.R. 818 highlighted the rising cost of disaster assistance and the importance of implementing a program to help small businesses mitigate damages from natural disasters. The Small Business Administration Administrator requested $934 million in disaster loans for anticipated damage and emphasized the effectiveness of mitigation efforts, with FEMA estimating a $2 saving for every $1 spent on mitigation. The Administrator expressed strong support for H.R. 818. The Small Business Administration (SBA) pilot program required a report to Congress on its effectiveness, including areas served, loans made, savings to the government, and other relevant information. Congress initially authorized $15 million annually for the program from FY2000 to FY2006, with extensions and additional funding. Since its expiration, there have been discussions about reauthorizing the program. Four loans were approved during the pilot program according to SBA. According to SBA, four loans were approved during the SBA PDM pilot program, totaling $101,400. Two loans defaulted, while the other two were repaid in full. A required report on the program's effectiveness was not found, and reasons for lack of participation are discussed. The limited participation in the SBA PDM pilot program may be due to its alignment with FEMA programs, which restricted the time frame and eligibility for PDM loans. Businesses may have been unaware of the availability of pre-disaster loans through the program. Delays in the implementation of FEMA's Project Impact also contributed to the low number of businesses obtaining SBA PDM loans. The PDM program rules were effective as of October 1, 1999, but communities couldn't apply as FEMA had not implemented Project Impact. The program was further delayed due to funding issues. Eventually, $25 million was provided to FEMA for the pre-disaster mitigation grant program, leading to a reevaluation and revamp of Project Impact. SBA revised rules for the PDM pilot program in response to FEMA comments before its implementation. The SBA PDM pilot program, which aimed to complement Project Impact for disaster mitigation, had eligibility criteria based on Project Impact community participation. This requirement limited the number of businesses eligible for PDM loans, as few communities participated in Project Impact. This may have unintentionally excluded businesses in non-Project Impact areas from accessing SBA PDM loans. The SBA PDM loan pilot program, which aimed to complement Project Impact for disaster mitigation, had eligibility criteria based on Project Impact community participation. Businesses in Project Impact communities not in a Special Flood Hazard Area were ineligible for SBA PDM loans for flood prevention measures. Project Impact was replaced by the Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) program in FY2002, integrating its concept into mitigation efforts. The PDM program does not designate participating communities; instead, state and local governments submit mitigation planning and project applications to FEMA for review. FEMA makes funding decisions based on priorities for effective use of grant funds and availability of funds. SBA PDM loan pilot program eligibility requirements were not changed to reflect the new FEMA PDM program. SBA coordinated with FEMA to inform potential applicants of the loan program through press releases and Federal Register notifications. The SBA PDM loan pilot program may need improvements in outreach and eligibility requirements if Congress decides to reauthorize it. One option could be to align the program with FEMA's Pre-Disaster Mitigation program or make it available to all small U.S. domestic businesses. Additionally, requiring SBA to allocate a portion of the loan appropriation money for outreach and advertising could help increase business participation.

One option could be to align the program with FEMA's Pre-Disaster Mitigation program or make it available to all small U.S. domestic businesses. Additionally, requiring SBA to allocate a portion of the loan appropriation money for outreach and advertising could help increase business participation. The SBA could also be required to provide information to Congress on their efforts to make businesses aware of the program and submit a report on the effectiveness of the pilot program. If Congress reauthorizes the SBA PDM pilot program, they could consider requiring SBA to provide relevant information for evaluation. Congress could tie the report to appropriations to signal intent for compliance. Committee reports accompanying bills are expected to influence agency behavior, although not legally binding. Post-disaster mitigation loans are limited to the lesser of the measure or 20% of verified loss. Research indicates that many businesses lack contingency or disaster recovery plans. A survey of CPA firms in Staten Island found that only 7% had a formal plan before Hurricane Sandy, with 42% admitting they never tested their plan. Over half of the firms had no plan at all. Only 7% of CPA firms in Staten Island had a formal contingency or disaster recovery plan before Hurricane Sandy. Many businesses lack such plans, with 60% considering them unnecessary and 20% finding them time-consuming to establish. Congress could incentivize businesses to create plans through programs like FEMA's Ready Business Program and SBA's resources for emergency preparedness. These programs offer toolkits to identify risks and develop recovery plans, helping businesses protect employees, reduce financial impact, and reopen quickly after disasters. SBA also provides disaster loans to businesses and homeowners, with roughly 80% of loans going to businesses. SBA provides disaster loans to homeowners in declared disaster areas, offering up to $200,000 for repairs. Mitigation assistance must be sought from other sources before a disaster. The RISE Act of 2015 allows for post-disaster mitigation measures. The RISE Act of 2015 allows homeowners to use disaster loans for safe rooms or storm shelters. Congress could expand the program to offer pre-disaster mitigation loans to homeowners, possibly contingent on homeowners insurance. The RISE Act of 2015 allows homeowners to use disaster loans for safe rooms or storm shelters. Congress could expand the program to offer pre-disaster mitigation loans contingent on homeowners insurance, to protect homes from future disasters and ensure adequate insurance coverage for repairs without additional federal assistance. If Congress reauthorizes the SBA PDM pilot program, policy options include decoupling the loan program from FEMA, enhancing advertising, restructuring loans for more mitigation use, and promoting business continuity plans. Businesses may be more open to pre-disaster mitigation loans due to recent large-scale disasters. Disaster issues were previously less prominent in business concerns, with disasters being more regional than national in scope. The focus of emergency management post-9/11 was on terrorism concerns, but recent disasters like hurricanes Katrina, Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Michael have shifted attention to the impact of climate change. Businesses are now more willing to consider pre-disaster mitigation loans to protect their investments. Project Impact P.L. 104-204 established a mitigation program to help communities reduce vulnerability to future disasters. The Project Impact P.L. 104-204 established a pre-disaster mitigation program to reduce vulnerability to future disasters. Up to $5,000,000 is available for pilot projects approved by FEMA. A needs-based analysis and cost/benefit study will be conducted before funding specific mitigation programs. Results will be used to develop a National Pre-disaster Mitigation Plan. The Project Impact P.L. 104-204 established a pre-disaster mitigation program to reduce vulnerability to future disasters. FEMA is directed to involve participants from various sectors in planning efforts. The remaining funds provided should not be obligated until the plan is completed. This approach aims to reduce human and financial costs associated with natural disasters. Project Impact serves as a model for mainstream emergency management and mitigation practices in every community. Project Impact P.L. 104-204 established a pre-disaster mitigation program to involve communities in identifying risks, establishing plans, and forming partnerships with stakeholders, including the business sector. Mitigation efforts require long-term investments and collaboration between government, business, and citizens to create Disaster Resistant Community Planning Committees. Project Impact Grants were used to fund planning and outreach activities, including logistics, staff support, training, travel, and information dissemination to support risk reduction actions identified by the Planning Committee. Project Impact provided $77 million in funding to communities from 1997 to 2001, increasing awareness and support for mitigation efforts. Nearly 250 communities participated in the program, receiving grants between $60,000 and. Project Impact communities received grants between $60,000 and $1,000,000, with states selecting recipients. Communities chose mitigation measures to fund, contributing 25% of costs. The program was eliminated in FY2002, rebranded as the Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) program. Governors suggested communities for PDM grants, with FEMA making final selections. FEMA had discretion for \"extraordinary\" cases. SBA announced the availability of pre-disaster mitigation loans in 2003 through the Federal Register and press releases. Businesses had to submit a Small Business Loan Application during a 30-day filing period, including confirmation of the project's location in a Project Impact community. FEMA had discretion to award grants in \"extraordinary circumstances.\" The SBA PDM pilot program offered businesses up to $50,000 per fiscal year for mitigation measures in Project Impact communities. Loans were provided on a first-come, first-served basis with a 4% interest rate. Loan requests could be reconsidered if denied. The SBA PDM pilot program offered businesses up to $50,000 per fiscal year for mitigation measures in Project Impact communities. Loans had a 4% interest rate with eligibility criteria tied to FEMA programs and financial need. Business had to be in a Project Impact community or Special Flood Hazard Area, lack financial resources for mitigation, be a small business, operate for at least one year, and use the loan for commercial building protection. Businesses were not eligible for the SBA PDM Loan Program if they were primarily engaged in political or lobbying activities, derived over one-third of their revenues from legal gambling, or had owners who were incarcerated, on parole, or on probation."
