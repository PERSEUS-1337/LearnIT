    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Emergency Contraception Education Act\" and includes findings. Congress finds that 3,000,000 pregnancies in the US are unintended each year, with half ending in abortion. The FDA deems emergency contraception safe and effective, reducing pregnancy risk by 89%. Common forms include birth control pills taken within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse. Emergency contraception prevents pregnancy by delaying ovulation, preventing fertilization, or implantation, without causing abortion. Emergency contraception is safe and effective, reducing the risk of unintended pregnancies by half. Despite its benefits, awareness and usage in the United States remain low. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends routine discussion of emergency contraception, but only 1 in 5 ob/gyns do so, highlighting the need for increased education for both providers and patients. The American Medical Association and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists support wider availability of emergency contraceptive pills without a prescription. Healthy People 2010 aims to increase the number of healthcare providers offering emergency contraception. Public awareness campaigns can help remove barriers to emergency contraception for American women. SEC. 3. EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION EDUCATION AND INFORMATION PROGRAMS. In this section, emergency contraception is defined as a drug or device used after sexual relations to prevent pregnancy. A health care provider is defined as an individual licensed to provide health care services. An institution of higher education has the same meaning as defined in the Higher Education Act of 1965. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is responsible for developing and disseminating information on emergency contraception. This information includes a description of emergency contraception and its use and safety. The dissemination can be done directly or through various organizations and agencies. The Secretary, in collaboration with health organizations, will provide information to healthcare providers on emergency contraception, including its use, safety, efficacy, and availability. This program aims to educate providers on recommending emergency contraception in appropriate cases and how to obtain more information. Authorization of Appropriations: $10,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2003 to 2007 to distribute information on emergency contraception to healthcare providers."
