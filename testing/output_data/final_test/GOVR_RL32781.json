    "content": "The report discusses the federal deductibility of state and local taxes, including the deduction of property taxes and income taxes. Congress extended the provision to include sales tax for the 2004 and 2005 tax years, and later made it permanent in 2016. Additionally, a special deduction of up to $500 ($1,000 for joint filers) for property taxes was available in 2008 and 2009 in response to the housing crisis. The special property tax deduction, unlike the sales tax deduction, was not extended beyond 2009. Taxpayers without high deductible expenses who did not itemize likely benefited from this provision. Those without mortgages in states with low tax burdens benefited the most. The above-the-line deduction for sales and excise taxes on new vehicle purchases also expired after 2009. The federal income deduction for state and local taxes paid dates back to the Revenue Act of 1913. The federal income deduction for state and local taxes paid dates back to the Revenue Act of 1913. State sales taxes were not introduced until 1932, and a deduction for those taxes for individuals was not explicitly stated in the tax code until the Revenue Act of 1942. Significant revision did not occur until 1964 with the enactment of the Revenue Act of 1964. Before 1964, a deduction was allowed for all state and local taxes paid or incurred within the taxable year except those explicitly excluded. After 1964, only taxes explicitly mentioned were deductible. The Revenue Act of 1964 introduced deductions for state and local taxes on property, income, general sales, and motor fuels. The act specified criteria for deductibility of general sales taxes, which was later repealed by the Tax Reform Act of 1986. TRA 1986 aimed to broaden the federal income tax base by eliminating the deduction for all state and local taxes except for ad valorem property taxes and income taxes. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 repealed the deduction for general sales taxes but kept deductions for ad valorem property taxes and income taxes. The decision was made because only general sales taxes were deductible, not selective sales taxes like tobacco and alcohol taxes, which caused economic inefficiencies. Additionally, the sales tax deduction was not allowed for taxes paid at the wholesale level, creating inequities. The deduction was also burdensome for taxpayers and the alternative sales tax deduction tables did not accurately reflect individual consumption patterns. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 reinstated deductible sales tax in lieu of income taxes, contrasting with the pre-TRA 1986 tax law. Concerns about altering tax structures in response to the elimination of sales tax deductibility did not arise. The sales tax deductibility provision was extended multiple times until the 2011 tax year. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 reinstated deductible sales tax in lieu of income taxes, contrasting with the pre-TRA 1986 tax law. The deduction of state and local taxes was extended through various acts until the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 permanently incorporated the deduction of state and local sales taxes into the tax code. Taxpayers may deduct state and local taxes paid from income by itemizing deductions. Individual taxpayers must itemize deductions on their income tax return to claim the deduction for state and local taxes paid. Business taxpayers can deduct state and local taxes as a cost of doing business. The federal tax savings from the deduction is based on the taxpayer's marginal tax rate multiplied by the deduction size. This deduction benefits higher-income taxpayers more, with 88% of the benefits going to individuals with incomes over $100,000. In 1986, the sales tax deduction was the most common itemized deduction for taxes paid, but it was repealed by TRA 1986. Before repeal, more taxpayers claimed a sales tax deduction as it was imposed by all but five states and not tied to property ownership. Currently, the sales tax deduction is less common as it is in lieu of income taxes. In 2014, 6.6% of taxpayers claimed a deduction for sales taxes paid, while the percentage of taxpayers claiming a deduction for income taxes dropped from 25.8% in 2006 to 21.8% in 2014. The percentage of itemizers has remained stable since 2003, likely due to lower tax rates and more generous standard deductions for married taxpayers filing jointly. The percentage of itemizers increased from 33.7% in 2003 to 35.0% in 2004, possibly due to the introduction of the sales tax deduction option. The decline in 2009 may be linked to the economic downturn. Taxpayers can deduct property taxes from taxable income, reducing taxes based on their marginal tax bracket. Higher-income individuals typically have higher tax brackets and home values. Higher-income taxpayers in higher tax brackets receive greater tax savings due to the progressive state income tax. A provision in the 110th Congress allowed non-itemizers to deduct property taxes up to $500 ($1,000 for joint filers). The deduction was available for 2008 and 2009. Approximately 25.1% of all tax returns claimed a real estate property tax deduction in 2014. In 2014, property taxes comprised 46.8% of all local government revenue and 1.2% of state government revenue. About 41% of the $466.4 billion in property taxes collected was deducted by individual taxpayers or businesses. In 2009, $11.3 billion in real estate taxes were claimed as deductions on non-itemized tax returns, along with $9.2 billion in personal property taxes like car taxes. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the federal tax expenditure due to these deductions. Table 2 shows tax expenditure estimates for state and local real estate property deductions from FY2016-FY2020, totaling $180.0 billion. Annual expenditure for itemizers rose from $31.2 billion in 2016 to $40.5 billion in 2018, reflecting economic changes. Eliminating the property tax deduction could lead to gradual reductions in housing consumption and tax bills. State and local governments might adjust tax rates if property tax revenue decreases. Local governments would be more affected by the repeal of property tax deductibility compared to state governments. High-income property owners in states with high property values would see the greatest increase in tax burden. State governments primarily rely on individual income taxes for revenue, collecting $311.5 billion in FY2014, while local governments collected $29.6 billion. The federal deduction for state and local income taxes is based on the taxpayer's individual tax rate multiplied by the amount paid. In the 2012 tax year, deductions claimed for state and local income taxes on federal income tax forms totaled $311.2 billion. The difference in amounts collected and claimed is due to taxpayers who did not itemize or were not required to file federal returns, mainly low-income individuals. Various acts extended the sales tax deduction option through different tax years, with the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 permanently extending the deduction. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113) permanently extended the deduction of state and local sales taxes in lieu of state and local income taxes. This deduction affects the distributional burden of both state and federal taxes by potentially increasing the progressivity of state taxes. The cost of the deduction for high-rate taxpayers is effectively shifted to all federal taxpayers, with states collecting a larger share of income taxes from high-income brackets being most effective at exporting their tax burden. However, the federal tax burden could be shifted to non-itemizing taxpayers, especially in states without an income tax. The sales tax deductibility provision was reinstated in 2004 and made permanent in 2016. Taxpayers could choose to deduct sales taxes instead of income taxes, with options to report actual amounts or use IRS-provided tables for estimates. Certain items like cars, boats, and homes were not included in the table amounts. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA, P.L. 111-5) included a special deduction for sales and excise taxes paid on new vehicle purchases through 2009. This deduction was available to taxpayers who did not claim a deduction for general sales taxes paid, allowing both non-itemizers and itemizers to benefit. The deduction was limited to the first $49,500 of the purchase price. The deduction for state and local sales taxes in lieu of income taxes is limited to the first $49,500 of the purchase price and phased out for taxpayers with adjusted gross income between $125,000 and $135,000. This provision diminishes the progressivity of the federal income tax system as it is only available to itemizers and takes the form of a deduction rather than a credit. Itemizers in states without an income tax benefited the most from this optional sales tax deduction. The deduction for state and local sales taxes in lieu of income taxes is limited to the first $49,500 of the purchase price and phased out for taxpayers with adjusted gross income between $125,000 and $135,000. Itemizers in states without an income tax could deduct proportionately more of their state and local taxes than taxpayers in states with both an income and sales tax. States without an income tax rely more on sales and property taxes than do states with an income tax, resulting in a higher reliance on sales and property taxes for total tax revenue. This unintended differential treatment of states based on income tax reliance benefits states without an income tax with the sales tax deduction option. In 2014, federal itemization rates varied across states, influenced by municipal taxes and income levels. 29.7% of U.S. taxpayers itemized deductions, with values ranging from 17.1% in West Virginia to 45.2% in Maryland. Deductions as a share of adjusted gross income (AGI) ranged from 30.2% in Alaska to 48.0% in Mississippi. President Obama's FY2016 budget proposed limiting the tax rate for itemized deductions, affecting the deduction value for state and local taxes for higher income individuals. The proposal would cap the deduction value at 28% of taxes paid, impacting taxpayers in the 33%, 35%, and 39.6% tax brackets. Eliminating deductibility would not change the distributional burden of state and local taxes if governments remain policy neutral. The federal tax burden will shift from low tax states to high tax states if the deduction for state and local taxes is eliminated. Taxpayers in high tax states like New York can deduct significantly more from federal income than those in low tax states like Delaware. This shift would occur unless federal tax rates are reduced to maintain revenue neutrality. The elimination of state and local tax deductibility would lead to lower federal tax rates, especially for high-income individuals. Estimates suggest a potential 50% reduction in individual income tax rates while remaining revenue neutral. This shift would make federal income taxes more progressive, with upper-income individuals experiencing a 2.9% decrease in after-tax income. Eliminating state and local tax deductions would mainly impact high-income individuals with lower federal tax rates. This could lead to reduced financing for projects benefiting wider communities, affecting low-income individuals more than high-income ones. The extent of state and local spending changes is challenging to quantify due to various influencing factors. Before sales tax deductibility was eliminated in 1987, research showed that state spending would decline, but by a small percentage. Some economists believe that state and local spending is significantly affected by deductibility. Additionally, there is evidence that state taxes became more progressive in response to changes in the federal tax structure in the 1980s. The reduction in federal tax rates from 70% in 1980 to 28% in 1988 decreased the value of state and local tax deductions. States lowered tax rates in response but did not fully reverse the increase in progressivity. Taxpayers can choose to itemize deductions or take a standard deduction, with recent proposals suggesting an expansion of the standard deduction. Expanding the standard deduction simplifies the tax code and increases the number of filers benefiting from it. This change would reduce revenues and increase budget deficits as taxpayers would switch to the standard deduction only if it lowers their tax liability. The debate on federal income tax treatment of state and local taxes may question if these tax expenditures are truly federal expenditures. The debate on federal income tax treatment of state and local taxes questions if these tax expenditures represent a return of taxpayer income that never belonged to the federal government. The ideal federal income tax would include all income sources to accurately measure an individual's ability to pay taxes, any exclusions or deductions would generate a tax \"expenditure\" or federal subsidy. The debate on federal income tax treatment of state and local taxes revolves around two views: one sees these taxes as payment for government services, while the other sees them as a loss of income. The issue of a tax-on-a-tax arises from this debate, with no clear consensus on the correct view. Some taxpayers benefit from specific services like trash collection, making the fee-for-specific-services view more accurate in certain cases. The debate on federal income tax treatment of state and local taxes revolves around two views: one sees these taxes as payment for government services, while the other sees them as a loss of income. The reduction-in-ability-to-pay view seems more reasonable for those paying general sales taxes for general government provision of public goods such as fire and police protection. Note that a federal deduction for sales taxes and not property taxes would theoretically seem more desirable."
