    "content": "The House and Senate approved a bill providing $120 billion in supplemental appropriations for FY2007, signed into law by the President on May 25, 2007. The bill includes political and security benchmarks for progress in Iraq, with most funding allocated to the Department of Defense for military operations, construction, and base realignment. Additionally, it provides funding for international affairs and domestic programs. The bill provides $14.5 billion for domestic programs, including hurricane relief, agricultural disaster assistance, veteran's health programs, homeland security measures, state children's health insurance program shortfalls, fire fighting, secure rural school, and other smaller programs. It does not include funds for pandemic flu preparedness or low income energy assistance. This is the second FY2007 supplemental appropriations bill sent to the President, following a previous bill that was vetoed. The President vetoed a bill on May 1, and the House failed to override the veto on May 2. Congress approved FY2007 supplemental funding for military operations without a timetable for withdrawal. H.R. 2206 establishes benchmarks for the Iraqi government and requires progress reports. A future vote is planned for a bill requiring withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq by June 30, 2008. The House Appropriations Committee plans to bring up a defense supplemental for FY2008 in September. The Administration requested $103 billion in supplemental appropriations for FY2007, including $93.4 billion for the Department of Defense and $6.0 billion for international affairs. Additionally, $3.4 billion was requested for FEMA Disaster Relief Fund for ongoing Katrina relief measures. Congress considered these funding proposals for FY2007 supplemental appropriations. The House Appropriations Committee plans to bring up a defense supplemental for FY2008 in September. The Administration requested $103 billion in supplemental appropriations for FY2007, including $93.4 billion for the Department of Defense and $6.0 billion for international affairs. Additionally, $3.4 billion was requested for FEMA Disaster Relief Fund for ongoing Katrina relief measures. Congress considered these funding proposals for FY2007 supplemental appropriations. The curr_chunk details the allocation of funds for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, counter-terrorism operations, equipment repair and replacement, war-fighting needs, and troop additions. It also includes funding for foreign operations, security and reconstruction assistance to Iraq, assistance to Afghanistan, activities in Sudan, and reconstruction efforts. The House Appropriations Committee plans to bring up a defense supplemental for FY2008 in September. The curr_chunk details the allocation of funds for humanitarian and peacekeeping support in Darfur, reconstruction and security assistance to Lebanon, assistance to Kosovo, avian flu prevention measures, migration and refugee assistance, Department of State and International Broadcasting programs, FEMA Disaster Relief Fund for Katrina recovery, and unobligated balance transfers. The House Appropriations Committee plans to bring up a defense supplemental for FY2008 in September. The allocation of funds includes humanitarian and peacekeeping support in Darfur, reconstruction and security assistance to Lebanon, assistance to Kosovo, avian flu prevention measures, migration and refugee assistance, Department of State and International Broadcasting programs, FEMA Disaster Relief Fund for Katrina recovery, and unobligated balance transfers. Congress considered various additions of funds for agricultural disaster relief, child health insurance, avian flu preparedness, homeland security, and other purposes in response to the Administration's FY2007 supplemental appropriations requests. The House and Senate approved two bills, H.R. 2206 and H.R. 2207, providing $123.3 billion in supplemental funding for military operations. H.R. 2206 required a Presidential report on progress in Iraq and congressional approval before releasing $52.8 billion. After revisions, the President signed H.R. 2206 into law on May 24. The President signed into law H.R. 2206 and H.R. 2207, providing $123.3 billion in supplemental funding for military operations. The House and Senate approved the bills, with H.R. 2206 requiring a Presidential report on progress in Iraq before releasing $52.8 billion. Congress considered various alternatives for the FY2007 supplemental appropriations bill before final enactment. The President vetoed a bill on April 25 that required troop redeployment from Iraq based on specific benchmarks. The bill allowed for redeployment within 180 days if benchmarks were not met by July 1, 2007. If benchmarks were met, redeployment would begin by October 1, 2007. The bill allows U.S. troops in Iraq for specific purposes like protecting citizens, diplomatic missions, counterterrorism, and training Iraqi forces. It includes military readiness standards and conditions on economic aid to Iraq. The final version of the bill expands on political benchmarks for aid and reconstruction. The conference agreement on the bill includes provisions such as prohibiting the closure of Walter Reed Army Medical Center until alternative facilities are available, increasing the minimum wage with offsetting tax cuts for small businesses, and providing $100.3 billion for the Department of Defense, with $95.5 billion for regular defense programs and $4.8 billion for other programs. The defense appropriations bill adds about $7 billion to the Administration request, with $4 billion in the regular bill and $3.1 billion in military construction. Major additions include funding for defense health programs, readiness reserve fund, National Guard, housing allowances, and Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles. The bill does not include a provision to reduce funding for payments to Iraq contractors or for Base Realignment and Closure Funds. The military construction funding includes $3.1 billion for Base Realignment and Closure, restoring funds deleted by Congress from the FY2007 continuing resolution. The Administration requested provisions to increase the Defense Department's transfer authority, with $4.5 billion for general transfers and $3.0 billion for special transfers in the Title IX bridge fund for war costs. The authority allowed shifts to other accounts of the amounts provided in Title IX. One requested provision would increase general transfer authority from $4.5 billion to $6 billion, an increase of $1.5 billion. A second requested provision would allow the Defense Department to transfer up $3.5 billion of the defense funds provided in the supplemental. The conference agreement does not provide the increase in general transfer authority but does allow transfer of $3.5 billion of the new defense money in the supplemental. The agreement also provides that amounts shifted to restore funds transferred to the \"Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Fund\" and to the \"Iraqi Security Forces Fund\" shall not count against general transfer authority. In effect, this increases general transfer authority by $1.625 billion\u2014$825 million for the JIEDDF transfer and $800 million for the ISFF transfer. The Defense Department may shift funds to the Army to avoid a slowdown in operations if certain provisions become law before the end of the fiscal year. The agreement includes $6.9 billion for Gulf Coast hurricane relief, with additional funding for FEMA, the Corps of Engineers, agricultural and fisheries relief, schools, and more. The bill includes $3.5 billion for agricultural disaster relief, $1.8 billion for veterans medical care, and $2.25 billion for homeland security. Key additions for veterans medical care include funds for medical services, VA health care administration, facilities maintenance, and minor construction. The bill allocates $2.25 billion for homeland security, including funds for customs and border protection, emergency planning grants, port security, rail and transit security grants, airport baggage screening technology, and air cargo security. It also provides funding for pandemic flu preparedness, state children's health insurance, fire fighting, secure rural schools, and low-income energy assistance. House appropriators proposed dividing funding for military operations and domestic programs into two pieces after the President's veto. The House approved two bills, H.R. 2206 and H.R. 2207, providing $123.3 billion in supplemental appropriations for FY2007. H.R. 2206 allocated $103.3 billion for the Department of Defense, $6.2 billion for international affairs, and $10.5 billion for non-defense programs. H.R. 2207 provided $4.5 billion for domestic programs, including $3.5 billion for agricultural disaster relief. Key elements of H.R. 2206 included $42.8 billion for U.S. military operations abroad and $52.8 billion for U.S. military operations. The House approved $123.3 billion in supplemental appropriations for FY2007, including $52.8 billion for U.S. military operations, $6.2 billion for international affairs, $6.8 billion for Gulf State hurricane relief, and funding for various other programs such as veterans medical care, homeland security, pandemic flu preparedness, and low-income energy assistance. The House approved $123.3 billion in supplemental appropriations for FY2007, including funding for U.S. military operations, international affairs, Gulf State hurricane relief, veterans medical care, homeland security, pandemic flu preparedness, and low-income energy assistance. H.R. 2207 included $3.5 billion for agricultural disaster relief, $500 million for wildfire suppression, $325 million for the secure rural schools program, and $60 million for Pacific salmon protection. The bills were based on H.R. 1591 but faced a veto threat from the President if funding for operations abroad was divided. The House and Senate approved a revised version of H.R. 2206, providing $120.0 billion in FY2007 supplemental appropriations. The bill includes $99.5 billion for the Department of Defense, with $6.0 billion more than the Administration requested. The final version was signed into law on May 24. The revised version of H.R. 2206, providing $120.0 billion in FY2007 supplemental appropriations, was approved by Congress. The bill includes $99.5 billion for the Department of Defense, with additional funding for various programs such as international affairs, Gulf Coast hurricane relief, veterans health programs, homeland security, and agricultural disaster assistance. The total amount in the final bill is less than initially provided in the first supplemental bill. The final supplemental bill for FY2007 provides $393 million for the State Children's Health Insurance Program, $465 million for fire fighting, and $425 million for the secure rural schools program. It excludes funding for pandemic flu preparedness and low income energy assistance. The bill also includes a provision for increasing the minimum wage and tax cuts for small businesses. There are no provisions for establishing timetables for withdrawal from Iraq, but a measure for withdrawal of most U.S. troops by June 30, 2008, will be voted on. The final supplemental bill for FY2007 includes funding for various programs such as the State Children's Health Insurance Program, fire fighting, and the secure rural schools program. It also includes provisions for increasing the minimum wage and tax cuts for small businesses. The bill does not establish timetables for withdrawal from Iraq but a measure for withdrawal of most U.S. troops by June 30, 2008, will be voted on. The bill sets 18 benchmarks for performance by the Iraqi government and prohibits the release of Economic Support Funds until these benchmarks are achieved. The total amount of funding is $1.6 billion. The House inserted requirements for deployed forces in H.R. 1591, providing $3.5 billion for Defense Department fund transfers and increasing transfer authority by $1.6 billion for FY2007 defense appropriations. This helps address issues with limited transfer authority used to restore funds from Air Force and Navy personnel accounts. The final version of the H.R. 2206 establishes 18 benchmarks for performance by the Iraqi government, including forming a Constitutional Review Committee, enacting legislation on de-Baathification, and ensuring equitable distribution of hydrocarbon resources. The Iraqi government is required to enact and implement legislation on various issues, including forming semi-autonomous regions, establishing an Independent High Electoral Commission, addressing amnesty, and disarming militias accountable only to the central government. Additionally, supporting committees are to be established to aid the Baghdad Security Plan, and Iraqi brigades are to be provided for Baghdad operations. Iraqi commanders are given authority to execute the plan in consultation with the U.S. The curr_chunk focuses on executing the Baghdad security plan, reducing sectarian violence, establishing joint security stations, increasing independent Iraqi security forces units, protecting minority political parties, and allocating $10 billion in Iraqi revenues. The Iraqi government must meet specific benchmarks to receive reconstruction assistance, including protecting minority political parties and allocating $10 billion for projects. Reports to Congress are required to assess progress towards these benchmarks by July and September 2007. The FY2007 supplemental appropriations bill requires specific officials to testify to Congress on progress towards benchmarks in Iraq by September 15. Congress has used its power of the purse to set conditions on military operations in the past. The FY2007 supplemental appropriations bill sets conditions on military operations in Iraq, including timetables for withdrawing U.S. forces. The House version of H.R. 1591 includes three alternative withdrawal timetables and requires the President to certify Iraq's progress by July 1, 2007. The FY2007 supplemental appropriations bill sets conditions on military operations in Iraq, including timetables for withdrawing U.S. forces. The bill required the President to certify Iraq's progress towards security and political benchmarks by specific dates, with deadlines for withdrawal if certifications were not made. It also established requirements for unit readiness and time between deployments. The Senate-passed version included a timetable for withdrawing forces within 120 days of enactment. The FY2007 supplemental appropriations bill sets conditions on military operations in Iraq, including timetables for withdrawing U.S. forces. The bill required the President to certify Iraq's progress towards security and political benchmarks by specific dates, with deadlines for withdrawal if certifications were not made. It also established requirements for unit readiness and time between deployments. The Senate-passed version included a timetable for withdrawing forces within 120 days of enactment, with a goal of completing the redeployment within 180 days. The FY2007 supplemental appropriations bill set conditions on military operations in Iraq, including timetables for withdrawing U.S. forces. The bill required the President to certify Iraq's progress towards benchmarks by specific dates, with deadlines for withdrawal if certifications were not made. Congress considered ways to assert control over Iraq policy without facing a veto. The House leadership divided funds for military operations to address these goals. The House leadership divided funds for military operations into two parts in the FY2007 supplemental appropriations bill. The initial version of H.R. 2206 allocated $42.8 billion for immediate use without conditions. It also required the President to report on Iraq's progress towards specific benchmarks by July 13. The FY2007 supplemental appropriations bill allocated $10 billion for Iraqi reconstruction and $52.8 billion for military operations. The bill required a report on Iraq's progress towards benchmarks and a joint resolution of approval from Congress to release the military funds. The Administration objected to this approach, stating it would hinder military planning. Congressional leaders supported including benchmarks for the Iraqi government's performance, but the key issue was how to enforce progress towards these benchmarks. Senator Warner proposed an Iraq policy amendment to the Water Resources Development Act, linking reconstruction assistance to Iraq to the achievement of benchmarks similar to those in H.R. 2206. The Senate voted on the amendment, which failed to close debate due to lack of votes. Congress ultimately approved a proposal with benchmarks similar to those in the Warner amendment, tying economic assistance to Iraq's progress. The final version of H.R. 2206 establishes 18 benchmarks for Iraq's reconstruction. The final version of H.R. 2206, passed by the House and Senate on May 24, sets 18 benchmarks for Iraqi government performance. $1.6 billion in economic aid to Iraq is contingent on meeting these benchmarks. The President must report Iraq's progress to Congress in July and September. Independent assessments by the Government Accountability Office and a Defense Department group are also required. The Army and DOD officials warned of potential disruptive changes in Army operations if Congress did not approve supplemental funding by April. In early April, DOD requested and received approval to transfer $1.6 billion from military personnel funds to the Army to address the shortfall in war monies. The Army adopted measures to slow down spending on non-war-related activities and utilize various tools to temporarily finance war-related operations until the end of June without supplemental funding. This includes tapping bridge funds, transferring funds from other areas, using baseline program funds, slowing down O&M spending, and invoking the Feed and Forage Act if necessary. The duration of this temporary financing depends on the availability of funds from different sources. The Department of Defense (DOD) urged Congress to pass a supplemental funding bill to prevent the Army from slowing down spending on operations. Congress allocated $53.5 billion for Army Operations and Maintenance (O&M) in FY2007, with an additional $1.6 billion transferred to meet O&M obligations, bringing the total available funds to $55.1 billion. Transfer authority allows flexibility to move funds between programs for unforeseen military requirements. The Army had $55.1 billion available for O&M obligations in FY2007. By slowing obligations to $5.4 billion a month, they could cover expenses through June 2007 with $16.1 billion remaining. DOD requested a $1.4 billion transfer for July, which became unnecessary with the passage of a supplemental bill on May 25, 2007. Congress had provided $7.5 billion in transfer authority for FY2007, with $3.1 billion approved so far, including $1.6 billion for the Army. The Army had $55.1 billion available for O&M obligations in FY2007, with $16.1 billion remaining by June 2007. DOD tapped military personnel funds from the Navy and Air Force for an earlier transfer. Congress restored $1.4 billion in reprogramming authority in the FY2007 Supplemental to offset DOD concerns about financing war costs. In FY2007, Congress allocated an additional $3.5 billion for DOD's funds in the supplemental. Delays in passing the supplemental caused concerns about training and deployment of Army units in Iraq. President Bush and Army officials warned of disruptions if funding was delayed beyond April 15. Without approval of supplemental funds in April, the Army will need to take drastic measures affecting readiness and causing hardships for soldiers and families. The Service Chiefs and Secretary of Defense outlined steps to limit activities, with restrictions excluding those impacting war operations, readiness standards, equipment reset, or safety. Restrictions imposed by the Army included postponing non-essential travel, training, and conferences, suspending shipments not related to deployed forces, limiting government purchase card use to essential items, freezing civilian hiring except for specific roles, delaying contracts for facility repairs and upgrades unless cost or safety concerns arise, and deferring equipment repairs for overseas deployment unless necessary. The Army imposed restrictions on non-essential activities like travel, training, and conferences, as well as delaying repairs and supplies for overseas deployment. These measures focused on saving costs for state-side facilities and units not scheduled to deploy, without significantly impacting unit readiness. The Army tapped into current inventory to re-order supplies, anticipating higher orders in later months. Savings from civilian hiring freeze and travel restrictions were not expected to be significant. The Army also considered potential savings from cancelling training exercises and delaying shipments to bases, but with the passage of the supplemental, a further slowdown is no longer necessary. Secretary of Defense Gates mentioned that with maximum effort, the war could be funded until July, but it would disrupt department programs at home. The Defense Department considered invoking the Feed and Forage Act to sustain troops abroad, with $14.2 billion in funding provided by the final supplemental appropriations bill, including $3.6 billion for hurricane relief. The final supplemental appropriations bill provided $14.2 billion in funding, including $3.6 billion for hurricane relief. The bill reduced funding for various programs compared to Congress' initial bill, including cutting funds for pandemic flu preparedness, low-income energy assistance, homeland security, and agricultural relief. In recent years, defense appropriations exempted from budget caps have increased significantly, reaching $163 billion approved or requested in FY2007. This reflects a progressive expansion of equipment and operational support considered urgent for inclusion in emergency funding measures. The Defense Department requested a large increase in weapons procurement in the FY2007 supplemental funding, including funds for new systems like the F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. The House Appropriations Committee eliminated funding for these programs, questioning their immediate war-related necessity. The FY2008 budget request for international affairs funding faced scrutiny for requesting emergency supplemental funds for foreign affairs expenditures that were not unplanned or unexpected. Senator Biden criticized the ongoing practice, questioning the emergency designation for spending in Afghanistan and Iraq. Despite concerns, Congress continued to designate both defense and non-defense spending as emergency funding in legislative agreements. In FY2008, Congress designated defense and non-defense spending as emergency funding, leading to ongoing debates over what should be considered emergency spending versus part of agency base budgets. The Administration objected to using \"emergency\" defense supplementals to avoid cuts in non-defense programs. In recent years, defense supplementals have been used to shift funding from the base defense budget to avoid cuts in non-defense programs. This practice has allowed for more funding under discretionary spending caps for both defense and non-defense programs. For example, in FY2007, $3.1 billion was cut from the Administration's defense request for Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), freeing up an equivalent amount for non-defense appropriations. Some argue that Congress may need to set more effective limits on this practice in the future. Congress may need to set more effective limits on emergency spending to restore budget discipline. Reports of poor conditions in housing and medical care for wounded veterans led to additional funding for defense and veterans health programs. The final enacted version of H.R. 2206 added $1.8 billion for defense health and $1.8 billion for veterans health. Additional measures were taken to improve healthcare services for veterans. The defense supplemental request did not cover all identified military programs. The military services submitted an \"Unfunded Priorities List\" (UPL) of programs not funded in the FY2008 request. The Army's UPL included $2.2 billion for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles. Congress addressed readiness and cost issues in the supplemental. The conference agreement on the initial, vetoed supplemental bill, H.R. 1591, added funding for defense readiness reserve fund, housing allowances, and Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles. The final, enacted version of H.R. 2206 added more funding for readiness reserve fund and MRAP vehicles. The scandal over deteriorating facilities at Walter Reed Army Medical Center reignited debate over its closure in the 2005 BRAC process. The 2005 BRAC process aimed to close Walter Reed Army Medical Center, but House appropriators included a measure in H.R. 1591 to prevent its closure. This sparked a debate led by Senator Warner, as reversing the decision for one facility could impact the entire BRAC process. The Senate Appropriations Committee later included a measure to keep Walter Reed open temporarily. The House and Senate approved H.R. 2206 on May 24, 2007, providing $99.4 billion in additional funding for the Department of Defense for war operations since 9/11. Total supplemental funding for FY2007 is $169.3 billion, 40% higher than the previous year. The FY2007 funding level for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan is significantly higher than previous years, reaching a total of about $611 billion since the 9/11 attacks. The FY2008 request for war funds is $141.7 billion, bringing the total to about $753 billion if approved. The FY2007 supplemental funding includes $3 billion above the administration's request, with $2 billion for war-related expenses and $1 billion for non-war costs. The FY2007 Supplemental funding includes $4 billion for non-war costs, such as base closures and healthcare programs. Congress supported the administration's funding request, providing a total of $169.3 billion for DOD, including $74 billion for military personnel and operational costs for OIF and OEF. The FY2007 Supplemental funding includes a \"surge\" of 36,000 troops announced by the president in January, $900 million for Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) research, doubling annual procurement costs to $45.0 billion, $3 billion for Mine Resistant Ambush Program (MRAP), $3.6 billion to convert Army and Marine Corps units, and $12.9 billion for equipment. The FY2007 supplemental funding includes a permanent increase in the size of the Army and Marine Corps, $12.9 billion for Afghan and Iraqi security forces, $1.4 billion for coalition support funds, $1 billion for small-scale reconstruction projects, $1.1 billion for military construction projects, increased funding for countering IEDs by 30%, and $4.0 billion in non-war related funding. The Administration's request for the FY2007 Supplemental included funds for support forces for the president's surge of combat troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as $3.1 billion for base closures that Congress did not approve. Congress rejected the proposal to cut domestic programs to finance these base closure costs. Additionally, the Administration requested funds and authority for DOD to start up factories in Iraq and assist the Iraqi government with disarmament efforts. The FY2007 Supplemental request included funds for DOD to start up factories in Iraq, assist Iraqi government with disarmament, and support Provincial Reconstruction Teams. Congress reduced funding levels and added $1.6 billion for defense health programs. Congress added $1.6 billion for defense health programs, including $900 million for Traumatic Brain Injury and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder treatment. DOD was required to inspect and report on conditions at all medical facilities. Congress provided $3.1 billion for base closure costs but rejected using domestic program cuts to finance them. The FY2007 Supplemental was passed in two bills, with the second eventually enacted on May 24, 2007, totaling $100.4 billion for national defense. In the first version of H.R. 2206, the total amount provided for national defense was $100.4 billion, $3.0 billion above the Administration's request. This included funding for MRAP vehicles and a Strategic Reserve Readiness Fund. H.R. 1591 was passed by both houses but vetoed by the president due to Iraq withdrawal provisions. H.R. 2206 split the funding into two tranches, with $47.6 billion available immediately and $53.2 billion available after a report on Iraq's progress. The Senate passed a placeholder bill on May 17, 2007, to provide funds for the military needs. The House voted on amendments to remove controversial Iraq provisions on May 24, 2007. The final bill, H.R. 2206, included $99.7 billion for national defense, with $99.4 billion for the Department of Defense. Total funding was part of negotiations with the Administration. The final bill, H.R. 2206, included $700 million less funding for the Department of Defense compared to H.R. 1591. The House passed two separate amendments covering Congressional adds and war funds, with the Senate later passing the bill by 80 to 14. The first amendment provided $10.8 billion for DOD, including funds for traumatic brain injury research, MRAP vehicles, and a new Strategic Readiness Reserve Fund. The House passed two separate amendments for the Department of Defense funding, including $1.6 billion for a new Strategic Readiness Reserve Fund, $3.1 billion for military construction, and $1.1 billion for additional military personnel. The second amendment provided $88.5 billion for war costs, including funds for military personnel, operation and maintenance, defense health, procurement, training Afghan and Iraq Security Forces, and research and development. The FY2007 Supplemental included funds for the Device Defeat Fund, Research & Development, military construction overseas, and support for Army and Marine Corps. Congress debated the effectiveness of the Administration's policy in Iraq and approved most of DOD's funding request with added oversight mechanisms. Congress also endorsed initiatives to address stress from frequent deployments of Army and Marine Corps units. Congress endorsed initiatives to address stress from frequent deployments of Army and Marine Corps units by accelerating unit conversions and increasing troop size. Additional funds were allocated for defense health, a new Strategic Readiness Reserve Fund, and the Mine Resistant Ambush Program. Congress also added oversight mechanisms to DOD's funding requests. Congress provided funding for military personnel, operations, and additional troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, including increasing troop levels by 21,500 combat troops in Iraq and deploying more troops in Afghanistan. The CBO estimated that the troop increase in Iraq could cost $9-13 billion, higher than the DOD's $6 billion proposal. This included funding for 15,000-28,000 support troops. General Petraeus acknowledged the need for additional support troops in Iraq. General Petraeus acknowledged the need for more support troops in Iraq, with the possibility of sustaining higher troop levels beyond the summer. Secretary of Defense Gates extended Army tours in Iraq to 15 months, allowing for the deployment of 20 brigades for 12 to 24 months. The administration's FY2008 war costs request may be inadequate if troop levels remain high, leading to a halved request for an additional carrier strike group deployment. The Navy underfunded its normal steaming hours request and requested the hours in an emergency supplemental, which was reversed by Congress. This cost shifting may be inconsistent with DOD financial regulations. DOD funded the ongoing deployment of additional troops using currently available funds before the supplemental was passed. The president can tap DOD funds for military operations. In response to health issues, Congress added $900 million for treatment and research on Traumatic Brain Injury and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder in the FY2007 supplemental. H.R. 2206 / P.L. 110-28 provides $3.0 billion for Defense Health, almost $2 billion above the Administration's request, with $1 billion of the increase being war-related. In response to health issues, Congress allocated additional funding in the FY2007 supplemental bill, including $600 million for treatment and $300 million for research on Traumatic Brain Injury and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. They also provided funding for burn, orthopedic, and trauma care, a care givers support program, and the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center. Additionally, Congress restored cuts in last year's regular bill and included efficiency cuts from the DOD budget. H.R. 2206 requires DOD to inspect and report on military medical facilities and housing for holdover personnel within 180 days. A new provision allows service members to designate individuals to receive a portion of their death gratuity, with the remainder going to their spouse, child, or siblings. This provision may impact the amount received by children of the deceased member. The FY2007 supplemental provides additional funds for training and equipping Afghan and Iraqi security forces. Concerns about the competency of Iraqi Security forces were raised, but the full amount requested was provided. The provision allowing service members to designate individuals to receive a portion of their death gratuity may impact the amount received by children. The issue of protecting the income of minors was addressed in the 1939 \"Coogan law.\" DOD is unlikely to develop regulations to implement this provision before September 2007. Annual appropriations for training and equipping Afghan forces are set to increase. Annual appropriations for training and equipping Afghan and Iraqi security forces have significantly increased, with a total of $30.2 billion allocated for these purposes. The funds provided in the FY2007 supplemental budget will amount to $7.5 billion for the Iraq Security Forces Fund and $6.1 billion for the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund over the next 18 months. This marks a substantial increase from the previous year's allocations. In FY2006, $5.1 billion was allocated for Iraq and $1.8 billion for Afghanistan. The funds were used to train Iraqi security forces and Afghan army and police forces. An additional $5.9 billion for Afghanistan aimed to increase the number of trained personnel to 152,000. For Iraq, an extra $3.8 billion was designated to enhance logistical and Air Force capabilities. Up to $155.5 million could be used for disarmament and reintegration of militias with the Secretary of State's approval. The effectiveness of Iraqi Security Forces is crucial for meeting U.S. progress benchmarks in Iraq. The report on benchmarks due July 15, 2007, will assess the Iraqi Security Forces' capability to provide security within the next 12 to 18 months. Congress also requires reports on individual Iraqi unit readiness, project details, and cost estimates for training Iraqi and Afghan security forces. Between FY2002 and FY2007, the Army and Marine Corps received $50.2 billion for equipment repair and replacement. An additional $14 billion was approved in FY2007, bringing total reset funds to around $64 billion. This amount fully met DOD's reset requirements for FY2007 and covered previously unfunded FY2006 requirements. Army and Marine Corps reset requirements were fully-funded as of the FY2007 Bridge Fund. The Army and Marine Corps reset requirements were fully-funded, with the DOD's FY2007 Supplemental request front-loading some of the reset costs. This front-loading reflects concerns about equipment replacement needed even after a drawdown in troop levels. Additionally, the FY2008 Global War on Terror request includes an additional $37.6 billion for reconstitution, similar to the FY2007 level. The DOD's FY2008 Global War on Terror request includes $37.6 billion for reconstitution, covering more than one year and allowing for equipment replacement for operations beyond Iraq and Afghanistan. Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon England issued new guidelines for services to include costs related to the longer war on terror, leading to a 40% increase in war funding between FY2006 and FY2007. The 40% increase in war funding between F2006 and FY2007 is attributed to new guidance from DOD Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon England, allowing for costs related to the longer war on terror. Despite strict financial regulations, some items included in the funding did not meet necessary criteria, leading to Congressional cuts in certain areas like depot maintenance and procurement. DOD's reset requests now include funds for war losses and future equipment replacement. DOD projects equipment replacement for wear and tear, upgrades, and recapitalization. Congress questions replacing out-of-production items with new ones. DOD regulations caution against accelerating procurement without approval. The FY2007 Supplemental request for defense funding included funds for various aircraft and ongoing program recapitalization. However, due to Congressional scepticism and the need to allocate funds for support troops, some requests were withdrawn. Congress largely approved the requests for ongoing program recapitalization. The FY2007 Supplemental request for defense funding included funds for various military equipment such as Bradley base sustainment, Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles, SINCGARS Family radios, Family of Heavy Tactical Vehicles, Marine Corps radio systems, and Family of Construction Vehicles. There were concerns about the uncertainty in requirements and the validity of specific funding requests. The Army's inability to track reset expenditures until FY2007 raised concerns about the accuracy of previous projections. DOD needs to assess the validity of its estimates on equipment breakdowns and repairs to justify its FY2008 war cost request. Reset requirements are uncertain due to potential changes in troop numbers and operational intensity. The Army projected a decrease in reset requirements from $13 billion to $10.5 billion annually, with a further decline to $2 billion if troops were withdrawn over two years. Previous cost estimates were also lower. In March 2005, CBO estimated annual repair and replacement costs at $8 billion for all services, much lower than DOD's current requests. Congress provided $25.3 billion in procurement funds, slightly more than the Administration's request. Despite concerns about reset estimates, most funding was approved with some cuts made by conference and committee reports. The Senate and House made cuts to non-essential programs in response to concerns raised in conference and committee reports. The Administration also eliminated unjustifiable items from the procurement request. Congress added funds for the Mine Resistant Ambush Program due to concerns about the slow purchase of effective vehicles. The Marine Corps received increased funding for force protection needs, including aircraft survivability modifications for helicopters and countermeasures for various aircraft. Congress deemed some programs premature or unexecutable due to delivery timelines or production constraints. Requests to replace \"stressed\" aircraft were rejected, but funds were added for combat. Congress provided $35.9 billion for Operation and Maintenance (O&M) funding for war operations and support, with a $2 billion cut affecting unexecutable programs. An additional $245 million was allocated for higher operating tempo in anticipation of a Taliban spring offensive in Afghanistan. Concerns about low readiness ratings led to $1.6 billion being allocated to the Strategic Readiness Reserve Fund. Congress allocated $1.6 billion to the Strategic Readiness Reserve Fund to improve readiness of units next to deploy or in strategic reserve. $1.0 billion is reserved for National Guard and Reserve equipment shortages, with $600 million at DOD's discretion. The Secretary of Defense must identify transfers within 120 days and provide 30-day advance notifications to Congress. Funds are available until September 2009, but DOD has 90 days to identify needs due to notification requirements. Additional funds may go towards MRAP vehicles if production ramp-up is possible. The FY2007 Supplemental included $3.0 billion for MRAP vehicles. Some active-duty units are deploying to Iraq with a year or less of \"dwell\" time at home between tours, far short of DOD's goals. Congress approved initiatives to expand the rotation base supporting deployed units by creating modular units and increasing the size of the Army and Marine Corps. DOD argues that accelerating its plans to convert units to new configurations should be considered a war cost to reduce pressure on the rotation base. In FY2007, Congress allocated $3.6 billion for Army modularity, including converting units to a new modular design and creating additional Marine Corps battalions. The costs breakdown includes $900 million for military personnel, $300 million for O&M, $2.3 billion for procurement, and $100 million for military construction. This funding aimed to support the reorganization of the Army and Marine Corps. The Department of Defense requested additional funding from Congress for the reorganization of the Army and Marine Corps through modularity. The goal was to improve deployment schedules and reduce stress on personnel. Studies suggested that modularity would only marginally impact force rotation schedules, providing an additional 6,000 to 7,000 troops. DOD sought an extra $1.6 billion for FY2008 GWOT costs to accelerate the conversion process. The Department of Defense is requesting an additional $1.6 billion for FY2008 GWOT costs to speed up the conversion of more units. Secretary Gates extended tours of Army units in Iraq to 15 months, indicating modularity alone is not enough to meet rotation schedules. President Bush endorsed permanent increases in Army and Marine Corps size, with the Army growing to 547,000 and the Marine Corps to 202,000 by 2012. Congress debated funding for the additional troops added since 9/11, arguing they should not be considered temporary. In January 2007, the president announced plans to permanently increase the size of the Army and Marine Corps by 92,000 over the next six years to meet the needs of the \"long war\" on terror. This expansion reflects a new requirement for the U.S. to deploy troops at current levels in major stability operations, even with lower requirements in Iraq and Afghanistan. Congress approved $4.9 billion in the FY2007 supplemental to cover the costs. In the FY2007 supplemental, Congress approved $4.9 billion for military personnel costs of additional troops and $1.7 billion for equipment and infrastructure. DOD will include higher personnel levels in base budgets starting in FY2009. CBO estimated adding 92,000 active duty forces would cost $108 billion between FY2007 and FY2013. The issue of these costs being emergency expenses is being revisited in DOD's FY2008 war costs. In the final version, $815 million for contractor efficiencies was removed. Conferees imposed an 85% limit on O&M funding until DOD submits a report on the use of contracts in Iraq by August 1, 2007. DOD's request includes funding for pay and operations supporting 320,000 troops in OIF and OEF operations, with about 140,000 in Iraq and 20,000 in Afghanistan. The total number of deployed military personnel is higher than previously cited, including additional troops in the region and activated reservists in the US. The President's surge proposal added about 36,000 troops for a total of 355,000. DOD is planning for a \"long war\" on terror, with initiatives to expand the Army and Marine Corps. DOD requested $300 million for a \"regional war on terror\" but dropped it in March. They also asked for $500 million to expand spare parts inventory, indicating future substantial deployments. The DOD requested $500 million to expand its spare parts inventory, with Congress not objecting to the funds. Concerns were raised about duplication and financial management practices at the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO), with Congress requiring DOD to submit a strategic plan and improve its financial management practices for future funding. Congress showed scepticism towards DOD's RDT&E request, cutting programs deemed non-emergencies. Mixed responses were given to new authority and funding requests for foreign policy and military tasks. DOD has expanded authorities post-9/11 through new military aid forms. In response to new military aid forms, Congress endorsed various funding requests for foreign policy and military tasks in the FY2007 Supplemental, including support for businesses in Iraq, assistance to disarm militias in Iraq, coalition support funds, and economic assistance from DOD. Congress sometimes required State Department concurrence in decision-making to address foreign policy implications. Congress approved $110 million in economic assistance for Iraq and Afghanistan, but denied funding for training Pakistani border police and global operations in countries like the Phillippines and Djibouti. They also extended prohibitions on DOD spending authority and encouraged reprogramming requests. The final version of H.R. 2206 included provisions prohibiting the permanent stationing of U.S. forces in Iraq or control of Iraqi oil resources, as well as restrictions on the use of funds to contravene international laws. Congress also limited DOD's transfer authority to $3.5 billion and set caps on funding for small reconstruction projects and counter drug programs. The FY2006 Supplemental included provisions for reconstruction projects and counter drug funding in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Kazakstan. Congress faced pressure to pass the supplement quickly to ensure Army funding for wartime and peacetime operations. The Army had to tap into regular budget funds and transfer money from other accounts to finance war costs temporarily. The Army's revised estimates showed it could last until the end of June with a $1.6 billion transfer and a slowdown in obligations in April, May, and June 2007. To protect readiness, non-essential expenditures were restricted, including holding off on contracts for maintenance and repairs, supply contracts, limiting travel and meetings, and slowing equipment maintenance. Congress provided $28.4 billion in this year's bridge fund, $7 billion higher than last year, to meet the Army's operational needs. The Army's revised estimates indicated that with a $1.6 billion transfer and a slowdown in obligations, they could cover operating costs until the end of June 2007. Additional transfers could be requested from the available $4.6 billion transfer authority, but this would disrupt ongoing activities. To maintain operations, the Army would need to use all O&M funds in its regular FY2007 budget, O&M war funds in the FY2007 bridge fund, and exhaust transfer authority by moving funds from other areas. This could limit DOD's flexibility for other priority needs. The FY2007 supplemental funding allowed for flexibility in transferring funds between accounts to support Army operations. Supplemental appropriations have been crucial for international affairs programs due to budget constraints. There has been criticism of overreliance on supplementals, with calls for incorporating items into regular appropriations. The Administration argues for supplemental requests for unforeseen overseas expenses, with Congress approving over $1 billion annually since FY1999. Bush Administration's requests in FY2005 and FY2006 totaled $6.3 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively, representing 13% and 21% of regular foreign affairs budgets. The FY2007 request of $5.993 billion makes up 20% of enacted international affairs funding, with $4.8 billion for foreign assistance programs and $1.18 billion for State Department operations. The supplemental request for foreign assistance programs includes $2.3 billion for Iraq, $721 million for Afghanistan, and significant funding for Kosovo, Lebanon, and Sudan. Additional funds were sought for humanitarian assistance, migration assistance, peacekeeping operations, and food aid in various countries. $161 million was also included to address the potential for a global avian influenza pandemic. The State Department's supplemental request of $1.17 billion would mainly support activities and the U.S. Mission in Iraq. The $1.17 billion supplemental request would largely support activities and the U.S. Mission in Iraq. An additional $10 million is allocated for expanded broadcasting in Arabic on Alhurra Television. The total international affairs spending in the second conference agreement is $6.146 billion, with $4.88 billion for foreign assistance, including $460 million for international food aid programs. The FY2007 supplemental bill included a total of $6.34 billion for foreign assistance and State Department operations, $347 million more than the Administration's request. The Senate's bill included about $6.25 billion for similar purposes. The Administration's request for Iraq reconstruction was $6.6 billion, with $4 billion for equipping and training Iraqi security forces. The FY2007 supplemental bill allocated funds for Iraqi security forces, grassroots development projects, and revitalizing state-owned enterprises in Iraq. The Department of Defense planned to use $100 million from the Iraq Freedom Fund to rehabilitate factories, aiming to create employment for 150,000 Iraqis. The FY2007 supplemental bill allocated funds for Iraqi security forces, grassroots development projects, and revitalizing state-owned enterprises in Iraq. U.S. assistance would provide necessary machines, tools, and generators for the rehabilitation of factories, aiming to create employment for as many as 150,000 Iraqis. The remaining $2.3 billion was requested under six foreign operations accounts meeting economic reconstruction and humanitarian objectives, with most falling under the Economic Support Fund to continue efforts in private sector reform, civil society strengthening, democratization, and assisting national ministry staff. The reconstruction component of the new strategy for Iraq includes doubling the number of Provincial Reconstruction Teams and increasing U.S. civilian staff for them. The new strategy for Iraq involves increasing Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) in Baghdad and Anbar province to stabilize areas cleared by military forces. The plan aims to use U.S. and Iraqi government funding to create jobs and meet local needs, while integrating civilian teams with military battalions for security and program effectiveness. The U.S. military's CERP, USAID's CSP and CAP funded by FY2007 Supplemental, along with $10 billion from the Iraqi government, support activities identified by PRTs for grassroots initiatives like community infrastructure improvements, job training, and micro-loans. However, security and staffing issues may hinder the effectiveness of an expanded PRT program, as many staff face constraints on travel outside their compounds. The success of expanded civilian PRT efforts in Iraq relies on the ability of U.S. and Iraqi troops to secure new areas. The availability of U.S. civilian staff with specialized skills, such as local government, economic, and agricultural advisers, is also crucial for the program's success. Insurgent threats intimidate local Iraqis from meeting with U.S. staff, but the State Department disagrees with this assessment. Secretary Rice has stated that most positions in the new PRT posts are filled, but about 129 of them will be temporarily occupied by military personnel until enough civilian contract personnel are recruited. An additional funding request was made for operational costs of PRTs and SIGIR. $150 million was requested from the DOD Iraq Freedom Fund to support PRT operational costs, including transportation, force protection, and body armor for personnel. The conference report on H.R. 2206 provides $6.3 billion in Iraq reconstruction assistance, $316 million less than the Administration request. The bill matches the Administration request for ISFF and CERP, but cuts DOD support for Iraqi state-owned enterprises. There is a significant cut of $248 million from proposed assistance programs, with PRT programs reduced to $620 million under ESF and the Democracy Fund. The conference report on H.R. 2206 reduces Iraq reconstruction assistance to $6.3 billion, $316 million less than requested. PRT programs are cut by $100 million to $620 million, National Capacity Development by $40 million to $140 million, and Iraqi government support by $50 million to $60 million. Funds for National Institutions and Political Participation are eliminated. USAID's CAP receives $45 million more at $95 million, civil society development gets $67.6 million, and NGOs receive $57.4 million for economic and social programs. $250 million for Iraq's Democracy Fund includes $190 million allocated by the State Department and $60 million for human rights and labor. The INCLE account is decreased by $50 million to $150 million, with $50 million cut from prison construction. The MRA account is increased by $30 million to $45 million due to displaced people. H.R. 2206 cuts DOD Iraq Freedom Fund support for PRTs by $50 million to $100 million. State operational request for embassy and PRTs is reduced by $74 million. SIGIR request is fully funded at $35 million, with an extension of its lifespan. H.R. 2206 imposes conditions on the availability of $1.6 billion in Iraq reconstruction funds until the President certifies progress in 18 benchmarks by July 15 and September 15, 2007. Benchmark requirements can be waived by the President. Afghanistan's political transition was completed in 2005, but insurgent threats escalated in 2006. In 2005, Afghanistan completed its political transition with the adoption of a new constitution and successful elections. Citizens are enjoying new freedoms, including women participating in economic and political life. However, insurgent threats escalated in 2006, raising concerns about the success of stabilization efforts. The Taliban is experiencing a resurgence in Afghanistan due to frustration with slow reconstruction, corruption, and lack of government authority in rural areas. Narcotics trafficking and independent militias are also hindering stabilization efforts. Some Taliban commanders are operating from Pakistan, beyond the reach of U.S./NATO forces. Stabilization measures focus on strengthening the central government, security forces, and promoting reconstruction while combating the insurgent challenge. The international community is running Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) in Afghanistan to combat the insurgent challenge. The Administration is requesting $720.9 million in supplemental funds for reconstruction efforts, including $653 million in Economic Support Funds (ESF) focusing on provinces affected by insurgency and Taliban threats. Specific efforts include power sector projects, road construction, rural development, and governance initiatives. The Administration is developing Reconstruction Opportunity Zones (ROZ) in Afghanistan and border regions with Pakistan to stimulate economic activity in underdeveloped, isolated regions. $653 million would be allocated for infrastructure, power sector projects, livelihood improvement, and alternative economic development initiatives in rural areas. The request includes $138 million for strengthening provincial governance, $117 million for Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs), $47.155 million for Diplomatic and Consular Programs (DCP), $15 million for Non-Proliferation, Anti-Terrorism, Demining and Related Programs (NADR), and $5.7 million for security requirements for USAID operations in Afghanistan. The House-passed supplemental recommends a total of $743 million in Economic Support Fund (ESF) funding. The House-passed supplemental recommends $743 million in ESF funding for Afghanistan, including $292 million for infrastructure, $173 million for livelihood improvement, and $238 million for provincial governance. Additionally, $94.5 million is allocated for counternarcotics, police training, and justice institution development. The Committee believes these activities are crucial for reconstruction and stabilization efforts. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about increasing attacks by the Taliban and Al Qaeda, record levels of poppy cultivation, and the links between opium production and terrorist financing in Afghanistan. They identified rural development projects and Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) as key mechanisms for promoting stabilization and security. The committee emphasized the need for more investment from other donors in infrastructure projects. The Senate supplemental recommends $686 million in ESF funding for Afghanistan, $33 million above the Administration's request. The Senate supplemental recommends $686 million in ESF funding for Afghanistan, including $125 million for livelihood improvement, $25 million for agriculture, $144 million for provincial governance, $10 million for a Civilian Assistance Program, and $55 million to support DCP in Afghanistan. The Senate bill recommends adding $62 million in programs for Afghanistan, including $25 million for the Democracy Fund, $18 million for Migration and Refugee Assistance, and $18 million for International Disaster and Famine Assistance. The Conference agreement recommends a total of $737 in ESF funding for various projects in and around Kabul, including new power generation, rural road rebuilding, rural development, agriculture, PRTs, governance capacity building, and a Civilian Assistance Program. Additionally, $79 million is recommended to support DCP in Afghanistan, $16 million for Migration and Refugee Assistance, and $16 million for International Disaster and Famine Assistance for Internally Displaced Persons Assistance. The Administration seeks $361.9 million in supplemental funds for Sudan, mainly for humanitarian and peacekeeping support in Darfur. The crisis in Darfur began in 2003 when rebel groups challenged the government, claiming discrimination against Muslim African ethnic groups. The conflict escalated as the government and allied militia targeted civilians to crush the rebellion. Since 2003, an estimated 300,000-400,000 civilians have been killed, with more than two million displaced and over half the population dependent on international aid in Darfur. Atrocities against civilians continue, labeled as genocide by Congress and the Bush Administration. The African Union has deployed 7,700 peacekeeping troops. The FY2007 supplemental request includes $40 million for immediate assistance, $150 million for food aid in Sudan and Eastern Chad. The FY2007 supplemental request includes $150 million for food aid in Sudan and Eastern Chad, $150 million for Darfur peacekeeping, and $21.9 million for U.S. Mission Security. Additionally, $30 million in Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance funds are included for various crises. The House and Senate supplemental bills recommend funding levels for Sudan and Darfur peacekeeping, with slight differences in allocations. The request includes $128 million for international peacekeeping missions in Africa, focusing on Darfur, and $49 million for International Disaster and Famine Assistance in Sudan. Additionally, $16.9 million is allocated for U.S. Mission Security. The conference agreement maintains funding for food assistance in Sudan and Eastern Chad, and support for Darfur peacekeeping. The conference agreement recommends changes in funding for Sudan, including $44 million in International Disaster and Famine Assistance (IDFA) funding ($4 million above the request) and $19.4 million for U.S. Mission Security within State Department's Diplomatic and Consular Programs. The request also includes $150 million for additional food assistance in Sudan and Eastern Chad, and $150 million for Darfur peacekeeping. Additionally, the Administration is requesting $585.5 million following the Israeli-Hamas-Hezbollah conflict in 2006. The Administration is requesting $585.5 million for Lebanon, including $300 million in Economic Support Funds for budget support and reconstruction, $220 million in Foreign Military Financing for the Lebanese Armed Forces, $60 million in INCLE funds for the Internal Security Forces, and $5.5 million for a terrorist interdiction program. Additionally, $184 million would be used for State Department's Contributions to International Peacekeeping Activities. The final conference agreement allocated $769.5 million, including $295 million in ESF for UNIFIL in Lebanon. $250 million was designated for budget support. $60 million was provided for narcotics funding. $220 million in FMF funds were also included. The conference agreement allocated $184 million for the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon, with conditions on the release of ESF, FMF, and INCLE funds. Reports on Lebanon's economic reform plan, benchmarks on cash transfer assistance, and procedures for eligibility of armed forces and police forces are required. Certification is needed to ensure assistance does not support terrorist activities. The House bill approved $300 million in ESF for Lebanon, with conditions on the release of funds. The Secretary of State must report on Lebanon's economic reform plan, benchmarks for cash transfer assistance, and procedures to prevent funding terrorist activities. The House bill approved $300 million in ESF for Lebanon with conditions on funds release, including $10 million for scholarships and support for American educational institutions, $220 million for the Lebanese Armed Forces, $60 million from the INCLE account, $5.5 million from the NADR account, and $184 million for UNIFIL. Military and narcotics assistance are conditioned on vetting procedures, and the Secretary of State must report on the Lebanese government's steps within 45 days. The Senate bill reduced the Administration's ESF request by $35 million, transferring funds to a separate Democracy Fund. It matched the request for FMF, INCLE, and NADR accounts, requiring a certification for FMF and NADR funds release. The Secretary of State must certify efforts to prevent assistance to terrorist entities. The bill also approved a $184 million contribution to the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon. The FY2007 supplemental request of $279 million for Kosovo under the SEED Act aims to support Kosovo's status determination process. U.N. Special Envoy Ahtisaari proposed supervised independence for Kosovo, leading to tensions with Serbia and grassroots protests in Kosovo. The U.N. Security Council may consider the plan in late March, with a transition period expected post-settlement. The requested funds are intended to aid Kosovo's development. The requested supplemental funds for FY2007, totaling $279 million, are intended to support Kosovo's immediate needs in governance, rule of law, infrastructure development, and new international civilian missions. The Administration justifies the need for funding based on the expectation of settling Kosovo's status early in the year outside of the normal budget process. The final conference agreement provided $214 million, $65 million below the request. The agreement maintained reporting language requiring a report on the outcome of the Kosovo Donors Conference, with a $50 million reduction from the request for Kosovo aid. The Administration also sought funding for humanitarian assistance in various crises worldwide, including Afghanistan, southern Africa, Zimbabwe, and the Horn of Africa. The funding allocation includes $105 million for International Disaster and Famine Assistance (IDFA) to support humanitarian crises in Iraq and Somalia, $71.5 million for Migration and Refugee Assistance (MRA) for refugee and migration emergencies in Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo, $30 million for Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance (ERMA) for emergencies in Somalia, Chad, West Bank/Gaza, Iraq, and Sri Lanka. The final conference report to H.R. 2206 allocated $450 million in additional P.L. 480, Title II assistance, $10 million for the Emerson Humanitarian Trust, and $165 million for IDFA, including $75 million for unanticipated emergencies like replenishing costs from humanitarian crises in Iraq. The report expressed concern about deteriorating situations in Chad and the Central African Republic and called for consultation with USAID and the State Department. The committee expressed support for resolving the conflict in northern Uganda and allocated $130.5 million for MRA, $55 million for ERMA, and $310 million for emergency food needs worldwide. Additionally, $165 million was allocated for IDFA, with specific amounts designated for Sudan, Iraq, Afghanistan, and other countries facing emergencies. The President requested FY2007 supplemental funding for various international peacekeeping activities, including $200 million for Contributions to International Peacekeeping Activities (CIPA) and $278 million for Peacekeeping Operations (PKO). This funding was intended to support peacekeeping efforts in Lebanon, Timor Leste, Darfur, Chad, and Somalia. The FY2007 supplemental funding request included $150 million for the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) and $128 million for peacekeeping needs in Chad and Somalia. The final conference agreement provided $283 million for Contributions to International Peacekeeping Activities (CIPA) and $230 million for Peacekeeping Operations (PKO), with $161 million requested for Child Survival and Health (CSH) funds to prevent the spread of avian influenza. The final conference agreement provided $161 million for avian flu programs, allowing the President to use specific funds for this purpose. The agreement also required the State Department to report on planned expenditures within 45 days. Additionally, other assistance provisions were included, such as $80.3 million for Jordan. The conference agreement provides $80.3 million for Jordan, including $10.3 million for programs to improve basic education, health, water, and sanitation services for Iraqi refugees. Additionally, $25 million is allocated for border security programs and $45 million for security programs. For Liberia, $40 million is designated for Peacekeeping Operations to support security sector reform. The Democracy Fund receives $260 million in the conference agreement. The conference agreement provides $260 million for the Democracy Fund, with $250 million for programs in Iraq, $5 million in Lebanon, and $5 million in Somalia. Additionally, $3.5 million is allocated for the USAID Inspector General. The agreement also includes a $13 million rescission for narcotics funds in Colombia and does not include $110 million in ESF funds for Pakistan but provides the same amount from DOD funds. Sudan receives $44 million for International Disaster and Famine Assistance. The conference agreement allocates $44 million for Sudan in International Disaster and Famine Assistance, along with $150 million for Peacekeeping Operations to support the Africa Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS). Additionally, $165 million in disaster funding is provided, with specific amounts designated for Iraq, Somalia, and internally displaced persons in Kabul, Afghanistan. The remaining funds are for humanitarian assistance in various countries. The Senate bill allocated $187 million in IDFA funds for assistance in countries like Chad, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Uganda. The House bill included $135 million for IDFA and expressed concern about the conflict in northern Uganda. The conference report provided $2.624 billion for the Economic Support Fund, with allocations for various programs in countries like Sierra Leone, Nepal, and Vietnam. The Administration requested $1.168 billion in the FY2007 supplemental request for the Department of State, with most funds allocated for State's Administration of Foreign Affairs, including additional funding for Iraq Operations and Worldwide Security Upgrades. The bulk of the funds were for Iraq Operations, with a significant portion dedicated to setting up new Provincial Reconstruction Teams. The FY2007 supplemental request included $414.1 million for expanding Provincial Reconstruction Teams in Iraq, with funds allocated for personnel, support, and security. Additionally, $47.6 million was requested for U.S. Mission Operations, $72.5 million for logistics support, $8.9 million for mission information technology, and $15 million for security measures. State also requested $21.9 million for public diplomacy activities to combat violent extremism. The State Department's FY2007 supplemental request included funding for diplomatic support, reconstruction, and stabilization efforts in Sudan, as well as worldwide security upgrades in Afghanistan and Sudan. It also included funds for international exchanges to combat violent extremism and U.S. contributions for international peacekeeping activities in Lebanon and Timor Leste. Additionally, there was money allocated for expanded broadcasting in Arabic on Alhurra Television. $10 million was allocated for expanded broadcasting in Arabic on Alhurra Television in 22 Middle Eastern countries. Legislation limits fund transfers between accounts to 5% and caps transfers at 10% of the recipient account's appropriation level. A supplemental bill, H.R. 2206, was signed into law (P.L. 110-28) on May 25, 2007, providing funding for State Department operations in Iraq. H.R. 1591 allocated $1.275 billion for State Department operations and broadcasting, with $870.7 million for Diplomatic and Consular Programs. This included funding for operations in Iraq, ongoing operations, and security upgrades. The Inspector General's Office received $36.5 million, with $35 million transferred to SIGIR.

Additionally, $24.158 million was allocated for ongoing operations, $102.2 million for worldwide security upgrades, and $395 million for D&CP Iraq operations will be withheld until a detailed plan is approved. The House FY2007 supplemental bill provided $288 million for Contributions to International Peacekeeping, including funds for UNIFIL, UNMIT, and a possible mission in Chad. The Senate FY2007 supplemental bill allocated $815.8 million for Diplomatic and Consular Programs, with $723.9 million for Iraq operations. The Senate FY2007 supplemental bill allocated $723.9 million for Iraq operations, including funds for mission support, security, information technology, overhead security, and PRTs. It did not provide funding for temporary housing outside the compound or travel costs for U.S. dignitaries in Sudan. Additionally, the bill allocated funds for the Office of Inspector General, U.S. Contributions to International Organizations, Contributions to International Peacekeeping, and the Broadcasting Board of Governors. The Senate bill allocated $10 million to expand Alhurra TV viewership and up to $50 million for a civilian reserve corps. The House version requires specific authorization for funds, while the Senate version only needs regular notification to appropriation committees. The President requested $195 million to resolve Transportation Security Administration contract and grant obligations from FY2002 and FY2003, which were in violation of the Antideficiency Act. During a financial review, a violation was reported to the President and Congress on December 3, 2006. The deficiency was due to errors in voucher entries during TSA's migration to the Department of Homeland Security in 2003. The DHS confirmed the violation was unintentional. The TSA has improved internal controls, and the President requested a transfer of $195 million to correct the deficiency. The Administration proposed transferring $20 million from the Aviation Security and Transportation Security Support accounts to the TSA's Expenses account, with no impact on the FY2007 budget authority or deficit. Additionally, $3.4 billion was requested for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund for Katrina recovery efforts, including housing assistance and infrastructure repair in the Gulf Coast region. Congress previously provided $6.0 billion for FEMA activities in the FY2006 supplemental. The House-approved version of H.R. 1591 included the $3.4 billion for FEMA and added $3.0 billion for other hurricane relief measures. The House-approved version of H.R. 1591 included $3.0 billion for hurricane relief measures, with the largest addition of $1.3 billion for the Corps of Engineers in New Orleans and south Louisiana. The White House objected to the added funds in the March 19 Statement of Administration Policy, arguing for reallocation of previously appropriated funds. The Senate version of the FY2007 supplemental appropriations bill also approved the $3.4 billion requested for FEMA. The FY2007 supplemental appropriations bill approved $3.4 billion for FEMA and $3.6 billion for other hurricane relief measures. It included $1.7 billion for the Corps of Engineers for repairs in New Orleans and coastal areas, waived restrictions on project costs, and allocated funds for studies on hurricane protection in coastal Louisiana.
