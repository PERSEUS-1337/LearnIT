The Smart Energy and Water Efficiency Act of 2015 defines eligible entities and establishes a pilot program for smart energy and water efficiency. The program aims to award grants to utilities, municipalities, water districts, and other authorities providing water services. The Smart Energy and Water Efficiency Act of 2015 establishes a pilot program to award grants for innovative technology solutions to increase energy efficiency in water systems, conserve water, save energy, and reduce costs. The program supports the implementation of advanced automated systems providing real-time data on energy and water usage. The Secretary will make competitive, merit-reviewed grants under the pilot program. The pilot program awards grants to 3-5 eligible entities based on selection criteria including energy and cost savings, technology novelty, integration of next-generation tools, and cost-effectiveness in terms of energy and water savings. The pilot program awards grants to eligible entities based on criteria such as energy and cost savings, technology novelty, scalability, and completion within 5 years. Eligible entities must submit an application to the Secretary with necessary information. The pilot program awards grants based on criteria like energy and cost savings, technology novelty, scalability, and completion within 5 years. An application must include a project description, technology details, anticipated results, budget, lead organization, users served, and other relevant information. The Secretary will select grant recipients based on specified criteria and will evaluate each project annually to assess progress and impact. The project is meeting pilot program goals. The Secretary provides technical and policy assistance upon request. Best practices and evaluation results are made public. Congress receives a report on each evaluation. Funding is also addressed. The Secretary must allocate at least $7,500,000 for this section. Funding priorities are given to unobligated amounts for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Office activities."
