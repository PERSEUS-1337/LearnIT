Valeo, the Supreme Court upheld reporting and disclosure requirements of the Federal Election Campaign Act, citing three governmental interests: providing information to the electorate, deterring corruption, and aiding in law enforcement. Reporting requirements for independent expenditures only apply to those expressly advocating for or against a candidate. In Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court upheld reporting and disclosure requirements of the Federal Election Campaign Act, citing governmental interests in providing information to the electorate, deterring corruption, and aiding law enforcement. The Court deferred to legislative judgment on the constitutionality of reporting thresholds, stating that such determinations are best left to congressional discretion. The court found disparities in disclosure thresholds set by the legislature, as seen in Vote Choice, Inc. v. DiStefano where PACs had to disclose all contributors, even those donating $1, while candidates only had to disclose those donating over $100. The court highlighted the inconsistency in disclosure requirements between PACs and candidates, emphasizing that the government's interest in disclosure remains constant regardless of the entity. The Rhode Island law was found to be inconsistent and imposed uneven disclosure requirements, raising constitutional questions about freedom of association. The Supreme Court has established that freedom to associate for beliefs is a fundamental liberty right guaranteed by the 14th Amendment, emphasizing the importance of privacy in associations. The NAACP Court ruled that compelled disclosure of membership lists is unconstitutional if it hinders members' freedom of association rights. Disclosure exposed members to reprisals, coercion, and public hostility, affecting the association's ability to advocate its beliefs. The Supreme Court upheld FECA disclosure requirements in Buckley v. Valeo, stating that minor parties' First Amendment rights were not significantly burdened. The plaintiffs argued that the First Amendment rights of minor parties were burdened by contributor disclosure requirements, but the Court found that any serious infringement on these rights was speculative. The Buckley Court recognized the possibility that a specific minor party could demonstrate a reasonable probability of harm from disclosure laws in the future. The Supreme Court has ruled that disclosure requirements for minor political parties can be exempted if they can show a \"reasonable probability\" of threats, harassment, or reprisals to their contributors. This was demonstrated in Brown v. Socialist Workers '74 Campaign Committee (Ohio), where the Court upheld disclosure rules unless there was a likelihood of harm to contributors' First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court has upheld disclosure requirements for independent expenditures over $250 that expressly advocate for or against a candidate. However, courts generally consider non-candidate expenditures that do not meet the \"express advocacy\" standard to be constitutionally protected issue advocacy communications exempt from disclosure requirements. Some argue that conditioning tax-exempt status on compliance with disclosure requirements for issue advocacy may allow regulation beyond express advocacy standards. However, federal law prohibits the government from conditioning public benefits on the relinquishment of First Amendment rights. For example, in Speiser v. Randall, the Supreme Court ruled that a state cannot tie a veteran's tax exemption to giving up protected rights. The Court ruled that a state cannot require a veteran to sign a loyalty oath for a tax exemption, violating their First Amendment rights. In Regan v. Taxation With Representation of Washington, the Supreme Court upheld restrictions on lobbying by tax-exempt organizations as a government subsidy. Congress refused to fund lobbying with public money. A disclosure requirement for issue advocacy expenditures by tax-exempt groups may infringe on the First Amendment right not to disclose or speak on constitutionally protected issue advocacy communications. This could be seen as denying federal benefits to those engaging in protected activities rather than just denying federal funds for a specific First Amendment activity."
