    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Restore Opportunity, Strengthen, and Improve the Economy Act\". The Congress of the United States acknowledges the challenges of disappearing good jobs, a shrinking middle class, and increasing income inequality. The government's significant purchasing power funds millions of low-wage jobs, subsidizes labor law-breakers, and supports inflated executive compensation. The Federal Government uses taxpayer dollars to fund firms violating labor laws and subsidize high executive salaries, leading to workers relying on public assistance. This misuse of purchasing power hinders job creation, weakens the economy, and increases costs for taxpayers. Federal purchasing power should instead be used to create good jobs, strengthen the middle class, and reduce income inequality. Federal purchasing power should be used to create good jobs for America, allowing workers to live in dignity without relying on public assistance. It should also be used to rebuild the middle class, stimulate the economy, and narrow the growing income inequality gap. The Act aims to use Federal purchasing power to incentivize private-sector firms, create good jobs for American workers, rebuild the middle class, address income inequality, and boost the economy by increasing the purchasing power of working Americans. The Act aims to use Federal purchasing power to incentivize private-sector firms and create good jobs for American workers. SEC. 3 outlines the Good Jobs Model Employer Standards. The Good Jobs Model Employer standards include respecting employees' collective bargaining rights, providing living wages and decent benefits, demonstrating compliance with workplace protection laws, limiting executive compensation, and maintaining a workforce with at least 35 percent employment. The Good Jobs Model Employer standards require a workforce with at least 35 percent residing in Historically Underutilized Business Zones and subcontracting only with other Good Jobs Model Employers. SEC. 4. APPLICATION TO FEDERAL CONTRACTS AND ASSISTANCE. In federal contracts and assistance, executive agencies are required to award contracts to Good Jobs Model Employers unless no offer is available from such a source. Financial and nonfinancial assistance must also be provided to model employers over others, unless it significantly diminishes the assistance's value to the public good. Starting January 1, 2015, new contracts and assistance agreements must include a clause mandating compliance with these requirements. The assistance agreement includes a clause for contractors to act as Good Jobs Model Employers. Exclusions apply to certain federal statutory entitlements, awards, benefits, and federal employment. SEC. 5. IMPLEMENTATION. The Secretary of Labor will establish regulations for the Good Jobs Model Employer Standards within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Federal Acquisition Regulation will be amended by specific agencies to align with the Act's policy and purposes. Additionally, provisions for debarment or suspension will be implemented. An organization may face debarment or suspension if it fails to meet the Good Jobs Model Employer Standards or violates a contract clause, leading to placement on the Excluded Parties List for specified periods. Multiple suspensions can result in permanent debarment. SEC. 6. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Act is held invalid, the rest of the Act and its application shall not be affected."
