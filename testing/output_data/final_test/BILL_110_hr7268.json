Definitions in this section include authorized equipment necessary for public vehicle fleets to operate on alternative fuels, such as bi-fuel vehicle property and alternative fuel vehicle conversion property. The Advancing Alternative Fuels Revolving Loan Fund is established by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, funded by the Treasury of the United States for expenditures on alternative fuel vehicle projects. The Administrator determines necessary amounts for loans under subsection (e) from the Fund. Up to 10 percent of Fund amounts are available for administrative expenses. Transfers to the Fund are made monthly based on Treasury estimates. Adjustments are made for prior transfer discrepancies. The Fund is used for loans for alternative fuel vehicle projects. The Administrator uses Fund amounts to provide loans to local governments for purchasing equipment enabling vehicle fleets to run on alternative fuels, with a maximum loan amount of $500,000. The Administrator provides loans to local governments for purchasing equipment for alternative fuel vehicle fleets, with a maximum amount of $500,000. The interest rate on the loan is 2 percent, and a report on purchases made using the loan must be submitted within 180 days. Loan repayment schedule requirements must be met to be eligible for the loan. An eligible local government must enter into an agreement with the Administrator to establish a loan repayment schedule. The schedule requires repayment to the Treasury within 1 year of receiving the loan and semiannually thereafter. The eligible unit of local government must repay the loan (including interest) by dividing the principal amount by the total quantity of payments required during the repayment period, with completion of repayment to the Treasury within 20 years of receiving the loan."
