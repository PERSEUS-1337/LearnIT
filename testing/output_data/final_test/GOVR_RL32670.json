    "content": "The Department of Homeland Security issued a terrorism alert for critical financial institutions in New York, Washington, DC, and Newark, NJ in 2004. Security guards at these institutions were under surveillance by terrorists. Security guards are seen as vital for deterring terrorism and responding to attacks, according to the Bush Administration's National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets. The nation's reliance on security guards for protecting critical infrastructure raises questions about their status and capabilities. In 2003, there were approximately one million security guards employed in the United States, with nearly half directly employed by institutions and the rest working for contract guard companies. This report discusses the role of security guards in critical infrastructure protection, trends in their deployment post-9/11, wages compared to similar workers, and the qualifications and training of security guards. The report discusses the qualifications and training of security guards, recent changes related to counter terrorism, state-to-state differences in qualification requirements, and policy considerations for Congress. It highlights the federal government's role in protecting critical infrastructure post-9/11, including imposing security requirements on private sector infrastructure like nuclear power plants and federalizing airport screeners. As homeland security policy evolves, there may be direct federal intervention in protecting other critical infrastructure such as chemical plants, banks, and communications. The protection of critical infrastructure, including chemical plants, banks, and communications networks, is a growing concern for Congress. A terrorist attack on such infrastructure would have national implications. Congress is evaluating the effectiveness of security guards in countering terrorism and may consider legislation to enhance their capabilities. The definition of \"critical infrastructure\" is evolving and ambiguous. The definition of \"critical infrastructure\" has evolved over the years, expanding to include various sectors and assets vital to national security. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 defines critical infrastructure as systems and assets essential to the United States, the destruction of which would have a severe impact on security, economic security, public health, or safety. The National Strategy on critical infrastructure, as defined in the Homeland Security Act of 2002, identifies specific sectors and assets crucial for national security. Out of 33,000 assets cataloged in the DHS database, only 1,700 are considered nationally critical, highlighting the importance of prioritizing key infrastructure. Security guards play a crucial role in protecting people and property from accidents and crime by monitoring, patrolling, and inspecting property. They may enforce laws, conduct incident interviews, prepare reports, and provide legal testimony. Guards use radios and phones to call for assistance and may be armed based on specific duty assignments. Security guards may be armed as required by specific duty assignments. They have unique duties at different institutions such as banks and transportation terminals. In banks, guards protect customers, money, and records, while in transportation terminals, they protect travelers, luggage, and equipment by screening for weapons and explosives. Security guards have more limited authorities than police officers. Security guards typically have limited authorities compared to police officers. Their powers vary by jurisdiction and are similar to those of private citizens. In most states, citizens can only make arrests if a crime is committed in their presence, not just based on suspicion. In some states, citizens can only arrest for felonies and must immediately hand over the suspect to a police officer. Guards must be cautious when making arrests to avoid false arrest liability. Additional authorities or limitations may be imposed based on state licensing or regulations. For example, California's security guard training manual lists authorities such as questioning individuals as an agent of the employer. Since the terror attacks of 9/11, protecting against terrorism has become an additional responsibility for many security guards, especially those associated with critical infrastructure. Guards must have a state permit and a valid security guard license to legally carry a firearm or baton. They can question individuals on the employer's property, prevent entry, and use reasonable force in an arrest if necessary. Guards are not obligated by law to make arrests and should only touch a criminal suspect for self-defense purposes. If a guard believes an arrested person is armed, they may search for weapons. Since 9/11, security guards, especially those at critical infrastructure, have taken on a greater role in counterterrorism efforts due to limited resources in law enforcement agencies. Private and public sector security plans now include security guards in the fight against potential terrorist attacks. In the refinery industry, security guidelines during a DHS \"orange\" alert call for engaging a trained security workforce, increasing patrols, inspecting vehicles, and other security activities. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were approximately 1,022,000 security guards working in the United States in 2003, categorized as \"contract\" guards and \"staff\" guards deployed at critical infrastructure. In 2003, there were approximately 1,022,000 security guards in the United States, working as contract guards or staff guards at various facilities including airports. Over 14% of security guards work part-time, with a higher percentage among contract guards. Some part-time guards are off-duty police officers supplementing their incomes. The number of security guards protecting critical infrastructure is roughly estimated. Approximately 122,000 staff guards (28%) work in industries corresponding to critical infrastructure sectors. Assuming 5% of staff guards protect critical infrastructure, the actual number of security guards safeguarding critical assets is estimated. Contract security guards make up approximately 53% of all guards in the United States in 2003, with revenues of around $11 billion, accounting for 30% of total security industry revenues. The industry is fragmented, with several large companies dominating the market. In 2003, the contract guarding industry in the United States was fragmented, with a few large national companies and many smaller regional ones. The top four contractors accounted for 50% of industry revenues and 35% of contract employees. Securitas U.S.A. and Wackenhut were the top two contractors, both foreign-owned. Contract guards are commonly used to protect critical infrastructure and assets. The contract guarding industry in the United States utilizes guard services to protect critical infrastructure and key assets. Companies like Wackenhut and Akal Security provide guard services at nuclear plants, U.S. Army bases, and federally owned facilities. The employment of U.S. security guards has seen a decline in recent years. The overall employment of U.S. security guards (excluding airport screeners) has declined over the last five years, despite an increase in certain infrastructure sectors. Between 1999 and 2003, the number of guards decreased by approximately 124,000 (11%), while the number of police increased by approximately 34,000 (6%). This decline in guarding jobs since 2001 contradicts popular perceptions about U.S. guard deployment. The employment of U.S. security guards has declined over the last five years, despite an increase in certain infrastructure sectors. Private guard contractors did not see a significant increase in business post-9/11, possibly due to short-lived reactions and economic recession forcing companies to cut security expenses. Total market growth in 2003 was around zero percent. The employment of U.S. security guards has declined over the last several years, but there appears to be an increase in critical infrastructure guards. Airport screeners saw a significant increase post-9/11, with numbers doubling by 2003 and still remaining 57% higher than in 2001. The number of guards deployed at U.S. nuclear power plants increased from 5,000 in 2001 to 8,000 due to heightened security measures post-9/11. The number of guards at the nation's 67 nuclear sites increased from 5,000 in 2001 to 8,000 in 2004. Security guard employment trends in critical sectors like airports and nuclear plants have seen some increase, with reports of heightened security measures post-9/11. Security costs at downtown Los Angeles skyscrapers rose by 25% between 2001 and 2002, primarily due to additional guard expenses. In 2002, a security review of financial market organizations found increased deployment of security guards post-9/11. Some used more guards for patrols, armed response, or vehicle screening. In 2003, seven chemical facilities increased security guards in response to industry guidance. The Los Angeles Department of Water & Power doubled security patrols in FY2001 but decreased the budget in FY2002 and FY2003. The American Petroleum Institute reported that some oil pipeline operators increased guard patrols post-9/11. The Jamestown-Surry ferry system hired guards for passenger screening in 2004. Policy analysts focus on staffing, pay, background checks, and training for security guards in critical infrastructure protection. The debate over the relationship between guard force size and facility security has received public attention, with calls for more security personnel to protect critical infrastructures. Increases in airport screeners and nuclear plant guards post-9/11 reflect this thinking. The debate over the relationship between guard force size and facility security has received public attention post-9/11. Increasing guard numbers may not always enhance security, as guards can only address certain threats. Simply adding more guards may not prevent all types of attacks, such as a commandeered airliner or cyber-attack on safety systems. Additional guards may not be effective if they are not trained to recognize specific threats. Increasing the size of a guard force may not always enhance critical facility security as it can lead to fatigue, confusion, and increased opportunities for hostile insiders. Simply posting more guards may not be sufficient in countering terrorist attacks, as effectiveness depends on various factors such as threat recognition, training, and organization. Policy analysts often argue that security guard employment offers inadequate pay and benefits, leading to a shortage of well-qualified workers. Advocates suggest that better compensation could attract more skilled guards, especially for critical infrastructure. The GAO's 2000 report on airport security highlighted ongoing issues with guard quality and effectiveness. The GAO's 2000 report on airport security identified long-standing problems with airport screener performance linked to personnel factors like low pay and high turnover. Federalization of airport screeners led to a pay increase of over 100%, improving employee quality and retention. Policy analysts suggest reevaluating guard pay for critical infrastructure guards, as security guards are relatively low-paid compared to police and the average U.S. salary. Staff guards earned 25% more than contract guards in 2003. In 2003, guards earned nearly 25% more than contract guards. Pay for government and contract airport screeners averaged over $28,700, almost 50% higher than contract guards but $16,000 less than police officers. Salaries for nuclear plant guards varied, starting at $19,364 to $32,117 and reaching up to $40,393 after three years. Contract security guards often receive benefits like health insurance and retirement plans. Low pay for guard jobs reflects minimal qualifications required by employers. Armed guards must be licensed and may receive special police certification for certain arrests. Higher pay is common for guards at critical infrastructure sites like airports and nuclear plants due to perceived terrorist threats. Higher pay for guards at critical infrastructure sites like airports and nuclear plants may be necessary to ensure better qualifications and counter-terror training. This could result in increased costs for guard employers, potentially met with resistance due to the cost-competitive nature of the industry. The need for thorough background checks for security guards at critical facilities, such as nuclear plants and airports, has been highlighted due to concerns about potential terrorist infiltration. Legislation and federal strategies emphasize the importance of comprehensive screening to protect against insider threats. Federal background checks for security guards are crucial for protecting against insider threats. Congressional interest in this issue arises from inconsistent screening requirements at the state level. A 2004 survey found that only 23 states authorize federal criminal background checks for contract security guards, while 12 states only allow state criminal checks. In states with authorizing regulations, federal background checks are not always conducted on all prospective guards. The Private Security Officer Employment Authorization Act of 2004 facilitates federal background checks. The Employment Authorization Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-458, Sec.6402) allows private security guard companies to access FBI criminal records for background checks. Legislation in the 108th Congress proposed requiring federal criminal background checks for security guards to prevent hiring individuals with criminal history. Many analysts argue that screening guards for criminal history is essential for crime prevention and employee reliability. The importance of conducting criminal background checks for security guard job applicants is debated, as some terror groups recruit operatives without criminal histories. The Irish Republican Army and Al Qaeda have preferred recruits with clean records for certain missions. This raises questions about the direct link between criminal history and terrorism. Federal criminal background checks for security guard job applicants may not always be effective in identifying individuals with terrorist connections. The FBI faces limitations in estimating the number of potential guards with such ties due to database constraints. Additionally, checks may not detect \"clean operatives\" recruited specifically for their lack of criminal or terror records. Background checks for nuclear security guards and airport screeners involve assessing reliability, trustworthiness, and potential terrorist threats. However, even with higher standards, there are limitations to the effectiveness of these checks. Federal criminal background checks for security guard job applicants may not always be effective in identifying individuals with terrorist connections. The FBI faces limitations in estimating the number of potential guards with such ties due to database constraints. Additionally, checks may not detect \"clean operatives\" recruited specifically for their lack of criminal or terror records. Background screening laws may only apply to state-licensed contract guards, leaving opportunities for hostile insiders as unlicensed staff guards. Incomplete state records and limited availability of automated information on felony and other arrests further hinder the effectiveness of these checks. Federal criminal background checks for security guard job applicants may not always be effective in identifying individuals with terrorist connections. Law enforcement agencies and state identification bureaus face limitations in conducting thorough and timely checks. Stricter criminal screening on critical infrastructure guards could lead terrorist groups to divert recruitment efforts away from convicted criminals. Policy makers may need to implement complementary measures like guard supervision and access controls to reduce the terror threat from potential insider threats. Counter-terrorism training is crucial for the professional development of security personnel. Counter-terrorism training is essential for the professional development of critical infrastructure guards. While there has been an increase in training for law enforcement, airport screeners, and nuclear guards since 9/11, there are no federal requirements for training other security guards in the U.S. Some states do require basic training for licensed contract guards, but not for staff guards, and few specifically require counter-terrorism training. The number of training hours required varies, with basic guard training ranging from 1 to 48 hours. Basic guard training varies from 1 to 48 hours and covers property rights, emergency procedures, and criminal detention. Additional weapons training is required for armed guards. Training requirements for security guards in the U.S. are compared to those in the European Union, showing variability in both regions. In the European Union, Spain has the highest training requirements for private security guards due to its history of Basque separatist terrorism. Other EU countries and non-EU countries like Hungary also have varying training requirements. In the UK, mandatory training is planned by 2005 under the Private Security Industry Act. In the US, guard training traditionally covers security responsibilities, police powers, relations with police, inspection, observation, report writing, and legal responsibilities. Nuclear power plant guards undergo extensive training in areas such as firearms, first aid, alarms, and electronic security systems, with a focus on counter-terrorism. Some states, like California, include terrorism training in their curriculum, but time constraints limit the depth of coverage. Connecticut's guard training law from 2004 has minimal requirements regarding terrorism training. Connecticut's 2004 guard training law only requires a brief 90-minute discussion on terrorism, prompting calls for greater counter-terrorism training. Los Angeles Mayor mandated security guards at LADWP to attend antiterrorism seminars taught by LAPD, focusing on terrorism awareness and detection. The training includes intelligence data on Al Qaeda tactics and seized videotapes. The DHS Protective Security Division offers training programs for private security guard companies, with 174 staff from 37 companies participating as of October 2004. Future programs will include Web-Based Workforce Antiterrorism Awareness/Prevention, Surveillance Detection, and Physical Security training. The Protective Security Division offers training programs for private security guard companies, including distance learning and hands-on training at regional offices. Some policymakers have called for terrorism training legislation, such as the D.C. Enhanced Professional Security Amendment Act of 2004 and the Private Sector Preparedness Act of 2004. Opponents question the effectiveness of expanded guard training standards, citing differences in job responsibilities, oversight levels, and exposure to the public. They argue that one-size-fits-all training requirements may not meet the varying security needs of different facilities. Some argue that security guard training policies should be evaluated based on specific facility needs, rather than having federal regulations. Private companies may voluntarily provide training, but there is limited public information on the extent of this practice. Since 9/11, security guard employers in California have implemented new procedures, conducted emergency drills, and improved training to prevent terrorist attacks. Major contractors like Securitas offer specialized training for guards in high-risk facilities. Other security firms also provide training for critical infrastructure protection in homeland security efforts. Some analysts suggest critical infrastructure guards should receive additional counter-terrorism training as part of homeland security efforts. The National Strategy directs DHS to create a training regime for private security officers, with specialized training for utility security staff also identified as important. Nuclear power plant guards undergo months of special training in various areas. The DHSFY2004 appropriations allocated $2.9 billion for first responders and urban security grants, intended to assist state and local law enforcement, fire service, emergency medical service, emergency managers, and other first responders with aid, alarms, and electronic security systems. The cost of specialized training for critical infrastructure guards is a barrier, with projections of $800 per guard for a 40-hour training course in Manhattan. Training 50,000 guards to the 260-hour Spanish standard would cost $260 million. The DHSFY2004 appropriations allocated $2.9 billion for first responders and urban security grants, including funding for counter-terrorism training programs for emergency personnel. The guidance allows grant funds to cover overtime and backfill costs for employee attendance at these programs, including private security providers. While specific DHS grants for security guard training are not confirmed, it is likely eligible. State security guard training requirements typically apply to contract guards, not staff guards. Proposed federal guard legislation focuses on contract guards. Guard legislation at the federal level is mainly focused on contract guards, but approximately 48% of all U.S. guards in 2003 were staff guards and not subject to this oversight. State and federal legislators are considering increased training and licensing requirements for contract guards, which may lead to disparities between standards for contract and staff guards. It is argued that both types of guards should have the same screening and capability requirements, as seen in nuclear power plants where both contract and staff guards are subject to the same regulations. Contract and TSA airport screeners, whether contract or staff guards, are subject to the same NRC regulations, background checks, and training requirements. Discussions on guard issues in infrastructure security include comparing performance between contract and staff guards, but research on this topic is limited. TSA officials are considering potential differences in performance, but little research is available. The effectiveness of federal and private screening performance needs further evaluation. Civilian guards have been hired at military bases to meet security requirements, potentially influenced by overseas troop demands. Training and capabilities of nuclear plant guards are also important considerations. The training and effectiveness of nuclear guards regulated by the NRC have been questioned in the media, with reported lapses in performance and conflicts of interest in guard testing. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act allows only U.S. owned companies to provide contract screeners at airports, unless U.S. firms with sufficient capability are unavailable. This measure was in response to perceived inadequacies of airport screening contractors after 9/11. Some analysts criticize restrictions on foreign ownership of security firms post-9/11, as foreign firms have valuable international experience in infrastructure security. There is little demand for similar restrictions on guard contractors for other critical infrastructure. Analysts question if critical infrastructure guards need more resources for counter-terrorism functions. The report addresses the need for resources to enhance guards' ability to respond to terrorist threats and incidents. It highlights the lack of federal or state policies that differentiate critical infrastructure guards from others, raising concerns about uniform requirements for all guards. The appropriate role of the federal government in overseeing security guards, especially private guards, remains a question. The report discusses the lack of federal policies for critical infrastructure guards and the challenges in identifying them due to uncertainties in defining critical assets. The DHS compiled a list of 1,700 critical U.S. assets, but confusion among private sector and state partners cast doubt on its validity. The DHS compiled a list of 1,700 critical U.S. assets, but confusion among private sector and state partners cast doubt on its validity. Uncertainties in defining critical assets have raised concerns about the effectiveness of policies for critical infrastructure guards. Counter-terrorism funding for guards in the private sector presents a policy challenge as the DHS will not provide money for remediation. Private security guards, employed by private companies or institutions, play a crucial role in protecting critical infrastructure from terrorism threats. While federal funding for guards may not be necessary if the private sector invests in counter-terrorism measures, economic reasons may prevent them from doing so. Private markets in homeland security may not always produce the best results, highlighting the need for government intervention. Private markets in homeland security may not always produce the best results, as private firms may not invest in the appropriate level of security for critical infrastructure. The balance between public and private funding of homeland security is a complex topic, and funding for private guards may become a security consideration where public benefits and private resources do not align. Private markets in homeland security may not always produce the best results, as private firms may not invest in the appropriate level of security for critical infrastructure. Funding for private guards may become a security consideration where public benefits and private resources do not align."
