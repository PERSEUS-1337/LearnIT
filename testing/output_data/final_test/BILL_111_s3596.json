The demonstration program aims to improve hospital compliance with Medicare conditions of participation. It will operate for 3 years in 4-6 selected states with up to 24 hospitals participating, meeting specific criteria set by the Secretary. The demonstration program aims to improve hospital compliance with Medicare conditions of participation. States or hospitals interested in participating must submit an application to the Secretary.
