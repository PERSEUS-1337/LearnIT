    "title": "AB 1185",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following: Article 3.3 is added to the Public Contract Code, allowing the Los Angeles Unified School District to use the best value procurement method for building and modernizing school facilities. This method has been previously authorized for projects by the University of California. The Legislature recognizes the benefits of best value procurement for school construction projects, aiming to streamline the process and reduce costs. The new article in the Public Contract Code allows school districts to adopt this alternative bidding method. In the context of school construction projects, \"best value\" procurement allows for selecting bidders based on a combination of price and qualifications. This method results in a \"best value contract\" awarded to a qualified bidder with a competitive bid. The \"best value score\" is calculated by dividing the bidder's price by their qualification score. Additionally, \"demonstrated management competency\" refers to the experience and capability of the proposed management staffing for similar projects. The curr_chunk defines \"financial condition\" as resources needed for contract performance, \"governing board\" as LAUSD's board, and \"labor compliance\" as meeting wage and workforce qualifications. Bidder evaluation criteria include obtaining payment bonds, insurance, apprenticeship compliance, and paying prevailing wages on public works projects. The curr_chunk defines \"qualifications\" as including financial condition, relevant experience, management competency, labor compliance, safety record, and subcontractor qualifications for the project. Relevant experience refers to the ability to complete similar projects in terms of size, scope, or complexity. The curr_chunk defines \"safety record\" as acceptable if a contractor's experience modification rate is 1.00 or less, with injury/illness rates meeting standards. \"Skilled and trained workforce\" refers to workers being skilled journeypersons or apprentices in an approved program. As of January 1, 2016, 20% of skilled journeypersons on the contract must be apprenticeship program graduates approved by the Chief of the Division of Apprenticeship Standards or the US Secretary of Labor. As of January 1, 2017, 30% of skilled journeypersons on the contract must be graduates of an approved apprenticeship program. As of January 1, 2018, 40% of skilled journeypersons on the contract must be graduates of an approved apprenticeship program. As of January 1, 2019, 50% of skilled journeypersons on the contract must be graduates of an approved apprenticeship program. (E) As of January 1, 2020, 60% of skilled journeypersons on the contract must be graduates of an approved apprenticeship program. For occupations without an approved program before January 1, 1995, up to half of the graduation percentage requirements can be met by skilled journeypersons who started working in the occupation before an approved program was established in the county. The pilot program for the Los Angeles Unified School District allows best value procurement for projects over $1,000,000. The governing board can use this method for projects before December 31, 2020. The governing board of the school district may select a bidder based on best value, ensuring fair and impartial evaluations of qualifications. Procedures and guidelines must be adopted to conform to this method of selection. The governing board of the school district may award a project to the second or third bidder if the selected bidder fails to execute the contract. Contracts must be awarded to the bidder representing the best value or all bids may be rejected. Retention proceeds withheld from the best value contractor cannot exceed 5 percent if a performance and payment bond is required. In contracts between contractors and subcontractors, the retention proceeds withheld cannot exceed the specified percentage. If a subcontractor fails to provide a bond when required, the contractor can withhold retention proceeds exceeding the specified percentage. The school district must follow specific procedures when awarding best value contracts, including preparing bid solicitations, prequalifying bidders, and keeping bidder information confidential. Subcontractors bidding on contracts are protected under Chapter 4 of Part 1. Entities awarded best value contracts must commit to using a skilled and trained workforce for all work falling within apprenticeable occupations in the building and construction trades. This commitment can be demonstrated through an agreement with the school district and providing evidence of compliance on a monthly basis during the project. Entities awarded best value contracts must commit to using a skilled and trained workforce for all work within apprenticeable occupations. This includes entering into a project labor agreement that binds all contractors and subcontractors, providing evidence of compliance, and following specific criteria and methodologies outlined in bid solicitations. The school district evaluates bidders based on set criteria, assigns qualification scores, and ensures bidder identity and cost information remain confidential during evaluation. Factors like relevant experience and safety record are weighted appropriately in the selection process for the best value contractor. The school district evaluates bidders based on relevant experience, safety record, and other factors in the request for proposal. A preference is given to small businesses. The best value contractor is determined by dividing each bidder's price by its qualifications score, with the lowest cost per quality point winning the bid. The contract award decision is made in writing by the school district. The school district must publicly announce the contract award details, including project price and best value contractor. Reports on best value procurement method usage must be submitted to legislative committees by specified dates. The school district must publicly announce contract award details, including project price and best value contractor. Reports on best value procurement method usage must be submitted to legislative committees by specified dates, including interim and final reports with project details, contract amounts, best value contractors, protests resolution, prequalification process, bid evaluation criteria, project performance assessment, delays, and cost increases. The requirement for submitting a report on best value procurement method is inoperative after January 1, 2021. This article will be in effect until January 1, 2021, unless extended or repealed by a later statute. The Legislature deems a special law necessary for a pilot project in the Los Angeles Unified School District to assess the benefits of best value procurement for infrastructure improvements and fiscal impacts."
