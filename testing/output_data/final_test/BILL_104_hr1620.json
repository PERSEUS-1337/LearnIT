The Congress finds that contaminated and underused industrial sites in distressed communities face economic challenges in securing funding for cleanup and redevelopment. These sites, once cleaned up, can provide significant public benefits and promote environmentally sound practices. Voluntary cleanup programs encourage private sector involvement in remediation efforts. The Act aims to revitalize distressed communities by providing loans for cleanup of industrial properties to attract private investment, promote clean manufacturing, and create local jobs. States can use Federal funds to support cleanup and redevelopment projects through revolving loan funds. The Act establishes a pilot project for a revolving loan fund to support cleanups under state voluntary cleanup programs. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will establish a pilot project to provide capitalization loans to States for creating or expanding revolving loan funds for environmental cleanups. Loan applications must demonstrate State voluntary cleanup programs with public participation opportunities.
