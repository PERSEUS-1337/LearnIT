Entities known as \"information brokers\" have created billions of personal records on individuals, which are used in credit, employment, housing, insurance, and other decisions. It is crucial for information brokers to be fair, accurate, and transparent to ensure individuals' economic opportunities are not hindered. In 2004, an identity theft operation gained access to hundreds of thousands of individual profiles from a large information broker, leading to many becoming victims of identity theft. Identity thieves exploit personal information like names, addresses, social security numbers, and financial data for illegal purposes. Identity theft is a growing problem affecting millions of Americans, with 10,000,000 individuals impacted in 2004 alone. This type of fraud accounted for 39 percent of consumer complaints filed with the Federal Trade Commission that year, costing the United States $52.6 billion.

The Act requires information brokers to disclose the identity of entities accessing personal information, correct errors promptly, safeguard confidentiality, authenticate users, and ensure lawful use of personal data. Information brokers must ensure that personally identifiable information is used lawfully, establish procedures to prevent fraud and unauthorized access, track users' access to information, and comply with regulations set by the Commission.

States can take civil actions to enjoin, enforce compliance, or obtain damages for violations of Commission regulations. The attorney general of a State can file an action to obtain damages, restitution, or other relief on behalf of residents.

Upon receiving notice of a complaint, the Commission and Attorney General have the right to move to stay the action, intervene in the action, and file petitions for appeal. If the Attorney General or Commission has initiated a criminal or civil proceeding for a violation of the Act, no State can bring an action under this subsection against the same defendant during the pending proceeding.

State laws are not affected unless they conflict with this Act. State laws are only affected by this Act if they conflict with it, and the Act providing greater protection takes precedence in case of conflict. The Commission must submit a report to Congress within 12 months of issuing regulations required by section 2, detailing the impact of the information brokerage industry on personally identifiable information privacy.
