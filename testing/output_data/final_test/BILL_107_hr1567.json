FINDINGS.\" \"According to the United Nations, economic and social factors contribute to the spread of HIV/AIDS, infecting an average of 16,000 people daily. Debt crisis in impoverished countries leads to more money spent on debt repayment than on HIV/AIDS prevention. Structural adjustment programs impose harmful policies like user fees at medical clinics, hindering prevention and treatment programs.\" User fees at health clinics in impoverished countries, due to structural adjustment programs, have led to decreased attendance at STD clinics by 35-60%. This, along with budget cuts, contributes to the spread of HIV/AIDS. Labor migration caused by these programs has increased HIV transmission rates in several African countries. The pandemic will result in millions of orphaned children, straining global resources. United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan highlighted the destructive impact of AIDS in 1999.
