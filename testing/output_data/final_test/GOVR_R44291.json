    "content": "The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources reported the Energy Policy Modernization Act, addressing energy efficiency, critical infrastructure, energy supplies, financing, markets, and critical minerals. The Senate and House passed amended versions of the bill, including provisions on natural resources and environmental issues. The Senate and House versions of the Energy Policy Modernization Act include provisions on fish and wildlife recreation, federal land conveyances, permanent reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, EPA's Brownfields Program, National Forest management, drought relief, and physical security of the electric grid. The House-passed bill also addressed restrictions on the export of U.S.-produced crude oil. The Senate and House versions of the Energy Policy Modernization Act cover key topics such as fish and wildlife recreation, federal land conveyances, Land and Water Conservation Fund reauthorization, EPA's Brownfields Program, National Forest management, drought relief, and electric grid security. The House bill also includes restrictions on U.S. crude oil exports. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce approved draft text for H.R. 8, which was later introduced and passed by the House. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources also marked up various energy-related bills. The Senate and House versions of the Energy Policy Modernization Act cover various energy-related bills, with differences in emergency authority for grid emergencies. The Senate version focuses on cyber threats, while the House version includes any major threat to the grid. The House version of the Energy Policy Modernization Act authorizes emergency measures for any major threat to the grid, including natural events like geomagnetic storms. It includes provisions for promoting cyber-secure technologies and creating a strategic transformer reserve. In contrast, the Senate version is more expansive, covering risk modeling for all grid threats and potential changes to the Electricity Sector Information Sharing and Analysis Center (E-ISAC). Section 1104 of the Energy Policy Modernization Act grants the Secretary of Energy authority to order emergency measures to protect critical electric infrastructure during a grid security emergency. Section 1105 mandates a plan for a strategic transformer reserve, while Section 1106 establishes a voluntary program for cyber-secure products in the bulk-power grid. The Senate version includes two sections focused on electric grid security: Section 2001 grants the Secretary of Energy additional authority to address cybersecurity threats, while Section 2002 designates DOE as the lead agency for cybersecurity in the energy sector. The House and Senate versions of S. 2012 address energy infrastructure risks, alternative funding mechanisms for the E-ISAC, review of RTO performance, grid modernization for resiliency, liability protection for grid service providers, development of micro-grids, and expedited transmission siting. The Senate version of S. 2012 includes provisions for developing micro-grids and expediting transmission siting. It also requires FERC to evaluate the impact of increasing dispatch of distributed generation and micro-grids on electric system reliability. The House version focuses on grid modernization and reliability, with a section addressing energy delivery, reliability, and security. Section 1102 authorizes FERC to ensure that emergency orders for electricity generation or transmission comply with environmental regulations and minimize adverse impacts. Section 1103 authorizes the Secretary of Energy to enhance emergency preparedness for natural disasters, including improving communications and industry cooperation. Section 1107 requires states to consider new voluntary standards under PURPA for electric utilities to improve resiliency. Compliance with emergency orders issued under this subsection would not violate environmental laws or regulations. Section 1108 of the legislation requires FERC to conduct independent reliability assessments of proposed rules affecting electric utilities, while Section 1110 mandates electric utilities to incorporate reliable generation into their plans over a 10-year period. Section 1110 of the legislation requires Regional Transmission Organizations operating capacity markets to analyze how market structures procure capacity resources using competitive forces while ensuring reliability. FERC must evaluate these analyses and report to Congress on market structures. Section 2302 mandates the Secretary of Energy to develop a grid architecture model and scenarios to assess different impacts. The Secretary would determine if additional standards are needed for grid interoperability and communication networks. Section 2304 focuses on promoting hybrid micro-grids for isolated communities to enhance infrastructure resilience, especially in extreme weather conditions. Cost-shared demonstration projects would be developed to increase resiliency in these communities. The bill includes provisions for cost-shared demonstration projects to enhance grid resiliency through physical and cybersecurity plans. It also establishes an Interagency Rapid Response Team for transmission permitting and a Transmission Ombudsman for grid reliability. FERC would mandate reports from RTOs on distributed energy resources and micro-grid systems. The bill mandates reports from RTOs on distributed energy resources and micro-grid systems, including fuel sources, operational characteristics, benefits, costs, and barriers to deployment. Regional entities under the ERO must submit a report every three years to Congress and FERC on reliability within their geographic region. FERC would solicit a reliability impact statement from affected regional entities for major rule proposals affecting the bulk power system. The ERO would produce a single RIS for a broader area than covered by a regional entity. FERC would require reports from RTOs on electric generation capacity resources, transmission facilities, and market transparency. Both bills include provisions on renewable energy and energy efficiency, with some overlap in energy efficiency in buildings. The two bills contain modest proposals for energy efficiency in buildings, with many provisions being similar or identical to previous legislation. Both bills also include proposals to repeal statutory provisions for renewables and efficiency. The proposed repeals of provisions for renewables and efficiency in the two bills are nearly identical, including repeals of study, survey, or reporting requirements and programs. It is unclear if some provisions may have a significant impact. The Senate version proposes updating model energy codes for residential and commercial buildings to achieve new energy savings targets. The House version includes a controversial energy efficiency proposal known as the Blackburn-Schrader provision, which would modify model building energy codes by prohibiting DOE assistance for new provisions with a payback period over 10 years. The current model code development and implementation processes are criticized for excessive DOE advocacy, calling for greater controls and transparency. A self-certification process is suggested instead of the burdensome DOE certification for jurisdictions' code implementation. Opponents argue that proposed controls could hinder DOE's technical assistance. Self-certification is deemed unreliable, and a 10-year payback period requirement for new code provisions is proposed to address costly products. However, critics argue that this method overlooks long-term benefits and profitability. The House and Senate versions of the bill contain different building provisions. The House version includes voluntary building asset ratings, federal renewable energy purchase requirements, and smart grid energy labels. The Senate version includes multifamily building demonstration projects, efficiency retrofits, training centers, green buildings certification, and commercial refrigeration standards. The Senate version of the bill includes provisions for energy efficient manufacturing, small and medium manufacturer leverage, smart manufacturing at national laboratories, vehicle research and development, and manufacturing. It also authorizes and reauthorizes various energy efficiency and renewable energy programs, such as the Weatherization Assistance Program and the State Energy Program. The Senate version of the bill authorizes appropriations for renewable energy programs, including marine and hydrokinetic energy. It also proposes changes to the Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing program to include U.S.-built vessels and increase applicant fees. The Senate version of S. 2012 proposes changes to the fee structure of ATVM loans, asserts carbon neutrality for forest bioenergy, and calls for consistency in federal policy across departments. Debate surrounds the carbon neutrality designation for bioenergy, with some industries seeing it as crucial for federal support while others caution against a blanket designation due to varying carbon impacts. The Senate version of S. 2012 addresses changes to ATVM loan fees, asserts carbon neutrality for forest bioenergy, and emphasizes consistency in federal policy. The bill also includes provisions related to natural gas exports, requiring permits from the Department of Energy and either FERC or MARAD. Environmental impact assessments under NEPA may be necessary for facility permits. The Senate version of S. 2012 includes provisions for natural gas exports, requiring the Secretary of Energy to make timely decisions on applications, report delivery destinations, study economic implications, and establish a permit acquisition process. The House version also mandates DOE action on export project proposals needing FERC or MARAD approval. The Senate version of S. 2012 includes provisions for natural gas exports, requiring timely DOE decisions on applications and disclosure of export destinations. It also mandates BSEE to review blowout preventer regulations for economic impact on small entities in the oil and gas supply chain. No similar provision is in the House version of S. 2012. The House-passed FY2017 appropriations bill for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies, H.R. 5538, includes provisions prohibiting funds for implementing the BSEE well control rule. Both House and Senate versions of S. 2012 address carbon capture and storage (CCS) but differ significantly. The House version establishes an evaluation process for DOE-funded CCS projects, reviewing advancements and progress in CCS technology. The House-passed FY2017 appropriations bill includes provisions for evaluating DOE-funded CCS projects and determining the need for increased funding based on progress in advancing CCS technology. The bill also requires reports from the Secretary of Energy on evaluations and recommendations for each project, to be made publicly available on the DOE website. Additionally, a report assessing progress in advancing CCS technologies is to be submitted to energy-related congressional committees every three years. The House-passed FY2017 appropriations bill includes provisions for evaluating DOE-funded CCS projects and determining the need for increased funding based on progress in advancing CCS technology. The Senate-passed version addresses CCS in three sections of Title III, expressing the importance of CCS in a clean energy future and focusing on R&D related to CCS. The House version includes a provision for a study of carbon dioxide pipelines, assessing cost and feasibility of a national system, which is not present in the Senate version. The House-passed FY2017 appropriations bill includes provisions for evaluating DOE-funded CCS projects and determining the need for increased funding based on progress in advancing CCS technology. Section 3402 of the bill would amend EPAct 2005 to focus on improving the conversion, use, and storage of carbon dioxide produced by fossil fuels. Section 3403 would establish a coal technology program to ensure the continued use of coal through efficiency, cost, and environmental improvements, including research, pilot projects, and addressing CO2 emissions through high efficiency platforms and carbon capture. The Senate-passed version of the bill focuses on the validation of geologic storage of carbon dioxide and the development of infrastructure for a CO2 storage industry. It requires regular reports on progress towards CCS objectives and authorizes appropriations for demonstration programs. Additionally, it includes a provision for a GAO study on the effectiveness of existing loan guarantee programs for advanced fossil energy at DOE. The Senate-passed version of the bill aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the advanced fossil energy loan guarantee program in advancing CCS technology, review federal incentives for CCS projects, assess the potential of combining existing incentive programs for CCS, and evaluate the impacts and costs of implementing recommendations from the 2015 National Coal Council report. It also includes a provision for a carbon dioxide technology prize program with a $50 million authorization. The bill authorizes a $50 million technology prize program for nuclear innovation. It includes the establishment of a National Nuclear Innovation Center for testing reactor concepts funded by the private sector. DOE would operate the Center in consultation with NRC on safety issues. Reports to congressional committees are required on DOE's capabilities for overseeing privately funded reactors and on alternative budget plans for nuclear energy research. NRC would also submit a report on its licensing abilities. The bill includes provisions for DOE to enhance nuclear energy technology through computer modeling and simulation, determine the need for a fast neutron source, and eliminate a location requirement for a prototype Next Generation Nuclear Plant. The House version requires reports on DOE's capabilities for overseeing privately funded fusion and non-light water reactor prototypes at Department-owned sites. The House bill includes provisions for DOE to enhance nuclear energy technology through computer modeling and simulation, determine the need for a fast neutron source, and develop alternative 10-year nuclear R&D budget plans. It also requires reports on overseeing privately funded reactor prototypes at Department-owned sites and addresses the development of domestic critical minerals and mine permitting processes. The Senate version of S. 2012 addresses the identification and designation of critical minerals, requiring a methodology to be established by the Secretary of the Interior. A comprehensive resource assessment of critical mineral potential in the United States would be conducted, with survey and field work to supplement existing information. The process for critical minerals exploration on federal lands would be made more efficient through agency review and reports. The bill aims to improve the permitting process for critical minerals development on federal lands by establishing performance metrics and engaging with state and local governments to avoid conflicts. Additionally, the Department of Energy would be required to establish an R&D program to explore alternatives to critical minerals, including recycling and material efficiencies in the supply chain. The Senate bill includes provisions for forecasting domestic supply, demand, and price of critical minerals over 1-year, 5-year, and 10-year periods. It also mandates a workforce assessment for critical mineral development. The House-passed version contains the National Strategic and Critical Minerals Production Act to streamline mine permitting for critical minerals. The federal mine permitting process aims to minimize delays and promote domestic development of critical minerals. The Senate bill includes provisions for reauthorizing the Land and Water Conservation Fund and reallocating revenues from OCS leases to a National Park Service fund. Other sections focus on amending and reauthorizing the EPA's Brownfields Program. The Senate bill includes provisions for reauthorizing the Land and Water Conservation Fund and amending the EPA's Brownfields Program. The House version of the bill also includes natural resources provisions such as federal forest management, wildfire funding, water management, and drought relief. Both versions have provisions on federal land management and fish and wildlife recreation, with some differences between the two bills. Section 5002 of the Senate version of S. 2012 proposes changes to the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) Act of 1965, which aims to preserve outdoor recreation resources. The LWCF is funded through Treasury with an annual revenue target of $900 million until September 30, 2018. Congress appropriates funds from the LWCF for federal land acquisition, state grants, and other recreational purposes. Section 5002 of S. 2012 proposes changes to the LWCF Act of 1965, aiming to preserve outdoor recreation resources. It includes provisions for permanent authorization of the LWCF with $900 million annually, allocation of funds for federal land acquisition and state programs, and enhancing public access to federal lands. The House- and Senate-passed versions of S. 2012 contain differing provisions related to the Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act (FLTFA), which expired on July 25, 2011. FLTFA allowed for the sale or exchange of lands owned by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) identified for disposal under BLM's land use plans. The law permitted proceeds from land sales to be used for enhancing public access to federal lands. The Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act (FLTFA) allowed for the sale or exchange of lands owned by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) identified for disposal under BLM's land use plans. The law permitted proceeds from land sales to be retained in a special account in the Treasury for subsequent land acquisition and other purposes. FLTFA emphasized acquisition of inholdings and nonfederal lands adjacent to federal lands with exceptional resources to improve resource management efficiency. After FLTFA expired, proceeds from BLM land sales now go to the General Fund of the Treasury. The Senate-passed bill would permanently reauthorize the authority in FLTFA, while the House-passed bill would provide reauthorization through July 25, 2022. Any remaining funds in the special account would be used for deficit reduction or federal debt reduction. Both versions of the bill allow for updated BLM land management plans to be used for identifying lands for sale and exchange, as well as for acquisition of lands within or adjacent to federally designated areas. The House-passed bill contains additional provisions to broaden the purposes. The House-passed bill includes provisions to broaden the purposes for funds in the account, such as addressing deferred maintenance, acquiring lands for recreation, and establishing a database of lands for disposal. Both Senate and House versions of the bill address National Park Service (NPS) issues, with Senate provisions focusing on funding for the agency's centennial anniversary and backlog of maintenance. The Senate bill includes provisions for a National Park Service Maintenance and Revitalization Conservation Fund funded by oil and gas lease revenues, and a National Park Centennial Challenge Fund supported by donations. The House-passed version of the bill does not have similar provisions. The Senate bill proposes a National Park Centennial Challenge Fund with donations matched by federal funding, up to $17.5 million. The House version does not include this provision. The Senate bill would derive federal funding from discretionary appropriations, while the House bill would use a price increase for park passes for senior citizens. The Senate bill proposes a Second Century Endowment for the National Park System, funded through gifts, devises, or bequests. The House version also includes a similar provision but adds a fee on park lodging for funding. The funds would be used for projects identified by the Secretary to further the NPS mission. The National Park Service administers the Historic Preservation Fund (HPF) funded by oil and gas activities on the OCS. The funding authorization expired in 2015, but there is still a balance available. The Senate bill would permanently authorize HPF funding, while the House version would reauthorize it through FY2023. Both bills also direct NPS to conduct special resource studies for potential new park system units. The Senate and House bills differ in their requirements for National Park Service studies and designations. The Senate bill focuses on sites in Maryland and Tennessee, while the House bill includes sites in Mississippi and Nebraska, Kansas, and Oklahoma. The Senate bill designates segments of Connecticut's Lower Farmington River and Salmon Brook as part of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, and expands the North Country National Scenic Trail in New York. In contrast, the House bill redesignates and expands the Ocmulgee Mounds National Monument in Georgia. Sections 6001-6007 would redesignate and expand the Ocmulgee Mounds National Monument in Georgia, Sections 10001-10002 would expand the John Muir National Historic Site in California, and Sections 18001-18003 would redesignate the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site in Georgia as a national historic park. The Senate bill includes provisions related to NPS intellectual property protection, education and interpretation in the parks, the Public Land Corps, the National Park Foundation, and more. The Senate bill includes provisions related to NPS intellectual property protection, education, and interpretation in the parks, the Public Land Corps, and the National Park Foundation. The House-passed version of S. 2012 contains provisions related to various national parks and monuments, including Coltsville National Historical Park, the Gullah/Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor, the 9/11 Memorial, and more. The Senate-passed bill includes provisions for commercial filming and still photography on federal lands, directing the Secretaries of Interior and Agriculture to establish a fee schedule within 180 days. Small businesses and film crews of three or fewer would be exempt from fees, and noncommercial news-gathering activities would be clarified. The House-passed bill allows film crews of five or fewer to pay a special fee for commercial filming. The Senate and House versions of the bill mandate an \"open until closed\" policy for hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting on federal lands managed by the Forest Service and BLM. Closures can only be for public safety, administration, or compliance with laws, and must be minimal in time and area. Consultation with state agencies, public notice, and comment opportunities are required. Shooting ranges may be allowed on federal lands, except in specified protected areas. Section 10231 of the Senate version and Section 2081 of the House version allow bows and crossbows to be transported in vehicles on NPS lands. The Senate version also permits qualified volunteer hunters to help cull wildlife populations on NPS lands. The House version includes provisions for hunter access corridors and volunteer bison hunters in Grand Canyon National Park. The Senate version includes a mandate for a survey of recreation access on federal lands under various agencies' jurisdiction, with a focus on improving public access for hunting and fishing. An advisory committee would be created to advise on access and recruitment of new hunters, with annual reports required. Additionally, there are provisions in the Senate version affecting the use of funds for hunter education in the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act by states and territories. The Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act allows states to pay up to 90% of the cost for acquiring land, expanding, or constructing public target ranges for firearms or archery. The Enhanced Hunter Education program would increase the federal share from 75% to 90% for projects related to target ranges. The House bill has a similar provision, including a limit on state funds. The Senate version includes provisions for reauthorizing funds for the North American Wetlands Conservation Act and creating a National Fish Habitat Conservation Partnership with a National Fish Habitat Board. These provisions are not found in the House bill. The House bill includes provisions such as prohibiting regulation of lead shot and lead sport fishing equipment by EPA, facilitating importation of polar bear trophies from Canada, and prohibiting possession of firearms at water resources projects of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Additionally, it amends the Migratory Bird Treaty Act to limit prosecution for hunting birds over baited fields. The focus is on agricultural practices that may attract birds to a field, with controversy over hunting in farm fields affected by natural disasters. Subtitle J addresses conservation, poaching, and hunting of African elephants, including restrictions on ivory transportation and sale in the US. Section 2131 limits NPS and Office of National Marine Sanctuaries' ability to restrict fishing in their jurisdiction. Section 2201 would require reissuance of rules delisting wolves in the western Great Lakes area and in Wyoming, with an exemption from judicial review. Subtitle T of Title II would limit the take of predators on federal lands in Alaska, in response to a decision encouraging predator take on non-federal lands to increase game species populations. Federal agencies are diverging from state hunting regulations in this case. The Senate and House versions include provisions for annual reporting of expenditures under the Equal Access to Justice Act and payments from the Judgment Fund in litigation against the federal government. The EAJA allows a prevailing party to recover costs and attorneys' fees if the government's position was not justified. Data from the report would be available online in a searchable database. The Senate and House versions of the bill include provisions for annual reporting of expenditures under the Equal Access to Justice Act and payments from the Judgment Fund in litigation against the federal government. The information would be available in a searchable database, with disclosure of fees and expenses awarded in settlement agreements required. The Senate version would amend 31 U.S.C. \u00a71304 to mandate the Secretary of the Treasury to post specified information. The House version omits language requiring the Secretary of the Treasury to post specified facts about each judgment. The Senate version includes provisions to reauthorize the Brownfields program through FY2018, while the House-passed version does not have comparable provisions. The Brownfields program funds federal assistance for the assessment and remediation of contaminated sites. The Brownfields program provides federal assistance for the assessment and remediation of contaminated sites on non-federal lands. Federal assistance is limited, with states playing a predominant role in remediation. Title VII of the Senate version reauthorizes appropriations for the EPA Brownfields program at $200 million annually for competitive grants to state and local entities. Title VII of the Senate version reauthorizes appropriations for the EPA Brownfields program at $200 million annually for competitive grants to state, local, and tribal governmental entities and non-profit organizations for site characterization, assessment, planning, and remediation, job training for site remediation workers, and technical assistance. It also includes $50 million annually for formula-based grants to state and tribal governments to establish or enhance their own remediation programs. The amendment would alter various aspects of eligibility and authorized uses of competitive grants, expanding the general eligibility of non-profit organizations and allowing for \"multipurpose\" grants combining site characterization, assessment, planning, and site remediation. The Senate version reauthorizes appropriations for the EPA Brownfields program at $200 million annually for competitive grants to state, local, and tribal governmental entities and non-profit organizations for site characterization, assessment, planning, and remediation. It includes various changes such as allowing governmental entities that purchased contaminated properties prior to January 11, 2002, to receive grants, increasing the dollar limit for individual site remediation grants, giving priority to small communities and waterfront sites, and authorizing a dedicated program element for renewable energy sites. The House-passed version of S. 2012 reallocates funds for state and tribal remediation programs and includes forest management provisions. Division B impacts federal forest management, defining terms and establishing procedures for NEPA documentation. The House-passed version of S. 2012 includes forest management provisions that define terms and procedures for NEPA documentation for specified forest management projects on NFS and public lands. It stipulates that action alternatives analyzed in any environmental assessment or environmental impact statement would be limited to carrying out the project as proposed or taking no action. Additionally, it requires completion of an EA for salvage operation projects within three months after a large-scale catastrophic event, with reforestation activities achieving 75% reforestation within five years. Four new NEPA categorical exclusions are established to expedite certain critical response actions. Title III of the House-passed version of S. 2012 imposes a procedural requirement for plaintiffs challenging agency decisions developed through a collaborative process. Plaintiffs must post a bond equal to the estimated legal costs before proceedings can move forward. The Secretary concerned can recover costs if the plaintiff does not prevail on every challenge. Section 302(e) prohibits an award of fees or expenses. Title III of S. 2012 imposes a bond requirement for plaintiffs challenging agency decisions. Section 302(e) prohibits fees or expenses for plaintiffs who succeed in Title III actions. Titles IV-VIII impact federal forest management activities, including payments under the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act. Title V authorizes contract ceilings for stewardship contracts and amends fire liability provisions. Title VI establishes a fund for nonfederal parties to contribute financially and receive appropriations. Title VII of S. 2012 amends the Tribal Forest Protection Act to specify timeframes for project implementation and allows federal lands to be treated as tribal lands upon request. Title VIII includes provisions impacting forest management activities, such as exempting certain provisions of the Northwest Forest Plan on NFS and public lands. Title IX of S. 2012 proposes changes in wildfire suppression funding and disaster declarations for wildfires on federal lands. It aligns closely with Title IX of H.R. 2647 and includes provisions for water management and drought relief. The House and Senate-passed versions of S. 2012 differ in their provisions for water management and drought relief. The Senate focuses on authorizing federal projects and adding reporting requirements, while the House incorporates a larger drought relief bill, including controversial provisions that may impact the federal Central Valley Project in California. The Senate-passed version of S. 2012 includes provisions affecting federal water projects like Fontenelle Reservoir, Yakima Project, and Klamath Project. These sections authorize study and expansion of the reservoirs, efforts to reduce power costs for irrigators, and national water resource management changes. The House-passed version of S. 2012 includes management changes at a national level, such as a pilot program for \"forecast-based\" operations by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and an asset management report by Reclamation for infrastructure repair needs. These provisions were not in the Senate-passed version but were included in H.R. 2898. Many of these provisions have been debated in Congress regarding drought-related issues in California. The House-passed S. 2012 includes provisions from H.R. 2898 addressing the federal Central Valley Project in California and drought/water management. Changes aim to maximize water deliveries without harming species survival. Controversially, the bill sets maximum negative flow rates for California's rivers based on inflow scenarios. The House-passed bill includes provisions setting maximum negative flow rates for California's rivers based on various scenarios. The Secretary of the Interior can override these rates if they pose an imminent threat to species survival. Supporters argue for more flexibility in water management during droughts, while opponents fear the changes could lead to litigation. The House-passed bill includes provisions for water management issues, such as completing surface water storage feasibility studies, partnering with local authorities for projects, addressing water rights protections, expanding the CVP service area, expediting project permitting, and initiating a new review process. The House-passed bill includes provisions for water management issues, such as accelerated repayment of construction costs, development of benefits at dam safety projects, and addressing water rights in connection with federal lands. Congress faces challenges in managing federal water projects during times of drought and increasing demand, balancing various laws, regulations, and obligations while meeting growing water supply needs."
