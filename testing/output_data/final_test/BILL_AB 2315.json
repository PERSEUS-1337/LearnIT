    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 36 of the Code of Civil Procedure in California is amended to grant preference in civil actions to parties over 70 years old or under 14 years old in certain cases. The court must find that the party has a substantial interest in the case and that their health requires a preference to prevent prejudice. The Code of Civil Procedure in California allows parties over 70 years old to file a motion for preference in civil actions. The court may grant preference based on age or medical documentation showing a serious health condition. Upon granting a motion for preference in civil actions in California, the court must set the trial within 120 days with no continuance beyond that period, except for physical disability or good cause. In cases of alleged professional negligence by a health provider, the trial date must be set between six to nine months from the motion's approval. In asbestos tort actions, the plaintiff must submit a sworn affidavit in support of the preference motion. The Asbestos Tort Claim Trust Transparency Act requires plaintiffs in asbestos tort actions to comply with disclosure requirements and make claims with all asbestos trusts. A plaintiff may not receive a trial preference if subject to an order under Section 825. Chapter 6 of the Code of Civil Procedure introduces definitions for asbestos tort actions. The Asbestos Tort Claim Trust Transparency Act mandates disclosure requirements for plaintiffs in asbestos tort actions involving claims related to personal injury or death. An asbestos tort claim includes damages for lost earnings, medical expenses, emotional distress, and other harms for which an asbestos trust may be responsible. (c) An asbestos trust is a legal entity established to compensate claimants with eligible asbestos tort claims, as defined by specific laws. \n(d) An asbestos trust claim refers to any claim filed or potentially filed with an asbestos trust. (e) \"Asbestos trust claim documents\" include all relevant writings and information for a pending or potential claim against an asbestos trust, such as proof of claim forms, affidavits, medical records, and trust distribution procedures. \n822. (a) The plaintiff in an asbestos tort claim must serve specific documents on all parties. The plaintiff in an asbestos tort claim must serve specific documents on all parties, including a sworn statement identifying asbestos trust claims filed, trust claim documents submitted, and communication records with the trust. These documents must be served within 90 days of filing the complaint, or within 30 days if awarded a preferential trial date. On or before March 1, 2017, the plaintiff must supplement information on asbestos trust claims within 30 days of filing or receiving new information. The court can still require additional disclosures for asbestos trust claims. A defendant in an asbestos tort action can request relevant materials from an asbestos trust identified by the plaintiff. The plaintiff cannot claim privilege to prevent discovery and must provide consent for the release of trust claim documents. These documents are admissible as evidence in the tort action, including for proving alternative causation or apportioning responsibility. Claims of privilege do not apply to asbestos trust claim documents. If a defendant discovers an undisclosed asbestos trust, they can request the plaintiff to file a claim against it or seek court intervention for appropriate relief. The court has the discretion to stay the asbestos tort action, delay trial dates, or impose other remedies if necessary. In an asbestos tort action, damages awarded will be reduced by the amount paid to a plaintiff by any other asbestos trust or by the valuation amount of such asbestos trust claim as specified in the claim documents. In an asbestos tort action, a court may retain jurisdiction over the action even after resolution for hearing motions or enforcing remedies related to issues raised under this chapter, including willful concealment or intentional delay in filing an asbestos trust claim. Section 877 of the Code of Civil Procedure is amended to specify the effects of a release, dismissal, or covenant not to sue given in good faith to tortfeasors or co-obligors. In an asbestos tort action, a court may retain jurisdiction over the action even after resolution for hearing motions or enforcing remedies related to issues raised under this chapter. Section 877 of the Code of Civil Procedure specifies the effects of a release, dismissal, or covenant not to sue given in good faith to tortfeasors or co-obligors. This includes moneys received from an asbestos trust, discharging the party from liability for contribution to other parties, except for co-obligors who have agreed in writing to an apportionment of liability. The section does not apply to releases, dismissals, or covenants given to a co-obligor on a contract made before January 1, 1988. No reimbursement is required by this act if the contract was made before January 1, 1988. This act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes penalties, within the meaning of the Government Code."
