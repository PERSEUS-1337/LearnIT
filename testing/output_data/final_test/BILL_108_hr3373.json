Establishment of a program at the Center to determine and monitor biological and chemical characteristics of the River, assess the interrelationship with hydrology and geomorphology, and monitor biota, including threatened species and water quality. Development involves consultation with Governors of affected States through the Missouri River Natural Resources Committee. The program at the Center involves the Missouri River Natural Resources Committee, Missouri River Basin Association, Secretary of Agriculture, Secretary of the Army, Western Area Power Administration, Fish and Wildlife Service, EPA Administrator, and Missouri River Basin Indian Tribes. It aims to provide scientific information for managing the River, monitoring biota, habitats, and water quality. The program at the Center involves the Missouri River Natural Resources Committee, Missouri River Basin Association, Secretary of Agriculture, Secretary of the Army, Western Area Power Administration, Fish and Wildlife Service, EPA Administrator, and Missouri River Basin Indian Tribes. It aims to provide scientific information for managing the River, monitoring biota, habitats, and water quality. The program includes identifying methods to conserve fish and wildlife, making recommendations to restore or enhance the ecosystem of the River, establishing a baseline for future activities, creating a database on River biota, and making the database accessible to listed entities and the public. A report is required three years after the program's establishment. The Secretary of the Interior, through the Director of the US Geological Survey, must review and revise the program every 3 years and report to Congress on the River's environmental health. The Secretary may also enter into contracts with Indian Tribes for environmental restoration along the River. The tasks to be contracted will support the research and monitoring program outlined in this section and complement activities by the Secretary of the Interior and State Governments. Authorization of appropriations includes specific funding amounts for fiscal years 2005 to 2020, with allocation details specified. In fiscal years 2005 to 2020, funding amounts are specified for various purposes, including directing at least 50 percent of funds to a specific Center and allocating the remaining funds to State agencies for field data collection and monitoring activities in the River basin. The funding allocated for the River system aims to supplement scientific knowledge and support monitoring of endangered fish species, including the pallid sturgeon's response to reservoir operations. The focused investigations component will be competitively funded through collaboration between State agencies, the Secretary of the Interior, and other relevant entities. The Secretary of the Interior and relevant entities will prioritize information needs and issue a request for proposals to organizations with River expertise. Selected proposals will be funded."
