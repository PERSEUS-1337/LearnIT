This system has been both criticized as undemocratic and praised for its role in political stability and federalism. The report focuses on the institutions and procedures of the electoral college, including rare eventualities that occurred in the 2016 election. The report examines the 2016 presidential election, including issues like faithless electors, split allocation of electoral votes in Maine, and challenges to electoral votes in Congress. It also discusses the constitutional origins of the electoral college system, additional components, and processes, as well as alternative reform measures. The 2016 presidential election marked the fourth occurrence of a \"wrong winner\" election, where the President and Vice President were elected with a majority of electoral votes but fewer popular votes than their opponents. This eventuality is attributed to the constitutional structure of the electoral college system. The 2016 presidential election resulted in a \"wrong winner\" scenario due to the electoral college system. The Constitution and Twelfth Amendment require a majority of electoral votes to elect the President and Vice President, with no mention of popular votes. \"Faithless\" electors, who vote for candidates other than pledged, are allowed by the Constitution. Maine's electoral vote was split between the two major party tickets for the first time. In Maine, the electoral vote was split between Republican and Democratic nominees in the 2016 presidential election. This split was allowed by constitutional provisions, with the district system producing split electoral votes. Title 3, Section 15 of the U.S. Code outlines procedures for counting electoral votes in Congress, including objections to state certificates of electoral votes. Several objections were raised during the joint session of Congress on January 6, 2017. Several objections were raised by members of the House of Representatives during the January 6, 2017, joint session of Congress to count electoral votes. These objections were not considered due to not meeting legal requirements. Public opinion has historically favored direct popular election over the electoral college system, with support for direct popular election never falling below 58% since 1967. After the 2016 election, support for the electoral college rose, with 49% favoring direct popular election and 47% favoring retention of the electoral college. Republicans' support for replacing the Electoral College with the popular vote significantly decreased, while Democrats' support for direct popular election increased. The Constitutional Convention of 1787 considered various methods of electing the President before settling on the electoral college system. This system aimed to balance state and federal interests and give state legislatures the authority to choose electors. The electoral college system was chosen at the Constitutional Convention of 1787 to provide different means of electing electors, including popular vote or selection by the legislature. It aimed to balance state and federal interests, give smaller states leverage, and keep the presidency independent from Congress. Alexander Hamilton expressed satisfaction with the electoral college method as a compromise that contributed to the convention's success. The electoral college system was chosen at the Constitutional Convention of 1787 to provide different means of electing electors. Alexander Hamilton expressed satisfaction with the electoral college method as a compromise that contributed to the convention's success. Hamilton praised the mode of appointment of the Chief Magistrate of the United States in The Federalist, stating that it united all wished-for advantages. Each state was given electors equal to its Senate and House of Representatives membership, chosen by the states as directed by their Legislature. The qualifications for electors were broad, with only Senators, Representatives, and certain officeholders prohibited from serving. The electoral college system required electors to assemble separately in their states to cast their ballots. One candidate had to be from another state to prevent provincial insularity. This aimed to encourage electors to consider national candidates. A majority of the whole number of electors was needed for a candidate to win. The original method of electing the President and Vice President required a majority of electors' votes for a candidate to win. If no candidate received a majority, the House of Representatives would choose the President. The runner-up in the presidential contest would become the Vice President. The original method of electing the President and Vice President required a majority of electors' votes for a candidate to win. If no candidate received a majority, the House of Representatives would choose the President. The runner-up in the presidential contest was elected to the second office. This system, never anticipated the early growth of political parties and factions, each offering a joint ticket of two candidates - one for President and one for Vice President. By the third election in 1796, Federalists and anti-Federalists each offered a joint ticket, leading to a cumbersome system that broke down. The original method of electing the President and Vice President required a majority of electors' votes for a candidate to win. However, the system broke down in 1800 when a Republican elector failed to withhold his vote, leading to a tie between Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr. This constitutional crisis resulted in the Twelfth Amendment, showing how the electoral college system evolved over time. The electoral college system evolved over time with constitutional requirements, federal and state legal provisions, and political party practices in place. The Constitution prohibits Senators, Representatives, and certain government employees from serving as electors. The two major political parties tend to nominate well-known figures for the electoral college. The electoral college system involves nominating well-known figures as electors, who may not be recognized by the public. Electors' names do not appear on the ballot in most states, and their anonymity is maintained during the voting process. The Constitution and federal law do not specify nomination procedures for elector-candidates. The nomination procedures for elector-candidates are determined by state and political party preferences. Most states have laws that dictate how major party candidates for presidential elector are nominated, with methods including state party conventions or nomination by the state party's central committee. Other states have varied methods such as nomination by the governor, primary election, or by the party's presidential nominee. Provisions for new and minor political parties, as well as independent candidacies, are also determined by state law and are diverse.

Provisions for new and minor political parties, as well as independent candidacies, are also determined by state law and are diverse. The Constitution gives each state a number of electors based on its Senate and House of Representatives delegation, with the total number of electoral votes per state ranging from 3 to 55. These totals are adjusted following each decennial census in a process called reapportionment. The process of reapportionment reallocates the number of Members of the House of Representatives based on population changes among states. States may gain or lose electors, but always retain their two senatorial electors. The Constitution grants states the right to decide how electors will be chosen. The current allocation of electoral votes will be in effect for the 2024 and 2028 elections, with reallocation following the 2020 census. In the early days of the republic, legislatures chose presidential electors, but democratic sentiment led to the expansion of voting rights. By 1832, voters in every state except one chose electors, and since 1864, voters have chosen electors in all states. Today, citizens vote for presidential electors, while state legislatures have the constitutional authority to decide how they will be chosen. The constitutional authority of state legislatures to decide how presidential electors will be chosen continues to be in effect. In 2000, during the presidential election controversy in Florida, the possibility of the state legislature appointing electors was raised. While electors are expected to vote for their party's candidate, the constitutional right of state legislatures to choose electors remains unquestioned. Since the first decade under the Constitution, presidential electors have been expected to vote for the candidates of the party that nominated them, with \"faithless\" electors occasionally breaking this rule. Despite efforts by 24 states to prevent faithless electors through pledges and penalties, the tradition of electors being bound to vote for their party's candidates remains a topic of debate among constitutional scholars. Most constitutional scholars believe that electors remain free agents to vote for any candidate once chosen. Faithless electors have been rare, with only eight instances since 1900. In 2016, 10 electors attempted to vote for different candidates, with seven succeeding. In 2016, seven electors successfully cast votes for candidates other than those chosen by their state's voters in the popular election. This included electors from Hawaii, Texas, and Washington who voted for alternative candidates for President and Vice President. This was the largest number of electors to do so since 1836. In 2016, seven electors voted for candidates other than those chosen by their state's voters. The Secretary of State of Washington fined four electors for voting against the popular vote winners, which was upheld by a state administrative law judge. General election ballots offer joint candidacies for President and Vice President, with voters casting a single vote for electors pledged to the joint ticket of the party they represent. This practice conforms to the Constitution, which provides for only one set of electors voting separately for President and Vice President, eliminating the possibility of voters choosing among electors from different parties. Most states do not print individual elector-candidates on the general election ballot. Only the names of presidential and vice presidential nominees and their party appear, with some states specifying that a vote for them is a vote for their party's elector-candidates. 48 states and DC use the \"general ticket\" system, while Maine and Nebraska use the \"district\" system for awarding electoral votes. The winner-take-all system, also known as the general ticket system, allows political parties to nominate a group of elector-candidates equal to the state's total number of electors. Voters cast a single vote for the presidential and vice presidential candidates, which actually counts as a vote for the entire ticket of electors pledged to the party. This system awards all the state's electors to one party's nominees, magnifying the winning party's impact. The winner-take-all system, also known as the general ticket system, awards all the state's electors to one party's nominees, magnifying the winning candidates' victory margin within states and across the nation. This multiplier effect historically produces an electoral college majority for the winners greater than their popular vote margin of victory. In the 1960 presidential election, Democratic nominees John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson won 49.72% of the popular vote but received a solid electoral vote majority due to this system. In the 1960 presidential election, Democratic nominees Kennedy and Johnson won by a narrow popular vote margin of 0.18%. However, they gained a significant electoral college victory margin of 15.64% due to the general ticket system multiplier. This system magnifies the winning candidates' victory margin, as seen in hypothetical \"State A\" with 10 electoral votes. In the electoral system, \"Party X\" and \"Party Y\" nominate 10 electors each, with voters casting a single vote for the general ticket of electors. If Party X's electors receive 51% of the popular vote, they win all electoral votes in a winner-take-all system. The district system, used in Maine and Nebraska, allows voters to choose two electors. In Maine and Nebraska, voters choose two at-large electors statewide and one elector in each congressional district. Each voter casts a single vote for President and Vice President, counted twice - first statewide and then in each district. This system is illustrated in a hypothetical scenario with Party X winning 51% of the statewide vote and Party Y winning 49%. In Maine and Nebraska, voters choose two at-large electors statewide and one elector in each congressional district. Party X wins 51% of the statewide vote, securing two senatorial or at-large electors. In the district system, Party X wins five out of eight congressional districts, earning a total of seven electors. Party Y wins three districts, receiving three electors. In the 2016 presidential election in Maine, Party X won two at-large electors and five district electors, totaling seven electors. Party Y won three district electors. Clinton and Kaine won the statewide popular vote and the First Congressional District, while Trump and Pence won the Second Congressional District. Maine and Nebraska are the only states that award electoral votes based on congressional district victories. In 1992, Nebraska split its electoral votes, awarding four votes to Republican nominees McCain and Palin and one vote to Democratic nominees Obama and Biden. Presidential elections are held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Congress established a single election day in 1845 to prevent fraudulent practices. Congress established a single election day in November to prevent fraudulent practices, choosing Tuesday for travel convenience and to avoid congestion at the county seat. The Twelfth Amendment requires electors to meet in their respective states. The Twelfth Amendment requires electors to meet in their respective states on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December. In 2020, electors will convene on December 14. The \"safe harbor\" provision governs disputed election returns, stating that if a state resolves disputes at least six days before the electors meet, the decision is final. Electors usually meet in the state capital. The electors meet in the state capital to vote separately for President and Vice President by paper ballot. Results are endorsed and sent to various officials before the electoral college ceases to exist until the next presidential election. The final step in the presidential election process is the counting, ascertainment, and declaration of the electoral votes in Congress on January 6 of the year following the presidential election. The Vice President opens the electoral vote certificates from each state and passes them to four tellers for counting. No debate is allowed in the joint session. The Vice President opens electoral vote certificates from each state and passes them to four tellers for counting. The candidates who receive a majority of electoral votes are declared the winners by the Vice President. Objections can be made to individual electoral votes or state returns, requiring signatures from one Senator and one Representative. If objections are raised, the joint session is recessed for separate consideration by the two houses of Congress. During the joint session of Congress, objections to electoral votes can be made by one Senator and one Representative. The objections are considered separately by the two houses, with limited speaking time and a two-hour session. If both houses agree, the electoral votes in question are not counted. This process was last used in 2005 following the 2004 presidential election, specifically against the State of Ohio's electoral vote certificate. Following the 2005 joint session of Congress, where objections to electoral votes were debated and rejected, it was noted that objections must be signed by at least one Representative and one Senator. In the event of a tie in the electoral votes, a candidate must receive at least 270 out of 538 votes to be elected President or Vice President. In a contingent election, if no candidate receives a majority of the electoral votes, Congress chooses the President and Vice President. The House of Representatives votes by state for President, while the Senate votes for Vice President individually. A majority of 26 state votes is needed for President and 51 Senator votes for Vice President. In a contingent election, Congress chooses the President and Vice President if no candidate receives a majority of electoral votes. Each state delegation in the House votes for President, while each Senator votes for Vice President. The Vice President-elect serves as acting President if the House is unable to elect a President by January 20. Congress can determine who will act as President if no President-elect or Vice President-elect is chosen by January 20 in a contingent election. The timeline for the 2020 presidential election includes nomination of candidates for elector in each state from May to August 2020, the General Election Day on November 3, 2020, and the \"Safe Harbor\" deadline on December 8, 2020. On December 14, 2020, the electoral college meets where state delegations of electors vote separately for President and Vice President by paper ballot. Certificates of the results are then transmitted to various officials. On December 14, 2020, the electoral college meets where state delegations of electors vote separately for President and Vice President by paper ballot. Certificates of the results are then transmitted to various officials. Certificates must be delivered to specified officers by the fourth Wednesday in December. On January 6, 2021, Congress assembles to count electoral votes, declaring the elected President and Vice President. Inauguration of the President and Vice President occurs on January 20, 2021. The electoral college and election laws have been controversial since the early days of the Constitution. Criticism of the electoral college system includes indirect election of the President and Vice President by state electors, disenfranchisement of voters for losing candidates, and potential for candidates to win with fewer popular votes. Contingent election further removes the election from voters by giving equal voting power to each state. The electoral college system is defended by supporters who argue that it is not undemocratic, as electors are chosen by voters in free elections. They believe it is a key component of American federalism, promoting broad-based electoral coalitions and moderate political parties. Supporters also maintain that the system allocates electors among states fairly and challenges claims of advantages for certain groups or parties. The electoral college system is defended by supporters who argue that it promotes broad-based electoral coalitions and moderate political parties. Various constitutional amendments have been proposed to reform or eliminate the electoral college, with three alternative proposals being the most widely suggested: the automatic system, the district system, and the proportional system. The electoral college system has been the subject of reform proposals, including the automatic system, district system, and proportional system. These proposals aim to allocate electoral votes based on popular vote proportions and eliminate the office of elector to prevent faithless electors. Congress has considered various electoral college reform measures from the late 1940s through 1979, including constitutional amendments to reform or eliminate the system. Congress has considered electoral college reform measures from the late 1940s through 1979, with proposals debated multiple times in Senate and House Judiciary Committees. Amendments to reform or eliminate the electoral college were approved by the necessary majority in both chambers at different times, but no action has been taken since the 107th Congress. In the 114th Congress, four proposals to replace the electoral college with direct popular election were introduced but did not progress beyond committee referral. Two resolutions proposing a constitutional amendment for direct popular vote in the 115th Congress. States have authority over the appointment and election of electors, with Maine and Nebraska using the district system. Maine and Nebraska use the district system for elector selection, showcasing states as \"laboratories of democracy.\" Various states have proposed proportional and congressional district plans for electoral vote allocation, but none have succeeded. Examples include failed ballot initiatives in California and Colorado rejecting a district system in 2004. In Colorado, voters rejected Amendment 36 for proportional electoral vote allocation in 2004. Michigan and Nebraska also considered changing their electoral vote allocation systems but did not succeed. In Pennsylvania, proposals to change electoral vote allocation were introduced in 2011 and 2012. In Pennsylvania, legislation was introduced in 2013 to award electoral votes based on the proportional system, but no action was taken. In Virginia, a variant of the district system was proposed in 2012 but was bypassed indefinitely in 2013. Wisconsin legislators considered awarding electoral votes based on the district system between 2011 and 2014. Following the 2016 presidential election, there have been efforts in various state legislatures to change the electoral system. Bills have been introduced in Minnesota and Virginia to switch to district systems. Additionally, the National Popular Vote initiative aims to establish direct popular election of the President and Vice President through an interstate compact. Members of the NPV pledge to appoint electors based on the popular vote in their states. The National Popular Vote initiative aims to establish direct popular election of the President and Vice President through an interstate compact. States would choose electors committed to the candidates with the most votes nationwide, potentially leading to a unanimous electoral college decision. Currently, 10 states and the District of Columbia have joined the compact, totaling 165 electoral votes. The plan requires approval from states controlling at least 270 electoral votes to take effect. The electoral college system, present in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, has been under consideration in 18 states in 2017. Despite remaining largely unchanged since the Twelfth Amendment, it has never functioned as the founders intended. Originally meant to be an indirect and deliberative selection process, it has evolved into a system influenced by political parties and voter participation determined by state legislatures. The electoral college system, established by constitutional provisions, state laws, and traditions, determines the presidential election process. It sets the size of the electoral college, elector allocation, voting margins, and procedures for contingent elections. Federal and state laws dictate the election schedule, voting eligibility, elector nomination, vote allocation, and procedures. Despite not functioning as intended by the founders, the system has elected the candidate with the most public support in the majority of elections. The 2016 presidential election, with the largest number of faithless electors in recent history, has sparked renewed interest in electoral college reform proposals in Congress. Despite this, reform does not seem to be a pressing public issue currently, given the challenges of amending the Constitution and changing opinions among Republican poll respondents. Given the slow progress of the National Popular Vote Initiative and the lack of substantial congressional support, the electoral college system is likely to remain unless there is a broad consensus for reform or abolition among the public and in Congress and the states."
