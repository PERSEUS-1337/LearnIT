    "content": "Section 202 of the Social Security Act states that benefits are paid through the month before the month in which a beneficiary dies, with no benefits paid for the month of death. This rule, in place since 1939, does not apply to Medicare, which provides benefits up to the date of death. Social Security benefits are paid monthly, with payments issued in the following month. If a beneficiary dies late in the month, family members may not notify the SSA in time to stop the payment, resulting in the need to return the check to the government. Critics argue that withholding Social Security benefits for the month of death is unfair and cruel, as bills and funeral expenses still need to be paid. They highlight the discrepancy between beneficiaries who die on the last day of the month and receive no benefits, compared to those who die shortly after midnight and receive a full month's benefit. Critics question the policy of withholding Social Security benefits for the month of death, finding it unfair and cruel. They argue that the system discredits itself by appearing arbitrary and bureaucratic. The current policy of withholding Social Security benefits for the month of death is being debated. Supporters argue that paying benefits for the month of death would be costly, with estimates ranging from $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion annually. Alternative proposals include paying 50% of the benefit if the beneficiary dies in the first half of the month, and a full benefit if they die in the second half, or prorating the benefit based on the number of days the beneficiary was alive in the final month. Additionally, there is a proposal to pay a full benefit for the month of death to a surviving spouse. The proposal to pay Social Security benefits for the month of death would increase payments by $13.2 billion over 10 years. Survivor benefits are payable starting from the month of death, and a lump-sum death payment of $255 may be received by eligible family members. The Social Security Administration faces challenges in determining who should receive the deceased beneficiary's benefit for the month of death, as more than 2 million beneficiaries die each year. This process would require careful investigation and consideration, similar to regular benefit applications, with potential costs and administrative difficulties."
