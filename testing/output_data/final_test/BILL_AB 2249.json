    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The California Heritage Protection Act, also known as the California Heritage Protection Act, recognizes the historic significance of national, state, and regional parks in California, specifically highlighting Yosemite National Park and the Ahwahnee Hotel. The Act aims to preserve these historic landmarks for future generations. Curry Village and Wawona Hotel in Yosemite Valley are historic landmarks on the National Register of Historic Places. California state park venues are held in trust for the people and trademark claims on park names are seen as detrimental to the state's cultural heritage. An agreement compromising Californians' interests is considered \"ultra vires\" for a California state agency. Legislation clarifies that concession contracts in state parks do not grant trademark rights to park names or resources. Concessionaires making trademark claims should be disqualified. Contracts for state park occupancy over two years must be awarded to the best bidder. The \"best responsible bidder\" for a concession contract in state parks must operate in line with specific standards, be compatible with the park's characteristics, and protect the state's trademark rights. Concession contracts must include certain provisions, and concessionaires making trademark claims should be disqualified. The maximum term for concession contracts in state parks is 10 years, with the possibility of extending up to 20 years under certain circumstances determined by the director. Renewals of contracts are subject to competitive bidding requirements. The maximum term for concession contracts for multiple-unit lodging facilities exceeding $1,500,000 in capital improvements is 50 years, subject to competitive bidding requirements for renewals. Concession agreements at Will Rogers State Beach executed before December 31, 1997, can be extended beyond 20 years with director approval if necessary for amortizing improvements exceeding $1,500,000. Concessionaires must submit tax returns and financial statements, and all concessions are subject to department audits. (c) Concessions are audited by the department. \n(d) Concessionaire must have a performance bond or deposit funds approved by the department. \n(e) Concessionaire must have liability insurance naming the state as an additional insured. \n(f) Discrimination based on certain characteristics is prohibited. \n(g) Any changes to the concession contract must be in writing. To modify a concession contract, it must be in writing. If the contract is terminated for a substantial breach, the state is not required to buy any improvements made by the concessionaire. If a concessionaire claims trademark rights in violation of the law, they may lose the right to bid on future state park contracts. If a concessionaire files a trademark application related to a state park venue in bad faith and the state successfully opposes it, the concessionaire is liable for the state's legal fees. Concession contracts must include specific provisions, including those related to modifications and termination for breach. The maximum term for concession contracts is 10 years, extendable up to 20 years with specific authorization. Renewals are subject to competitive bidding requirements.

The bidder will not be awarded a contract if they make a legal claim to have a trademark interest in violation of the law. The department must provide a denied bidder with a written notice and a chance to challenge the denial at a formal hearing. Starting January 1, 2017, any contract violating certain provisions will be void. This does not affect valid trademark rights held before the contract. Section 4.5 of the bill includes amendments to the Public Resources Code, contingent on specific conditions being met."
