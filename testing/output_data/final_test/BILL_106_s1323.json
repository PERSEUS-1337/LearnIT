It also addresses the disposition of property. The \"TVA Customer Protection Act of 1999\" amends the Federal Power Act to include the Tennessee Valley Authority in the definition of a public utility and addresses the disposition of property, exempting TVA from certain regulations if proceeds are used to reduce debt. SEC. 4. FOREIGN OPERATIONS; PROTECTIONS. Section 208 of the Federal Power Act is amended to limit charges by the Tennessee Valley Authority, prohibiting any rates or charges related to activities outside the United States. The Tennessee Valley Authority must annually report its activities outside the United States to the Commission, with regulations ensuring just and reasonable rates. The Tennessee Valley Authority must report its international activities to the Commission annually and certify that costs have not been included in any filed rates. SEC. 5. TVA POWER SALES AND PROPERTY VALUATION. An amendment to the Federal Power Act adds a section regarding TVA power sales. The Tennessee Valley Authority is restricted from selling electric power to a retail customer within a specific area unless certain conditions are met, such as the customer already purchasing power from TVA or the distributor agreeing to the sale. Retail sales of electric power are subject to specific rates, terms, and conditions. The Tennessee Valley Authority's retail sales of electric power are subject to state regulation, and they cannot construct or acquire electric generation capacity without a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the Commission. The Commission will issue a certificate of public convenience and necessity for the construction or acquisition of electric generation capacity if the reserve power margin of the Tennessee Valley Authority is less than 15 percent and expected to remain so for at least 1 year without new capacity. The Energy Information Administration must determine that there is no commercially reasonable option to purchase power from the wholesale market to meet the needs of the area where the Tennessee Valley Authority operates. The proposed construction or acquisition must be the only commercially reasonable way to fulfill the firm contractual obligations of the Tennessee Valley Authority in that area. The Tennessee Valley Authority can only be a power supply source within its permitted area. The electric generation capacity authorized should not expand TVA's supply area where it is prohibited by law. The capacity must be fully subscribed for use by customers within TVA's original power supply area. \"SEC. 216. VALUATION OF CERTAIN TVA PROPERTY.\" The Commission must hold an evidentiary hearing within 120 days to determine the value of Tennessee Valley Authority's property used for electric service. They will use procedures similar to those for public utilities and issue a final order in a timely manner. The Commission must issue a final order within 1 year of the hearing to determine the value of Tennessee Valley Authority's property for electric service. Recovery of stranded costs can be awarded only after the final order is issued. Tennessee Valley Authority must file all rates and charges within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The curr_chunk discusses the classifications, practices, and regulations related to rates and charges, as well as contracts affecting contracts required to be filed under the Federal Power Act. SEC. 6. FILING AND FULL DISCLOSURE OF TVA DOCUMENTS. Amends Part III of the Federal Power Act to include new section 319 for filing and full disclosure of TVA documents. SEC. 319 requires the Tennessee Valley Authority to file and disclose documents as other public utilities do under the Act. The Commission must regulate this within a year of enactment, considering practices for other utilities. SEC. 17 of the Tennessee Valley Authority Act amends the Antitrust Laws' applicability. The Antitrust Laws, as defined in this section, include the Clayton Act, Robinson Patman Act, and section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The Tennessee Valley Authority is considered a person, not government, under the antitrust laws. These laws are not modified, impaired, or superseded by this Act. The antitrust laws apply to the Tennessee Valley Authority regardless of its classification as a corporate agency or engagement in governmental functions. SEC. 8. SAVINGS PROVISION. Defines \"TVA distributor\" as a cooperative or publicly owned electric power system purchasing power from TVA. The Act does not subject TVA distributors to FERC regulation or affect existing laws. The Tennessee Valley Authority Act of 1933 is amended to restrict the Corporation from renting or selling construction equipment, providing maintenance or repair services, performing contract construction work, or offering engineering services to private or public entities, except for electrical contractors engaged in electrical utility work. The Corporation may provide equipment or services to power customers, distributors, or governmental entities engaged in electrical utility projects. Used construction equipment is defined as equipment with over 2,500 hours of service. The Corporation can auction off used construction equipment with over 2,500 hours of service to reduce debt. Authorization of appropriations is granted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to carry out the Act and its amendments."
