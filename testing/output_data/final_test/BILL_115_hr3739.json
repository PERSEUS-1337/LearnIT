The monetary allowance for former Presidents is subject to limitations, with adjustments based on specific criteria. The applicable reduction amount for former Presidents is defined based on their earned income exceeding $400,000 in a 12-month period. Joint returns are considered for this calculation. The dollar amount allocated to the former President and their spouse is adjusted for cost-of-living increases.

The Secretary of the Treasury or their delegate must be disclosed return information by a former President to receive a monetary allowance.
