    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Iran Freedom and Support Act of 2004\". Congress finds that the people of the United States have a long history of interest in the well-being of Iran, with individuals like Howard Baskerville and Dr. Samuel Martin making significant contributions to Iranian society. Iran was a key ally of the United States until the late 1970s, serving as a regional ally and a bulwark against Soviet influence. Following the seizure of the United States Embassy in Tehran, Iran by students and extremists, Ayatollah Khomeini expressed support for the hostage-taking. Despite Mohammad Khatami's victory in the 1997 presidential election, control of Iran's affairs remains with the courts, Revolutionary Guards, Supreme Leader, and Council of Guardians. The May 1997 election in Iran showed support for economic and political reforms and greater interaction with the West. However, key Iranian groups like Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and others oppose opening up to Western influences and changing US-Iran relations. Iran has been identified as the leading sponsor of international terrorism by the Department of State for the past two decades. They have been linked to various terrorist attacks against American military and civilian personnel, including the Hezbollah suicide bombings in Beirut in 1983 and attacks in Saudi Arabia in 1996 and 2004. Iran has provided support and a safe haven for terrorist groups like al Qaeda, Islamic Jihad, and Ansar al Islam. Iran operates radio and television stations in Iraq supporting violent actions against US and coalition personnel. Iranian leaders have called for killing Americans in Iraq and are believed to be pursuing a clandestine nuclear weapons program. They have also failed to extradite foreign terrorists. The United States Government accuses Iran of supporting terrorists in Iraq to undermine peace efforts. Iran successfully tested the Shahab-3 missile in 2003, capable of targeting Israel and US troops in the Middle East and Afghanistan. Congress believes the US should support regime change in Iran and transition to a democratic government. Assistance is proposed to aid in this transition. The President is authorized to provide assistance to pro-democracy groups in Iran, including grants to radio and television broadcasting organizations. Assistance is only for those who renounce terrorism, adhere to nonproliferation regimes, support destruction of weapons of mass destruction, and advocate for a democratic government in Iran. The President is authorized to provide assistance to pro-democracy groups in Iran dedicated to democratic values, human rights, equality, freedom of religious worship, equality of opportunity, freedom of the press, speech, and association. Funding can come from the Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI), National Endowment for Democracy (NED), and authorized appropriations. The President must notify relevant congressional committees 15 days before providing assistance under this section. A senior member of the National Security Council will be appointed to coordinate federal agencies on Iran matters. Congress supports expanding contacts with opposition groups in Iran meeting specified criteria and transitioning to democracy in Iran. Support for transition to democracy in Iran should be expressed by US officials in international forums. Official meetings with Iranian government representatives should be stopped. Efforts to halt Iran's nuclear weapons program, including cutting off the supply of nuclear components, should be intensified. US officials should also back indigenous efforts in Iran for a national referendum on the government's form, highlighting human rights violations by the Iranian government. The US should express support for democracy in Iran and halt Iran's nuclear weapons program. $10,000,000 is authorized for State Department activities related to human rights violations in Iran. SEC. 5. DESIGNATION OF DEMOCRATIC OPPOSITION ORGANIZATIONS.\n\n(a) The President should designate at least one democratic opposition organization as eligible for assistance under section 4 within 90 days of this Act.\n(b) The President must notify relevant Congressional committees at least 15 days before designating a democratic opposition organization for assistance.\n\nSEC. 6. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.\n\nNothing in this Act allows the use of the US Armed Forces for activities under this Act."
