    "content": "Chad, a landlocked country bordering Libya and Sudan, has a history of conflict and civil war since gaining independence from France in 1960. Despite having significant oil reserves, persistent conflict has hindered its development, leading to high child mortality rates and widespread corruption. Chad is among the world's 10 poorest countries, with one in five children dying before the age of five. Foreign Policy magazine ranked Chad as the second on its 2009 Failed States Index. The country's population is diverse, with approximately 200 ethnic groups, predominantly Muslim Arab and non-Arab groups in the north. Chad has a diverse population with predominantly Muslim Arab and non-Arab groups in the north, and indigenous groups practicing Christian and traditional beliefs in the south. The country has been politically unstable since 1965, with years of authoritarian rule and civil war. President Idriss D\u00e9by Itno took power by force in 1989, pledging to establish a democratic multi-party system. Former President Hissein Habr\u00e9 was forced into exile and sentenced to death in absentia for human rights abuses. President Idriss D\u00e9by Itno of Chad, who came to power in 1991, promised a democratic multi-party system. Despite irregularities and fraud in elections, D\u00e9by won re-election in 2001 and his party secured a majority in legislative elections in 2002. The opposition boycotted the 2006 elections after D\u00e9by was allowed a third term. A dialogue with the opposition led to the postponement of legislative elections to 2009 for a new census and electoral commission. New elections were scheduled for November 10, 2010. The opposition holds half the seats on the electoral commission for the upcoming elections in Chad, but concerns remain about its credibility. Presidential elections are expected in April 2011. Tensions between the government and opposition escalated after the 2008 arrest of opposition leaders. European donors support the 2007 political accord and will provide technical assistance for the elections. President D\u00e9by appointed a new prime minister in April 2008 and included former political opponents in high-level cabinet positions, seen as a move towards inclusive governance. However, some viewed it as an attempt to divide the weak and fragmented opposition. In March 2010, another prime minister was appointed after corruption allegations led to the resignation of the previous office holder. President D\u00e9by has faced coup attempts due to perceived lack of democratic legitimacy, leading to armed efforts to oust him. Rebel alliances, including defectors from the government, gained strength in the east in 2005-2006. In 2005-2006, rebel alliances, including defectors from the government, gained strength in the east and launched raids on government positions. Inter-communal violence also increased. Rebels attacked the capital, N'Djamena, in April 2006, leading to a state of emergency declared by D\u00e9by. Critics accused him of using the state of emergency to silence opposition. Despite a peace agreement signed in 2007, fighting continued sporadically, with rebel forces attempting to overthrow D\u00e9by in 2008. In 2008, rebel groups unsuccessfully tried to overthrow President D\u00e9by in Chad, resulting in civilian casualties and mass displacement. The rebels later formed a unified alliance, UFR, led by Timane Erdimi, D\u00e9by's nephew, but were repelled by Chadian forces in May 2009. The UFR faced internal conflicts and struggled against the Chadian military. The Chadian rebel group has faced internal conflicts and is at a strategic disadvantage against the Chadian military's air power. Ethnic rivalries and violence within the Zaghawa tribe, which holds a majority of government positions despite being a small percentage of the population, have added to the complexity of the situation. The emergence of a new rebel grouping, ANCD, led by Mahamat Nouri, has further complicated the conflict in Chad. The conflict in Darfur has led to a humanitarian crisis in Chad, with over 2 million Sudanese displaced and many fleeing into Chad. This has increased social tensions and political instability in the region, with accusations of both countries sponsoring rebellions against each other despite peace agreements signed in 2007 and 2008. Chad and Sudan have accused each other of backing rebel groups in cross-border attacks, leading to diplomatic tensions and military strikes. Despite peace agreements in 2007 and 2008, allegations of support for rebel groups persist, with renewed diplomatic ties in 2008 and another agreement in 2009. The conflict in Darfur has exacerbated the humanitarian crisis in Chad, with millions displaced and fleeing into the country. The Sudanese Air Force bombed a refugee camp in Chad in May 2009, leading to further bombing raids by Chad in Darfur in July. Diplomatic talks resumed in October, culminating in an agreement signed in January 2010 to deny rebel groups the use of their territories and normalize relations. Relations between Chad and Sudan improved significantly, with trade across the border resuming in April 2010. In April 2010, points closed since 2003 reopened. Chad and Sudan deployed a 3,000-strong cross-border force to combat criminal activity and armed opposition groups. Chadian immigration officials forced Darfur rebel leader Khalil Ibrahim to return to Libya. Refugee camps in eastern Chad and the south house Sudanese, CAR, and displaced Chadian refugees, facing shortages of water and firewood. In 2007, Chad tightened oversight of NGOs and increased travel restrictions, hindering humanitarian assistance delivery due to insecurity in the east. Violence and criminal activity in the region have led to looting of aid compounds, threats, attacks, and kidnappings of aid workers. Some groups had to suspend operations or remove international staff. The director of Save the Children, a French national, was killed in May 2008. In 2008, the director of Save the Children, a French national, was killed. President D\u00e9by initially opposed a peacekeeping force but later accepted a multinational presence in Chad and the Central African Republic for protection and humanitarian assistance. In 2008, the director of Save the Children was killed. President D\u00e9by initially opposed a peacekeeping force but later accepted a multinational presence in Chad and the Central African Republic for protection and humanitarian assistance. Resolution 1778 led to the creation of two multinational bodies, a U.N. mission (MINURCAT) and an EU military force (EUFOR), working together to create favorable conditions for reconstruction and development. MINURCAT focused on police training and judicial infrastructure, while EUFOR provided general security for civilians and facilitated humanitarian assistance. Some officials expressed concerns about the complexity of having two separate international missions in Chad. The EU force in Chad faced challenges with deployment due to funding and logistical issues. Rebel groups viewed the force as a foreign occupation army, leading to criticism from President D\u00e9by and aid groups for not engaging the rebel advance effectively. Despite delays, the force reached initial operating capacity with 3,300 troops deployed by December 2008. The EU force in Chad faced challenges with deployment due to funding and logistical issues. Under Security Council Resolution 1834, EUFOR transferred authority to a U.N. military component on March 15, 2009. MINURCAT was authorized to have 5,200 troops but faced deployment delays, with less than 3,000 troops deployed by the end of 2009. The force stood at 3,442 troops as of late April 2010, impeding its ability to protect IDPs, refugees, and humanitarian staff. In January 2010, the Chadian government requested the United Nations not to renew the mandate of MINURCAT's military component due to slow troop deployment and improved security in the east. The Security Council extended the mandate until May 2010, and further extensions were made through Resolutions 1913, 1922, and 1923. Resolution 1923 extended MINURCAT's mandate until December 31, 2010, with a gradual reduction of its military component and transfer of civilian protection responsibilities to Chadian security forces. The Chadian government committed to ensuring security and protection of civilians, facilitating humanitarian aid delivery, and ensuring the safety of MINURCAT staff. A joint Chad-U.N. Working Group will monitor progress on civilian protection benchmarks. Resolution 1923 mandates MINURCAT to reduce its military personnel to 2,200 by July 15, 2010, with a complete withdrawal by December 31, 2010. The resolution allows MINURCAT to provide security for U.N. personnel and conduct medical evacuations if necessary. MINURCAT can also respond to imminent threats of violence to civilians in consultation with the Government of Chad. Some humanitarian officials are concerned about a \"security vacuum\" in the east due to the withdrawal of the U.N. force. MINURCAT trained a local police unit, DIS, to take over security for refugee camps. DIS patrols have improved security and freedom of movement in the camps, with support from the U.N. trust fund. Support from DIS, MINURCAT, and other U.N. agencies has helped build judicial and corrections capacity in eastern Chad. U.N. reports highlight challenges such as a lack of resources and infrastructure in the justice sector, hindering efforts to address high criminality levels. Up to 10,000 children may have been used by rebel groups and the national army, prompting the government to sign an agreement with UNICEF to end recruitment of persons under 18. The Chadian government has made efforts to address child recruitment in the military, granting access to international organizations to verify and release children. Despite progress, child recruitment by the army and armed groups continued in 2009, with 26 cases documented by MINURCAT. The United Nations remains concerned about the situation. The United Nations expresses concern about child recruitment by rebel groups in Chad, including the Justice and Equality Movement. Droughts and locust infestations impact food production, leading to high malnutrition rates. In 2009, cereal production dropped by 34%, with almost half of the population classified as food insecure. Over 16% of children under five suffer from acute malnutrition, and almost 40% of Chadian children are chronically malnourished. The World Food Program warns that 60% of households in the western Sahelian region of Chad, totaling 1.6 million people, are currently food insecure. The shrinking Lake Chad, a vital water source, is expected to dry up completely in the next 20 years, affecting 30 million people in Chad, Cameroon, Niger, and Nigeria. Experts suggest major changes to water management to prevent a humanitarian disaster. Chad's oil production began in 2003 with hopes of economic growth. Corruption and instability threaten progress in the oil sector. The $4 billion Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Project faced World Bank funding suspension in 2006 due to revenue mismanagement. Chad increased military spending and changed its revenue management law, leading to a compromise with the World Bank in 2006. The World Bank withdrew in 2008 but continues to engage with Chad. The IMF praised Chad for its poverty reduction strategy in 2010 and pressured the government to revise its budget in response. Chad revised its 2010 budget under pressure from the IMF due to declines in oil and agricultural production, leading to a decrease in real GDP growth. Oil production has also decreased, with Chad becoming a candidate country in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative in 2010. The United States is the largest donor of humanitarian assistance to Chad, providing almost $700 million since FY2004. The Obama Administration has requested $7.38 million in non-emergency assistance for FY2011, mainly for health and agricultural development programs. U.S. foreign policy priorities in Chad include promoting regional stability, democracy, and reducing extremism. The U.S. is a major donor of humanitarian aid to Chad, with a focus on promoting regional stability, democracy, and reducing extremism. FY2009 Economic Support Fund resources are used for election preparations. USAID assistance in Chad is overseen by regional offices in Ghana and Senegal. The U.S. Embassy in N'Djamena operates a Democracy and Development section to administer foreign aid programs. Peace Corps program in Chad closed in 2006. The State Department has issued a travel warning for U.S. citizens traveling in Chad, advising extreme caution and avoiding certain areas due to violent crime. USAID is concerned about the withdrawal of MINURCAT impacting relief efforts and aid worker safety. The U.S. government views the D\u00e9by government as an ally in countering violent extremism. AQIM has been associated with smuggling in Chad but has not conducted attacks in the country. The United States provides military assistance to Chad through various programs, including the Trans-Saharan Counter-Terrorism Partnership (TSCTP). Chad has received over $8 million in military aid since FY2005, with additional support for tactical airlift capacity in FY2007. Other security assistance is funded through State Department programs. The United States provides military assistance to Chad through various programs, including the Trans-Saharan Counter-Terrorism Partnership (TSCTP). Chad has received over $8 million in military aid since FY2005, with additional support for tactical airlift capacity in FY2007. In addition, the U.S. provides bilateral security assistance to Chad to professionalize and modernize its security forces, with a focus on promoting democratic values and respect for human rights. The State Department's FY2011 budget request includes funding for International Military Education and Training (IMET) and Foreign Military Financing (FMF) to continue training for the Chadian police force. Demining assistance was discontinued in 2007 due to institutional weakness and a lack of political will to address the problem. Landmines in Chad continue to kill hundreds annually, with 80% of victims being children. Congress has shown concern for the violence and humanitarian crisis in the region through legislation and hearings. Conflict with rebels, refugee inflows from Darfur, and ethnic tensions raise concerns for Chad's future. President D\u00e9by has made limited progress toward democracy, but human rights conditions remain poor. Chad's President D\u00e9by has made limited progress towards democracy, with poor human rights conditions and lack of transparency. Reports of human rights abuses, including sexual violence in conflict zones, are high. International assistance and oil revenues could help improve governance and economic growth, but donor frustration may impact future support. Without political and economic reforms, popular resentment could perpetuate instability."
