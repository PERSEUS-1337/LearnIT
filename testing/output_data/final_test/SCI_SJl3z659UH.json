    "content": "Advances in document intelligence are driving the need for a unified technology that integrates OCR with various NLP tasks, especially semantic parsing. A consolidated dataset for receipt parsing has been published, containing images and annotations for OCR, and multi-level semantic labels for parsing. This dataset can be used for various OCR and parsing tasks, addressing the need for integrated post-OCR parsing. Deep learning has improved OCR performance in computer vision, but there is still room for improvement, especially in tasks linked to NLP. Post-OCR parsing is a crucial challenge in both OCR and NLP communities, aiming to predict semantic labels from OCR. Datasets for this task have limitations, with OCR datasets lacking parsing labels and parsing datasets containing error-free texts. Synthetic noise can be added to parsing data to address this issue. The availability of post-OCR parsing datasets, like the SROIE dataset from the ICDAR 2019 Post-OCR Challenge, has sparked active research in the field. However, these datasets still have limitations such as limited data size and lack of box-level parsing annotations. In this paper, a novel dataset called CORD is introduced for post-OCR parsing. It includes box-level text and parsing class annotations with eight superclasses and 54 subclasses. The dataset also provides line annotations for the serialization task, addressing the limitations of current semantic parsing techniques. In this paper, a novel dataset called CORD is introduced for post-OCR parsing, providing multi-level labels for weakly and strongly supervised parsing tasks. The dataset includes box-level text and parsing class annotations, with a focus on serialization techniques for mapping texts into one-dimensional space. Over 11,000 Indonesian receipt images were collected through crowd-sourcing, with guidelines provided for crowd workers. The curr_chunk discusses the creation of guidelines and an annotation tool for crowd workers to parse receipt structures. The tool has two user accounts: annotator and inspector, to ensure compliance with guidelines. The process involved sampling receipts, defining parse categories, and redesigning them through pilot annotation. A web-based annotation tool was developed for efficient annotation by crowd workers. The receipts dataset consists of over 11,000 image and JSON pairs with sensitive information removed through blurring and deletion. The ground truth includes meta, valid line field, quad field, and text field for OCR tasks. Only optically identifiable text instances are included. The dataset includes annotations for parsing tasks with fields like category, is_key, and row_id. The row_id indexes lines, with text instances on the same line sharing the same row_id. The is_key flag identifies key words in the text. Dataset statistics are presented in Table 1, with eight superclasses including store, payment, menu, and total. The dataset includes annotations for parsing tasks with fields like category, is_key, and row_id. The row_id indexes lines, with text instances on the same line sharing the same row_id. The is_key flag identifies key words in the text. The dataset consists of eight superclasses, such as store, payment, and menu, with 54 subclasses. The top 20 class labels from 1,000 randomly sampled data examples show that menu is the most frequent class label. The proposed receipt dataset is designed for OCR-parsing tasks, considering the complex nature of receipt documents with numbers, symbols, and various layout types. The dataset for OCR-parsing tasks includes multi-level class labels for eight superclasses and 54 subclasses. Initially, 1,000 samples will be released, with 800 for training, 100 for development, and 100 for testing. Sensitive information will be carefully examined and removed to avoid legal issues."
