    "content": "The Construction Quality Assurance Act of 2000 may be cited as the \"Construction Quality Assurance Act.\" Congress finds that specialty subcontractors play a significant role in the construction industry, with their price and performance being crucial in the overall cost of construction projects. Detrimental practices like \"bid shopping\" and \"bid peddling\" exist in the industry, including on projects for the Federal Government. \"Bid shopping\" involves contractors contracting with subcontractors at a lower price than originally quoted, after being awarded a contract. Bid shopping and bid peddling threaten the integrity of the competitive bid system for construction, benefiting the Federal Government, the construction industry, and the economy. Bid shopping and bid peddling threaten the integrity of the competitive bid system for construction in the United States, depriving taxpayers of benefits, exposing projects to substandard performance, and can be deterred by modifying the Federal Acquisition Regulation to require bid listing. The practice of requiring subcontractor listing in Federal construction contracts helps deter bid shopping and bid peddling, ensuring integrity in the competitive bid system. The Government-wide Federal Acquisition Regulation will be revised to implement the provisions of the Act within 120 days of enactment, with a 60-day public comment period. Final regulations must be published within 180 days of enactment and will take effect 30 days after publication. Additionally, federal contractors on construction projects will have requirements regarding subcontractors. Each solicitation for construction over $1,000,000 must include bidder's subcontractor details for work over $100,000. Bidders can list one subcontractor per work category, or multiple for discreet portions within a category. Bidders must list subcontractors for work over $100,000 in construction projects over $1,000,000. They can list themselves for specific portions of work, and failure to list subcontractors may result in being deemed non-responsible. Contractors cannot substitute subcontractors without the consent of the contracting officer for good cause. Examples of good cause for substituting subcontractors without the contracting officer's consent include failure to execute a written contract, subcontractor bankruptcy, death or disability of the subcontractor, dissolution of the subcontractor, or failure to meet surety requirements. Failure of a subcontractor to meet surety bond requirements specified by the bidder, subcontractor ineligibility due to suspension or debarment, repeated failures by the subcontractor to perform as per contract terms, and failure to comply with regulations. Failure of a subcontractor to comply with laws, perform the subcontract, or meet surety bond requirements may result in substitution. The contractor must submit a written request for substitution to the contracting officer, who will notify the subcontractor for objections within five working days. The contractor must obtain consent from the contracting officer for any subcontract assignment, transfer, or substitution. Failure to file objections to a substitution will be considered as consent from the subcontractor. The contracting officer must promptly approve any substitution in writing and include it in the contract file. Contractors cannot subcontract work they listed themselves for without consent. A contractor must obtain approval from the contracting officer before subcontracting any listed work. Failure to do so may result in the imposition of liquidated damages. Subcontractors can also be held liable if they knowingly participate in the contractor's failure to comply. Liquidated damages may be imposed if a subcontractor knowingly participates in the contractor's failure to comply with regulatory provisions regarding subcontractor substitution. The amount of damages imposed will be determined based on specific criteria outlined in the regulations. The imposition of liquidated damages on a contractor or subcontractor for failure to comply with subcontractor substitution procedures may indicate a lack of business integrity affecting government contractor responsibility. The Federal Acquisition Regulation will be modified to comply with this requirement. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines a \"contractor\" as an entity that contracts with an executive agency for construction exceeding $1,000,000 and a \"subcontract\" as an entity subcontracting with a contractor for work exceeding $100,000 on a construction contract exceeding $1,000,000 with an executive agency."
