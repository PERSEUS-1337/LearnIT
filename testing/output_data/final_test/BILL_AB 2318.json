    "title": "AB 2318",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 54964.5 of the Government Code is amended to prohibit the use of public resources by nonprofit organizations for unauthorized contributions or expenditures. The term \"local agency\" includes public entities created under the Joint Exercise of Powers Act. A nonprofit organization is defined as an entity incorporated under the Nonprofit Corporation Law or one that qualifies for tax-exempt status. Public resources refer to property owned by a local agency provided to a nonprofit organization, excluding funds received for goods or services. A publicly funded nonprofit organization receives funds from conduit bond financing activities subject to transparency provisions. Public resources account for over 20% of its annual revenue. \"Use\" refers to substantial gain or loss from local agency resources. The section allows the use of public resources for authorized expenditures, including supporting or opposing ballot measures or candidates, minimal use of resources, and costs related to establishing or running a sponsored committee. Providing accurate and impartial information to the public about the potential impact of a ballot measure on state or local agency activities, operations, or policies, as long as it meets certain conditions outlined in the California Constitution and state laws. Any person who violates this section is liable for a civil penalty up to $1,000 per day, plus three times the value of the unlawful use of public resources. The penalty will be enforced by the Attorney General, district attorney, or city attorney, with joint liability for multiple violators. Penalties recovered will go to the General Fund, county treasurer, or city treasury, depending on who brings the action. A civil action for violating the time limit must be filed within four years. Section 54964.6 of the Government Code is repealed, and a new section 84222.5 is added, requiring publicly funded nonprofit organizations to use a separate bank account for contributions and expenditures. Violators may face civil penalties enforced by the Attorney General, district attorney, or city attorney. Publicly funded nonprofit organizations must comply with registration and reporting requirements if they make significant contributions or expenditures related to candidates or ballot measures. They are also required to use a separate bank account for these transactions to avoid penalties enforced by legal authorities. Publicly funded nonprofit organizations must provide and display required disclosure information to the Commission and on their website, clearly identified on a separate webpage linked from the homepage. The link must be prominently displayed. The Commission may require an audit of publicly funded nonprofit organizations that exceed $500,000 in contributions or expenditures in a calendar year. If a violation is found, a civil fine of up to $10,000 per violation may be imposed by the Commission, Attorney General, or district attorney. The bill does not require reimbursement under the California Constitution as it pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes. The Legislature states that the bill aligns with the Political Reform Act of 1974."
