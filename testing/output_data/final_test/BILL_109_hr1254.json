    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Farm Animal Identification and Records Act\" and introduces a nationwide livestock identification system under the Animal Health Protection Act. The National Farm Animal Identification and Records Act mandates the establishment of an electronic nationwide livestock identification system within 90 days. This system aims to enhance disease outbreak response by tracing livestock from birth to slaughter within 48 hours, covering all livestock in the US regardless of state boundaries. The Secretary will cooperate with States for implementation. The Secretary is authorized to cooperate with States to secure information for the livestock identification system and provide access to it. Existing technology can be used, and financial assistance will be given to producers to comply with system requirements, ensuring smaller operations are not disadvantaged financially. The Secretary is authorized to cooperate with States to secure information for the livestock identification system and provide financial assistance to producers for compliance. Information obtained through the system is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and is considered privileged and confidential commercial information. The Secretary may release limited information as authorized. The Secretary may release information obtained through the livestock identification system regarding specific livestock if it involves disease or pest threats, is related to actions under this subtitle, and is needed for public health and safety reasons. Limited release of information is required by the Secretary. The Secretary may disclose information from the livestock identification system to the owner, Attorney General, Homeland Security Secretary, court, or foreign government for disease or pest tracing purposes. If there is a conflict with state law, the federal requirements prevail. The subsection takes precedence over state law in conflicts involving interstate or international commerce, while state law prevails in conflicts involving intrastate commerce. $175,000,000 is authorized for the Secretary to carry out this section. The Animal Health Protection Act is amended to allow the Secretary of Agriculture to appoint an international panel of experts to review the Department's responses to livestock disease outbreaks and suggest improvements."
