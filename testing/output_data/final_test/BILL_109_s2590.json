In this section, the term \"entity\" includes various types of organizations, both for profit and nonprofit, as well as subcontractors and subgrantees. It does not include individual recipients of federal assistance or federal employees. The term \"Federal award\" refers to federal financial assistance and expenditures. Federal financial assistance and expenditures include grants, loans, contracts, and other forms of financial aid, excluding transactions below $25,000 and credit card transactions before October 1, 2008. A searchable website allows the public to search and aggregate federal funding by various elements and ascertain the total amount awarded to an entity by fiscal year. The Office of Management and Budget must ensure a single searchable website by January 1, 2008, accessible to the public at no cost, containing details of each Federal award, including recipient name and award amount. The website mandated by the Office of Management and Budget must include details of each Federal award, such as the award amount, transaction type, funding agency, location of the recipient entity, unique identifiers, and any other relevant information specified. The data on the website should cover fiscal year 2007 and onwards. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget can designate Federal agencies to support a single website. Agencies must follow guidance to ensure the website's operation. The website will display Federal award details from fiscal year 2007 onwards. The Act allows the use of specific data sources for information, but requires that the website allows for direct searches without linking to external websites. The website for Federal awards must allow for separate searches to distinguish between different types of awards, provide a public input opportunity, and be updated within 30 days of award. Additionally, a pilot program will test data collection for subgrants and subcontracts. To implement a subaward reporting program across the Federal Government. The subaward reporting program includes a reporting system where the entity issuing a subgrant or subcontract is responsible for meeting reporting requirements, and a mechanism for collecting feedback on the website's design and utility. The pilot program for subaward reporting shall terminate by January 1, 2009. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget must ensure that subaward data is disclosed in the same manner as other Federal awards by that date.

The Director of the Office of Management and Budget may extend the deadline for subaward recipients receiving Federal funds through State, local, or tribal governments to disclose data for up to 18 months if compliance is burdensome. Entities with gross income under $300,000 are exempt from reporting subawards until the Director determines it won't be burdensome.

The Director shall submit an annual report on the website's implementation, including data on usage and public feedback. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget may extend the subaward reporting deadline if necessary. Reports submitted will be made publicly available on the designated website. SEC. 3.
