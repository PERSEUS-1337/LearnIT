    "content": "Congressional policymakers have expressed concern about the safety of facilities storing hazardous chemicals, especially after September 11, 2001. Some states enacted laws requiring security considerations at chemical facilities, leading to debates in Congress about federal regulation. In 2006, the 109th Congress passed legislation giving the Department of Homeland Security authority to regulate chemical facilities for security purposes, which has been extended by subsequent Congresses. This authority is set to expire on March 27, 2013. The Obama Administration has requested an extension of statutory authority for chemical facility security until October 4, 2013. Advocacy groups, stakeholders, and policymakers are calling for congressional reauthorization, with debates on the preferred approach. Congress may extend, revise, or allow the authority to lapse. The report outlines policy issues, options for congressional consideration, and legislation in the 112th Congress. The 112th Congress granted DHS authority to regulate chemical facilities for security, with some aspects left to the Secretary's discretion. The statute expires on March 27, 2013, but the Obama Administration requested an extension until October 4, 2013. DHS issued an interim final rule on CFATS on April 9, 2007, implementing both explicit and implicit authorities granted by Congress. Under the interim final rule, the Secretary of Homeland Security determines which chemical facilities must meet regulatory security requirements based on the risk posed by each facility. DHS lists 322 chemicals as \"chemicals of interest\" for compliance with CFATS, considering threats like release, theft, sabotage, and contamination. Facilities with specified quantities of dangerous chemicals must submit information to DHS for risk assessment, with exemptions for certain facility types. Facilities regulated under various federal agencies must meet CFATS requirements based on risk assessment by DHS. High-risk facilities are categorized into tiers with more stringent security requirements. All high-risk facilities must assess vulnerabilities, develop security plans, and implement them. The vulnerability assessment is crucial for determining facility risk tiers and evaluating security plan activities. Site security plans must address vulnerabilities, preparations for terrorist attacks, and compliance with DHS performance standards. DHS reviews and approves submitted documents, audits facilities, and ensures regulatory compliance. The DHS may disapprove vulnerability assessments or security plans that do not meet performance standards, but not due to specific security measures. Owners of chemical facilities can appeal DHS decisions. If a facility is found non-compliant, DHS will notify the facility of deficiencies, provide a chance to consult, and issue an order to comply by a deadline. Failure to comply may result in fines or cessation of operations. The rule outlines the appeal process for facilities, but third-party enforcement suits are prohibited. The interim final rule establishes protections for Chemical-terrorism Vulnerability Information (CVI), exempting it from disclosure under FOIA and similar laws. CVI is treated as classified information in judicial and administrative proceedings, with DHS having sole discretion on who can access it. Non-compliance with CVI disclosure rules may result in fines. The rule preempts state and local regulations that conflict with it. The DHS interim final rule preempts state and local regulations that conflict with federal regulations. States, localities, or companies can request a decision from DHS on potential conflicts. Congress amended the statute to require an \"actual conflict\" for preemption to occur, but DHS has not updated its regulations. The NPPD oversees chemical facility security regulations, including the CFATS program. This section reviews implementation, focusing on funding, regulated facilities, inspections, and internal reviews. The DHS received statutory authority to regulate chemical facilities in 2006 and has since increased staffing for the CFATS program. By February 2012, DHS had hired 102 inspectors out of a planned 108, along with 14 field leadership positions. Chemical inspectors assess security measures at facilities using performance-based criteria developed by DHS. Funding for the program has generally increased since its creation, but decreased since FY2011. The DHS has established a Basic Inspector School training program to help chemical inspectors assess performance-based security measures. The House of Representatives and the Senate Committee on Appropriations have recommended different funding levels for FY2013, with the House proposing $45 million. The Senate committee recommends $86 million for the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) program, stating that proposed cuts are too deep to ensure necessary improvements can be completed. They also direct DHS to retain at least 148 FTE inspectors for FY2013. The Senate committee recommends $86 million for the CFATS program to meet security requirements for high-risk chemical facilities. DHS estimates $35 million for salaries and benefits for 242 FTEs, leaving $12 million for program implementation. Insufficient funding would delay activities like reviewing SSPs and facility inspections. Maintaining CSAT and the Chemical-Security Management System would be impacted at the proposed $45.4 million funding level. The DHS has assessed over 41,000 chemical facilities, identifying 7,800 as high-risk and requiring vulnerability assessments. 4,433 facilities were placed into risk tiers, with Tier 1 being the highest risk. An anomaly in risk-assessment tools was discovered in May 2010, which was believed to be resolved but rediscovered in June 2011. In June 2011, a new acting ISCD Director rediscovered an issue with facility tiering, leading to DHS reassigning approximately 500 facilities to a lower risk tier. The number of facilities in the highest-risk tier was reduced by over 50%. Factors contributing to this decline include erroneous filings, process changes, and business decisions by regulated entities. The DHS has engaged in targeted outreach activities to ensure compliance with regulations for chemical facilities. The observed reduction in regulated facilities indicates increased security. Inspections of Tier 1 facilities have been delayed due to various factors, including the need to build an inspector cadre and establish regional infrastructure. The DHS began inspections of Tier 1 facilities in February 2010 with plans to inspect all by the end of 2010, but only nine inspections were done by September 2011. Despite expectations to finish by the end of 2011, only 10 site security plans were approved with no implementation. An interim review process was implemented, approving 73 site security plans by September 2012, with successful inspections at two facilities. The DHS inspected and approved site security plan implementation at two facilities. Annual performance measures for high-risk chemical facilities are set by DHS, with a target compliance goal not met in FY2008. In FY2011, DHS lowered the target goal to 9.1% compliance. No chemical facility had a successful authorization inspection according to DHS. The delay in the inspection schedule was attributed to the necessary iteration between DHS and regulated entities regarding site security plans. DHS issued 66 administrative orders for completion of plans and established a pre-authorization inspection process. Internal challenges within the Infrastructure Security Compliance Division led to an internal review. In December 2010, NPPD initiated a management review of ISCD due to challenges with regulated chemical facilities and locality pay. New leadership took charge in July 2011 and began a review of goals and corrective actions. A report presented to Under Secretary Beers in November 2011 focused on challenges faced by ISCD, including the delay in approving site security plans. The review report identified factors contributing to ISCD's lack of success, including compliance inspection inability, lack of records management system, human resource issues, and challenges in workplace requirements, security compliance, and workforce management. ISCD also faced difficulties in tracking consumable supplies, hiring qualified individuals, and managing waste fraud and abuse. The ISCD faced challenges in hiring qualified individuals, managing waste fraud and abuse, and lacked morale. The memorandum outlined top priorities to address these challenges, including clearing the backlog of security plans, developing a chemical inspection process, and addressing statutory responsibilities. A working group has been established to explore legislative and regulatory changes, with an action plan in place and oversight from NPPD leadership. Ongoing assessment and revisions are expected to ensure the plan's success. The ISCD has developed multiple versions of an action plan, completing 59 out of 95 action items. They have updated internal policies, created a review process for security plans, and are working on hiring a permanent leadership team. NPPD is overseeing the review process for assigning risk tiers to facilities. GAO has reviewed DHS progress and stated that ISCD is moving in the right direction. The GAO reviewed ISCD's action plan progress, noting positive direction but early to assess effectiveness due to lack of performance measures. GAO highlighted issues like missing documentation on decision-making and funding concerns for chemical facility security oversight. The regulation establishes oversight relying on DHS personnel inspecting chemical facilities to ensure implementation of approved security plans. Performance-based measures offer flexibility but may require more training and judgment from DHS. The DHS may face challenges in creating the necessary infrastructure for nationwide inspections of regulated facilities. Congressional oversight questions whether sufficient funds have been allocated for hiring and retaining staff for compliance inspections. Infrastructure Security Inspectors will be located in up to 10 field offices to ensure regulatory compliance at facilities covered by the CFATS regulation. Creating a fully functional cadre for nationwide inspections of regulated facilities by DHS involves recruiting and training staff, procuring equipment, acquiring office space, government vehicles, support staff, safety equipment, and clothing. The adequacy of funds depends on external factors like the number of regulated facilities and internal factors such as staff ratios and inspection timetables. Once facility tiers and inspection schedules are determined, DHS can conduct inspections more comprehensively. DHS is working on determining its resource needs by reviewing regulated facilities and their timetables. NPPD will conduct a manpower and systems review to identify the total number of inspectors. Two chemical facilities have completed the CFATS process as of September 2012. Training inspectors for CFATS inspections is crucial for the success of the program. The DHS has conducted 19 authorization inspections since 2010, with projections indicating it will take almost seven years to inspect all regulated facilities. Some policymakers question the pace of inspections and suggest accelerating the compliance process. Factors such as internal operations and insufficient detail in security plans may be slowing down the inspection process. The DHS implemented pre-authorization inspections to gather necessary information from regulated facilities, aiming to improve the quality of site security plan submissions. These inspections may be a drain on DHS resources but could expedite future authorization inspections, especially for higher risk tier facilities with complex operations and multiple chemicals of interest. Lower risk tier facilities may not require pre-authorization inspections. Some policymakers question if low inspection rates are due to constraints in hiring chemical facility security inspectors or funding availability. DHS regulations require inspections of site security plan implementation every 2-3 years for different facility tiers, totaling about 1,700 inspections annually. DHS claims inspections need two or more inspectors and a week to complete. The DHS may need to hire additional inspectors to address the backlog of site security plan submissions and consider temporary staff for assistance. Hiring more inspectors could reduce the backlog but may lead to unnecessary staff in the future. Training temporary staff for CFATS-specific inspections could pose challenges. DHS may face challenges in inspecting high-risk tier facilities, but could increase inspections by focusing on lower risk tier facilities. The original statute did not address federal preemption of state and local chemical facility security regulations. Advocates for federal preemption argue for a uniform security framework nationwide to prevent conflicting state regulations and potential competitive disadvantages for companies. Supporters of state regulation argue for the right to implement stricter regulations than the federal government for chemical facility security. They believe that allowing states to have more stringent regulations would enhance security measures. This could lead to conflicting state regulations preempting federal regulations if they mandate specific security approaches. The concern of retaining industries that may relocate due to increased regulations may influence states to not be overly stringent. If Congress allows the CFATS program to expire, states would regain responsibility for regulating chemical facility security. The program involves identifying vulnerabilities and creating security plans, with information classified as CVI to prevent disclosure. Some advocate for more transparency in the process despite limited details on vulnerabilities and security measures. The current statute and regulation prohibit public disclosure of security-related information, limiting access to CVI to specific \"covered persons.\" Some policymakers question if these restrictions hinder emergency response efforts by first responders, community representatives, and worker representatives at chemical facilities. The limitations on worker input into security plans due to the lack of mandated inclusion of worker representatives may lead to incorrect marking of protected information at chemical facilities. Regulated entities may limit dissemination of information to protect themselves from liability, as penalties only apply to disclosure of correctly marked information. This disparity could hinder emergency response efforts and transparency in the public availability of information. The 2007 explosion at a Bayer CropScience chemical facility in West Virginia led to documents being incorrectly labeled as protected from disclosure. Security information was shielded under SSI markings to avoid public debate on chemical use and storage. Questions arose about the oversight of such protective markings and the lack of provisions for divulging CVI or challenging information categorization. The CFATS regulations do not provide whistleblower protection for individuals who disclose security vulnerabilities. DHS regulates entities that possess or manufacture chemicals of interest, expanding the definition of chemical facilities to include various types of facilities. Stakeholders are concerned about the increasing number of regulated facilities. Stakeholders are concerned about the increasing number of regulated chemical facilities. DHS revised the regulatory threshold for propane possession to focus on large commercial establishments rather than non-industrial users. The DHS revised the regulatory threshold for propane possession to focus on large commercial establishments, excluding non-industrial users. Stakeholders are concerned about the increasing number of regulated chemical facilities, with academic institutions arguing against CFATS regulations due to dispersed chemical holdings and disproportionate compliance costs. Some advocacy groups push for security regulations to include water and wastewater treatment facilities due to their large amounts of hazardous chemicals like chlorine and proximity to population centers. The federal government currently does not regulate these facilities for chemical security, making current efforts voluntary. Representatives of the water sector caution against including water and wastewater treatment facilities in the existing regulatory framework due to potential public impacts like loss of basic services. If Congress removes the exemption for these facilities, the number of regulated facilities could significantly increase, burdening the CFATS program. The US has around 52,000 community water systems and 16,500 wastewater treatment facilities, varying in size and service. The criteria for inclusion would determine the number of regulated facilities. The criteria for determining the number of regulated facilities under the CFATS program would depend on factors like chemical possession or individuals served. It is estimated that around 6,000 facilities would meet the CFATS threshold. Previous debates have discussed implementing changes in chemical processes to enhance security, such as reducing chemical storage or using safer technologies. The challenge lies in comparing different technologies for their potential replacements. In comparing industrial processes for security enhancements, it is challenging to determine if one technology is inherently safer than another without established metrics. Additional research is needed to develop these metrics. The National Academies recommend DHS support for research on cost-effective, inherently safer chemistries and processes. However, the outcomes of inherently safer process analyses may be narrowly focused. Facilities must consider various factors beyond homeland security implications when deciding to switch processes, including cost and technical challenges. Supporters argue that adopting inherently safer technologies in chemical facilities can improve security by reducing the incentive for attacks and mitigating risks to the surrounding population. They point to examples of facilities voluntarily changing processes to show it can be done cost-effectively. Opponents question the effectiveness of mandating these technologies as a security measure. Industrial entities argue that process safety engineers in the regulated industry already use safety approaches, not security methods. A 2011 survey found that 66.4% of respondents deemed alternative chemicals or processes technically infeasible. Opponents of mandating inherently safer technology express concerns about the lack of understanding regarding potential side effects, advocating for further research before implementation. The federal government may lack technical expertise to judge the practicality of alternative technological approaches, raising concerns about implementing safer technology. The DHS is conducting research on safer technology, but the NPPD has not integrated these findings into regulations. Congress has requested detailed reports on this issue. Some industry representatives argue that an inherently safer technology mandate could have a significant negative financial impact on chemical facilities regulated under CFATS. Small businesses may struggle to meet the existing CFATS requirements, which already impose costs. DHS estimated that CFATS could have a substantial economic impact on small entities even without an inherently safer technology requirement. The performance-based nature of the regulations makes it challenging to determine the exact impact on small businesses, but adding an inherently safer technology requirement could further increase compliance costs and disproportionately affect small entities. The Obama Administration has requested an extension of the statutory authority for CFATS until October 4, 2013. The 112th Congress may address chemical facility security by increasing oversight of DHS's implementation efforts or taking legislative action to extend the existing authority. Congress could revise or repeal the sunset provision, codify regulations, amend statutory authority, address programmatic activities, or expand the scope of chemical facility security regulation. If Congress allows the statutory authority for CFATS to expire and does not appropriate funding, the regulations may lapse, leading states to potentially take over chemical facility security regulation. Congressional oversight of the CFATS program may increase due to concerns about program performance, appropriations use, and internal oversight. The 112th Congress has held oversight hearings on DHS's implementation of CFATS, with a focus on addressing management challenges identified in the ISCD review memorandum. The GAO is currently reviewing CFATS program management. The GAO is reviewing management challenges in the CFATS program, with statutory authority giving discretion to the Secretary of Homeland Security. Congressional oversight may determine the effectiveness of regulations, with options to extend the sunset date or codify existing regulations. Allowing the authority to expire could maintain the regulatory framework if funding continues, potentially leading to litigation. The Obama Administration requested an extension of statutory authority to October 4, 2013, which was extended through March 27, 2013. Extending the existing authority may provide continuity for regulated entities and allow for assessment of current regulations. Some policymakers argue for a simple extension without changes. Some policymakers and chemical manufacturers support making the existing chemical facility security program permanent by removing the sunset date, which would provide consistency in authority and eliminate the need for reauthorization. This could also lead to increased congressional attention on the topic. Some advocates may oppose removing the sunset date on the existing chemical facility security program, as it could limit the Secretary of Homeland Security's discretion to alter regulations in the future. Policymakers might consider codifying specific components of the regulations to retain them, but this could restrict the Secretary's ability to adapt to changing circumstances. The DHS bases its schedule for facility CFATS compliance on the chemical facility's assigned risk tier, with higher risk tiers having a more accelerated compliance schedule. Congressional policymakers may accelerate compliance by increasing funding for DHS, allowing for better feedback, review, and inspection of facility security plans. The DHS may need additional funding to reduce inefficiencies in processing security plan submissions. Policymakers could authorize the use of third-party inspectors to increase the number of CFATS inspectors or delegate inspection authority to state and local governments. Concerns exist about equal treatment of facilities by different third-party inspectors. The DHS has not yet issued a rulemaking on the use of third-party inspectors. Congressional policymakers may direct DHS to streamline its review process and reduce response time for compliance activities. They could also slow down the implementation schedule of chemical facility security regulations, especially for small businesses. DHS has already granted regulatory extensions for certain agricultural operations. The DHS and EPA are calling for additional authorities to regulate water and wastewater treatment facilities to close a gap in chemical security regulations. Congressional policymakers may also consider providing longer timelines for compliance for entities facing economic burdens and removing exclusions from the CFATS program. The DHS and EPA are seeking more regulatory authority to secure chemicals at water and wastewater treatment facilities. They propose that EPA should lead chemical security efforts for these facilities, with support from DHS. States would also play a role in regulating security, including auditing and inspecting. The DHS and EPA are proposing to enhance security at water and wastewater treatment facilities by potentially including them under existing CFATS regulations, which would remove the current exemption. Congressional policymakers would need to consider various factors such as which facilities to regulate, the level of security measures, overseeing agency, and practicality of compliance. The DHS and EPA are considering including water and wastewater treatment facilities under CFATS regulations to enhance security. Opponents argue that this may duplicate requirements under the Safe Drinking Water Act and that DHS's authority under CFATS may not be suitable for municipal utilities. Another option is to grant regulatory authority to EPA or require DHS to consult with EPA. Some industry representatives express concern about multiple agencies regulating security at water treatment facilities. They suggest EPA should retain the lead to avoid conflicting regulations. Congress granted DHS authority for chemical security, separating it from EPA's public health responsibilities. Having one agency oversee safety and security could reduce redundancy. The authority to oversee safety and security operations may reduce redundancy and inefficiencies but could also increase stakeholder reluctance to consult voluntarily. Assigning responsibility for chemical facility security to different agencies may result in separate rules based on statutory authority, interpretation, and compliance ability. Congress may need to assess similarities and differences in facilities to provide appropriate authorities. New regulations for water treatment facilities may incur costs for regulated entities and the federal government. Representatives from the water and wastewater sectors argue that local ratepayers may end up bearing the costs of increased security measures. Congressional policymakers need to decide whether regulated entities or taxpayers should cover these expenses. The DHS supports enhancing security at MTSA facilities to meet CFATS standards. Additional funds may be needed for regulatory submissions and inspections if more facility types are included in the regulations. The Obama Administration believes DHS should ensure consistency in high-risk chemical facility security. Congress may modify exemptions, leading to conflicts between security regulations. One approach is to identify which statute supersedes others, while critics argue for harmonizing regulations. Regulatory agencies may need to harmonize implementing statutes. Regulatory agencies aim to harmonize regulations to reduce duplication and contradiction, potentially easing the burden on companies regulated under multiple frameworks. The DHS has a working group to harmonize CFATS and MTSA regulations, but increased security requirements could raise industry burdens. The DHS has not met Congress's expectation to harmonize chemical security responsibilities under CFATS and MTSA with the USCG. The Senate Committee on Appropriations directs the DHS Deputy Secretary to continue reporting on efforts to harmonize these responsibilities. The House committee calls for a critical review of CFATS implementation in conjunction with the USCG and reporting on specified topics. The current statute bars DHS from mandating the presence or absence of specific security measures, such as inherently safer technologies. Congress may consider giving DHS authority to require these technologies at chemical facilities, either mandating their implementation or consideration based on certain criteria. Another option is to establish a federal repository of inherently safer technologies. The Obama Administration has shown support for the use of inherently safer technologies to enhance security at high-risk chemical facilities. They have established principles to guide policy in this area, including the consistency of inherently safer technology. Stakeholders could assess the viability of these approaches at lower costs if information was centralized and freely available. Policymakers could also consider establishing an incentive-based structure to encourage adoption of inherently safer technologies by regulated entities. Alternatively, congressional policymakers may choose not to require consideration or adoption of these approaches. The Obama Administration supports the use of inherently safer technology approaches for high-risk chemical facilities. They propose that all Tiers 1-4 facilities should assess and report on these methods in their site security plans. Regulatory entities should have the authority to require Tiers 1 and 2 facilities to implement safer technology if it enhances security and is feasible. Tier 3 and 4 facilities should also undergo review of their safer technology assessments. The Obama Administration supports the use of inherently safer technology approaches for high-risk chemical facilities. A congressional mandate for regulated entities to adopt or consider adopting inherently safer technologies may lead to changes in chemical processes for increased safety and cost-effectiveness. The extent to which homeland security impact has factored into industry decisions is unknown, but DHS has identified cases where chemical facilities have voluntarily modified processes to lower their CFATS tier. Assessing inherently safer technology is complicated by varying amounts and quality of available information. Differences among chemical facilities in process, layout, and financing may challenge mandatory implementation of safer technologies. The National Academies have identified a lack of inherently safer technology adoption in the chemical industry. The chemical industry lacks common understanding and practice protocols for identifying safer processes. Any mandate may require outreach and educational activities for regulated entities. Financial burden on small entities may result from mandatory consideration of safer technologies. Congress could limit measures to high-risk facilities or provide financial assistance. Incentives may be used to encourage adoption of safer technologies, potentially reducing assigned risk tiers for facilities. Over 2,730 facilities had reduced chemical amounts by July 2012. As of July 2012, over 2,730 facilities reduced chemical amounts to no longer be high-risk. Policymakers could incentivize safer technologies adoption or conduct assessments for regulated entities. Increasing transparency in the CFATS process may involve altering information security provisions, improving information exchange with first responders, and adjusting court access to information. The Obama Administration supports maintaining CVI in its current form, but Congress may amend statutory authority to address policy concerns. This could involve requiring DHS to gather input from various groups and use industry best practices. Policymakers might also direct DHS to make certain information, such as enforcement results or site security plan approvals, more accessible. Congressional policymakers may mandate the inclusion of information gathering and the release of specific information to facilitate cooperation between stakeholder groups. However, concerns about security and the potential for adversaries to exploit vulnerabilities may arise. Congressional policymakers can consider expanding access to chemical facility security information for first responders to minimize barriers to disclosure during accidents. They may also choose to limit dissemination of sensitive information to increase security measures. Congressional policymakers may choose to further limit dissemination of CVI to increase security measures, potentially prohibiting sharing outside the federal government or setting criteria for access by state and local officials. Limiting access to CVI could make it harder for malicious actors to obtain sensitive information, but it may also impact emergency response and law enforcement protection at chemical facilities. Policymakers could mandate review of marked documents to address the identification of protected information. Congressional policymakers may address concerns about the certification of marked CVI documents by potentially placing this responsibility on chemical facilities or the federal government. Industry representatives may oppose this requirement due to increased regulatory burden. Concerns about incorrect marking and reporting mechanisms for misdeeds could be addressed by creating a \"whistleblower\" reporting mechanism. Compliance enforcement for incorrect marking remains unclear. Congress may consider creating a more general exemption for individuals reporting protected information to federal officials to protect whistleblowers. They may also address federal preemption of state chemical facility security regulations by limiting cases where federal regulation would preempt state regulation. Additionally, policymakers could extend protections against retaliation for individuals using reporting mechanisms. The Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2013 (P.L. 112-175) extends the statutory authority for chemical facility security regulation funding through March 27, 2013. Congress is considering extending the authority further through authorization legislation, as requested by the Obama Administration in each budget request. The Obama Administration has requested extensions of statutory authority for chemical facility security regulation funding in FY2011, FY2012, and FY2013 budgets. Congress provided extensions in appropriations acts, with the latest extension to March 27, 2013, under the Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2013 (P.L. 112-175). H.R. 901 proposes amendments to the Homeland Security Act of 2002 for DHS oversight of chemical facility security, matching existing authority and authorizing annual appropriations of $89.9 million from FY2012 through FY2018. H.R. 901 proposes amendments to the Homeland Security Act of 2002 for DHS oversight of chemical facility security, authorizing annual appropriations of $89.9 million from FY2012 through FY2018. The bill also includes requirements for vulnerability assessments, site security plans, background checks, and reporting to congressional committees. H.R. 908, the Full Implementation of the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards Act, extends statutory authority to October 4, 2018, authorizing appropriations of $89.92 million annually. It allows background checks for security purposes and grants access to CFATS-regulated facilities for Transportation Worker Identification Credential cardholders. H.R. 916, the Continuing Chemical Facilities Antiterrorism Security Act of 2011, extends authority to October 4, 2015, amending the Homeland Security Act of 2002. H.R. 916, the Continuing Chemical Facilities Antiterrorism Security Act of 2011, extends authority to October 4, 2015. It amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to establish voluntary chemical security training and exercise programs. The Antiterrorism Security Act of 2011, S. 473, would extend statutory authority to October 4, 2014 and establish voluntary chemical security programs. S. 3216, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Bill, 2013, would extend authority to October 4, 2013. H.R. 225, the Chemical Facility Security Improvement Act of 2011, aims to enhance security measures. The Chemical Facility Security Improvement Act of 2011 aims to enhance security measures by prohibiting approval of site security plans that do not meet state or local requirements, allowing the Secretary of Homeland Security to mandate specific security measures, treating CVI as sensitive security information, and allowing third-party individuals to bring suit against chemical facilities for non-compliance with security regulations. The Secure Chemical Facilities Act, S. 709, expands chemical facility security regulations to include public water systems and wastewater treatment facilities. It authorizes DHS to require implementation of safer measures for high-risk facilities to reduce consequences of an attack. The act also increases employee participation in security measures. S. 709 increases employee and employee representative involvement in security plans, aligns information control with sensitive security information rules, and allows third-party individuals to enforce compliance. S. 711, the Secure Water Facilities Act, authorizes the EPA Administrator to regulate community water systems and wastewater treatment facilities for security purposes, including reducing consequences of a chemical release from an intentional act. S. 711 authorizes the EPA Administrator to provide grants or agreements for regulatory compliance with controlled information to prevent unauthorized disclosure."
