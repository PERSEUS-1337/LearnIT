    "content": "The United States has historically exported natural gas primarily via pipeline to Mexico and eastern Canada, with limited LNG exports from Alaska to Japan. However, with increased development of shale gas and low domestic prices, U.S. companies are now considering exporting larger quantities of LNG to other countries by tanker ship. This shift may position the United States as a significant natural gas exporter in the near future, pending federal approval. The United States is looking to expand its natural gas exports, particularly in the form of LNG, pending federal approval. The Department of Energy and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission play key roles in authorizing these exports. Congress is closely monitoring the potential impact on consumer prices and the economy, with concerns about a rise in natural gas costs. Developers and producers argue that domestic prices will not increase significantly due to ample gas resources to meet both export and domestic demand. The United States has ample gas resources to meet export and domestic demand, with potential benefits such as higher employment and an improved trade balance. Despite lower natural gas prices in the U.S. compared to international markets, prices vary by region due to transportation limitations and differences in demand. Stakeholders disagree on the impact of LNG exports on domestic prices and the economy. The U.S. natural gas market is adjusting to balance supply and demand regionally and nationally, facing challenges such as limited pipeline capacity and environmental regulations. The potential export of more U.S. natural gas may have varying economic effects on different regions, with exports by pipeline or as LNG playing a role in seeking market balance. Regional impacts may differ from national impacts. Environmental groups are divided on the desirability of greater natural gas use at home and abroad. Advocates see it as reducing emissions compared to coal, while opponents highlight concerns about water contamination during gas production. Some groups prioritize domestic use for economic and national security reasons before exporting overseas. The debate over growing U.S. natural gas exports, especially LNG, continues in Congress. The U.S. natural gas market has seen changes, with bills introduced in Congress to expedite LNG exports. The country was once expected to be a growing importer of natural gas, but now there is a focus on becoming a larger net exporter. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasted an increase in natural gas imports, leading to the construction of new LNG import terminals. However, higher domestic production has made imports largely unnecessary, with the U.S. projected to become a net natural gas exporter by around 2016. The abundance of new domestic natural gas supplies has led to a shift in industry interest towards constructing LNG export terminals. There are currently 48 applications for permits to build liquefaction facilities for exporting domestically produced natural gas as LNG, with a total proposed capacity of approximately 42 bcfd. Additionally, companies have permits to re-export LNG cargos from existing import terminals. Increased pipeline exports to Canada and Mexico may also rise if their domestic demand continues to increase, driven by low U.S. natural gas prices compared to international markets. The interest in exporting U.S. natural gas, especially from the Gulf of Mexico, has been driven by lower prices and a growing resource base. The debate over the impact of exporting natural gas on U.S. prices and the economy is ongoing. Some suggest increasing the use of natural gas in the electric power sector instead of exporting it. The U.S. should increase natural gas use in the power sector to replace coal and as an alternative transportation fuel. Natural gas exports have grown significantly since 1999, primarily to Canada and Mexico. LNG exports to Japan also started in 1969 via the Kenai LNG terminal in Alaska. The Kenai LNG terminal in Alaska operated continuously until 2012 when it was temporarily idled. In 2014, the facility's owner announced its reopening due to increased local gas supply forecast, providing an opportunity to export Alaskan natural gas. It is the only completed LNG export facility in North America, currently not shipping LNG. The U.S. allowed re-export of foreign-sourced LNG in 2010, with re-export volumes exceeding domestic LNG exports in recent years. The decline in LNG exports since 2005 is attributed to the growth in U.S. natural gas production, primarily from shale gas. Import terminals are mostly idle as demand for pipeline and LNG imports has decreased. Natural gas exports by pipeline have significantly increased since 1999, with Canada and Mexico being the main recipients. Projects adding liquefaction to existing import terminals are considered most viable for LNG exports. Exports of natural gas to Canada and Mexico have increased significantly since 1999, facilitated by FTAs and new cross-border pipelines. Despite a decline in Canadian natural gas production, exports to both countries have grown substantially. Some of Canada's \"imports\" from the US are actually re-exported Canadian gas due to pipeline constraints. Mexican natural gas consumption has surged by 80% since 2002, surpassing production levels. U.S. LNG exports began in 1969 at the Kenai LNG terminal in Alaska. New LNG export projects in the U.S. have increased exports to countries like Brazil, India, Spain, and the UK. Seven companies have approval to re-export LNG from idled facilities to maintain operational capabilities. Currently, seven companies have permission to re-export LNG cargos from foreign countries, with four pending applications. Approval from DOE's Office of Fossil Energy and FERC is required. There have been 48 applications for permits to export domestically produced natural gas as LNG, totaling almost 15,330 bcf per year. Some projects plan to adapt existing LNG import terminals for export, requiring a significant financial investment of $6-10 billion per terminal, while others will construct new LNG export terminals costing around $20 billion each. New LNG export terminals, costing around $20 billion each, have received approval to export to free trade countries. Only a few projects have DOE final approval to export U.S. produced natural gas to non-FTA countries. South Korea, the second-largest importer of LNG globally, is among the FTA countries with existing LNG import terminals. Modifications or expansions of existing LNG terminals for liquefaction equipment require authorization from FERC and may need to comply with additional state or federal regulatory requirements. The Alaska LNG Project L.L.C. (Alaska LNG) aims to construct a pipeline from the North Slope to Nikiski for LNG export, with a total project cost estimated at $45 billion. Alaska has substantial natural gas resources, with potential reserves exceeding 200 trillion cubic feet. The project includes a gas treatment plant, an 800-mile pipeline, and a new LNG liquefaction plant and marine terminal. The Alaska LNG Project aims to construct a liquefaction plant and marine terminal with a total project cost estimated between $45 billion and $65 billion. On July 18, 2014, Alaska LNG applied to the DOE for authorization to export approximately 929 billion cubic feet of LNG annually to both FTA and non-FTA countries over a 30-year term. Energy Secretary Moniz agreed to expedite the review process due to the project's gas reserves being sufficient for local demand and exports, and geographically isolated from the lower-48 states. Alaska LNG requested FERC's pre-filing process for facility authorization. Most LNG export permits are for non-FTA countries, with 5.74 bcfd approved by the DOE. South Korea is the main FTA country importer of LNG. Other FTA countries either have LNG terminals, export natural gas, or do not import LNG. The United States is negotiating free trade agreements like TPP and TTIP to allow LNG exports to non-FTA countries, including Japan, the largest LNG importer. Japanese companies have signed contracts with U.S. LNG export projects, benefiting from potential markets. The United States is negotiating free trade agreements like TPP and TTIP to allow LNG exports to non-FTA countries, including Japan. Japan's motivation for joining TPP was access to U.S. LNG exports. TTIP aims to give the EU access to U.S. LNG to reduce dependence on Russian gas and increase purchasing options. Concerns arise over potential restrictions on U.S. LNG exports under WTO regulations. The United States may face challenges if it restricts LNG exports, potentially contradicting its stance on free trade and previous WTO cases. Natural gas imports and exports are a small part of overall U.S. trade. Natural gas imports and exports in the United States totaled about $25.7 billion in 2013, with net imports decreasing from almost $8 billion in 2012 to $650 million in 2015. LNG trade accounted for 5% of total petroleum gases trade in 2013. The U.S. could become the top global LNG exporter with proposed projects, but will face competition as global liquefaction capacity is expected to increase by 50% by 2020. Global LNG trade is expected to rise by almost 50% by 2020, with many non-U.S. projects more advanced than U.S. projects. Most LNG is sold under long-term contracts indexed to oil prices to finance liquefaction facilities. U.S. natural gas prices being market-based can give U.S. LNG export projects an advantage over oil-indexed prices, potentially pressuring other countries to delink their natural gas exports from oil-indexed prices. Several recent LNG supply contracts with proposed U.S. exporters are interested in a natural gas-based pricing mechanism to reduce costs and exposure to oil prices. However, recent declines in global oil prices have narrowed the oil-indexed versus gas-indexed price differential. U.S. LNG export contracts will still need to be long-term to obtain financing, which may be challenging given market conditions and recent price volatility. Providing LNG to countries using oil for heating, industrial processes, or electricity generation could decrease demand for petroleum products, putting further downward pressure on oil prices. Trinidad & Tobago's LNG decline is due to the US no longer being a major importer. Egypt and Libya also saw declines due to internal turmoil. Proposed US export terminals are targeting Asian demand, with Asia likely being the main market for US LNG. The Panama Canal widening in 2015 will boost US competitiveness in Asia. Europe has growing LNG demand but needs better infrastructure. US LNG projects may pressure Russia to decouple gas prices from oil. The United States is facing increasing pressure from export projects to delink natural gas prices from oil. LNG exports could offer alternatives for countries reliant on a single supplier. Export authorizations for natural gas transactions with foreign buyers must be filed under DOE rules. FTA nations automatically deemed consistent with the public interest, while non-FTA countries are presumed to be in the public interest unless deemed otherwise by DOE. FERC approval is required for LNG export terminal projects. Approval for LNG export terminals, whether onshore or in state waters, requires FERC approval. Compliance with state, tribal, or federal laws may also apply. DOE and FERC approval for LNG permits are federal actions subject to environmental review under NEPA. DOE evaluates public interest and environmental impacts, while adopting FERC's environmental review for projects requiring separate approval. The NGA does not specify DOE's role in the process. The NGA does not specify DOE's role in the process of evaluating environmental impacts related to LNG export terminals. DOE's primary public interest evaluation focuses on the domestic need for natural gas proposed for export, considering factors like U.S. energy security, economic impacts, and environmental considerations. The administrative process for reviewing applications includes submitting information to DOE, inviting public participation, responding to comments, and considering relevant information. The DOE evaluates applications for LNG export terminals, considering public comments, protests, and relevant information in the administrative record. A final opinion and order is issued with necessary conditions to ensure the project is in the public interest. The administrative record includes NEPA documentation and reports informing DOE's decision on natural gas exports. The DOE evaluates applications for LNG export terminals, considering public comments, protests, and relevant information in the administrative record. In determining LNG exports to non-FTA countries, DOE commissioned three studies: a domestic price impact study by EIA in January 2012, an economic impact study by NERA in December 2012, and another domestic price impact study by EIA in October 2014. The first EIA price analysis and subsequent NERA economic study were criticized for unrealistic scenarios. EIA's analysis showed a range of 9.6% to 32.5% increase in domestic prices due to LNG exports. The 2012 NERA study concluded that LNG exports would benefit the overall U.S. economy, despite potential negative impacts on large consumers of natural gas. Critics of the report pointed out flaws such as outdated data and incomplete market information. The EIA's 2014 price study also provided insights on the impact of LNG exports on domestic prices. The EIA's 2014 price study found that increased LNG exports lead to higher natural gas prices in the United States, with domestic production increasing to balance the market. This results in higher total energy use and CO2 emissions, along with modest increases in consumer expenditures for natural gas and electricity. Increased U.S. LNG exports lead to higher GDP levels, offsetting higher energy prices. Critics debate the methodology of DOE's studies on LNG export impacts. The impact of U.S. LNG exports on the economy is analyzed through various studies, including those by NERA and EIA. These studies consider parameters like export volumes and their effects on the economy. DOE uses multiple criteria, including domestic need and energy security, to determine the public interest in LNG exports to non-FTA countries. NEPA requires federal agencies to assess environmental impacts before making final decisions. This involves preparing an environmental impact statement (EIS) for projects with significant impacts, an environmental assessment (EA) for uncertain impacts, and categorical exclusions (CEs) for projects with no significant impacts. DOE's regulations outline the types of projects it can approve and the level of review required. DOE's regulations outline the types of projects it can approve and the level of review required. Actions authorized under Section 3 of the NGA include those requiring an EIS for major new natural gas pipelines, an EA for minor construction, and a CE for minor operational changes. DOE's determination of environmental impacts for LNG export approvals depends on various factors. The evaluation of impacts related to LNG export terminals by FERC involves preparing an EA/FONSI or EIS. FERC is the lead agency for these documents, with DOE as a cooperating agency. DOE adopts FERC's final EIS or EA/FONSI as its own NEPA document. Additionally, DOE has issued environmental reports on LNG exports, including the Addendum to Environmental Review Documents and Life Cycle Greenhouse Gas Perspective. These reports are part of the public record for LNG export requests. The Department of Energy (DOE) prepared reports to evaluate environmental impacts of natural gas exploration and development in response to public concerns. The purpose of the second report is to provide information on life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of U.S. LNG exports for electric power generation. Compliance with environmental requirements under NEPA may involve input or approval from other federal, tribal, or state agencies. The construction or expansion of LNG export terminals may require approval from federal, tribal, or state agencies such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, EPA, U.S. Coast Guard, and various state environmental protection agencies. Other federal statutes like the Clean Air Act, Endangered Species Act, National Historic Preservation Act, and Rivers and Harbors Act also play a role in evaluating and approving elements of the project. The construction or expansion of LNG export terminals may require approval from federal, tribal, or state agencies such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, EPA, U.S. Coast Guard, and various state environmental protection agencies. Projects may also be subject to safety or security-related requirements from agencies like the Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Coast Guard and Department of Transportation's Office of Pipeline Safety. Additional regulations may come from the National Fire Protection Association and Federal Emergency Management Agency. For more information on siting LNG terminals, refer to CRS Report RL32205. DOE has not provided a specific timetable for processing pending LNG export applications. The Department of Energy (DOE) issues conditional approvals for natural gas exports before final authorization from FERC. These conditional decisions are made after public input but before completing the NEPA review. DOE considers all factors except environmental ones and will reassess the approval once NEPA documentation is finished. LNG export applications are processed based on the order of precedence for pending approvals. The Department of Energy (DOE) issues conditional approvals for natural gas exports before final authorization from FERC. Conditional approvals are based on the order of precedence for pending applications. DOE announced new procedures in 2014, stating they will no longer issue conditional authorizations for non-FTA exports. Instead, DOE will act on applications when ready for final action. DOE no longer issues conditional approvals for non-FTA natural gas exports, focusing resources on viable LNG export proposals. Approval is based on completion of NEPA review and public interest determination, with no specified conditions for sufficiency. Financing for LNG projects no longer requires conditional approvals. Final order and approval are necessary before exporting natural gas. The growth in U.S. natural gas resources, particularly from shale gas, has led to increased natural gas exports. U.S. natural gas reserves have significantly increased since 2000, with shale gas accounting for a larger portion in recent years. DOE cannot finalize its public interest review for natural gas exports until FERC's NEPA review is complete. The decline in natural gas reserves between 2007 and 2008, and again in 2010, emphasizes the importance of shale gas for future U.S. production. Industry analysts predict shale gas reserves will continue to increase unless new restrictions are imposed. In 2012, natural gas surpassed coal as the most produced fuel in the U.S., driven by shale gas development. EIA projects a 56% growth in U.S. natural gas production between 2012 and 2040, with shale gas making up over 50% of that production. Shale gas will account for over 50% of U.S. natural gas production. Natural gas liquids (NGLs) have gained importance with the rise in shale gas production. NGLs are separated from natural gas at processing plants and include ethane, propane, butane, and pentane. The industry focuses on producing more wet gas to increase value as dry gas prices drop. Companies are shifting production to tight oil formations like the Bakken in North Dakota. The shift to tight oil formations like the Bakken in North Dakota has allowed companies to capitalize on their experience in shale gas development. The increase in wet gas production has helped maintain dry gas production levels despite low prices. Several bills in Congress focus on LNG exports, aiming to expedite approval processes for exports to non-FTA countries. The proposed legislation includes deadlines for DOE export permit decisions after environmental impact statements are issued. Several bills in Congress aim to expedite approval processes for LNG exports, including imposing deadlines on DOE permit decisions and extending FTA nation treatment to WTO member nations. The Crude Oil Export Act would repeal limitations on natural gas exports, while the Natural Gas Pipeline Permitting Reform Act would impact LNG production and infrastructure. The public focus on U.S. natural gas exports has been significant. The public focus on U.S. natural gas exports has been significant, with groups like IECA and APGA opposing LNG export projects due to potential price increases. However, natural gas producers and local businesses support the projects for access to new markets and higher prices. Analyses of price effects will continue as companies move forward. Natural gas exports are a topic of ongoing attention, with the Sierra Club opposing projects on environmental grounds. Economic impacts depend on export volume, growth, market segmentation, and regulations. Initial estimates suggest a modest rise in domestic gas prices if all proposed projects proceed, but prices would remain relatively low compared to global prices. Proponents argue that increased production could boost government revenue through taxes and royalties. Increased use of natural gas in the U.S. economy is limited to electric power generation, with natural gas-fired plants accounting for a growing share of demand. Environmental concerns are prompting the retirement of older coal plants, leading to a switch from coal to natural gas. This transition has economic benefits such as increased revenue for governments, more employment, and reductions in natural gas flaring. However, concerns exist about potential supply shortages and higher prices in the U.S. as producers prioritize overseas markets for higher profits. Switching from coal to natural gas in electric power generation may consume incremental U.S. natural gas supply increases before exports do. Proposed petrochemicals projects are in various stages of development and will take years to come to fruition. Other sectors like transportation, industrial, commercial, and residential are not expected to see a significant rise in natural gas demand in the near future. Technologies need improvement to increase natural gas use in transportation. High technology costs currently hinder reducing U.S. dependence on imported oil through fuel-switching. Natural gas exports by pipeline receive less attention. Canada's natural gas production may increase with the development of shale gas resources. The country also has LNG export projects in consideration. A recent study estimated Canada's shale gas resources at 573 trillion cubic feet. Mexico's natural gas production has been rising steadily but not enough to meet consumption. Mexico's natural gas consumption has been rising steadily, with imports now accounting for almost 27% compared to under 10% in 2000. The country heavily relies on natural gas imports from the United States, despite having significant shale gas resources. Mexico is lagging behind in developing these resources and will likely continue to depend on U.S. supplies to meet growing demand. Pipeline export projects to Canada and Mexico are easier to permit than LNG export facilities, with both countries being FTA partners of the U.S. The development of shale gas resources in the United States is crucial for becoming a net natural gas exporter. Infrastructure constraints in shale gas producing areas may limit gas availability for export. Environmental groups have differing views on natural gas as a bridge fuel to a zero carbon economy. Some environmental groups support natural gas exports to raise domestic prices and promote renewables. Concerns exist about water supply risks from hydraulic fracturing used in shale gas extraction. Increased shale gas development for overseas buyers raises environmental concerns."
