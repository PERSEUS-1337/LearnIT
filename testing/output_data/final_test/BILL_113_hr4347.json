Congress acknowledges the importance of United States diplomatic leadership in protecting religious minorities internationally. The International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 emphasizes condemning violations of religious freedom and promoting this fundamental right. House Resolution 306 urged Turkey to allow Christian church properties to be administered by their rightful owners without hindrance. The House Resolution 1631, adopted on September 28, 2010, calls for the protection of religious sites and artifacts in Turkish-occupied areas of northern Cyprus. Christian churches and communities in Turkey and Cyprus face restrictions in practicing their faith. The House Resolution 1631, adopted on September 28, 2010, calls for the protection of religious sites and artifacts in Turkish-occupied areas of northern Cyprus. Christian churches and communities in Turkey and Cyprus are prevented from fully practicing their faith and face obstacles in reestablishing control over stolen or confiscated properties. The rightful Christian church authorities are obstructed from caring for their holy sites due to destruction, expropriation, or neglect by the Turkish Government. More efforts are needed to rectify this situation. The spiritual leaders of Christian Armenian faithful called on Turkey to return confiscated church properties and treasures to the Armenian people. Turkey holds a vast majority of Christian holy sites in these areas, including historic Christian lands. Christian lands, including biblical lands of Armenia (present-day Anatolia) with Mount Ararat, have a rich history of early Christianity. However, due to repressive Turkish policies, historic atrocities, and persecution, Christians now make up less than one percent of Turkey's population. The Turkish Government's invasion of northern Cyprus in 1974 has also threatened the existence of Greek Cypriot, Maronite, and Armenian communities. Under Turkish occupation in northern Cyprus, Greek Cypriot, Maronite, and Armenian communities face severe restrictions on freedom of worship, blocked access to religious sites, destruction of religious sites, and illegal confiscation of religious and archaeological objects. The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom criticized the Turkish government for limitations on religious freedom, which threaten the survivability of minority religious communities in Turkey. Christian minorities in Turkey also experience discrimination and prohibitions on training and succession. The Government of Turkey faces criticism for discrimination against Christian minorities, prohibitions on clergy training, and violent attacks resulting in lenient sentencing. It refuses to recognize the international status of the Ecumenical Patriarchate and confiscates its assets. Candidates for the position of Ecumenical Patriarch must be Turkish, in violation of international obligations. The Government of Turkey faces criticism for discriminating against Christian minorities and imposing restrictions on clergy training. It also hinders the succession of the Greek Orthodox clergy by refusing to reopen the Theological School at Halki. Additionally, Turkey places limitations on the Armenian Patriarchate's rights to educate clergy and select successors without government interference, violating international obligations. Religious freedom is crucial for democracy and individual liberty, promoting stability and is a priority for the United States in its engagement with other countries. The report requirements are outlined in Section 3. The Secretary of State must submit an annual report on the status and return of stolen Christian churches and properties in Turkey and northern Cyprus occupied by the Turkish military to the relevant congressional committees. The annual report must detail efforts by the Department of State to engage with Turkey on the return of Christian churches and properties wrongfully taken in Turkey and northern Cyprus. This includes churches, monasteries, relics, and other religious artifacts. The annual report must detail efforts by the Department of State to engage with Turkey on the return of Christian churches and properties wrongfully taken in Turkey and northern Cyprus, including churches, monasteries, relics, and other religious artifacts. Information on Turkish military forces in occupied northern Cyprus will be included in the annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices and International Religious Freedom Reports."
