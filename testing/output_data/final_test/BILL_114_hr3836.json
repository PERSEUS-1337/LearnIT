The \"Foreign Affairs Inclusion Reporting Act\" mandates addressing complaints promptly and impartially, improving demographic data analysis for recruitment, and recruiting a diverse staff through various strategies. The \"Foreign Affairs Inclusion Reporting Act\" aims to recruit a diverse staff through various strategies such as the Foreign Service Internship Program and other hiring initiatives, as well as recruiting mid- and senior-level professionals through programs like the International Career Advancement Program and similar international leadership programs.

The first report to Congress will include information for the three fiscal years preceding its submission. SEC. 3 of the bill expands the Charles B. Rangel International Affairs Program and the Thomas R. Pickering Foreign Affairs Fellowship Program by increasing the number of fellows selected for each program by ten.
