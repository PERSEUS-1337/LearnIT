The rule targets sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emissions from specific states contributing to nonattainment of air quality standards. The EPA issued the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) on March 10, 2005, to address interstate transport of air pollutants affecting National Ambient Air Quality Standards for fine particulates and ozone. The rule targets sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emissions from specific states contributing to nonattainment of air quality standards. In the NOx SIP Call, EPA found 21 states and the District of Columbia significantly contributed to nonattainment of the 1-hour ozone NAAQS. To remedy the situation, EPA set statewide emissions budgets for NOx emissions and recommended cost-effective controls on electric generators and large industrial facilities under a regional cap-and-trade program. States began implementing controls on May 31, 2004. With CAIR, EPA creates regional emissions caps for NOx and SO2 to be implemented in two phases -- 2010 (2009 for NOx) and 2015. Two caps (annual SO2 emissions and annual NOx emissions) apply to the region of 23 states (and District of Columbia) found to contribute to PM2.5 nonattainment, and one cap (seasonal NOx emissions) applies to the region of 25 states (and District of Columbia) found to. The regional caps for affected states include SO2 annual caps of 3.6 million tons in 2010 and 2.5 million in 2015, NOx annual caps of 1.5 million tons in 2009 and 1.3 million in 2015, and NOx ozone season caps of 580,000 tons in 2009 and 480,000 tons in 2015. Each state is assigned a portion of the regional cap as a statewide emissions budget and must submit a revised State Implementation Plan (SIP) to achieve it. States have flexibility in choosing measures to meet the caps, subject to EPA approval. EPA believes the caps can be most cost-effectively achieved through reductions from electric generating facilities. The EPA encourages states to implement regional cap-and-trade programs for electric generators to achieve emissions caps cost-effectively. The new NAAQS set tighter standards for ozone and PM 2.5, with ozone standard at 0.08 ppm and PM 2.5 at 15 \u00b5g/m3 based on a three-year average. The EPA implemented new NAAQS for ozone and PM 2.5, with stricter standards. Compliance was delayed due to monitoring data issues in 1997, but designations were eventually made in 2004-2005. EPA issued designations for attainment and nonattainment for both the eight-hour ozone NAAQS and the PM 2.5 NAAQS. EPA analysis shows violations of the NAAQS for PM 2.5 over the eastern US, California, and Montana, with 39 nonattainment areas in 20 states affecting 224 counties. For the eight-hour ozone NAAQS, violations are widespread in the eastern and midwestern US, California, Texas, and scattered areas in Louisiana, Arizona, and Colorado, with 126 nonattainment areas in 31 states affecting 474 counties. The affected population is 90 million for PM 2.5 and unspecified for ozone. In 31 states, violations of the eight-hour ozone standard affect 159 million people. The Clean Air Act's SIP process was initiated due to the 1997 ozone and PM 2.5 NAAQS. EPA can require states to submit revised SIPs if found inadequate, known as a \"SIP Call.\" Compliance strategies are complicated by transported air pollutants, requiring states to prevent significant contributions to nonattainment in downwind states. The EPA issued the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) in 2005 to address interstate transport of pollutants contributing to ozone and PM 2.5 nonattainment. States are required to submit CAIR SIPs before nonattainment SIPs, based on the Clean Air Act. EPA justifies this based on policy and specific sections of the Act. The EPA issued the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) in 2005 to address interstate transport of pollutants contributing to ozone and PM 2.5 nonattainment. CAIR is based on determinations by EPA regarding pollution transport, cost-effective pollution control, and compliance feasibility within the SIP process. EPA argues that upwind reductions will benefit downwind states and that affected states significantly contribute to nonattainment in downwind states, defining the geographic scope of the rule. EPA conducted modeling runs to determine upwind states' contributions to areas in the eastern United States. Various upwind states are projected to contribute to areas in the eastern United States that are projected to be in nonattainment in 2010 and 2015 for ozone. EPA defined a \"significant contribution\" based on the actual amount of transported pollution, frequency of contributions over specific thresholds, and the comparative amount of upwind transported contribution to total nonattainment. EPA modeled emissions impact of 31 states on 40 eastern downwind counties in noncompliance in 2010, screening out states with minimal contributions. After evaluating eastern states on criteria, 25 states and DC were found to contribute significantly to nonattainment. EPA modeled emissions impacts of 37 states on 62 counties for PM 2.5 NAAQS. EPA considered actual and comparative amounts for ozone, settling on a threshold of 0.2 \u00b5g/m3. 23 states and DC were found to exceed this threshold. Based on a threshold set by the EPA, 23 states and the District of Columbia were identified as significant contributors to PM 2.5 nonattainment. The EPA excluded Western U.S. states from further analysis due to geographical and meteorological factors. The EPA excluded Western U.S. states from further analysis of PM 2.5 nonattainment due to geography, meteorology, and topography. The rule provides no specific basis for this determination, and rigorous modeling was not conducted in western nonattainment areas as it was in the eastern U.S. Regional Cap/State Budget considerations are being made for a cost-effective remedy. EPA concluded that reducing transport of pollutants over a broader regional area is necessary for many PM 2.5 nonattainment areas to reach attainment. Regional reductions were also deemed necessary for eight-hour ozone nonattainment areas. EPA determined the need for regional reductions to address pollution transport. Criteria were developed for cost-effective transport control levels for SO2 and NOx emissions from various sources, with a focus on electric generators for emission caps. EPA focused on electric generators 25 MW or greater to determine emission caps, comparing costs of control technologies like FGD and SCR with other regulatory actions. They found these technologies to be highly cost-effective in setting regionwide caps for affected states. EPA determined cost-effective emission caps for affected states by assuming control technologies on electric generators. States can choose to target other sources but must comply with electric-generator-only strategy for EPA regional trading program participation. EPA created three emissions caps in final rule. The EPA created three emissions caps in its final rule to address interstate contributions of SO2 and NOx to PM2.5 and ozone nonattainment. Each cap had to be integrated into the existing Clean Air Act, facing unique challenges. The annual SO2 cap builds on an existing cap-and-trade program, while the annual NOx caps are averaged on an annual basis for flexibility and cost-savings. Title IV of the 1990 CAA Amendments mandated the reduction of SO2 emissions from electric generators and created a permit and emissions allowance system. Allowances are allocated to existing power plants by the EPA, requiring new plants to offset their emissions with reductions from existing facilities. The Title IV program mandates SO2 emission reductions from electric generators through an allowance system. Utilities can use allowances to offset emissions from newer facilities and trade them nationally. Issues arose when developing a new regional cap-and-trade program, including allocation of state budgets and treatment of excess allowances. EPA had to address these issues while maintaining the successful Title IV program. EPA integrated CAIR's allocation scheme with the existing Title IV acid rain program to protect the Title IV program, resulting in the grandfathering of pre-1990 existing plants under CAIR. This interface created surplus Title IV allowances as emissions were reduced in the regional control area. The EPA mandates CAIR-affected states to redeem CAA Title IV allowances at specific ratios during phase 1 and phase 2, regardless of participation in the CAIR SO2 trading scheme. Allowances are not considered property rights under the 1990 CAAA. The EPA mandates CAIR-affected states to redeem CAA Title IV allowances at specific ratios during phase 1 and phase 2. Allowances are not considered property rights under the 1990 CAAA, and regulatory actions taken subsequent to the issuance of allowances are not subject to the \"takings clause\" of the U.S. Constitution. The EPA has the flexibility to modify Title IV allowances in response to changes in the environment or public policy without compensating allowance-holders for any loss in value. The Title IV allowance bank had 7.6 million allowances at the beginning of 2004, and pre-2010 banked allowances can be used on a one-for-one basis for meeting CAIR reductions. EPA defends its decision to use Title IV allowances in the CAIR trading program. The EPA allows pre-2010 Title IV allowances to be used for CAIR reductions, potentially doubling in value by 2010 and nearly tripling by 2015. The CAIR SO2 trading program shifts from a unit-by-unit to a source-by-source system. Unlike SO2, there is no statutory cap-and-trade program for NOx emissions from electric utilities, but a regional NOx cap-and-trade program exists. The NOxSIP Call trading program, like CAIR, is an EPA-sponsored model rule adopted by states to meet emissions budgets. CAIR replaces the NOx SIP Call's seasonal cap-and-trade scheme with the seasonal CAIR NOx program in 2009. EPA sets NOx emission rates for states based on historical heat input, with a rate of 0.15 lb./mmBtu in phase 1 and 0.125 lb./mmBtu in phase 2. The final CAIR NOx program includes an accelerated phase 1 compliance deadline to 2009, a Compliance Supplement Pool of 200,000 allowances, and adjustment factors for heat input baseline by fuel type (1.0 for coal, 0.4 for natural gas, and 0.6 for oil). EPA believes accelerating the NOx deadline is feasible, unlike for SO2. The EPA justified the departure from the NOx SIP Call methodology on equity grounds, with a 2\u00c2\u00bd weighing of coal combustion compared to natural gas combustion. States with substantial coal-fired generation receive a larger emissions budget. The EPA also introduced a voluntary opt-in provision for non-electric utility units meeting specific criteria. Issues arose with the NOx annual cap and its model trading program in relation to CAIR's seasonal NOx program and the existing NOx SIP Call. The EPA's final rule included a seasonal NOx cap in addition to the annual CAIR NOx cap. The annual CAIR NOx cap-and-trade scheme differs from the NOx SIP Call in terms of state budget determination and participant scope. EPA focused only on electric generators, contrary to recommendations for NOx controls on non-utility stationary sources. EPA calculated state emission budgets based on five sectors in the final NOx SIP Call. The EPA's CAIR rule required substantial reductions in emissions from various sectors, including electric utility and nonutility sources. The rule excluded stationary industrial sources due to methodological differences with the NOx SIP Call, causing difficulties for the cap-and-trade program. EPA argued a lack of data for including these sources in CAIR, despite having sufficient data in 1997 for the NOx SIP Call. The CAIR rule excluded industrial sources from participating in the cap-and-trade program, causing challenges due to the elimination of the NOx SIP Call trading program. EPA allowed states to include industrial sources in the seasonal NOx trading program but not the annual program. The seasonal nature of the NOx SIP Call was addressed in the CAIR rule with a third cap, but no flow control mechanisms were included to prevent excessive use of emission banks. In the final rule, EPA decided to include a seasonal NOx program focused on ozone nonattainment, separate from the annual NOx trading program. Allowances banked under the seasonal program cannot be used for the annual program, and vice versa. The ozone season is defined as May-September. EPA found that five states would be affected by this decision. EPA's final rule includes a seasonal NOx program for ozone nonattainment, separate from the annual NOx trading program. Five states - Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Delaware, and Arkansas - are covered under the seasonal program but not the annual program. The methodology for emissions budget allocation in the seasonal program is based on the CAIR annual NOx program, focusing on electric generating units and including fuel-type adjustment factors. EPA's decision reflects a desire to eliminate the existing NOx SIP Call trading program. The EPA's final rule introduces a seasonal NOx program for ozone nonattainment states, separate from the annual NOx trading program. The allocation methodology for emissions budgets in the seasonal program is based on the CAIR annual NOx program, focusing on electric generating units. States covered under the NOx SIP Call have two options: adopt the electric-generating-units-only system or include industrial sources in the seasonal trading program. The EPA's final rule introduces a seasonal NOx program for ozone nonattainment states, separate from the annual NOx trading program. Emission limitations for sources covered under the NOx SIP Call would remain the same. Rhode Island has two options: join the CAIR seasonal NOx trading program or develop an alternative method to meet its NOx SIP Call requirements. EPA aims to provide flexibility to participants in the CAIR cap-and-trade implementation strategy to achieve emission reductions earlier and at a lower cost. The EPA's final rule introduces a seasonal NOx program for ozone nonattainment states, separate from the annual NOx trading program. The rule allows for one-for-one redemption of SO 2 allowances banked before 2010 and NOx SIP Call allowances banked before 2009. A Compliance Supplemental Pool (CSP) with 200,000 annual NOx allowances is created to reward early reductions by electric utilities. However, projected banking activity does not show significant early reductions. The current bank of 7.6 million SO 2 allowances is projected to decrease to 6.9 million by 2010, with a declining bank thereafter to reduce costs. The EPA's final rule introduces a seasonal NOx program for ozone nonattainment states, separate from the annual NOx trading program. The projected banking activities do not show significant early reductions, with a declining bank of SO2 allowances to reduce costs. The model projects no banking before the 2009 compliance dates for the seasonal program, but a slowly accumulating bank of seasonal NOx allowances after 2009. This accumulation continues through the projected period, resulting in emissions remaining over actual cap levels. The EPA's final rule introduces a seasonal NOx program for ozone nonattainment states, separate from the annual NOx trading program. The emissions levels under the seasonal program remain below the cap limits throughout the period. The annual NOx emission levels follow the reduction requirement in lockstep with no smoothing of the emission levels over time. Compliance with the annual cap results in a slight overcontrol situation with respect to the seasonal cap. The EPA's final rule introduces a seasonal NOx program for ozone nonattainment states, separate from the annual NOx trading program. Compliance with the annual cap results in a slight overcontrol situation with respect to the seasonal cap, leading to slowly increasing bank of seasonal allowances. States may need to consider the value of including industrial NOx SIP Call sources in the seasonal CAIR program. CAIR aims to address interstate transport of pollutants hindering downwind states from meeting ozone and PM 2.5 NAAQS. Most eastern U.S. counties currently in nonattainment are expected to comply with NAAQS in 5-10 years through existing CAA programs. EPA predicts CAIR will have a greater impact on PM 2.5 attainment than on eight-hour ozone attainment in the eastern United States. The EPA's final rule introduces a seasonal NOx program for ozone nonattainment states, separate from the annual NOx trading program. Compliance with the annual cap results in a slight overcontrol situation with respect to the seasonal cap, leading to slowly increasing bank of seasonal allowances. States may need to consider the value of including industrial NOx SIP Call sources in the seasonal CAIR program. CAIR aims to address interstate transport of pollutants hindering downwind states from meeting ozone and PM 2.5 NAAQS. EPA projects CAIR will have a greater impact on PM 2.5 attainment than on eight-hour ozone attainment in the eastern United States. EPA data shows that CAIR will bring more counties into compliance with the PM 2.5 NAAQS compared to the eight-hour ozone NAAQS by 2010 and 2015. The EPA's seasonal NOx program for ozone nonattainment states raises questions about including industrial sources for seasonal NOx control only. With only five states under the CAIR seasonal program but not the NOx SIP Call, EPA's data concerns could be lessened. There are suggestions to strengthen the seasonal cap slightly based on projections of seasonal NOx banking. The separate nature of the seasonal NOx program from the annual NOx program allows for different budget allocation schemes. Progress on SO2 emissions between 2010 and 2015 may be impacted by banking activities during that time. Progress on SO2 emissions between 2010 and 2015 may be impacted by banking activities during that time. EPA believes it has struck the correct balance between addressing interstate transport of nonattainment and the need for local controls. The EPA does not provide direct regulatory relief to facilities covered under CAIR, specifically New Source Review, with no exemptions or safe harbors provided. However, two provisions of CAIR may offer future relief from CAA requirements, depending on future EPA determinations. Section 126 petitions under the Clean Air Act allow states to petition EPA regarding major sources emitting pollutants that contribute to nonattainment of air quality standards. EPA must respond within 60 days, and if granted, sources must comply with emission controls or cease operations. Petitions have been filed since 1997, with some being stayed indefinitely due to litigation. On March 19, 2004, EPA received a Section 126 petition from North Carolina seeking reductions in upwind emissions to help achieve air quality standards. In CAIR, EPA did not specify its ruling on the petition but mentioned the interaction between different sections of the Clean Air Act. The proposed rule under CAIR aimed to reduce regional haze in the eastern United States and sought comments on how it could satisfy the requirements of the regional haze program, including the installation of best available retrofit technology for certain existing sources. EPA presented a detailed argument in the proposed rule regarding indoor air quality and regional haze. In the proposed IAQ and CAIR, EPA argues that participation in CAIR should substitute for complying with BART for affected units. However, the final determination on whether CAIR makes greater progress than BART is deferred until BART guidelines are finalized. EPA believes that CAIR will achieve greater reasonable progress than BART based on the proposed better-than-BART test. The final CAIR rule reflects changes from the proposed IAQ. The final CAIR rule reflects changes from the proposed IAQ, including the inclusion of a seasonal NOx emissions cap separate from the proposed annual cap, accelerating compliance with phase 1 of the two NOx caps, and adjustments to states contributing to PM 2.5 and eight-hour ozone nonattainment. Several states were removed or re-included in the rule. The final CAIR rule includes changes such as a 200,000 annual NOx compliance supplement pool, a fuel-type adjustment factor, and decisions regarding Section 126 petitions and BART. These changes do not represent a major shift in the scope of CAIR, which has not been as controversial as the mercury rule. The CAIR rule, while not as controversial as the mercury rule, may face challenges in the future due to potential changes in PM 2.5 NAAQS stringency and the issue of global warming. Efforts may be made to strengthen CAIR provisions before 2015 if the PM 2.5 standard is enhanced. Additionally, the possibility of carbon dioxide reductions and new multipollutant control regimes could impact the future of CAIR. Bills in Congress propose a new system to address these environmental concerns. The promulgation of CAIR raises questions about the future of the Bush Administration's Clear Skies initiative, which aimed to rewrite Title IV of the Clean Air Act and implement a cap-and-trade system for utility emissions. With CAIR achieving emissions reductions and the final Hg rule in place, the need for Clear Skies is uncertain."
