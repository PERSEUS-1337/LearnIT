    "content": "On April 2, 2009, the House passed the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (H.R. 1256) by a vote of 298-112, giving the FDA authority to regulate tobacco products. Senator Reid introduced a similar bill in the Senate (S. 982), which awaits further action. The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, passed by the House on April 2, 2009, awaits Senate action. The legislation would regulate tobacco products under a new FFDCA Chapter IX, requiring manufacturers to register with the FDA, provide product lists, and adhere to new health warning label requirements. Manufacturers of new tobacco products must obtain FDA approval before market entry. The legislation awaiting Senate action would give FDA authority to regulate tobacco products, including requiring scientific evidence for reduced-risk claims, postmarket surveillance, regulating sales and advertising, setting product standards, establishing manufacturing practices, and disclosing product ingredients. The pending legislation would empower the FDA to regulate tobacco products, including testing, reporting, and disclosing ingredients and smoke constituents. It would also allow states and localities to impose additional restrictions on tobacco products, require new recordkeeping to combat illicit trade, and assess user fees on manufacturers for FDA regulation costs. Additionally, the bill would mandate the reissuance of the FDA's 1996 tobacco rule, focusing on reducing underage tobacco use through sales restrictions, marketing limitations, and labeling requirements. The FDA rule on tobacco products was incorporated into the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement. FDA argued for jurisdiction over tobacco products based on their delivery of nicotine. The Supreme Court invalidated the FDA tobacco rule in 2000. The Supreme Court invalidated the FDA's tobacco rule in 2000, finding it inconsistent with congressional intent. Congress would need to grant FDA new statutory authority over tobacco products for the agency to assert jurisdiction. Legislation was drafted in the 105th Congress but was unsuccessful. The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act was introduced in the 108th Congress to establish new legal authority for regulating tobacco products, addressing unique challenges and avoiding the safety and effectiveness standard for drugs and devices. The FDA would need to show that any proposed regulation is appropriate for public health, considering risks and benefits for both users and nonusers. This bipartisan legislation was the result of negotiations to balance competing interests. The FDA tobacco bill was the result of months of negotiations between public health groups and the tobacco industry. Public health advocates want broad FDA authority to protect public health, while tobacco companies seek restrictions on FDA's power to regulate their products. A weak FDA bill would be worse than no bill at all according to advocates. The government's regulation and approval of tobacco products aim to reduce uncertainty and restore predictability in the industry by creating federal standards. While public health groups and Philip Morris support the regulatory framework, other major cigarette companies oppose the legislation due to concerns about sweeping new regulatory authority. The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act aims to give the FDA broad regulatory authority over tobacco products, including marketing restrictions, to reduce smoking prevalence. The Institute of Medicine endorsed the legislation, stating that stronger federal regulation is necessary for substantial and enduring reductions in tobacco use. The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act aims to give the FDA authority over tobacco products, including regulating design and marketing, strengthening warning labels, and setting standards for reduced-harm products. The report discusses contrasting views on FDA tobacco regulation and key regulatory issues raised by the bill. Table 1 summarizes provisions in H.R. 1256 and differences in S. 982. A companion report analyzes the 1996 FDA tobacco rule. The report analyzes the 1996 FDA tobacco rule and the industry's legal challenge that overturned it. It also reviews the 1997 proposed national tobacco settlement and legislative activity on the Family Smoking Prevention and Control Act in the 108th, 109th, and 110th Congresses. The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids advocates for comprehensive federal regulation of tobacco products to reduce the public health impact of tobacco use. The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids advocates for federal regulation of tobacco products to reduce public health impact. According to the CDC, tobacco use causes over 400,000 deaths annually, with one-third being cancer-related. Tobacco products are exempt from various consumer protection laws, allowing companies to market to youth and deceive the public about addictiveness. Strong FDA regulation is seen as necessary to change industry practices. The Campaign supports FDA regulation of tobacco products and backs H.R. 1256 / S. 982. Philip Morris previously supported FDA authority but opposed the 1996 FDA rule, citing safety concerns. The Supreme Court agreed that cigarettes cannot be deemed safe and effective under current regulations. Philip Morris supported FDA regulation of cigarettes in a white paper, advocating for new legal authority to address issues like youth smoking, ingredient testing, health warnings, and marketing practices. The company proposed principles for FDA tobacco legislation. The white paper proposed principles for FDA tobacco legislation, emphasizing unique health, social, and economic issues associated with tobacco products. It advocated for regulating cigarettes as such, not as medical devices, allowing adults to make their own decisions about smoking. The FDA should require manufacturers to ensure added ingredients do not increase risks or addictiveness. The agency should have authority to mandate design changes to reduce harm without significantly impacting adult smokers' enjoyment. Regulation should define reduced exposure and risk products and establish guidelines for communications. FDA should address disclosure issues to inform adult smokers about health risks. Philip Morris opposes legislation that would ban cigarettes or make them unpalatable, leading smokers to unregulated products. The FDA used a similar reasoning in developing tobacco regulations, concluding that banning cigarettes would lead to a black market for unregulated and potentially more dangerous products. While Philip Morris supports tobacco regulation, other major companies like R.J. Reynolds and Lorillard have criticized it. Lorillard emphasizes the possibility of the FDA eventually banning conventional cigarettes. Lorillard and R.J. Reynolds oppose new legislation that could alter tobacco products, advocating for research on reduced exposure products and marketing restrictions. They support reasonable regulation but emphasize the importance of fair competition for adult smokers. Their opposition may stem from concerns about maintaining market share in the face of sweeping new regulations. The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act would bring significant changes to the labeling, advertising, and marketing of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. H.R. 1256 / S. 982 would impose new restrictions on youth access to tobacco products and advertising, potentially giving Philip Morris an advantage in the market. The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act would bring significant changes to tobacco product packaging and advertising. It includes restrictions on youth access to tobacco products and advertising, with more explicit health warnings and FDA authority to regulate tobacco product sales and promotion. The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act would give FDA the authority to require changes in tobacco products for public health protection, including reducing harmful ingredients. Manufacturers would need FDA approval to market new products, meeting the same public health standard. H.R. 1256 / S. 982 provides exceptions for manufacturers to obtain premarket approval for new tobacco products, including substantial equivalence claims and minor modifications. Manufacturers can market new products with substantial equivalence claims for 21 months without FDA approval, which has drawn criticism from public health officials. H.R. 1256 / S. 982 includes provisions for manufacturers to obtain premarket approval for new tobacco products, with exceptions for substantial equivalence claims and minor modifications. The bill also prohibits the use of descriptors like \"light\" and \"mild,\" requiring evidence for reduced-risk claims. Additionally, the House measure includes provisions on federal employee retirement benefits not found in S. 982. The report discusses the regulation of reduced-risk tobacco products and FDA's authority in establishing tobacco product standards. Both the tobacco industry and public health community are interested in creating a regulatory framework for these products. Philip Morris and other leading cigarette companies have tested various potentially less harmful products, including genetically modified tobacco cigarettes and cigarette-like products delivering nicotine at lower temperatures. The tobacco industry seeks FDA approval to market reduced-risk products that deliver nicotine through a controlled combustion process. Public health advocates want FDA to assess the risks and benefits of these products for the wider population, amid concerns about smokeless tobacco companies marketing their products as safer alternatives to smoking. The tobacco industry sees smoking restrictions as a chance to promote their products to smokers looking for alternative nicotine sources. Studies show that smokeless tobacco carries less risk than cigarettes, but public health experts fear it may deter youth from quitting tobacco altogether. They cite past challenges in regulating reduced-risk products like low-tar cigarettes. The tobacco industry marketed \"light\" and \"ultralight\" cigarettes as a less harmful way of smoking, despite no explicit health claims. These products emit lower levels of tar and nicotine, but the National Cancer Institute found no convincing evidence that they decrease disease burden. Smokers who switched to low-yield cigarettes often changed their smoking behavior to maintain nicotine intake. The legislation H.R. 1256 / S. 982 aims to prohibit the marketing of \"modified risk tobacco products\" without FDA approval. These products claim to be less harmful or reduce exposure to toxins, using terms like \"light\" or \"low.\" Manufacturers must gain approval before marketing such products. To market a modified risk tobacco product, a manufacturer can submit a reduced-risk claim or assert that the product reduces exposure to harmful substances. H.R. 1256 / S. 982 outlines criteria for approving reduced-exposure claims in the absence of scientific evidence for a reduced-risk claim. Approval of products with reduced exposure claims is likely to benefit overall population health. Manufacturers must conduct postmarket surveillance and report findings annually. Terms like \"light\" and \"low-tar\" must be discontinued within one year. Tar and nicotine levels must be adjusted to avoid classification as a modified risk tobacco product. The legislation requires manufacturers to discontinue terms like \"light\" and \"low-tar\" within one year to avoid classification as a modified risk tobacco product. FDA would develop new regulations for testing and reporting tobacco product ingredients, replacing the current FTC method. Approval for marketing a modified risk tobacco product based on reduced-risk claims would be challenging without long-term epidemiological studies. Approval for marketing a modified risk tobacco product based on reduced-risk claims does not require long-term epidemiological studies. The manufacturer must show that reduced exposure is likely to reduce harm and benefit public health. Postmarket surveillance is crucial to monitor the product's impact. FDA can enforce labeling and advertising restrictions on manufacturers. The legislation H.R. 1256 / S. 982 would give FDA authority to develop product standards for reduced-risk tobacco products, prohibiting certain additives and allowing for modifications to reduce harm. Manufacturers believe they should provide accurate information to adult consumers to make informed choices. The FDA tobacco bill H.R. 1256 / S. 982 allows for product standards for reduced-risk tobacco products, without restrictions on modifying product composition. Critics argue that reducing nicotine levels could lead smokers to alter their habits to maintain addiction levels, potentially worsening public health. Supporters believe smokers may not be able to compensate for lower nicotine levels by smoking more or inhaling deeper. Reduced-nicotine products may help smokers quit rather than maintain addiction levels by inhaling deeper or smoking more frequently. Setting product standards could make tobacco products less harmful, but the process is complex due to the numerous chemicals in tobacco smoke and the unknown health risks associated with each compound. Demonstrating the public health benefits of reducing specific tobacco product constituents may take years of data collection. The FDA must consider technical feasibility, patents, and potential demand for contraband when setting standards. H.R. 1256 / S. 982 does not allow FDA to ban tobacco products or reduce nicotine yields to zero, as the industry fears a de facto ban. The public health community supports FDA having unrestricted authority to protect public health. H.R. 1256 / S. 982 would ban all flavors in cigarettes except menthol, which is a compromise with Philip Morris. Former HHS Secretaries urged banning menthol in cigarettes due to public health concerns. The menthol exemption in cigarettes is controversial as it is the most popular choice among African-American smokers, leading to higher smoking-related health risks for this demographic. African-American smokers have a higher risk of long-term consequences from smoking compared to other ethnic groups. African-American smokers face higher smoking-related health risks, with studies suggesting menthol smokers may be exposed to more dangerous compounds. Menthol brands like Newport have high nicotine levels, making it harder to quit. Tobacco companies argue menthol does not worsen health risks, but legislation could ban menthol to protect public health. The legislation H.R. 1256 / S. 982 aims to study the public health impact of menthol cigarettes and address First Amendment concerns regarding outdoor advertising for tobacco products near schools. The Senate version includes provisions to protect public health. The FDA tobacco legislation, H.R. 1256 / S. 982, grants broad authority to regulate tobacco product marketing to protect public health. The legislation considers risks and benefits to the population, including the impact on current users and potential new users. It also reviews Supreme Court decisions on government regulation of advertising and commercial speech in relation to the FDA's 1996 rule. The U.S. Supreme Court established a four-part test for the constitutionality of commercial speech regulation in Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission (1980). The Court has struck down government restrictions on commercial speech, including tobacco product advertising. In Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly (2001), the Supreme Court ruled Massachusetts regulations on outdoor and point-of-sale tobacco advertising unconstitutional. The Court found the restrictions overly broad and not reasonably advancing the state's interest in reducing underage tobacco use. The regulations were deemed to almost entirely ban truthful information about tobacco products to adult consumers. The Supreme Court ruled that Massachusetts regulations on outdoor advertising of cigars and smokeless tobacco were overbroad and unconstitutional. The Court upheld challenges by tobacco companies, stating that adults have a right to information and the industry has a right to communicate truthful speech. H.R. 1256 / S. 982 would require the HHS Secretary to publish the agency's 1996 rule with some changes within 180 days. The FDA's 1996 rule aimed at reducing underage smoking and tobacco use, but its constitutionality under the Central Hudson test remains unclear. The FDA's 1996 rule aimed at reducing underage smoking and tobacco use, but its constitutionality under the Central Hudson test remains unclear. The rule included restrictions on advertising in publications with a significant teen audience and outdoor advertising near schools or playgrounds. The Supreme Court did not address the constitutionality of these marketing restrictions in FDA v. Brown & Williamson. S. 982 addresses concerns about the outdoor advertising restrictions in the 1996 rule. The Supreme Court questioned the necessity of the regulations imposed by the Attorney General in Lorillard, stating that they did not carefully calculate the costs and benefits associated with the burden on speech. The Court emphasized that speech regulations should not unduly impinge on the ability to propose commercial transactions or obtain information about products. The Attorney General did not consider the impact of the 1,000 foot restriction on commercial speech in major metropolitan areas. The Attorney General imposed a 1,000 foot restriction on commercial speech, similar to the FDA's rule in 1996. The Court criticized the broad geographical limitation, noting its lack of tailoring and potential impact on outdoor advertising in major metropolitan areas. The FDA imposed a 1,000 foot restriction on tobacco advertising in urban areas to protect children and adolescents. The Lorillard Court criticized the broad restriction, suggesting it could be struck down for not carefully considering speech interests. The FDA imposed a 1,000 foot restriction on tobacco advertising near schools and playgrounds to protect children. The Court suggested that tailored restrictions targeting practices appealing to children would be more appropriate, rather than a broad restriction. The Supreme Court may not uphold the 1,000 foot restriction on tobacco advertising near schools and playgrounds as it may not survive a Central Hudson analysis. Congress could exclude this restriction in the new final rule under the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. The House version specifies changes from the 1996 rule, but does not mention altering the 1,000 foot restriction. The Senate bill, however, addresses the new version of the FDA 1996 final rule. The Senate bill (\u00a7 102(a)(2)(E) of S. 982) states that the new version of the FDA 1996 final rule must include modifications in light of First Amendment case law. Some experts believe that tobacco advertising restrictions face challenges in meeting both effectiveness and extensiveness criteria under the Central Hudson test. The advertising restrictions in H.R. 1256 may be considered too extensive and not reasonably related to the government's interest, potentially failing the Central Hudson test. The bill includes a severability clause to ensure enforcement even if certain provisions are invalidated. This section also discusses federal preemption of state law in the context of FDA tobacco legislation, specifically the preemption provision in the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act. The Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act includes a preemption provision that prohibits additional health-related statements on cigarette packages and prevents states from imposing any other requirements on advertising. The U.S. Supreme Court has issued decisions on the preemption provision of the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, ruling that certain state tort actions against cigarette manufacturers are preempted by federal law. The plaintiff sued cigarette manufacturers for failing to warn about health risks, breaching warranties, fraudulent advertising, and concealing health data. Defendants argued that federal law preempted state claims. The FCLAA contains two preemption provisions regarding cigarette packaging and advertising. The first provision prohibits states from requiring additional statements on cigarette packages beyond the warnings prescribed by the Act. The second provision prohibits states from imposing any requirements or prohibitions on cigarette advertising or promotion. The Supreme Court interpreted these provisions separately, allowing state courts to award damages for failure to warn while preempting state regulations on cigarette advertising. The Supreme Court interpreted the FCLAA's preemption provisions, allowing state courts to award damages for failure to warn while preempting state regulations on cigarette advertising. Failure-to-warn claims are preempted if they require additional warnings in advertising, but not if they relate to testing or research practices. Breach of express warranty claims are not preempted as they arise from voluntary statements, and fraudulent misrepresentation claims are preempted if based on advertising statements that neutralize federally mandated warning labels. The Supreme Court addressed FCLAA preemption in Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, ruling that state restrictions on cigarette advertising were preempted. Claims based on concealment of smoking hazards through channels other than advertising are not preempted. The Supreme Court ruled in Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly that state regulations on cigarette advertising were preempted by the FCLAA. However, the FCLAA does not preempt state laws that prohibit sales to minors or restrict smoking in public places. In Altria Group, Inc. v. Good, the Court addressed whether the FCLAA preempted a state law claim regarding deceptive cigarette labeling. The MUTPA prohibits unfair trade practices, and the Court used the \"predicate-duty\" test from Cipollone to determine preemption. The Court in Altria Group, Inc. v. Good ruled that state law claims under the MUTPA were not preempted by the FCLAA, as they were based on the general duty not to deceive. The Court rejected Philip Morris's argument of implied preemption due to FTC actions promoting low tar cigarettes, stating that it did not justify preempting state deceptive practices rules like the MUTPA. The Court in Altria Group, Inc. v. Good ruled that state law claims under the MUTPA were not preempted by the FCLAA. The public health community supports eliminating FCLAA preemption for state tobacco regulations, while tobacco companies oppose it to maintain national standards. Any changes to the FCLAA's preemption provision could impact the types of lawsuits against tobacco companies. H.R. 1256 / S. 982 could impact lawsuits against cigarette manufacturers by potentially allowing states to regulate certain aspects of cigarette advertising and promotion, while still prohibiting them from adding their own warning labels to cigarette packages. This change aims to accommodate both sides of the argument regarding FCLAA preemption. H.R. 1256 / S. 982 \u00a7 916 would amend the FCLAA preemption provision and introduce a general preemption provision in the new FFDCA language. This provision would restrict states on certain aspects of tobacco product standards, adulteration, and misbranding, while allowing them to regulate the sale, advertising, and promotion of tobacco products. Attorneys general from 46 states signed the Master Settlement Agreement with major cigarette companies to settle state lawsuits related to smoking-related illnesses. The Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) involved major cigarette companies making annual payments of $200 billion over 25 years and agreeing to restrictions on tobacco advertising. This included bans on targeting youth, using cartoons in ads, limited brand sponsorships, and restrictions on outdoor advertising. The Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) imposed restrictions on tobacco advertising in various media, banned non-tobacco apparel with brand-name logos, prohibited gifts of non-tobacco items to youth for tobacco products, restricted the use of non-tobacco brand names for tobacco products, and limited free samples of tobacco products to adult-only facilities."
