    "content": "The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) is a strategic review process conducted by the Department of Defense every four years, generating an unclassified report specified by law. The most recent QDR in 2013 occurred amidst evolving strategic environment, fiscal constraints, and adjustments in DOD's strategic direction. The process aims to reassess and refine DOD's strategic direction and mandate. The QDR aims to ensure DOD's strategic vision is widely understood, establish internal division of labor, provide guidance for force planning, synchronize with national-level strategies, and facilitate Congressional oversight. The report briefly reviews the statutory QDR mandate and characterizes the context for the 2014 QDR, raising issues for Congress to consider in evaluating the mandate. The QDR mandate, outlined in Section 118 of Title 10, U.S. Code, requires a review every four years during the first year of a presidential administration. It must provide a 20-year outlook, be fiscally unconstrained by the President's budget, delineate a national defense strategy, determine force structure and modernization plans, and submit a report to Congress. The QDR mandate, outlined in Section 118 of Title 10, U.S. Code, requires a review every four years during the first year of a presidential administration. The Defense submits a report to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees the year following the QDR, addressing 16 specific points including the national defense strategy, national security interests, and threats examined. The report is not classified, and additional items can be included at the Secretary's discretion. The QDR mandate, outlined in Section 118 of Title 10, U.S. Code, requires a review every four years during the first year of a presidential administration. The Defense submits a report to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees the year following the QDR, addressing 16 specific points including the national defense strategy, national security interests, and threats examined. The report is not classified, and additional items can be included at the Secretary's discretion. The review includes scenarios of threats to the United States, assumptions used in the review, effects on force structure and readiness for combat, and policies on manpower, sustainment, and contractor support. The curr_chunk discusses the policies needed to support engagement in conflicts lasting longer than 120 days, the roles of reserve components in the national defense strategy, the tooth-to-tail ratio of combat forces to support forces, specific military capabilities required for strategic objectives, and transportation capabilities. The curr_chunk focuses on identifying strategic and tactical transportation capabilities needed to support the national defense strategy, including air-lift, sea-lift, and ground transportation. It also addresses forward presence, pre-positioning, resource shifting among theaters, Unified Command Plan revisions, future technologies impact on force structure, Coast Guard's defense mission, and homeland defense support. The QDR statutory mandate requires the organization and capabilities for active and reserve components to fulfill missions, along with oversight by an independent National Defense Panel. The panel reviews QDR terms, assesses strategy and risks, compares force structures and resource requirements, and submits recommendations to Congress within three months. The 2014 QDR report is due to be submitted to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees within three months of DOD submitting the report. This review comes amidst a complex global security environment and fiscal constraints, with President Obama directing DOD to find $400 billion in defense budget savings in 2011. Secretary of Defense Gates emphasized the need for strategic cuts based on a review of America's missions, capabilities, and role in the world. In August 2011, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta confirmed DOD's implementation of a \"fundamental review\" to address core strategic questions and financial costs. In January 2012, DOD released the Defense Strategic Guidance (DSG) to set priorities, activities, and budget requests for the next decade, considering cost savings and changes in the global security environment post-9/11. The Defense Strategic Guidance (DSG) issued in response to the decade of warfare post-9/11 called for a shift in DOD's priorities towards Asia and the Pacific region, emphasizing power projection over stabilization operations. It also emphasized reliance on advanced capabilities like Special Operations Forces, intelligence technologies, and cyberspace capabilities. However, the DSG was already outdated due to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which mandated defense spending reductions for ten years. The Budget Control Act of 2011 mandated defense spending reductions for ten years through sequestration if deficit reduction agreements were not reached. Efforts to alleviate fixed caps and sequestration restrictions failed, leading to the launch of the Strategic Choices and Management Review (SCMR) by Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel in 2013 to explore implications of continued budget reductions. The SCMR considered three fiscal scenarios for DOD budget reductions: the President's FY2014 budget projection, the BCA's topline caps and restrictions, and an \"in-between\" scenario. DOD senior officials argued that the BCA topline caps and sequestration restrictions would \"break\" the 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 amended the BCA to raise the topline budget caps for FY 2014 and FY 2015. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 amended the Budget Control Act (BCA) to raise the budget caps for FY 2014 and FY 2015, offsetting the cost by extending the BCA for FY 2022 and FY 2023. This change provides stability and relief for the next two fiscal years for the Department of Defense (DOD), allowing for more flexibility in balancing cost savings over a ten-year period. However, uncertainty remains for the out years, which are still subject to the original BCA caps and restrictions. Some DOD officials are uncertain about future fiscal planning. Congress may need to consider issues related to DOD's 2014 QDR and U.S. defense strategy. U.S. strategic guidance emphasizes the need for leadership, but there are differing views on how power operates globally. Leading experts disagree on the importance of personalities, perceptions, and military capabilities in exercising leadership. Key questions about the U.S. leadership role on the world stage include the extent, arenas, and cost of leadership, the tools for effective leadership, and its importance to national security. Uncertainty in the global security environment is a key factor in shaping U.S. defense strategy and leadership decisions. The global security environment is uncertain, with various potential threats. It is crucial to link key trajectories in the security environment with U.S. national interests. The President must submit an annual report on national security strategy to Congress, outlining vital worldwide interests for U.S. national security. Observers recommend analyzing specific U.S. interests impacted by global security dynamics in terms of likelihood, imminence, and severity of impact. Key questions regarding the global security environment include characterizing U.S. national security interests, distinguishing between vital and important interests, framing security threats, and considering factors like likelihood, imminence, and severity. The timeframe for national security planning and the confidence in long-term outlooks are also important considerations. The 2012 DSG outlined ten \"priority missions\" for the DOD, but many suggest explicit prioritization is needed for better understanding and execution. Prioritization can also help justify tough decisions to external audiences like Congress. Missions are interconnected, not isolated. The 2012 DSG outlined ten \"priority missions\" for the DOD, emphasizing the interconnected nature of these missions. Service roles are distinct, and some priorities are \"more equal than others\" in terms of force sizing. Key questions revolve around mission priorities and their impact on U.S. interests and global security. The 2012 DSG outlined ten \"priority missions\" for the DOD, emphasizing the interconnected nature of these missions. Key questions include the extent of changes in U.S. interests and global strategic environment, fiscal constraints driving strategic updates, mission prioritization clarity within DOD, implications for each military service, and the importance of missions not sized against. The 2012 DSG outlined priority missions for the DOD, emphasizing interconnected nature. It signaled geographic prioritization with a focus on Asia and the Pacific region, some attention to the Middle East, and intent to decrease engagement elsewhere. The 2014 QDR debates explored assuming greater risk in some areas. The 2014 QDR debates considered assuming greater risk in certain regions and questioned the current geographic priorities, particularly focusing on the Pacific and Middle East. The concept of \"presence\" as a powerful tool for shaping events on the world stage was also discussed. The strategic rationale for DOD's global presence should be debated, focusing on providing closer proximity for future contingencies, guaranteeing access, deterring aggressors, and shaping state and non-state actors' choices. This debate is crucial for making informed policy decisions and considering the impact of BCA topline caps and sequestration restrictions on DOD's global presence. The 2012 DSG introduced adjustments to DOD's global presence strategy, emphasizing \"rotational presence\" through various approaches like permanent, continual, limited, and virtual versions of presence. This strategy aims to balance priorities of deterring aggressors, shaping state and non-state actors' choices, and building relationships with Allies and partners. The DOD emphasizes \"rotational presence\" over permanent forward presence globally. Questions arise about differentiating the effects of various forms of presence, the importance of maintaining forward presence, and the risks of scaled-back presence. Discussions include the fungibility of presence forms, risks of substituting less robust engagement, and the validity of \"virtual presence is actual absence\" observation. The DOD emphasizes \"rotational presence\" over permanent forward presence globally, but questions remain about the effectiveness of different forms of presence, the importance of maintaining forward presence, and the risks of scaled-back presence. Discussions also touch on the fungibility of presence forms, risks of substituting less robust engagement, and the validity of the observation that \"virtual presence is actual absence\". The debate surrounding the potential value of partnership in global security involves two main perspectives: one emphasizing the extension of U.S. reach and the other focusing on cost savings. Skeptics question the affordability of such partnerships for the DOD in a challenging budget climate. International partnerships can vary in form, from building host nation security forces to fostering specific capabilities in developing partners. Partnerships in global security can be conducted bilaterally or under formal alliances like NATO, each offering different advantages. The concept of \"smart partnership\" is proposed to navigate global security challenges and fiscal constraints effectively. The concept of \"smart partnership\" suggests investing in combined effectiveness for future military operations with international partners. It emphasizes making tailored partnership investments based on desired effects, costs, timelines, and risks. Key questions include how building partner capacity can protect U.S. national security interests and the importance of partnership in defense strategy implementation. The concept of \"smart partnership\" involves investing in combined effectiveness for future military operations with international partners. Key questions include how to gauge opportunity costs associated with scaling back partnership activities and what the goal of partnership should be. This includes saving money, extending U.S. reach, meeting global security challenges, and influencing regional and global rules and norms. It may be helpful to differentiate among different categories of partnership activities for decision-making and oversight. The DOD's vision for partnership involves questions on resourcing decisions, conflict prevention, assessing outcomes, political will of allies, shaping allies' actions, evaluating risks, and acceptable divergence in partner actions. The importance of investing in NATO Alliance versus specific partners is also considered. Investing in the NATO Alliance versus specific capable states for future coalition operations is a key consideration. Strategic guidance emphasizes deterrence to prevent wars, with experts debating its effectiveness. The concept applies to both nuclear and non-nuclear scenarios. During the Cold War, the U.S. relied on nuclear deterrence with a second-strike capability to prevent attacks. This strategy involved maintaining a credible threat of retaliation to deter adversaries, including the Soviet Union. The U.S. continues to support extended deterrence post-Cold War, using a mix of nuclear and conventional capabilities to deter attacks against Allies in a changing global context with diverse actors and varying notions of \"unacceptable costs.\" The 2012 DSG highlighted the importance of deterrence but raised more questions than answers. It suggested the possibility of achieving deterrence goals with a smaller nuclear force without explaining the rationale. It emphasized that credible deterrence requires capabilities to deny an aggressor's objectives and impose unacceptable costs. Key questions concerning deterrence include the extent of current U.S. approaches to nuclear deterrence, the application of a single strategic logic to deterring use by nuclear powers and acquisition by aspirant states, and the effectiveness of conventional weapons in deterring nuclear attacks. The 2012 DSG emphasized the importance of deterrence but left unanswered questions about the rationale for achieving deterrence goals with a smaller nuclear force. The 2012 DSG raised key questions about the effectiveness of current U.S. approaches to nuclear deterrence and the use of conventional weapons in deterring nuclear attacks. It also questioned the rationale for achieving deterrence goals with a smaller nuclear force. The QDRs aim to revisit and update DOD's force planning construct, considering factors like military capabilities, economic strength, and international partnerships. The 2012 DSG introduced a force planning construct (FPC) calling for a future force capable of conducting simultaneous efforts to defeat an adversary and deny aggressor objectives. This FPC aims to shape and size the force for combined arms campaigns across all domains, including large-scale ground operations. The 2012 DSG introduced a force planning construct (FPC) for a future force capable of conducting simultaneous efforts to defeat an adversary and deny aggressor objectives. Concerns were raised about the understanding and execution of the FPC within DOD, as well as its ability to account for steady-state activities like presence and deterrence. The 2012 DSG introduced a force planning construct (FPC) for a future force capable of defeating an adversary and denying aggressor objectives. Concerns were raised about the FPC's ability to account for steady-state activities like presence and deterrence, as well as the risks it accepts for the force and mission. Observers and practitioners emphasize the importance of striking a balance of roles and responsibilities across the Total Force to eliminate gaps, redundancies, and achieve efficiencies through stronger integration of effort. The 2012 DSG emphasized the use of special operations forces (SOF) over conventional forces due to strategic and fiscal reasons. Proponents highlighted SOF's ability to strike and partner with other security forces globally. Skeptics raised concerns about the time needed to grow effective SOF, potential stress on the force, and the importance of complementary roles like command and control in complex operations. The 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance (DSG) emphasized the use of special operations forces (SOF) over conventional forces for strategic and fiscal reasons. It called for a greater reliance on SOF and highlighted the need to clarify the division of labor between SOF and conventional forces, particularly in areas like command and control and security force assistance. Additionally, the DSG called for increasing reliance on the Reserve Component (RC) and left it to each service to determine the implications for the Active Component (AC) in light of this shift. The 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance emphasized greater reliance on special operations forces (SOF) over conventional forces for strategic and fiscal reasons. It called for clarifying the roles and responsibilities between SOF and conventional forces, particularly in command and control and security force assistance. Key questions remain on how integration of effort and the balance of roles between SOF and conventional forces should evolve, considering changes in the global security landscape and fiscal constraints. The text discusses the integration of efforts between special operations forces (SOF) and conventional forces, focusing on how they can complement each other under changing global security and fiscal constraints. It raises questions about refining the balance of roles and responsibilities between active and reserve components to ensure they support defense strategy effectively. The text also touches on the importance of considering criteria for the AC/RC total force mix and calculating costs based on varying terms of service and responsibilities. The text raises questions about evaluating effectiveness in mission areas, reliance on the Reserve Component (RC) to mitigate risks, lessons learned from past warfighting experiences, and uncertainties regarding integration and division of labor between Special Operations Forces (SOF) and conventional forces. It also discusses the role of an \"honest broker\" in resolving tensions and risks to mission or the force. The text discusses the need for an \"honest broker\" to facilitate balance for the Total Force and the role of an independent panel in challenging assumptions and improving the QDR process. This internal competition aims to strengthen the formal process and enhance its output. The \"red team\" created to support the 2006 QDR closely followed the formal process and engaged with big ideas. An external panel can craft a complete alternative approach to spur debate and improve decision-making. This requires time, expertise, and staffing to establish a coherent counterpoint to the formal process. A competition of ideas can serve as a catalyst for debates in the QDR process. Key questions include the importance of external catalysts for strategic thinking, the role of grading the formal process, and the need for support mechanisms for outside panels. The goal is to offer alternative approaches for better oversight and decision-making. To enhance future decision-making in the QDR process, the idea of soliciting input from an independent panel early on is proposed. The potential benefits of establishing a standing independent panel to support DOD's QDR processes are considered, along with the value of a permanent institutional home and continuity of membership. The need to differentiate between catalyzing the QDR process and maintaining strategic engines within DOD is also discussed. Compliance with the statutory mandate for the QDR is a key oversight issue for Congress, with the conduct of past QDR processes and the contents of their reports being legally prescribed. The Department of Defense has generally complied with the statutory mandate for the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) reports, but there are concerns about the accuracy of the 20-year outlook. Some suggest that the list of items to be addressed in the QDR report is outdated due to the accumulation of legacy legislative language over time. The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) report may be outdated as new strategic concerns arise, with older terminology and concepts not being removed. Questions have been raised about the fixed four-year cycle of the QDR, which some believe lacks flexibility to adjust DOD's focus and priorities as circumstances change. Suggestions have been made to follow the statutory mandate for the national military strategy (NMS) for greater flexibility, as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is required to submit an NMS every two years when necessary. The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) and its value in comparison to other defense strategies have been questioned. Key questions include DOD's compliance with the QDR mandate, the effectiveness of a 20-year time horizon, and the impact of eliminating the QDR requirement on decision-making and oversight. The importance of the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) in synchronizing strategy vertically and horizontally within the U.S. Government, its contribution to national security and military strategy, its role as a strategic communications tool, and its utility for oversight purposes are all key considerations. Updating, revising, or streamlining the statutory mandate may improve the QDR's effectiveness for oversight. Strategic review processes can foster internal consensus and produce materials for external communications, but the fundamental contribution of any review is challenging to determine. Generating smart, rigorous strategic thinking is a fundamental contribution of any review, including the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR). Key questions revolve around DOD's internal entities mandated for long-term strategic thinking and ensuring strategic rigor in review processes. Access to debates without constraints is crucial for these entities. Access to debates without constraints is crucial for DOD's internal entities mandated for long-term strategic thinking. Former House Armed Services Committee Chairman Ike Skelton emphasized the need for strategic thinkers like General George C. Marshall, Jr. How should DOD identify and develop potential strategists and ensure their career paths are appropriate? To identify and develop potential strategists, craft suitable career paths, and integrate their insights into DOD's decision-making processes."
