    "content": "This report provides an overview of the federal response to domestic violence through the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act (FVPSA), administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Administration for Children and Families (ACF) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). FVPSA programs include grants to support local organizations providing shelter and assistance for victims, a national domestic violence hotline, and funding for state domestic violence coalitions. The report discusses coalitions and resource centers that provide training and advocacy for domestic violence providers. The CDC funds prevention efforts through the DELTA program. The House Committee on Education and Labor and the Senate HELP Committee oversee FVPSA. The report also covers definitions of domestic violence, risk factors, and the history leading to the enactment of FVPSA. The report highlights the provisions of the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act (FVPSA), including a national domestic violence hotline, support for shelters, and community-based prevention efforts. It also addresses assistance for children and youth exposed to domestic violence and its interaction with other federal laws like the Violence Against Women Act. Since the enactment of VAWA in 1994, the federal response to domestic violence has expanded to include investigating and prosecuting crimes, along with providing services to victims and abusers. The Family Violence Prevention and Services Act (FVPSA) includes provisions for coordinating programs with other federal agencies, defining family violence as acts of physical violence among related individuals, and providing funding and statistics related to domestic violence victimization. The focus is on physical forms of violence between abusers and victims who live together or are related by blood or marriage. Family violence, as defined under the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act (FVPSA), includes nonphysical violence and physical violence outside of intimate relationships. It covers a range of scenarios such as rape, sexual violence, stalking, abuse of children and elderly family members, and psychological torment. FVPSA programs focus on individuals abused by spouses and intimate partners, referencing terms like \"domestic violence\" and \"dating violence\" defined under VAWA. The VAWA definition of \"domestic violence\" includes forms of intimate partner violence involving current and former spouses, cohabiting individuals, and parents of children in common. \"Dating violence\" is defined as violence committed by someone in a romantic or intimate relationship with the victim. The federal government addresses child abuse and elder abuse separately. The federal government responds to child abuse and elder abuse through various programs authorized and funded under different laws. Titles IV-B and IV-E of the Social Security Act and CAPTA address child abuse, while the Older Americans Act (OAA) and the National Center on Elder Abuse focus on elder abuse prevention. The Social Services Block Grant also includes provisions for elder justice initiatives to promote the well-being of older Americans. The research literature on domestic violence identifies two underlying influences: the unequal position of women and the normalization of violence in society and relationships. Risk factors associated with domestic violence include substance abuse, poverty, and early parenthood. Substance abuse often precedes incidents of domestic violence, as shown in a U.S. Department of Justice study linking substance abuse to severe violent incidents. Domestic violence is often linked to substance abuse, with over 80% of men who killed or attempted to kill their intimate partners being problem drinkers. Estimating the number of individuals involved in domestic violence is complex due to varying definitions and methodologies for data collection. Survivors may not report their victimization due to shame, fear, or lack of support. The National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS) and the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) show that intimate partner violence is common, affecting both women and men sexually, physically, and psychologically. Minority individuals experience higher victimization rates than white individuals. NISVS collects data on domestic violence prevalence over individuals' lifetimes and in the past year. Contact sexual violence and physical violence are among the aspects examined in the survey. The 2015 survey found that women and men in the United States were victimized at about the same rate over their lifetime, with over one-third experiencing sexual violence, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner. Women were more likely than men to experience certain types of intimate partner violence, such as contact sexual violence, stalking, and severe physical violence. Women also reported a higher impact related to partner violence over their lifetimes. Women and men of color, especially those who are multiracial, have higher rates of experiencing domestic violence. In the 2010 NISVS, multiracial women had the highest rates of contact sexual violence, physical violence, and stalking by an intimate partner. Black and multiracial men were more likely to experience intimate partner violence compared to white and Hispanic men. The 2010 NISVS examined the prevalence of intimate partner violence. The 2010 NISVS found that bisexual women had higher rates of sexual violence, physical violence, and stalking by an intimate partner compared to lesbian and heterosexual women. The study also showed that women affiliated with the military were less likely to be victims of intimate partner violence, but active duty women deployed in the three years prior to the survey were at higher risk. Active duty women deployed in the three years prior to the survey were more likely to experience intimate partner violence compared to those who were not deployed. 12% of deployed women experienced physical violence, rape, or stalking by an intimate partner in the past three years, and 35% experienced victimization over their lifetime. This is higher than the 10% and 28% prevalence among non-deployed women. The National Crime Victimization Survey provides information on criminal nonfatal victimization and crimes reported to law enforcement. The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) collects data on various types of crimes, including intimate partner violence. In 2016, nearly 600,000 individuals were victims of intimate partner violence. A previous study showed a decline in the number of female victims of domestic violence from 1.8 million in 1994 to about 621,000 in 2011, with a significant decrease in serious intimate partner violence rates for both females and males. The prevalence of intimate partner violence, including sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault, decreased significantly for both females and males. A small percentage of victims experienced severe physical harm. Domestic violence leads to negative outcomes such as mental distress and health effects, with women being more affected. A quarter of women and one in ten men who experienced violence by an intimate partner reported various impacts, including fear, safety concerns, injuries, and missed work or school. Early marriage laws in the United States allowed men to abuse their wives, leading to a hidden problem of family violence. Victims, mostly women, suffered in silence due to fear of retaliation and concerns about leaving their homes. They were often blamed for their abuse based on stereotypes of women. Shelters and services for domestic violence victims became available in the 1960s, but were not always specifically targeted towards them. The battered women's movement emerged in the 1970s to raise awareness about abused women by spouses and partners. Influenced by movements in England and the US, shelters were opened to provide services primarily to abused women and their children. The battered women's movement in the 1970s established shelters in various locations to provide services to abused women and their children. Groups organized coalitions for public education, support groups, and services, such as a hotline in Chicago. The Chicago Abused Women's Coalition addressed concerns and advocated for funding and support for abused women. The battered women's movement in the 1970s established shelters across the country to assist abused women. These shelters provided a safe environment, emotional support, counseling, legal information, and housing assistance. Public awareness of domestic violence increased in the 1980s, with Time magazine publishing an article on the issue. In the 1980s, public awareness of domestic violence increased, leading to a shift in attitudes towards wife beating in the United States. The Department of Justice Task Force on Family Violence was established in 1984 to address the scope and impact of domestic violence, providing recommendations for improving law enforcement and community response. Congress began to show interest in domestic violence issues as a result of advocacy efforts and reports from the Justice Department. In the 1980s, public awareness of domestic violence increased, leading to a shift in attitudes. The House Select Committee on Children, Youth, and Families conducted hearings in 1983 and 1984 on family violence. The Family Violence Prevention and Services Act (FVPSA) was enacted in 1984 to address the issue, with subsequent reauthorizations occurring as part of legislation reauthorizing the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act. The Family Violence Prevention and Services Act (FVPSA) was reauthorized through P.L. 111-320, extending funding authority until FY2015. Congress later expanded the federal response to domestic violence with the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, which included social service and law enforcement components. Grants were authorized for states, territories, and Indian tribes to prevent domestic violence and provide shelter for victims. Funding for these grants was transferred from HHS to DOJ from FY1986 to FY1994, with 23 projects funded to train law enforcement personnel. The Family Violence Prevention and Services Act (FVPSA) funded 23 projects to train law enforcement officers on domestic violence policies and response procedures. Approximately 16,000 law enforcement officers and other justice system personnel from 25 states received this training, emphasizing a coordinated response to domestic violence. Funding for FVPSA law enforcement training grants was discontinued in 1992, before the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 authorized a similar program under the Services, Training, Officers, and Prosecutors (STOP) Grant program. The Family Violence Prevention and Services Act (FVPSA) authorizes domestic violence prevention activities, a national hotline, and support for shelters. Funding has been extended multiple times, with appropriations reaching over $180 million for FY2019. The CDC administers the DELTA program, while the Family and Youth Services Bureau administers funding for the hotline and shelters. The FVPSA has authorized funding for prevention activities since 1996 under the DELTA program, focusing on preventing domestic violence before it occurs. The program has had four iterations and aims to coordinate local community projects to prevent domestic violence, including youth involvement. The DELTA program has had four iterations: FY2012 involved 19 states, DELTA FOCUS from FY2013-2017 involved 10 states, and DELTA Impact from FY2018 involves 10 states. The program provides funding and technical assistance to state domestic violence coalitions for prevention strategies and coordinated community responses (CCRs) led by various stakeholders. The CDC supported two CCRs focusing on faith-based initiatives to prevent domestic violence. State domestic violence coalitions developed Intimate Partner Violence Prevention Plans with stakeholders to prevent first-time perpetration or victimization. A CDC brief summarized the plans, highlighting successes and challenges in supporting intimate partner violence prevention efforts. States improved their capacity in this area. The CDC supported intimate partner violence prevention efforts through projects like DELTA Prep and DELTA FOCUS. These projects extended training and assistance to states to build prevention strategies and leadership for domestic violence prevention. DELTA FOCUS and DELTA Impact funded state domestic violence coalitions to implement prevention strategies and evaluate their effectiveness. DELTA FOCUS focused on implementing prevention strategies and evaluating programs, while DELTA Impact supports community response teams in decreasing domestic violence risk factors and increasing protective factors based on evidence-based practices. The Family Violence Prevention and Services Act (FVPSA) directs the HHS Secretary to award grants for domestic violence prevention efforts. Grantees focus on engaging influential adults and peers, creating protective environments, and strengthening economic supports for families. The National Domestic Violence Hotline, operated by the National Council on Family Violence in Texas, provides information and assistance to adults. The National Domestic Violence Hotline, funded by FVPSA, offers support to adult and youth victims of domestic violence, family members, and others affected by victimization. It provides counseling, referral services, and connects callers to service providers. In FY2018, the hotline received 23,000 calls monthly, responded to 74% of calls, and had nearly 4,000 online chats per month. Some calls were missed due to increased media coverage and Spanish chat services. The National Domestic Violence Hotline offers support to adult and youth victims of domestic violence, providing counseling, referral services, and connecting callers to service providers. It maintains a database of domestic violence services throughout the United States, including shelter availability. Special populations like underserved groups, individuals with disabilities, and youth victims of domestic violence are assisted. The hotline also offers support for callers with limited English proficiency and those who are deaf or hard of hearing. Since 2007, a separate helpline for youth victims of domestic violence, the National Dating Abuse Helpline, has been operated, providing real-time support primarily from peer advocates trained to help those in abusive dating relationships. The National Domestic Violence Hotline provides support, information, and advocacy for those in abusive dating relationships. In FY2018, the helpline received an average of 2,400 calls, 4,000 online chats, and 1,300 texts per month. A 2019 study examined the demographics of contacts, with 48% being victims/survivors. Emotional support was the most common service provided, valued highly by contactors. The hotline collaborated with the National Indigenous Women's Resource Center to fund the StrongHearts Native Helpline. The StrongHearts Native Helpline was developed and funded by the Indigenous Women's Resource Center to provide culturally appropriate services for Native American survivors of domestic abuse. Funding includes grants for shelter, support services, and program support. FY2018 allocations for these activities are detailed in the report. The report provides information on grants for states, territories, tribes, and domestic violence coalitions. It also includes details on national and special issue resource centers. FVPSA appropriations must allocate at least 70% for shelter and services through formula grants to prevent domestic violence and support victims. Territories like Guam and American Samoa receive a minimum allocation. The Family Violence Prevention and Services Act (FVPSA) allocates funding to states, territories, and tribes for domestic violence prevention and victim support. Territories like U.S. Virgin Islands and Northern Mariana Islands receive a portion of the appropriation, while states receive a base allotment of $600,000 plus additional funding based on population. Indian tribes receive at least 10% of FVPSA appropriations for shelter and services. States must make assurances on fund use and victim support when applying for grants. States, territories, and tribes receive funding from the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act for domestic violence prevention and victim support. States can use up to 5% of their grant for administrative costs and the rest for subgrants to eligible entities. Subgrant funding must allocate at least 70% for temporary shelter and related services, and 25% for supportive and prevention services for victims. The Family Violence Prevention and Services Act provides funding to states, territories, and tribes for domestic violence prevention and victim support. Services include peer support groups, referrals to community-based services, training, outreach, culturally appropriate services, counseling for children exposed to domestic violence, advocacy, case management, legal and medical advocacy, and assistance in accessing financial programs. The Family Violence Prevention and Services Act provides funding for domestic violence prevention and victim support, including legal and medical advocacy, housing assistance, job training, financial literacy, and outreach to underserved populations. States must consult with domestic violence coalitions in planning and monitoring grant distribution. States must involve community-based organizations to provide culturally appropriate services to underserved populations and have laws in place to protect victims of domestic violence, including eviction laws or civil protection orders. Funding should prioritize supporting effective community-based projects by nonprofit organizations that operate shelters for victims and provide counseling and advocacy. The federal government provides funding to states for programs that support victims of domestic violence and their dependents. States have flexibility in how they allocate the funds as long as they ensure equitable distribution within the state and between urban and rural areas. Subgrantees must provide a nonfederal match of at least $1 for every $5 of federal funding. The funds must supplement, not replace, other public funds for domestic violence services. States have two years to spend the funds allocated to them. The federal government provides funding to states for programs supporting victims of domestic violence. States must ensure equitable distribution of funds and provide a nonfederal match. Subgrantees funded under FVPSA may not deny individuals from accessing services. In FY2017, programs funded by grants supported over 240,000 clients in residential settings and more than 1 million in nonresidential settings. States and subgrantees funded under FVPSA must not discriminate based on disability, sex, race, color, national origin, or religion. They cannot impose income eligibility requirements on participants and must protect the confidentiality of victims and their families. Personally identifying information collected must not be disclosed without consent, except when compelled by law, in which case victims must be notified and their privacy and safety protected. Since 1992, FVPSA has authorized funding for state domestic violence coalitions (SDVCs), which are statewide nongovernmental, nonprofit organizations. SDVCs must protect the privacy and safety of victims, provide shelter and services voluntarily, and cannot compel individuals to participate. Additionally, subgrantees are prohibited from making the location of confidential shelters public without written authorization. No direct payments can be made to victims or their dependents. Information sharing is allowed if it is aggregated and does not identify individuals, or if it is generated by law enforcement for protective orders or prosecutorial purposes. State domestic violence coalitions (SDVCs) are nonprofit organizations that provide education, support, and technical assistance to domestic violence service providers. They serve as information clearinghouses and resource centers for the state, supporting the development of policies to enhance domestic violence intervention and prevention. Funding is available for SDVCs in each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and other territories. State domestic violence coalitions (SDVCs) in each state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and four territories receive funding from HHS. Each jurisdiction has one SDVC designated by HHS, with funding divided evenly. SDVCs must use FVPSA funding for specific activities, including working with local domestic violence service programs, providing training and technical assistance, and collaborating with service providers to address the needs of domestic violence victims. The curr_chunk discusses collaborating with various organizations to address the needs of domestic violence victims, encouraging appropriate responses to domestic violence cases, and working on child custody and visitation issues in cases of children exposed to domestic violence. The curr_chunk discusses the authorization for resource centers on domestic violence, including special issue resource centers, as part of the reauthorization of the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act (FVPSA). The 2010 reauthorization of the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act (FVPSA) included authorization for a national resource center on American Indian women and culturally specific resources. It also authorized special issue resource centers for training and technical assistance on domestic violence intervention and prevention, as well as state resource centers to address disparities in domestic violence in states with high proportions of Indian or Native Hawaiian populations. These resource centers aim to provide information, training, and technical assistance on domestic violence issues to various stakeholders. The CDC reports high rates of physical and sexual dating violence among teenagers, with 1 in 9 female teens and 1 in 13 male teens experiencing physical violence, and over 1 in 7 female teens and nearly 1 in 19 male teens experiencing sexual violence annually. The FVPSA statute references dating violence and uses the definition from VAWA. The FVPSA statute references dating violence defined in VAWA as violence in a romantic or intimate relationship. Domestic violence shelters funded by FVPSA are for adult victims and their children. Teen victims of dating violence can access support through the National Domestic Violence Hotline. The Violence Hotline, including the loveisrespect helpline, provides support for youth victims of domestic violence. Children exposed to domestic violence can witness violent acts, see bruises, or live in a violent household. Approximately 7 to 10 million children are exposed to adult domestic violence each year. The impact of domestic violence on children is a growing area of research. The effects of domestic violence on children can vary from little to severe harm, depending on the type and severity of abuse. FVPSA activities provide specialized services for children exposed to domestic violence, including counseling and advocacy. State domestic violence coalitions collaborate with legal and child protective services to support these children. The FVPSA statute authorizes funding for specialized services for abused parents and their children, including responses to child custody and visitation issues in cases involving domestic violence. Funding for children exposed to domestic violence is set aside if appropriations exceed $130 million, with at least 25% reserved for grants to organizations serving victims. The FVPSA statute authorizes funding for specialized services for abused parents and their children, including responses to child custody and visitation issues in cases involving domestic violence. Funding for children exposed to domestic violence is set aside if appropriations exceed $130 million, with at least 25% reserved for grants to organizations serving victims. Nonprofit organizations and tribal organizations with a record of serving domestic violence victims received funding to expand service programs and prevent future domestic violence by addressing children's needs. Funding exceeded $130 million in various fiscal years, with additional funds allocated for specialized services for children exposed to domestic violence through the Expanding Services for Children and Youth Exposed to Domestic Violence initiative. The FVPSA statute authorizes funding for specialized services for abused parents and their children, including responses to child custody and visitation issues in cases involving domestic violence. Funding for children exposed to domestic violence is set aside if appropriations exceed $130 million, with at least 25% reserved for grants to organizations serving victims. Nonprofit organizations and tribal organizations received funding to expand service programs and prevent future domestic violence by addressing children's needs. Funding exceeded $130 million in various fiscal years, with additional funds allocated for specialized services for children exposed to domestic violence through the Expanding Services for Children and Youth Exposed to Domestic Violence initiative. Five grantees, including state domestic violence coalitions and a national technical assistance provider, received funding to expand supports for children, youth, and parents exposed to domestic violence. Specialized services for abused parents and their children have received approximately $5.0 to $5.6 million in excess funding annually for FY2019. The funding has been allocated to 12 grantees, including domestic violence coalitions, to provide direct services aimed at alleviating trauma in children exposed to domestic violence and improving systemic responses. An additional grant of $500,000 annually has been awarded to Futures Without Violence to provide training and technical assistance to the grantees. FVPSA, reauthorized by VAWA, provides training and assistance to 12 grantees, coordinating with VOCA-funded programs. It encourages coordination with related federal programs and research. FVPSA acknowledges the link between child abuse and intimate partner violence, as highlighted in research literature. In a national study of children in families involved with child welfare agencies due to abuse and neglect, 28% of households had a history of domestic violence. CAPTA funds states to improve child protective services and requires collaboration between CPS and domestic violence agencies. Other federal efforts also address the link between domestic violence and child abuse. The Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) program supports young children in communities with domestic violence or child maltreatment. It provides grants for evidence-based home visiting programs. The Family Connection Grants program helps children in foster care or at risk of entering foster care connect with birth parents or extended kin. The Greenbook Initiative, supported by HHS and DOJ in the early 2000s, provides guidelines for child welfare agencies, domestic violence providers, and dependency courts to address domestic violence and child abuse. The Greenbook Initiative, supported by HHS and DOJ, provides guidelines for addressing domestic violence and child maltreatment in six communities. The Federal Interagency Working Group on Child Abuse and Neglect, led by HHS, includes a Domestic Violence Subcommittee focusing on initiatives for children exposed to domestic violence. FVPSA and VAWA are key federal support vehicles for preventing and responding to domestic violence, with FVPSA emphasizing prevention and victim services, while VAWA focuses on law enforcement and legal responses. VAWA was enacted in 1994 after Congress hearings on violence against women. Since its enactment in 1994, the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) has expanded the federal response to domestic violence by involving multiple departments in investigating and prosecuting crimes, providing services to victims and abusers, and educating stakeholders. The law was passed to address the shortfalls of legal responses and change attitudes towards violence against women, not just intimate partners. VAWA also addresses other forms of violence against women and complements the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act (FVPSA) in providing a comprehensive response to domestic violence. Some VAWA programs provide support to victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking. The STOP Violence Against Women Formula Grant program offers victim advocacy, crisis intervention, and legal system navigation. STOP grants also fund law enforcement, courts, and prosecution efforts. Another VAWA program offers Transitional Housing Assistance Grants. The Family Violence Prevention and Services Act (FVPSA) provides transitional housing services for victims of domestic violence, aiming to move them into permanent housing. FVPSA grants immediate shelter and assistance in securing safe permanent housing. Funding recipients must allocate a portion for specific activities, including accessing federal and state financial assistance programs like the Crime Victims Fund (CVF) under the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA). The Crime Victims Fund (CVF) under the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) provides funds for victims of domestic violence through the Victim Compensation Formula Grants program and Victims Assistance Formula Grants program. Victims Compensation Grants reimburse victims for expenses like medical and counseling costs, while Victims Assistance Formula Grants support victim service programs for direct services such as counseling and temporary housing. About 40% of claims filed are for victims of domestic violence. The Crime Victims Fund provides funds for victims of domestic violence through various programs, including counseling, temporary housing, and criminal justice advocacy support. Approximately 50% of victims served by these grants were victims of domestic violence. Both FVPSA and VAWA require federal agencies to coordinate their efforts to respond to domestic violence. The HHS and other federal agencies conduct research on family and related violence. VAWA mandates the Attorney General to establish a task force to coordinate research on domestic violence. The National Advisory Council on Violence Against Women was formed in 1995 to advise the government on domestic violence issues. In 2010, the National Advisory Committee on Violence Against Women was rechartered by then-Attorney General Eric Holder. The HHS Steering Committee on Violence Against Women was established in 2006 to provide policy advice on improving the nation's response to violence against women. It focuses on successful interventions for children and teens who witness or are victims of intimate partner and sexual violence. The committee includes representatives from the CDC and other HHS agencies, collaborating with professional societies in health and social service fields. The HHS Steering Committee on Violence Against Women collaborates with professional societies in health and social service fields to address women's health and violence issues. Federal agencies participate in the Federal Interagency Workgroup on Teen Dating Violence to coordinate program, policy, and research activities. The Office of the Vice President coordinates federal efforts to end violence against women. Prevalence and Effects of Domestic Violence, along with State and Territory Funding for Selected FVPSA Services, are discussed in the appendix."
