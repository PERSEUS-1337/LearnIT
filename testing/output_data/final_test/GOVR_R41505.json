    "content": "Over the past year, congressional interest has grown in the EPA's actions to address greenhouse gas emissions. The EPA has implemented rules for reporting emissions from stationary sources and setting standards for light duty vehicles. Starting January 2, 2011, stationary sources will be required to obtain permits for their GHG emissions. The EPA has implemented rules for reporting emissions from stationary sources and setting standards for light duty vehicles. Starting January 2, 2011, stationary sources will be required to obtain permits for their GHG emissions, particularly affecting new and modified electric generating units fired by coal. This poses a significant threat to the future of coal, with the coal mining industry and coal-fired electric utilities facing multiple regulatory actions. The EPA's rules require new and modified major sources to install Best Available Control Technology (BACT) for each regulated pollutant. This includes preconstruction review and permitting under the Clean Air Act, with a focus on coal-fired electric generating units. Best Available Control Technology (BACT) is determined by state permitting agencies on a case-by-case basis, considering energy, environmental, and economic impacts. It involves assessing air quality, impact analysis on pollution, and public involvement during the permit process. The EPA issues guidance to states for determining Best Available Control Technology (BACT) on a case-by-case basis, considering energy, environmental, and economic impacts. BACT must be at least as stringent as federal standards but can be more so. Greenhouse gases will be regulated starting January 2, 2011, with new and modified major stationary sources requiring permits. EPA estimates over six million existing stationary sources emit over 100 tons of greenhouse gases annually. The EPA estimates that over six million existing stationary sources emit 100 tons or more of greenhouse gases annually. The agency argues that expanding the PSD permit program by implementing a 100/250 ton threshold for GHGs would pose an extraordinary burden on itself and state permitting authorities. To address this issue, the EPA proposed the \"Tailoring Rule\" to prioritize the largest facilities for permitting. The Tailoring Rule proposed by the EPA focuses on larger facilities emitting over 25,000 to 100,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide or its equivalent in other GHGs. States are provided with guidance on making BACT determinations, with EPA reviewing and hearing appeals on these determinations. The BACT determination process, required for federally run programs and encouraged for state-run programs, follows a \"top-down\" approach. The process aims to install the measure that results in the maximum reduction in pollutants unless energy, environmental, and economic impacts justify its rejection. The five-step process outlined by the EPA includes identifying available control options such as existing technologies, feasible options from other sources, innovative technology, and inherently lower polluting processes. The EPA guidance outlines control options for emission reduction, including fuels, coatings, and design parameters. Options should be technically feasible and ranked based on effectiveness. Data sources for control options include EPA's BACT/LAER Clearinghouse, permits, vendors, and technical papers. During the NSR process, control options are evaluated based on pollutant reduction and criteria such as energy, environmental, and economic factors. The most effective option is determined as BACT, with corresponding emissions limits established by the permitting agency. The permit application undergoes review by various parties, potentially leading to administrative appeals. The permit application can go through state and federal appeals processes and litigation. EPA guides states in determining BACT for GHG emissions, mainly focusing on coal-fired power plants responsible for 28% of the country's greenhouse gas emissions. There are five categories of control options considered in a BACT analysis, with limited alternatives for coal-fired facilities to reduce emissions significantly. Existing Control Technology for reducing emissions includes proven technologies specific to the source category. Technically Feasible Technology involves proven technologies for other categories but not yet demonstrated for the specific source. Innovative Control Technology is a new technology not yet commercialized for any source category. Innovative Control Technology, such as oxygen combustion, is in the pilot-plant stage and could involve substantial costs and risks if deployed on a coal-fired power plant. Inherently Lower Polluting Production Processes, Fuels, and Coatings offer alternatives like natural gas and biomass that could replace coal but may change the fundamental purpose of the source. The EPA's BACT guidance does not require specific design or operational parameters for coal-fired facilities, leading to uncertainty for future projects. The focus is on energy efficiency and innovative control measures due to limited options for coal-fired power plants. The EPA's work has focused on energy efficiency and innovative control measures. In a case involving GHG emission standards for motor vehicles, the Supreme Court ruled that EPA must address whether GHGs endanger public health. The Bush Administration's EPA did not respond to the petition, issuing only an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in 2008. The Office of Management and Budget, along with several Cabinet Departments and other officials, expressed objections to regulating greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. They stated that the Act is not suitable for reducing emissions. EPA's Technical Support Document for its ANPR took a narrow view. EPA's Technical Support Document for its ANPR focused on alternatives for imposing greenhouse gas performance standards for existing and new electric generating sources, including incremental improvements in efficiency and the development of regulations anticipating future technology. The objective was to mandate \"carbon-ready\" generating technology for new construction. The EPA is considering implementing carbon capture technology, specifically integrated-gasification, combined-cycle (IGCC), for new construction to prepare for future carbon capture needs. The agency believes that setting phased performance standards under section 111 could allow for more stringent limits in the future based on evolving technologies. The EPA is considering implementing carbon capture technology, specifically integrated-gasification, combined-cycle (IGCC), for new construction to prepare for future carbon capture needs. Future-year limits may be based on adequately demonstrated technologies available at a specified future date. Options like a fuel-neutral standard or technology-based standard are not mentioned in the technical support document. A fuel-neutral standard could encourage lower-carbon gas-fired technologies over coal-fired facilities. EPA could set a newly-constructed power plant standard based on these considerations. The EPA could set a new power plant standard based on natural gas performance, encouraging a shift from coal to gas, nuclear, or renewables. A CO2 emission standard could be met by various technologies, while coal-fired facilities would require carbon control technology for a 60% emissions reduction. The EPA's Clean Air Act Advisory Committee established a Climate Change Work Group in response to the Supreme Court's decision on GHGs endangering public health. The Work Group consisted of 35 members from various industries and organizations, tasked with discussing and identifying barriers to implementing the PSD Program under the CAA. The Climate Change Work Group was formed by the EPA to address barriers to implementing the PSD Program under the CAA for greenhouse gases. The group focused on BACT requirements and providing guidance to permitting authorities. Despite disagreements on the scope of work, the group was tasked with submitting interim and final reports to EPA with recommendations on implementing BACT for GHGs. The Work Group had a disagreement on the scope of its work regarding applying BACT to GHGs. They agreed on a two-phase strategy, with the first phase focusing on current BACT practices and the second phase exploring alternative approaches. Four subgroups were formed to address Phase 1 issues, reaching consensus on applying BACT to new and existing units undergoing changes. The EPA is recommended to expand its databases and provide guidance on evaluating energy efficiency in a BACT analysis for GHG control technologies. Criteria for eliminating technologies include considering environmental and energy impacts. The Work Group recommended expanding databases and providing guidance on evaluating energy efficiency in BACT analysis for GHG control technologies. Recommendations included timely communication with stakeholders, EPA guidance on cost methodologies for GHG reductions, streamlining the BACT determination process, guidance on netting GHG emissions, and training for permitting agencies and stakeholders. Carbon Capture and Sequestration feasibility would be determined on a case-by-case basis. The Work Group recommended expanding databases and providing guidance on evaluating energy efficiency in BACT analysis for GHG control technologies. Recommendations included timely communication with stakeholders, EPA guidance on cost methodologies for GHG reductions, streamlining the BACT determination process, guidance on netting GHG emissions, and training for permitting agencies and stakeholders. Feasibility of Carbon Capture and Sequestration would be determined on a case-by-case basis, with no agreement on cost thresholds or approach to determining carbon neutrality of biomass. EPA requested Phase 2 focus on developing energy efficient measures and the Clean Air Act's Innovative Control Technology waiver. The expanded Work Group recommended incorporating energy-efficient processes and technologies into the BACT analysis for GHG control technologies. They outlined a five-step framework, including identifying energy efficient options and eliminating technically infeasible measures. The group did not explore specific control methods or cost thresholds. The five-step framework for incorporating energy-efficient measures into GHG BACT analysis includes eliminating technically infeasible options, ranking feasible measures based on CO2 reduction potential, evaluating effectiveness, and incorporating measures into emissions limits with consideration for environmental impacts. Permitting authorities must assess tradeoffs and provide clear justifications for elimination of top candidates. The Work Group discussed methods for monitoring and compliance determination, including performance standards, operating limits, work practice standards, and design requirements. There was no consensus on the level at which BACT analysis should occur. The focus was on encouraging efficient and lower emitting processes through the Innovative Control Technology waiver provided under the Clean Air Act. EPA may grant an ICT waiver to promote the development of innovative emission reduction technologies. The waiver allows for the use of innovative technologies that achieve greater emission reductions with lower impacts. It applies to specific sources and extends compliance deadlines. If the technology fails, the waiver can be extended for up to three years. EPA grants waivers to test new technologies for energy, economic, and environmental criteria. The addition of BACT to the waiver provisions shows the connection between NSPS and BACT regulations. EPA's draft NSR guidance has defined the necessity for waivers narrowly. The Workgroup recommended changes to encourage the use of Innovative Control Technology (ICT) waivers in permits. They suggested allowing multiple waivers for a technology to promote its commercialization and urged EPA to clarify the availability of waivers based on a technology's deployment status and breadth of use. The EPA released guidance on implementing PSD and Title V permitting for greenhouse gas emissions, emphasizing the availability of waivers based on technology deployment status and promoting flexibility in permitting with innovative technologies. The EPA released guidance on implementing PSD and Title V permitting for greenhouse gas emissions, emphasizing waivers based on technology deployment status and flexibility with innovative technologies. The curr_chunk focuses on the five-step permitting process favored by EPA, including GHG Control Measures White Papers summarizing control techniques for various industries, a GHG Mitigation Strategies Database providing data on performance and cost, and enhancements to the Control Technology Clearinghouse for assimilating information on GHG control measures required by permits. The EPA released guidance on implementing PSD and Title V permitting for greenhouse gas emissions, emphasizing waivers based on technology deployment status and flexibility with innovative technologies. The guidance focuses on the five-step permitting process favored by EPA, including GHG Control Measures White Papers summarizing control techniques for various industries, a GHG Mitigation Strategies Database providing data on performance and cost, and enhancements to the Control Technology Clearinghouse for assimilating information on GHG control measures required by permits used by state and local authorities. EPA is taking public comment on the package, with a focus on calculations and technical errors. The guidance emphasizes state discretion in determining BACT and energy efficiency as the most likely result of a GHG BACT analysis. EPA's Step 1 guidance focuses on inclusion of all potentially applicable control alternatives. The guidance on implementing PSD and Title V permitting for greenhouse gas emissions emphasizes flexibility with innovative technologies and the inclusion of all potentially applicable control alternatives. It discusses redefining control measures, energy efficiency, and carbon capture technology under BACT. The Step 1 list of alternatives is limited by whether an option would fundamentally redefine the proposed source. Power Electric Cooperative's Bonanza Power Plant and American Electric Power's John W. Turk Jr. Power Plant were not initially considered for integrated gasification combined-cycle technology (IGCC) as a control option in the BACT analysis. The EPA's Environmental Appeals Board (EAB) rejected a 2005 EPA opinion and remanded the cases for further review, stating that the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality did not follow EPA's interpretation. ADEQ did not follow EPA's interpretation on the issue of defining project elements for emissions reductions, as outlined by the EAB. EPA recommends using the EAB decision's analytical framework to assess if changes would fundamentally redefine a proposed source. EPA no longer supports the reasoning used in a 2005 Agency decision. EPA no longer supports the reasoning used in a 2005 decision to exclude IGCC from consideration in all cases on redefining the source grounds. The discretionary authority of permitting authorities is highlighted in the guidance document, which discusses clean fuel options and the potential redefinition of coal-fired generating units when considering natural gas as a primary fuel. EPA guidance emphasizes the importance of energy efficiency measures in GHG BACT analysis, categorizing them into maximizing overall efficiency and improving thermal energy and on-site electricity use. CCS is classified as an add-on pollution control technology for CO2 emitting facilities. EPA guidance highlights the significance of energy efficiency measures in GHG BACT analysis, including maximizing overall efficiency and improving thermal energy and on-site electricity use. CCS is considered an add-on pollution control technology for CO2 emitting facilities, likely to be assessed in later steps based on various case-specific factors. EPA's specific GHG guidance for Step 2 focuses primarily on CCS, emphasizing that technical feasibility evaluations should consider all aspects of the technology option. The permitting authority is responsible for determining technical feasibility. The permitting authority is responsible for deciding technical feasibility of control measures, including new technologies. EPA sees CCS as a challenging option due to transport and storage issues with CO2. Step 3 of EPA's GHG guidance focuses on energy efficiency measures. Step 3 focuses on refining overall control effectiveness for energy efficiency measures. EPA suggests ranking options based on net output-based emissions to determine the top measure. Permitting authorities have discretion in conducting the analysis to choose the most suitable control technology. EPA interprets BACT requirements to consider more stringent technologies if their environmental benefits outweigh costs. When evaluating GHG control technologies, focus on emission levels rather than endpoint impacts due to the global nature of climate change. Permitting authorities should prioritize GHG emissions reductions when assessing control measures. EPA emphasizes the importance of considering GHG emissions reductions in control measures, noting that small collateral increases in other pollutants may not be concerning unless they could push an area into nonattainment. Cost effectiveness of GHG control measures is expected to be lower due to the large volumes of GHGs emitted by projects. EPA also mentions the current costs of CCS in the context of BACT analysis. EPA notes that CCS may be eliminated from consideration in BACT analysis due to current costs, but future research could make it more viable. Permitting authorities should consider energy impacts and focus on energy efficiency in new GHG permits. EPA encourages establishing output-based BACT emission limits. EPA encourages establishing output-based BACT emission limits, or a combination of output- and input-based limits, to ensure compliance at all levels of operation. Permits may also include work practice requirements for energy efficiency. The guidance does not specify technology or cost thresholds for coal-fired electric generating units. IGCC and CCS should be considered in Step 1 of the evaluation process, with states having discretion in Steps 2 and 4. Natural gas substitution for coal is generally considered by EPA. The EPA encourages establishing output-based BACT emission limits for coal-fired facilities, with a focus on energy efficiency and carbon capture technologies. States have discretion in determining if natural gas substitution redefines the source. The White Paper accompanying the guidance document provides an example of a BACT analysis for a coal-fired unit. The EPA compared five generating technologies, noting that the ultra-supercritical PC-fired unit had the lowest heat rate and GHG emissions rate. However, concerns were raised about the materials needed for high sulfur or chlorine applications. Michigan approved the permit based on the original supercritical design. In December 2009, Michigan approved a permit for the supercritical design. EPA's new guidance allows for waivers for innovative technologies and multiple waivers for similar technologies at different locations. In February 2010, California's BAAQMD issued the nation's first PSD permit including GHGs in BACT analysis for the Russell City Energy Center project in Hayward, CA. Calpine Corporation will install emission control technologies for the project. The permit for a power plant includes limits on greenhouse gas emissions and requires the installation of emission control technologies. Environmental groups' petitions challenging the permit were rejected. The permit specifies limits for various components of the facility and uses a five-step BACT approach to determine control technology. The five-step BACT approach was used to identify control technology for a power plant permit. Thermal efficiency and carbon capture and storage were considered, but CCS was eliminated due to availability concerns. The focus is on achieving GHG reductions through efficiency, with no specific recommendations provided for coal-fired facilities. EPA's guidance emphasizes that no definitive conclusions were drawn. The recent \"Questions and Answers\" release on BACT guidance clarifies that it does not make specific recommendations for control technologies or cost thresholds. The guidance emphasizes state discretion in determining BACT on a case-by-case basis for GHG emissions. The EPA GHG guidance expands the BACT process to include greenhouse gases, leaving industry to determine if it provides enough regulatory certainty for investment in new plants. The response's adequacy will be judged by applicants, state authorities, and future EPA actions under related parts of the act."
