The United States-Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development (BARD) Fund, established in 1977, promotes agricultural research benefiting both countries. BARD Fund projects have significantly contributed to the economies of the United States and Israel. The BARD Fund, a major platform for US-Israel agricultural research collaboration, has funded over 1,300 projects, awarded $300 million for research, and supported postdoctoral fellows and scientific workshops. Projects have led to developments in drip irrigation, pesticides, fish farming, livestock, poultry, disease control, and farm equipment. The Fund has successfully promoted research collaboration between the two countries for 40 years without fraud, waste, or abuse. The Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund, signed in 2013, promotes collaboration between U.S. and Israeli scientists and engineers. The 2013 Memorandum of Understanding aimed to provide funding for Israeli and U.S. researchers. Congress enacted legislation in 2014 declaring Israel as a major strategic partner of the United States. Israel, a major strategic partner of the United States, has authorized the President to enhance cooperation in various fields, including agriculture. Joint efforts aim to address challenges such as food safety, security, quality, post-harvest issues, and optimize production amidst limited resources, environmental changes, water scarcity, and management. The United States-Israel Expanded-Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund is authorized under Section 3. The Secretary of Agriculture, in coordination with the Secretary of State and the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, is authorized to establish a program for cooperative research and development in agriculture with the Government of Israel. The purpose is to enhance collaboration between the United States and Israel in research and development activities related to agriculture, including public and private entities. Activities supported may include various research and development initiatives. The program authorized under subsection (a) includes activities under the Agreement to establish the United States-Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development (BARD) Fund and activities under section 1458 of the Food and Agriculture Act of 1977. Projects and activities under this program may be carried out by nongovernmental and private entities, including collaboration with private universities, research institutions, and corporations. Authorization of appropriations is provided to the Secretary of Agriculture as necessary. The Secretary of Agriculture may receive necessary funds to carry out the United States-Israel Expanded-Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund. The funds are authorized to remain available until expended and can be transferred to other relevant Federal departments and agencies for program implementation. The Secretary of State, in coordination with the Secretary of Agriculture, is authorized to establish a binational task force to provide guidance and oversight for the program authorized under subsection (a), including identifying funding priorities, proposing research competitions, and addressing innovative developments in agriculture. The task force established should include the Secretary of Agriculture, the Israeli Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development, members of the BARD Fund board of directors, administrators of various agriculture research services, the chief scientist of the Israeli Ministry of Agriculture, and the director of the Agricultural Research Organization--Volcani Center."
