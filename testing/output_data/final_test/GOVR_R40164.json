    "content": "During the past two decades, Members of Congress have shown interest in U.S. participation in the UNESCO World Heritage Convention. The Convention aims to protect natural and cultural sites of importance through lists. Currently, there are 936 sites in 153 countries on the World Heritage List, with 35 sites from 28 countries on the Danger List. The United States is a party to the Convention. As of July 12, 2011, 187 countries are parties to the UNESCO World Heritage Convention. The United States was the first country to ratify it in 1973 and currently has 21 sites on the World Heritage List, including Yellowstone National Park and the Statue of Liberty. Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea in Hawaii was the most recent U.S. addition in July 2010. Everglades National Park is the only U.S. site on the Danger List. Congressional perspectives on the Convention vary, with some supporting it and others concerned about national sovereignty. The report discusses the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, U.S. participation, agencies' roles, financial contributions, and criteria for adding/removing sites. It also addresses Congress's potential role in nominating sites and the impact on U.S. sovereignty. The World Heritage Convention, adopted by UNESCO in 1972, aims to identify and protect cultural and natural sites of exceptional global importance. It includes a World Heritage List and a List of World Heritage in Danger for sites facing significant risks. Countries party to the Convention agree to protect listed sites. The World Heritage Convention, adopted by UNESCO in 1972, aims to identify and protect cultural and natural sites of exceptional global importance. Countries party to the Convention agree to protect listed sites within their borders and refrain from actions that might harm such sites in other countries. The responsibility for protecting and conserving World Heritage sites primarily belongs to the country where the site is located. The World Heritage Committee, comprised of 21 members elected by the parties, oversees the implementation of the Convention and selects sites to be included on the World Heritage List. The World Heritage Committee monitors sites, makes recommendations for site management, and can remove a property from the World Heritage List if a country fails to protect it. Committee decisions are usually made by consensus and advised by three advisory bodies. The World Heritage Committee, administered by ICCROM, focuses on monitoring existing sites and providing technical and financial assistance through the World Heritage Fund. Current Committee members include various countries such as Australia, Brazil, China, and Egypt. The World Heritage Fund provides emergency assistance to member countries who request it through an agreement with the Committee. The Fund's income mainly comes from member country contributions and voluntary donations. Funding is around $4 million annually, but requests often exceed available funds. The United States supports the World Heritage Convention and has been actively involved since its creation in 1973. The U.S. has 21 sites on the World Heritage List, with Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea in Hawaii being the most recent addition in July 2010. Everglades National Park is the only U.S. site on the Danger List. The Obama Administration supports preserving World Heritage Sites and plans to nominate new U.S. sites for submission to the World Heritage Committee in late 2012 or early 2013. Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar announced steps to include Everglades National Park on the Danger List in 2009. In 2010, Everglades National Park was inscribed on the Danger List by the World Heritage Committee. The Bush Administration supported U.S. participation in the World Heritage Convention and submitted a \"Tentative List\" of potential U.S. nominations in 2008. The Administration expressed concern about the limited resources of the World Heritage Fund and suggested focusing on protecting existing sites rather than adding new ones. It also highlighted the increasing workload of the World Heritage Centre and Committee staff without sufficient financial resources. The National Historic Preservation Act Amendment of 1980 charges the Department of the Interior with coordinating U.S. activities under the World Heritage Convention. The National Park Service administers the U.S. World Heritage program, processing nominations and managing daily operations. Property owners must go through an extensive application process to nominate a site, with the Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks responsible for considering and nominating properties on behalf of the United States. Non-federal properties can be nominated if the owner agrees in writing. The Assistant Secretary notifies committees before nominating sites for the World Heritage Convention. US contributions include assessed and voluntary contributions to UNESCO and the World Heritage Fund. The US pays approximately $80,915,000 for UNESCO and $700,000 for the Fund in FY2010 through voluntary contributions. The United States contributes to the World Heritage Fund through voluntary contributions to UNESCO. US contributions have ranged from $428,604 to $700,000 in the past decade. Despite a period of withdrawal from UNESCO, the US continued to support the Convention through annual voluntary contributions. The National Park Service provides technical assistance to countries that have ratified the World Heritage Convention. They also maintain relationships with counterpart agencies in other countries for training and assistance at non-U.S. World Heritage sites. The U.S. World Heritage Fellows program offers training opportunities to candidates from developing countries to learn from U.S. experiences in managing and protecting World Heritage sites. The U.S. provides support to UNESCO World Heritage sites outside of the country through USAID and the Ambassador's Fund for Cultural Preservation. Everglades National Park is the only U.S. site on the List of World Heritage in Danger due to various issues. The Everglades National Park was removed from the Danger List in 2007 but was added back in 2010 due to concerns about the deteriorating aquatic ecosystem. Yellowstone National Park was also on the Danger List in 1995 due to threats like a nearby gold mine. The Committee removed Yellowstone from the Danger List in July 2003, recognizing U.S. progress in addressing issues. In 1995, concerns were raised about UNESCO designation of World Heritage sites on U.S. land infringing on national sovereignty. Members of Congress introduced bills to address concerns about U.S. sites being nominated to the World Heritage List. Members of the House and Senate introduced the American Land Sovereignty Protection Act to give Congress more control over U.S. sites nominated for the World Heritage List. The House passed variations of the bill in multiple Congresses. In 2000, Congress included Section 580 in an appropriations act to restrict funds for the UNESCO World Heritage Fund. No related bills were introduced in subsequent Congresses. Members of Congress have shown support for the World Heritage Convention by seeking to include sites in their states on the World Heritage List. Senator John Kerry introduced a resolution in the 112th Congress commending UNESCO for preserving natural and cultural sites worldwide. Some opponents argue that U.S. participation in the Convention could allow UNESCO to influence the management of U.S. parks and monuments. U.S. participation in the World Heritage Convention does not give UNESCO or the United Nations authority over U.S. World Heritage sites. The Convention only involves listing or de-listing sites and providing technical advice. Parties voluntarily nominate sites and agree to protect them using their own laws. Supporters of the World Heritage Convention argue that U.S. sites are already protected under domestic laws, emphasizing the sovereignty of states where sites are located. Some Members of Congress have raised concerns about the limited role of Congress in nominating U.S. World Heritage Sites under current legislation. The executive branch must notify Congress of nominated World Heritage sites. Concerns exist about potential influence on domestic land use policies. Supporters highlight benefits of being on the World Heritage List, such as increased international awareness. The Committee supported the United States in protecting Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve by publicizing concerns about a Canadian pit mine near the Bay. Mexico dropped plans for a salt plant near a gray whale breeding ground in a World Heritage site. Supporters believe World Heritage listings can boost tourism and attract funding for conservation efforts. The National Park Service emphasizes the importance of assistance from international organizations for World Heritage sites. Opponents of the World Heritage Convention raise concerns about the impact of designation on private property near sites, particularly regarding buffer zones. They argue that this may affect the use of privately owned land and could be used by environmental groups or the government to influence public decisions. The World Heritage Convention can be used by the federal government to influence land management, as seen in the case of Yellowstone National Park. The procedures for adding and removing sites from the World Heritage List and the Danger List are outlined in the \"Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention.\" The World Heritage Convention requires nomination documents for sites to be added to the list, evaluated by advisory bodies based on criteria for outstanding universal value. Recommendations are made for inscription, non-inscription, or referral/deferral. The World Heritage Committee evaluates nomination documents for sites based on criteria for outstanding universal value. Recommendations are made for inscription, non-inscription, or referral/deferral, taking into consideration site integrity, protection, and management. The Committee may refer a site back for more information or defer nomination for further study. Properties may be deleted from the World Heritage List if they have deteriorated significantly. Properties may be removed from the World Heritage List if they have deteriorated significantly or if the party responsible fails to protect the site within the agreed time frame. The Secretariat verifies information from concerned parties and advisory bodies before the Committee votes to delete a site by a two-thirds majority. Since the Convention was established, only two sites have been removed from the World Heritage List. In 2007, the Arabian Oryx Sanctuary in Oman was delisted due to a 90% reduction in size, and in June 2009, the Dresden Elbe Valley in Germany was removed because of a four-lane bridge construction. Sites on the list that are seriously endangered may be placed on the Danger List, requiring a two-thirds majority vote by Committee members. The World Heritage Committee is responsible for adding and removing sites to the Danger List based on serious and specific dangers threatening the property. Examples include accelerated deterioration, large-scale projects, armed conflicts, and natural disasters. The World Heritage Committee assesses sites for inclusion on the Danger List based on permanent and potential dangers such as armed conflicts, natural disasters, and deterioration of materials or historical authenticity. Cultural and natural sites have different criteria for placement on the list. The World Heritage Committee evaluates natural sites for potential inclusion on the Danger List based on criteria such as population decline of key species, human encroachment, and development projects that threaten the site's integrity. Consultation with concerned parties is essential to develop corrective measures, including site analysis and feasibility assessments. Observers and advisors may be sent to evaluate threats and propose recommendations. The World Heritage Committee evaluates sites for potential inclusion on the Danger List based on threats and proposes corrective actions. Consent from relevant parties may be required, and sites are removed from the list when conditions improve or if they have deteriorated significantly. The World Heritage Committee evaluates sites for potential inclusion on the Danger List based on threats and proposes corrective actions. Sites may be removed from the list if they have seriously deteriorated or if necessary corrective measures have not been taken within the proposed time frame. The Committee may also consider recommendations from other parties or organizations for removal from the list. The World Heritage Committee evaluates sites for potential inclusion on the Danger List based on threats and proposes corrective actions. The Committee forwards relevant information to advisory bodies for recommendations on removal from the list based on criteria for Outstanding Universal Value. The World Heritage Committee evaluates sites for potential inclusion on the Danger List based on threats and proposes corrective actions. Sites must meet criteria for Outstanding Universal Value, such as being outstanding examples of human history, traditional settlements, or natural beauty. The World Heritage Committee evaluates sites for potential inclusion on the Danger List based on threats and proposes corrective actions. Sites must meet criteria for Outstanding Universal Value, such as representing major stages of earth's history, significant ecological processes, and important natural habitats for conservation. The World Heritage Committee evaluates sites for potential inclusion on the Danger List based on threats and proposes corrective actions. Criteria for Cultural Sites include serious deterioration of materials, structure, architecture, urban or rural space, historical authenticity, and cultural significance. Potential dangers include modification of property status, lack of conservation policy, regional planning projects, town planning, armed conflict, and environmental factors. Criteria for Natural Sites include a serious decline in the population of endangered species or species of outstanding universal value. The potential dangers for a site to be included on the Danger List by the World Heritage Committee include severe deterioration of natural beauty or scientific value due to human activities, human encroachment on boundaries, and potential threats like armed conflict or lack of adequate management plans. The potential dangers for a site to be included on the Danger List by the World Heritage Committee include armed conflict or inadequate management plans."
