    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature recognizes that requests for reasonable accommodation based on religion or disability are protected activities under state and federal law, providing protection against retaliation. Federal laws such as the Americans with Disabilities Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act set a minimum standard of protection, which California's law exceeds. The California law provides protections for requests for reasonable accommodation based on religion or disability, consistent with the Fair Employment and Housing Act. The California law protects requests for reasonable accommodation based on religion or disability, ensuring protection against retaliation even if the request is not granted. The amendment to Section 12940 of the Government Code reinforces this protection. The California law prohibits discrimination based on various factors such as race, religion, disability, gender, age, and military status in hiring, training programs, and terms of employment. The California law allows employers to refuse to hire or discharge an employee with a physical or mental disability if the employee is unable to perform essential duties even with reasonable accommodations or if it endangers health or safety. The California law permits employers to dismiss employees unable to perform essential duties due to a medical condition, even with accommodations, without legal liability. The California law allows employers to regulate spouses working in the same department for reasons of supervision, safety, security, or morale. Health plans cannot provide more benefits to employees with dependents than those without. Employers can use veteran status in employee selection or give special consideration to Vietnam-era veterans. The law allows employers to refuse employment based on age if compelled by law. Promotions, hiring based on experience, rehiring based on seniority, and recruiting from schools are not considered unlawful practices. The law permits employers to adjust or eliminate health benefits for retirees once they become eligible for Medicare, effective January 1, 2011. Labor organizations are prohibited from discriminating against individuals based on race, religion, color, national origin, disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, gender, age, sexual orientation, or military status in membership, officer elections, staff selection, or any other aspect. It is prohibited to discriminate in any training program or internship based on race, religion, color, disability, genetic information, gender, age, sexual orientation, or military status. It is prohibited for employers or employment agencies to discriminate based on various factors such as race, religion, color, disability, genetic information, gender, age, sexual orientation, or military status. This includes not making any non-job-related inquiries that express any form of discrimination. Employers and employment agencies are prohibited from requiring medical or psychological examinations or inquiries about disabilities or medical conditions from applicants. However, they can inquire about the applicant's ability to perform job-related functions and provide reasonable accommodations. Employers can require medical or psychological examinations of job applicants after an offer is made, as long as it is job-related and all employees in the same job classification are subject to the same examination. For employees, employers cannot require medical or psychological examinations or make inquiries about disabilities or medical conditions, except under certain circumstances. Employers can require job-related medical examinations for job applicants, but cannot discriminate against individuals who report suspected patient abuse. It is prohibited to discriminate against individuals for opposing forbidden practices or filing complaints under this part. It is also illegal to aid, abet, incite, or coerce the acts forbidden under this part. It is unlawful to harass individuals based on various protected characteristics in the workplace. Employers must take immediate and appropriate action to address harassment by employees, agents, or supervisors. Employers may also be held responsible for the actions of nonemployees in cases of sexual harassment. An employer may be responsible for acts of nonemployees in cases of sexual harassment in the workplace if they fail to take immediate and appropriate corrective action. The employer's control and legal responsibility regarding the conduct of nonemployees will be considered. Employers must take all reasonable steps to prevent harassment, and tangible job benefits are not required to establish harassment. The provisions of this subdivision clarify existing law and impose new duties on employers regarding harassment. An employee can be personally liable for harassment regardless of employer knowledge. The definition of \"employer\" includes those who regularly employ or receive services from one or more persons. For purposes of this subdivision, \"employer\" does not include a religious association or corporation not organized for private profit, except as provided in Section 12926.2. Harassment because of sex includes sexual harassment, gender harassment, and harassment based on pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. Sexually harassing conduct need not be motivated by sexual desire. \"A person providing services pursuant to a contract\" is someone who has the right to control the performance of the contract and is engaged in an independently established business. The person engaged in an independently established business has control over work time, place, and tools, requiring specific skills. Employers must prevent discrimination and harassment. Employers must not discriminate based on religious beliefs in hiring, training, or employment conditions unless accommodating the belief causes undue hardship. Employers must reasonably accommodate religious beliefs or observances without undue hardship, including time off for religious holy days, travel, religious dress, and grooming practices. This applies to various programs like apprenticeships and unpaid internships. An accommodation of religious dress or grooming practices must not require segregation. Accommodations are not required if they violate anti-discrimination laws. Retaliation for requesting accommodation is prohibited. Employers must provide reasonable accommodation for known disabilities without causing undue hardship. Retaliation or discrimination for requesting accommodation is prohibited. Employers must engage in a timely, good faith interactive process to determine reasonable accommodations for employees with disabilities.
