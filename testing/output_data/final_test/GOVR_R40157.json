    "content": "The economy entered recession in December 2007, losing 6.9 million jobs. The Congressional Budget Office forecasted a return to growth in late 2009, but with unemployment rising above 10% by mid-2010. Economic insecurity caused by the recession is a concern, especially for disadvantaged individuals and families. The report discusses the potential role of the TANF block grant in helping poor families with children during the recession. The child poverty rate increased during the recession, with high rates among families with certain characteristics like female-headed households, young parents, and racial minority children. Public policy aims to support low-income families with children. Current public policy towards low-income families with able-bodied adults emphasizes work, with initiatives in the mid-1990s expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit and Medicaid coverage for poor children. The TANF cash welfare system reflects a historical legacy of controversy dating back to the Great Depression. The 1996 welfare reform law (P.L. 104-193) significantly changed policy for low-income families by ending the AFDC program and introducing the TANF block grant. Welfare became associated with personal characteristics and behavior of recipients, raising issues of personal responsibility and morality. Welfare also raised racial issues as more nonwhite individuals became part of the caseload. The 1996 welfare reform replaced AFDC with the TANF block grant, imposing work requirements and time limits for cash assistance. Federal funding increased for child care, promoting work among low-income families. This led to a significant decrease in the welfare caseload and an increase in work among single mothers. Child poverty declined from 1994 to 2000, but the welfare rolls declined faster, resulting in fewer poor children receiving cash assistance. However, after 2000, economic growth slowed, leading to an increase in child poverty. In 2000, economic growth slowed, leading to an increase in child poverty. By 2008, the welfare recipiency rate among poor children was at 22%, down from about 60% before welfare reform. The current recession has led to higher unemployment rates, especially among groups at risk of economic disadvantage. Groups at risk for economic disadvantage, including women maintaining families, those with no high school diploma, African-Americans, Hispanics, and young adults, have high unemployment rates. Many of these unemployed individuals are in families with children. Child poverty rates tend to increase during recessions and peak after the low-point of the economic cycle. The child poverty rate peaked in 1983 after the 1980 and 1981-82 recessions, and in 1993 after the 1990-91 recession. Figure 1 compares the historical trend in child poverty rates with the unemployment rate. The child poverty rate is influenced by factors beyond the national economy, such as the increase in children living in female-headed families. It rose after the 2001 recession, reaching 19.0% in 2008 along with the higher unemployment rate. Concerns exist about the adequacy of the safety net for economically disadvantaged families. Unemployment insurance (UI) is the main government program to assist the involuntarily unemployed, but it does not cover all unemployed individuals. Unemployment insurance (UI) is not designed to cover all unemployed individuals, including new entrants, those re-entering the workforce, and those who have exhausted their benefits. Research shows that low-wage workers, part-time workers, and women have lower rates of UI receipt. Welfare reforms in the 1990s encouraged more single mothers to enter the workforce, but many struggle to stay employed. Only 13% of welfare leavers who became unemployed drew UI, with less than 25% applying for benefits. Voluntarily quitting a job often disqualifies a person from receiving UI, and many states also bar unemployed persons available only for part-term work from receiving benefits. During a recession, those who leave jobs for family reasons face a more difficult labor market. Before the recession, poor children were more likely to receive benefits from programs like SNAP and Medicaid than cash welfare. In FY2007, the number of children in families receiving SNAP and Medicaid far exceeded those receiving cash welfare. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides states with incentives and funds to rethink the safety net for disadvantaged families with children, affecting both social insurance and need-based assistance. It offers provisions to enhance UI for low-income families and provide additional TANF funding. States have new options to address the economic needs of disadvantaged families through these provisions. The ARRA includes provisions to enhance UI for low-wage workers, such as a $25 per week increase in benefits and grants for those with shorter work histories or compelling family reasons. States can also receive grants for providing dependents' allowances. The focus of the report will shift to TANF provisions, but expanding UI for low-wage workers can address their economic needs. The 1996 welfare reform law created the TANF block grant to help needy families with fixed funding and broad authority to use federal TANF funds. The basic block grant amount has remained at $16.5 billion since TANF's inception, with states required to maintain at least $10.4 billion in spending from their own funds. The TANF block grant provides fixed funding of $16.5 billion to states, with a requirement for states to maintain $10.4 billion in spending from their own funds. This funding structure poses financial risks for states during recessions, as they may need to cut other services or increase spending from their own funds to cover welfare costs. TANF funds are used for various human services to address economic disadvantage among families with children. Initiatives to address economic disadvantage among families with children are at risk in states reallocating TANF funds during a recession. In FY2007, basic cash assistance accounted for 30% of TANF and MOE funds, with child care being a significant category at 19%. Other work supports also play a role in TANF and MOE spending. TANF spending includes basic cash assistance, child care, and other work supports. However, the reported categories do not fully capture all benefits and services provided under TANF, such as contributions to programs addressing child abuse and neglect. The breadth of funded services in categories like \"family formation\" and \"other\" is also not fully reflected in expenditure reports. TANF provides various services for disadvantaged families and children, including home visiting programs, youth services, pre-Kindergarten education, after-school programs, responsible fatherhood programs, and marriage education. States can save unspent TANF funds, with reserves totaling $1.7 billion as of September 30, 2007. These reserves can be used to cover costs if the fixed block grant is insufficient. The ARRA lifted restrictions on TANF reserves, allowing them to finance any TANF benefit, service, or activity. A $2 billion contingency fund was provided in 1996, with $1.3 billion remaining in FY2009. The fund was estimated to be exhausted by FY2010. States qualify for the regular TANF contingency fund based on economic need, determined by SNAP participation or unemployment rates. The amount of grants a state receives is based on TANF expenditures, with a requirement to spend at least 100% of pre-TANF program funds from FY1994 before qualifying for matching funds. The regular TANF contingency fund is based on economic need determined by SNAP participation or unemployment rates. States must spend at least 100% of pre-TANF program funds before qualifying for matching funds. Expenditures above 100% are matched at the Medicaid rate, with the exception of child care. The ARRA added an emergency contingency fund for FY2009 and FY2010, providing reimbursement for increased expenditures in basic assistance, short-term benefits, and subsidized employment. The cap limits a state's receipt of federal funds to 50% of its annual basic block grant over FY2009 and FY2010. Reimbursement is tied to increases in basic assistance caseloads, measured quarterly. Table 2 displays state family assistance grants and federal fund limits for TANF contingency funds. Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands are ineligible for regular funds. The table shows that Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands are ineligible for regular TANF contingency funds but can receive emergency funds. Tribes with tribal TANF programs are also eligible for emergency funds. The total state caps exceed available funding, with 15 states claiming $563 million in emergency contingency funds by September 11, 2009. Out of this amount, $180 million had been disbursed to states. The 1996 welfare reform law aimed to address chronic welfare dependency, supported by research showing that many families only received cash welfare for a short period. Since the enactment of welfare reform in the mid-1990s, there has been a sharp decline in the number of families receiving cash welfare. Research has shown that cash welfare can discourage work and influence decisions on marriage and family formation. The goal of the TANF block grant is to reduce dependence on government benefits for needy parents. About 1/3 of those on welfare could be expected to be on it for five years or more. Since the mid-1990s, welfare rolls have significantly decreased, with a correlation to the unemployment rate until 2000. Despite fluctuations in unemployment, welfare dependency has remained lower than pre-1996 levels. Critics argue that additional funding may incentivize states to increase welfare rolls. Research suggests that macroeconomic conditions play a role in welfare caseloads, as shown in historical data from July 1959 to December 2008. The history of cash welfare caseloads shows that economic conditions, demographic changes, and policy all impact caseloads. The emergency TANF fund can be used for various economic supports during a recession, with the first priority being increased cash welfare caseloads. While cash welfare caseloads did not initially rise during the recession, there was a slight increase nationally from July to December 2008, with 31 states seeing increases in their caseloads. TANF cash benefits only represent a fraction of poverty income and can help families avoid total destitution but may not allow them to maintain their standard of living. TANF cash benefits can help families avoid destitution but may not maintain their standard of living. States set benefit amounts, which have not kept up with inflation, leading to a decline in purchasing power. In 2008, Alaska had the highest maximum benefit of $923 per month for a family of three, while California paid $723 per month, close to half of the poverty threshold. In 2008, TANF cash benefits varied by state, with New Jersey paying $424 per month for a family of three and Mississippi paying the lowest at $170 per month. States have flexibility in implementing TANF work participation requirements, but federal rules influence program design and individual requirements. The TANF standards are performance targets that states must meet or face financial penalties. These standards require a certain percentage of families to be engaged in activities, with reductions in the assistance caseload also counting towards meeting the standards. The ARRA temporarily modified the caseload reduction credit, allowing states to freeze their credit at certain levels during the recession. The ARRA caseload reduction credit provision allows states to freeze their credit at certain levels during the recession. The Secretary of HHS can reduce the financial penalty for a state failing to meet work participation standards if economically eligible for the TANF contingency fund. Most jurisdictions were eligible for relief from the penalty in June 2009. Activities for work participation standards focus on job search and education/training. In a fiscal year, education and training are countable for one year in a lifetime for adult recipients. Other activities that count include employment, subsidized employment, on-the-job training, community service, work experience, and providing child care. States must sanction non-compliant recipients, with work standards aiming to move recipients quickly from welfare to work. TANF funds cannot assist a family with an adult recipient for more than five years, but 20% of the caseload can exceed this limit. This recession is testing these rules during a period of high unemployment. States have flexibility in implementing time limits on welfare receipt, with most imposing a limit. Families on TANF cash welfare must assign child support payments to the state, which can pass it through to the family. Welfare caseload trends do not always follow the unemployment rate. The 1981-82 recession saw fairly constant caseloads, raising concerns about potential long-term welfare dependency. However, current policies offer greater incentives for leaving welfare for work, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit. State debates may arise on using ARRA funds and adapting cash welfare rules to meet the needs of families affected by the recession. The ARRA fund created temporary emergency aid to reimburse states for increased costs of non-recurrent short-term benefits and subsidized employment during the recession. States previously spent little on these forms of aid but may expand them in response to a long and deep recession. Non-recurrent short-term aid is designed for specific crisis situations and lasts up to four months, distinct from ongoing cash welfare. Non-recurrent short-term aid is distinct from ongoing cash welfare and does not trigger TANF requirements. It includes various forms of assistance like rental aid, moving allowance, and loans for stable housing or other needs. The distinction between short-term aid and cash welfare was created through HHS regulation, not statute. The Bush Administration in 2008 issued a program instruction to states to clarify the line between short-term aid and ongoing cash welfare. States were warned against classifying certain aid as \"short-term\" benefits to avoid work participation standards. The ARRA temporary emergency fund reimburses states for 80% of increased costs of subsidized employment for needy parents. This fund can support employment for unemployed individuals. States can use ARRA funds for increased \"basic assistance\" in ways other than traditional cash welfare, such as creating community service programs or vocational education training programs for unemployed parents. This allows families to receive a stipend for ongoing basic needs or attending training programs, without being subject to TANF time limits or work participation standards. States have flexibility in implementing time limits for welfare programs. Aid tied to community service or vocational education can help meet work participation standards. States can pass through all child support to families participating in these programs. The TANF contingency fund provides extra grants to states in economic need. The 1996 welfare law established a $2 billion contingency fund, with $1.3 billion remaining at the start of FY2009. Concerns arise over whether this amount is enough to cover costs during the recession. The Congressional Budget Office predicted the fund would run out by FY2010 before the ARRA was enacted. States failing TANF work standards face penalties, but these can be reduced based on their distance from the standard. The HHS Secretary has the authority to lessen penalties for states failing work standards if they meet economic criteria. The 1996 welfare law established a $2 billion contingency fund, with concerns over its adequacy during the recession. HHS released work participation data for FY2007, showing states at risk of financial penalties for failing TANF work standards. Congress could eliminate or defer these penalties to avoid funding cuts."
