The Secretary of Defense is required to modify the guidance and terms of reference for the Department of Defense working group reviewing the possible repeal of the policy on homosexuality in the Armed Forces. The modifications should ensure a comprehensive and objective evaluation in the final report. The evaluation of whether the application of section 654 is undermining military readiness, if repealing or amending section 654 will improve military readiness, and the implications on military readiness, cohesion, morale, and discipline as a result of repeal or amendment. The evaluation will cover regular and reserve components, military families, retirees, and their families for Federal benefits. The working group will examine the impact of section 654 on military recruitment, retention, and readiness, especially during wartime, and report to the Secretary of Defense. The working group will assess the impact of section 654 on military readiness and effectiveness since September 11, 2001. It will evaluate the significance of discharges under section 654 on attrition rates in the Armed Forces and determine if repealing the section is necessary for sustaining future military readiness. Additionally, the group will analyze how repealing section 654 could enhance military readiness, cohesion, morale, good order, and discipline. The impact of repealing section 654 on military readiness, cohesion, morale, good order, discipline, military family readiness, recruitment rates, and influencers' recommendations for military service will be assessed. Measures to mitigate any negative impacts of repeal will also be considered. The impact of repealing section 654 on military readiness, cohesion, morale, good order, discipline, military family readiness, recruitment rates, and influencers' recommendations for military service will be assessed. Measures to mitigate any negative impacts of repeal will also be considered, including the effects on retention and benefits for domestic partners, spouses, and dependents of gay and lesbian personnel. The assessment will consider the impact of repealing section 654 on military readiness, cohesion, morale, discipline, and family welfare. It will also evaluate the changes needed in federal laws and policies to promote the welfare of Armed Forces members and their families. Additionally, the necessity of a statute prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation will be examined. The assessment of repealing section 654 in the 111th Congress includes evaluating the impact on Department of Defense policies, implementation challenges, necessary measures, and effects on military housing policies. Assuming repeal of section 654, the Defense of Marriage Act and associated provisions would create differences in pay, benefits, and support for heterosexual vs. gay military couples. The extent of these differences and limitations on benefits should be explained. To effectively implement a repeal of section 654, the extent of limitations on benefits resulting from the Defense of Marriage Act affecting military readiness, cohesion, morale, and discipline should be explained. Additionally, the diversity of benefits and its impact on military family readiness, morale, welfare, and cohesion should be addressed. The need for education and training programs for members of the Armed Forces, their families, and dependents upon repeal of section 654, as well as the projected costs of the repeal, should also be considered. The projected costs of repealing section 654 include changes in military facilities to accommodate various sexual orientations. It also considers making gay and lesbian military retirees eligible for federal benefits retroactively, similar to heterosexual retirees, at an estimated cost. The methodology involves using in-house resources for surveys, studies, and analysis. The working group, using in-house capabilities of the Department of Defense, will conduct surveys, polling, and analysis. If necessary, external organizations cannot be used for these purposes. The working group will provide a final report to the Secretary of Defense within six months. The Secretary will then submit a report to the Committees on Armed Services, including the working group's recommendations, comments from military chiefs, and the Secretary's own conclusions and legislative proposals."
