The \"Colorado River Indian Reservation Boundary Correction Act\" established the Reservation along the Colorado River in Arizona and California for the Indians living in the area. President Grant expanded the Reservation's southern boundary in 1873 and 1874 to prevent conflicts with non-Indians. Mr. Chandler Robbins surveyed the Reservation in 1875, defining its new southern boundary. In 1876, President Grant established the Reservation's boundaries based on the Robbins Survey. In 1914, a resurvey by Mr. Guy Harrington confirmed and approved the boundaries set in 1876. In 1915, President Wilson issued Executive Order No. 2273 to correct an error in locating the southern boundary line of the Reservation, excluding the La Paz lands. However, historical evidence suggests that this decision was based on incorrect information, and the La Paz lands should not have been excluded from the Reservation. The La Paz lands hold cultural significance. The La Paz lands hold cultural and historical significance for the Colorado River Indian tribes, who seek to have them restored to their Reservation. The Act aims to correct the Reservation boundary, restore the La Paz lands, and ensure public access for recreational purposes. The Secretary of the Interior will review and mark the corrected boundary in accordance with public surveys. SEC. 2. BOUNDARY CORRECTION, RESTORATION, DESCRIPTION. The boundaries of the Colorado River Indian Reservation are defined by the Robbins and Harrington Surveys, encompassing approximately 15,375 acres of Federal land. A map prepared by the Bureau of Land Management, titled \"H.R. 2981, Colorado River Indian Reservation Boundary Correction Act,\" outlines these boundaries. The map is available for review at the Bureau of Land Management. The United States' rights to lands within these boundaries, excluded from the reservation by Executive Order, are subject to restoration, with exceptions for valid existing rights under Federal law. The lands excluded from the Colorado River Indian Reservation by Executive Order No. 2273 are now restored to the Reservation and held in trust by the United States for the tribes. Two parcels of Arizona State Lands totaling 320 acres and 520 acres are excluded from this restoration. The Secretary of the Interior will survey and mark the restored lands to clearly define their boundaries. These lands will have no Federal reserve water rights and public access for recreational purposes will be maintained under the Colorado River Indian Tribes' regulations. The restored lands will retain existing rights-of-way, easements, and mining claims. The United States can continue Reclamation projects and access mineral materials for Colorado River maintenance. The Secretary may grant additional rights-of-way for roads and utilities to adjoining landowners if necessary. The applicant must ensure that the proposed right-of-way acquisition does not harm the Colorado River Indian Tribes and complies with federal regulations. Fees for renewing leases, easements, or rights-of-way should not exceed the current Federal rate if the holder has complied with the terms. SEC. 7. GAMING. Land taken into trust under this Act shall not be used for gaming as defined in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act."
