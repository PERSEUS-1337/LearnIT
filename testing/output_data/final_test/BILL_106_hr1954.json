    "content": "The Rental Fairness Act of 2000, also known as the \"Rental Fairness Act,\" includes sections on short title, table of contents, findings, definitions, general fairness rule, preservation of State law, liability based on negligence, and applicability. The Congress finds that most State laws follow the principle that a party should only be liable for harm they could prevent. However, some laws still hold rental companies vicariously liable for their customers' negligence, even if the company was not at fault. Additionally, a few states impose unlimited liability on companies for their customers' actions, regardless of fault. The small number of vicarious liability laws create a competitive barrier for smaller companies in rental markets, increasing costs for all customers nationwide due to high insurance expenses. Legislation addressing rental fairness in interstate insurance markets is necessary to reduce burdens on commerce and litigation. This falls within Congress's powers under various clauses of the Constitution and the 14th amendment. The curr_chunk is a section header stating \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" The curr_chunk defines key terms for the Act, including \"harm,\" \"motor vehicle,\" and \"owner.\" Harm is defined as injury, illness, or loss resulting from injury or damage. Motor vehicle is defined as per section 13102(14) of title 49, US Code. Owner is defined as a person with ownership or possession rights of a motor vehicle. The curr_chunk defines key terms for the Act, including \"person\" and \"State.\" Person is defined as any individual, corporation, company, trust, or entity. State is defined as each of the several States, territories, or political subdivisions of the United States. SEC. 4. GENERAL FAIRNESS AND RESPONSIBILITY RULE. No owner renting or leasing motor vehicles is liable for harm caused by a renter's use of the vehicle, except if the owner fails to maintain required financial responsibility. SEC. 5. PRESERVATION OF STATE LAW. SEC. 5. PRESERVATION OF STATE LAW. This section ensures that owners renting or leasing motor vehicles must comply with a State's financial responsibility requirements.
