    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Informed Health Care Decision Making Act\" and includes findings. Congress finds that national randomized controlled trials have shown that replacing drug advertisement summaries with a drug facts box improves consumer knowledge and judgments. Consumers presented with a drug facts box accurately perceive side effects and benefits, and are more likely to choose the superior drug. Additionally, a 2007 Institute of Medicine workshop emphasized the public's limited understanding of drug benefits and risks, highlighting the importance of providing patients and physicians with the best information for informed decisions. The workshop emphasized the need for quantitative approaches in evaluating pharmaceutical benefit-risk and developing improved tools for communication. The FDA was recommended to pilot test a drug facts box and adopt a standard document for communicating essential information about pharmaceuticals. The workshop recommended quantitative summaries of risks and benefits, along with use and precaution information, suggesting the FDA adopt the drug facts box format as its standard. SEC. 3. PRESENTATION OF DRUG BENEFIT AND RISK INFORMATION. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will determine if standardized summaries of drug benefits and risks in labeling and advertising would improve decision-making. They will review evidence and consult with various stakeholders before submitting a report to Congress within a year. The Secretary will determine if standardized drug benefit and risk summaries in labeling and advertising would enhance decision-making. If deemed beneficial, regulations will be implemented within a year to establish this format. The Secretary will ensure that drug information summaries are objective, up-to-date, and based on a comprehensive review process. The information will be posted on the FDA website. SEC. 4. STANDARDS FOR COMPARATIVE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS INFORMATION. The Secretary will establish methodological standards for including comparative clinical effectiveness information in labeling and advertisements, ensuring reliability, usefulness, adherence to scientific standards, and transparency through consultation with stakeholders, manufacturers, and clinicians. The Secretary will consult with various stakeholders to define \"comparative clinical effectiveness\" as the outcomes, safety, and appropriateness of a drug compared to others for the same health condition and patient demographic. SEC. 5. DISCLOSURE OF COMPARATIVE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS INFORMATION. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of \"comparative clinical effectiveness\" in relation to drugs and devices for the same health condition and patient demographic subpopulation. It also mentions the inclusion of information on comparative clinical effectiveness in labeling and advertising. The curr_chunk revises regulations regarding comparative clinical effectiveness in drug labeling and advertising. The curr_chunk revises regulations on comparative clinical effectiveness in drug labeling and advertising by including information on effectiveness and comparative clinical effectiveness for medical devices."
