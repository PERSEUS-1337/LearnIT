    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Let Wall Street Pay for Wall Street's Bailout Act of 2009\". The findings are also included in the Act. Congress found that the Bush Administration's allocation of the first $350 billion of TARP funds lacked oversight, leading to public outrage. Despite this, Congress did not block the remaining $350 billion, and the Federal Reserve committed over a trillion dollars to stabilize the economy by bailing out \"too big to fail\" banks. The $700 billion TARP fund and new Federal Reserve lending facilities were created to protect Wall Street investors, who should now bear the cost of this taxpayer money infusion. A securities transfer tax, previously implemented in the United States from 1914 to 1966, could raise approximately $150 billion a year. This tax would be on the sale and purchase of financial instruments like stock, options, and futures, with a quarter percent (0.25 percent) rate. All revenue generated from this tax would go into the general fund of the Treasury of the United States. The revenue generated from a securities transfer tax would be deposited in the general fund of the Treasury of the United States to cover the net cost of bailouts, phasing out once the bailouts are repaid. SEC. 3. RECOUPMENT OF DEFICIT ARISING FROM FEDERAL BAILOUT. An amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 introduces a new subchapter on a tax on securities transactions to recoup the deficit from federal bailouts. A tax is imposed on covered securities transactions at a rate of 0.25 percent or a specified percentage. The tax is paid by the trading facility where the transaction occurs. The specified percentage is determined by the Secretary to generate revenue for the Treasury. The Secretary determines a tax rate on covered securities transactions to generate revenue for the Treasury, including costs of the Troubled Asset Relief Program and Federal Reserve authority. The Secretary determines a tax rate on covered securities transactions, taking into account the net cost estimation. The specified percentage is rounded to the nearest 1/100th of a percentage point. Covered securities transactions include those under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The Secretary determines tax rates on covered securities transactions in consultation with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. A clerical amendment is made to the table of subchapters for chapter 36 of the Code. The amendments to the tax on securities transactions will apply to sales occurring more than 30 days after the enactment of this Act."
