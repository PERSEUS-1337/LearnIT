    "content": "According to SAMHSA, in 2007, 11% of adults experienced serious psychological distress, with less than half receiving mental health care due to barriers. Some who did receive care faced issues like lack of trained providers. \"Mental health care\" encompasses a wide range of services for various mental conditions. The report discusses mental health care services, including treatment for various mental illnesses and conditions across different age groups. It covers counseling, inpatient and outpatient care, and prescription medications for emotional and anxiety issues. The report also examines the historical perspective, delivery system, and financing mechanisms of mental health care. It addresses the providers, locations, and payment for mental health services. This report focuses on the civilian mental health care delivery system, analyzing barriers to treatment and workforce training issues. Congress has shown interest in transforming the mental health system following tragedies involving mentally ill individuals. Two significant laws on mental health care have been passed in the past decade. In the past decade, Congress passed two laws on mental health care. The Children's Health Act reauthorized SAMHSA in 2000, focusing on measuring mental health care outcomes. The Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 expanded federal requirements for mental health coverage. In the United States, mental illnesses are diagnosed based on the DSM-IV, with an estimated 26.2% of Americans suffering from a diagnosable mental illness in a given year. The prevalence of mental illnesses in the population is high, with about 6% suffering from serious mental illness. Many individuals have multiple mental illnesses simultaneously, with anxiety and mood disorders being the most common in the United States. There is a negative societal perception of mental illness, leading to stigma that hinders treatment-seeking behavior, especially in rural areas. To combat this stigma, there needs to be a shift in society's perception of mental illness and increased access to effective treatment options. The evolution of mental health care delivery system has been hindered by historical lack of effective treatment options. Recent advances in treatment options have not been matched by transformation in delivery system and financing mechanisms. Mental health care has traditionally been the responsibility of state and local governments, with the earliest mental health care system in the US dating back to the 18th century. In the 18th century, the first \"asylum\" was established in Pennsylvania Hospital to treat individuals with mental illnesses using physical and psychosocial techniques. While some methods were considered humane, such as hiring caring attendants and engaging patients in activities, others like bloodletting and forced vomiting were seen as inhumane. Despite some success in restoring mental health, asylums eventually housed individuals with chronic conditions by the mid-19th century. In the 19th century, asylums housed individuals with chronic mental illnesses, leading to deteriorating care, overcrowding, and underfunding. The mental health care system incorporated public health principles, but funding issues persisted. By the end of the century, states passed laws to assume financial responsibility for asylums. Treatment effectiveness remained low at the turn of the 20th century, with neuropathology emerging as a new scientific approach. In 1946, the National Mental Health Act provided federal funding for psychiatric education and research, leading to the creation of the National Institute of Mental Health in 1949. Deinstitutionalization in the mid-20th century shifted mental health care to communities, with the Community Mental Health Act of 1963 authorizing federal support for treatment of mental illnesses. Deinstitutionalization in the mid-20th century shifted individuals with mental illnesses from asylums to institutions like the criminal justice system and homeless shelters. President Jimmy Carter's Commission on Mental Health in 1977 aimed to address deficiencies in the mental health system through social supports like housing and vocational training. However, bureaucratic rivalries and tensions hindered the implementation of the National Plan for the Chronically Mentally Ill in 1980. The Mental Health Systems Act of the 1980s was influenced by rivalries within administrations and mental health professions, as well as social issues like poverty and racism. President George H.W. Bush declared the 1990s as the Decade of the Brain, leading to advancements in neuroscience and mental illness research. Despite progress, policymakers and experts in the 21st century find the mental health system fragmented and challenging to navigate effectively. Experts assert that the mental health system is fragmented and difficult to navigate, with issues such as lack of health insurance, underinsurance for mental illnesses, access barriers for certain groups, discrimination, and stigma hindering help-seeking behavior. The 110th Congress passed a law expanding federal requirements for mental health coverage, and reports show advancements in treatment since the 1980s. In the 1980s, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released a report on mental health advancements. The study of mental illnesses and treatment options began in the early 20th century, with drugs for schizophrenia and depression discovered in the mid-20th century. In the 1970s, lithium was used to treat manic depressive illness, followed by the discovery of SSRIs in the 1980s for depression. More effective drugs emerged in the 1990s for psychosis and schizophrenia, leading to state-of-the-art treatments for most serious mental illnesses. Despite significant investments in research, a commission reported under President George W. Bush that many Americans were not benefiting from these advancements. The 1999 Surgeon General's report recommended transforming mental health care delivery in the US to improve access to quality care. Providers in various settings deliver mental health care, with financial resources influencing the quality of care and health outcomes. The section discusses characteristics of the mental health care delivery system, including types of providers, settings, and financing. It also describes federally funded efforts to measure quality of care. Providers fall into categories based on expertise, and care can be delivered in hospitals, outpatient clinics, or informal venues based on the severity of the illness. The type of mental health care provided depends on the severity of the individual's mental illness. Mild cases can be treated on an outpatient basis with medication, while severe cases may require more intensive care. Specialized mental health providers, such as psychiatrists and psychologists, are trained and licensed to provide this care. In the United States, mental health providers, including psychiatrists and therapists, may have licenses to require involuntary hospitalization and treatment for suicidal individuals. Specialty mental health care is delivered in clinics or hospitals specifically designed for such care, with inpatient care reserved for acute situations. In 2005, there were 41,598 psychiatrists and 398,000 mental health therapists in the US, with 2,891 organizations delivering specialized mental health care in 2004. Specialty mental health providers have their own professional associations and accreditation bodies. In the United States, mental health care providers, including psychiatrists and therapists, have the authority to involuntarily hospitalize individuals in acute situations. Psychiatric care for the elderly can be provided in nursing homes by mental health specialists. Recent trends show a shift towards less expensive settings for older adults with mental illnesses, such as skilled nursing facilities. General health care providers like family practitioners and pediatricians, who are trained in a broader field than mental health, also offer care in areas with a shortage of specialized mental health providers. In the United States, mental health care for children and youth is often provided by pediatricians, who may refer severe cases to specialists. General health care providers may also offer mental health care in outpatient settings or hospital emergency departments for acute conditions. Providers in the third category are trained in human services and may not be licensed to provide health care services, including mental health care. They may belong to social service-related professional associations but are not associated with medical accreditation bodies. The fourth category of mental health providers includes informal volunteer groups and peer counselors who lack formal training or licenses. Rural areas often face shortages of trained mental health professionals. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) designates providers in this category. In 2008, 66% of Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs) for mental health were in rural areas, with 3,059 HPSAs and 77 million people living in these areas. HRSA states that 5,145 practitioners are needed to meet the demand for mental health providers in these areas. Primary care providers in non-metropolitan areas often provide mental health care due to the lack of specialty providers. Care location may be influenced by payer and personal preferences, even if insurance covers specialty care. Stigma may also impact where individuals seek care. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services compile data on national health expenditures, including mental health services. In 2005, $142 billion was spent on mental health treatment, with private insurance covering the largest share of expenses. Stigma may influence individuals seeking care from primary care providers instead of psychiatrists. Funding for mental health care can come from out-of-pocket payments, health insurance, or philanthropic foundations. Disparities in insurance coverage for mental illnesses exist, but the mental health parity law aims to address them. State and local government funding for mental health services is significant, reflecting their historical responsibility for low-income individuals with serious mental illness. Federal funding for mental health care research and treatment is provided by various agencies with different missions and target populations. VA and DOD offer mental health benefits within their delivery system, while SAMHSA provides treatment through block grants and discretionary grant programs to states and communities. HRSA funds community health centers for treatment, and CMS administers Medicaid, CHIP, and Medicare programs for low-income individuals. The Medicaid, CHIP, and Medicare programs provide health insurance for low-income individuals, uninsured children, and individuals aged 65 and older. The Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 requires Medicaid and CHIP to offer mental health services on par with physical health services. Medicare covers inpatient and outpatient mental health services with a coinsurance requirement that is being phased out between 2010 and 2014. The Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 requires Medicaid and CHIP to offer mental health services on par with physical health services. Medicare covers mental health services with a coinsurance requirement being phased out between 2010 and 2014. The Institute of Medicine defines health care quality as the degree to which services increase desired health outcomes. Various federal entities measure mental health care quality using indicators. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) uses indicators for mental health care quality, including SAMHSA's National Outcome Measures (NOMs) and HRSA's requirement to report on suicide rates among 15- to 19-year-olds. Medicare and private insurers use the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) for quality assessment. Many private health insurers use HEDIS to measure mental health care quality, which includes medication management, follow-up after hospitalization, and utilization of services. AHRQ produces reports on health care quality annually, tracking effectiveness across nine health conditions, including mental illness. AHRQ uses indicators like suicide death rate and receipt of treatment for major depression to measure mental health care effectiveness. There are federally funded inventories of mental health care quality measures, such as NIMHQM. The National Inventory of Mental Health Quality Measures (NIMHQM) and the National Quality Measures Clearinghouse (NQMC) are databases with measures for quality assessment in mental health care. The mental health care delivery system in the United States is complex, with gaps that make it difficult for some populations to navigate. Congress may consider opportunities to transform the mental health care delivery system. The practical application of evidence-based treatment practices in mental health care is slow, especially in rural and urban areas with limited access to providers. Health insurance coverage for mental illness is often inadequate compared to physical illnesses. Coordination of mental health care with other services is lacking, and quality measurements are insufficient for system improvement. Various federal reports have called for reform in the mental health system. The 2003 Surgeon General's report and the Freedom Commission report provide general guidelines for reforming the mental health care system, while the 2005 Action Agenda and IOM report offer specific action steps to address issues such as improving evidence-based treatment practices, reducing stigma, enhancing quality of care, addressing workforce shortages, coordinating care, and overcoming financial barriers. Significant advances have been made in understanding and treating mental illness, but experts believe many Americans are not benefiting from improved mental health care. The lag between discovering effective treatments and incorporating them into routine patient care can last about 15 to 20 years. Options for Congress to address mental health care delivery issues are outlined, including evidence-based practices, access to care, financing, coordination, and quality of care. The disconnect between research and practice in mental health care can be attributed to factors such as reluctance by payers to cover new treatment modalities, lack of training for providers in evidence-based practices, and a shortage of research in key areas like disparities in seeking mental health care and long-term effects of medications. The curr_chunk discusses the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) for mental illness, specifically faith-based therapy. Data from HHS's 2007 National Health Interview Survey shows that CAM was used by a small percentage of adults and children for treating anxiety, depression, and ADD. There is limited research on the effectiveness of these alternative therapies, and more research is recommended in the field of mental health treatment. The Freedom Commission report recommends more research to address knowledge gaps in mental health care. Experts suggest increasing the use of effective practices and providing appropriate training for providers. The IOM report suggests using quality improvement tools and technology to reduce delays in applying evidence-based practices. Congress could collaborate with insurers to encourage the use of emerging research findings through grants and incentives. SAMHSA could work with accreditation boards to enhance training. Congress could consider requiring SAMHSA to collaborate with accreditation boards to provide more training and continuing education opportunities for mental healthcare providers, especially in rural areas where individuals face challenges accessing care due to a scarcity of providers and social stigma. This could help improve the delivery of evidence-based practices and information technology in mental healthcare. The shortage of culturally competent mental health providers is a concern in both rural and urban areas, leading to disparities in care for racial and ethnic minorities. Primary care practitioners often step in to provide mental health care, but face constraints such as lack of training and heavy patient loads. Efforts to address this shortage are needed to prevent the disproportionate burden of mental illness on minority populations. The shortage of culturally competent mental health providers leads to disparities in care for racial and ethnic minorities. Efforts are needed to address insufficient training, heavy patient loads, and lack of specialized backup in the mental health care system. The Surgeon General's report and the Freedom Commission recommend increasing the capacity and developing the workforce to meet the demand for care and treatment options. Congress could consider asking professional associations to assess mental health training needs. The federal mental health parity law requires health insurers to provide equal coverage for mental illness as for physical illness. Advocates believe that disparities in mental health coverage and barriers to access care persist due to this law not mandating coverage for all mental illnesses. Congress may provide funding to address mental health training needs identified by health care providers. The federal mental health parity law requires equal coverage for mental illnesses as for physical illnesses. Some analysts fear insurers may drop mental health coverage due to parity requirements. Insurers can now manage mental health benefits more aggressively under the law. Regulators find it challenging to determine parity in treatment options between mental and physical health. The law does not address the quality of care for mental health. The federal mental health parity law does not address quality of care issues or the mental health care needs of the uninsured. Some analysts believe the law may increase the quantity of mental health care without improving health outcomes. Research is needed to assess the effectiveness of the new requirements in improving mental health coverage. Increased federal support for mental health is recommended by national reports. Four national reports recommend increased federal support for mental health research, suggesting a public-private partnership involving various stakeholders to improve leadership and vision at the national level. Effective functioning of the mental health service system requires connections and coordination among public and private sectors, specialty services, and institutions in housing, criminal justice, and education. Lack of effective communication between service providers could result in missed opportunities for individuals with mental illnesses to receive necessary care. The report emphasizes the need for coordination among service providers to ensure individuals with mental illness receive appropriate care, especially when navigating multiple funding sources and providers with different processes. Individuals with mental illness often have multiple behavioral health conditions, including substance abuse disorders. Individuals with mental illness often have multiple behavioral health conditions, including substance abuse disorders. Coordination of care is crucial to prevent fragmented care and barriers to access. Experts recommend patient-centered mental health care focused on recovery, requiring integration with general health care. Consumers and caregivers should be more involved in planning mental health services to meet individual needs and preferences. Congress could consider requiring SAMHSA to work with federal and state agencies to provide coordinated social and health services. To improve mental health care, coordination with federal and state agencies is essential to develop a model for a coordinated system of care. This model can be adapted at the state or community level, similar to SAMHSA's Systems of Care for children with serious emotional disorders. Challenges such as inadequate evidence-based practices, inconsistent access to care, and poor coordination negatively impact the quality of mental health services. Unique characteristics of mental health care make measuring and assessing quality issues challenging. The unique characteristics of mental health care, such as involuntary commitment and a lack of standardized quality measurement infrastructure, pose challenges in developing performance measures. Current administrative data collection systems do not adequately capture mental health assessment and treatment practices, leading to inconsistent use of evidence-based treatments. Efforts to improve mental health care quality have not received significant attention in the private sector, and there is a lack of consensus in the public sector. National surveillance systems do not effectively capture necessary data for transforming mental health care. The mental health care delivery system needs indicators developed by SAMHSA for transformation. Efforts are required to translate outcomes data into recommendations. Modern quality improvement methods are not widely used in mental health care. A comprehensive strategy is recommended for improved outcomes, including better diagnostic and assessment strategies and a stronger quality measurement infrastructure. The IOM report recommends developing mental health information technology infrastructure to improve quality of care. Congress could require providers to collect data on mental health care quality and coordinate with federal agencies. Historically, mental illness has been less understood, leading to disparities in treatment and financing. The mental health care system faces structural and functional issues. The mental health care system is facing structural and functional issues, prompting experts to call for its transformation. Recommendations include incorporating evidence-based practices, addressing workforce shortages, removing financial barriers to access care, coordinating mental health care with general health care and social services, and improving the quality of care. A comprehensive transformation may be necessary to ensure quality mental health care for all individuals in need."
