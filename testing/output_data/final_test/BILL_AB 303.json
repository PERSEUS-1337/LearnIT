    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 4030 of the Penal Code is amended to establish a statewide policy strictly limiting strip and body cavity searches to protect the state and federal constitutional rights of the people of California. The amended Penal Code section restricts body cavity searches to prearraignment detainees for certain offenses, excluding those in the custody of specific departments. Definitions include limited body cavity areas and the purpose of a physical body cavity search. When a person is arrested and taken into custody, they may be subjected to patdown searches, metal detector searches, and thorough clothing searches to find concealed weapons and contraband before being placed in a booking cell. A person arrested on a misdemeanor or infraction offense shall not be strip searched unless there is reasonable suspicion of concealing contraband, with prior authorization required. The supervising officer must provide written authorization for strip searches based on specific and articulable facts. A person arrested for a misdemeanor or infraction not involving weapons, drugs, or violence cannot be held in the general jail population unless certain conditions are met. This includes not being cited and released, not being released on their own recognizance, and not being able to post bail within a reasonable time. A person arrested for a misdemeanor or infraction not involving weapons, drugs, or violence cannot be housed in the general jail population unless certain conditions are met, such as not being able to post bail within a reasonable time. They can only be placed in the general population in case of a documented emergency with no reasonable alternative, and must retain all rights to release on citation, their own recognizance, or bail. (g) A person arrested for a misdemeanor or infraction offense shall not undergo a physical body cavity search without a search warrant issued by a magistrate. A copy of the authorization and search warrant must be kept in the agency's records and provided to the person searched upon request. Details of the search must be recorded, including the time, date, place, the person conducting the search, and the results. Strip searches and body cavity searches must be conducted without touching certain areas of the body. Physical body cavity searches must be done in sanitary conditions by qualified medical personnel. Searches must be conducted by individuals of the same sex as the person being searched, except for physicians or licensed medical personnel. (l) All strip, visual, and physical body cavity searches must be conducted in a private area. Anyone authorizing or conducting a search in violation of this rule is guilty of a misdemeanor. This section does not limit a person's rights to seek damages or legal action, nor does it prevent prosecution of those who violate these rules under other laws. Any person harmed by a violation of this section can sue for damages, including punitive damages and attorney's fees. Section 4031 of the Penal Code prohibits touching specific body parts during strip or cavity searches of minors in juvenile detention centers. Physical body cavity searches must be conducted by authorized medical personnel in sanitary conditions. Searches must be conducted in privacy by same-sex individuals, except for physicians or licensed medical personnel. Searches must not be observed by unauthorized persons. Any unauthorized strip searches or body cavity searches are punishable by law. Victims of such violations can seek civil action for damages, including punitive damages and attorney's fees. This section does not limit the protections granted by another specific section. The act does not require reimbursement for certain costs incurred by local agencies or school districts related to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes. However, reimbursement may be made for other mandated costs determined by the Commission on State Mandates."
