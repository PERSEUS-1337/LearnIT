    "content": "From the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s, economic and trade relations between the United States and Vietnam were frozen due to the Vietnam War legacy. President Ford extended the trade embargo on North Vietnam to cover the reunified nation in 1975. Relations began to improve during the Clinton Administration, with joint efforts to recover the remains of missing U.S. military personnel and Vietnam's withdrawal from Cambodia prompting a shift in U.S. policy. President Bill Clinton ended the U.S. trade embargo on Vietnam in 1994, leading to the restoration of diplomatic relations in 1995. The shift from a central planned economy to market socialism in 1986 boosted Vietnam's economy, with real GDP growth averaging over 6% per year since 2000. The bilateral trade agreement signed in 2000 further strengthened economic ties between the United States and Vietnam. The United States extended most favored nation trade status to Vietnam under the Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) in 2000, leading to improved economic and trade relations. Vietnam was granted permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) status in 2006 as part of its accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO). A Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) was signed in 2007, signaling a desire for closer trade relations between the two nations. The United States and Vietnam improved economic and trade relations through various agreements. Trade between the two nations grew slowly initially due to Vietnam's lack of NTR, but increased rapidly after conditional NTR was granted in 2001. Bilateral trade nearly doubled between 2001 and 2002. The United States expressed interest in closer economic relations but highlighted the need for changes in Vietnam's legal and regulatory environment for agreements like the BIT or GSP program. Bilateral trade between the United States and Vietnam saw significant growth, especially after the US granted PNTR status to Vietnam in 2006. Despite fluctuations due to economic factors, trade has generally increased. Tensions arose over specific goods like clothing and catfish exports, leading to monitoring programs. New merchandise exports from Vietnam, such as electrical machinery, may pose future challenges. The Trump Administration has shown interest in increasing arms sales to Vietnam, with President Obama lifting restrictions in 2016. Despite expressed interest, arms sales have been limited. Reducing U.S. bilateral trade deficits is a priority for the administration. The United States aims to address trade deficits with various countries, including Vietnam. President Trump discussed the $32 billion bilateral trade deficit with Vietnam in meetings with Vietnamese leaders. The U.S. trade deficit with Vietnam has significantly increased since 2001, driven by imports of clothing, apparel, footwear, electronics, and machinery. Vietnam's economic growth from 2012 to 2017 was driven by expansion into electronics and machinery, reflecting changes in Asia's supply chains. Major manufacturers from China, Japan, South Korea, and the United States relocated production facilities to Vietnam, boosting Vietnamese exports. A joint statement in May 2017 between Prime Minister Phuc and President Trump outlined measures to enhance economic ties, including creating favorable conditions for businesses and Vietnam's commitment to economic reform and international integration. Vietnam has a consistent policy of economic reform and international integration, creating favorable conditions for foreign companies, including those from the United States. They are also protecting and enforcing intellectual property rights and aligning their labor laws with international commitments. Both nations have pledged to work together on resolving priority issues such as intellectual property, advertising, financial services, and trade of specific products. President Quang and President Trump released a joint statement in November 2017, pledging to deepen and expand the bilateral trade and investment relationship through formal mechanisms. The United States and Vietnam are working together to resolve agricultural trade issues and promote free and fair trade in priority areas such as electronic payment services, automobiles, and intellectual property rights enforcement. Vietnam has requested the US to recognize it as a market economy, lift catfish inspection regulations, and accelerate fruit exports. Both countries have agreed to use the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) as a major vehicle to discuss trade and investment issues. During a meeting in Hanoi, the United States and Vietnam discussed bilateral trade issues such as agriculture, food safety, intellectual property, digital trade, and illegal wildlife tracking. Vietnam urged the US to recognize it as a market economy, repeal catfish inspection procedures, and reduce barriers to fruit imports. Since 2002, trade friction has existed between the United States and Vietnam over frozen fish fillets. Vietnam exports basa, swai, and tra fish varieties, commonly known as catfish, to the U.S. market. Despite objections from the U.S. catfish industry, Vietnamese exports have grown, reaching almost $345 million in 2017. The U.S. has taken actions such as prohibiting the labeling of basa, swai, and tra as \"catfish\" in 2002 and imposing antidumping duties in 2003. In 2008, Congress transferred catfish inspection from FDA to USDA, confirmed in 2014. Duties on frozen fish fillets from Vietnam, including basa, swai, and tra, were kept in place by ITC. U.S. imports of Vietnamese catfish declined initially but rose after 2005. The number of companies exporting catfish to the U.S. decreased significantly following the imposition of antidumping duties. The Secretary of Agriculture sent draft regulations to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in November 2009; final regulations were published in December 2015. The new regulations took effect on March 1, 2016, with a transition period until September 1, 2017. The Vietnamese government views the U.S. response to basa, swai, and tra exports as trade protectionism. Ambassador Le Cong Phung raised concerns about reclassifying basa and tra as catfish, impacting over 1 million Vietnamese jobs. Vietnam tightened export hygiene standards for basa, swai, and tra in anticipation of new U.S. inspection regulations. Certificates for hygiene and food safety were required for all basa and tra exports from Vietnam. Vietnamese fish breeders were trained by U.S.-based Mazzetta Company to comply with U.S. standards. Prime Minister Dung approved a 10-year, $2 billion \"master plan\" in 2011. In 2011, Prime Minister Dung approved a 10-year, $2 billion plan for Vietnam's fish farming industry. Vietnam expressed disappointment over new U.S. catfish regulations, citing potential trade barriers and harm to Vietnamese farmers. Vietnam filed a WTO complaint regarding the U.S. inspection program for catfish. Vietnam filed a WTO complaint against the U.S. inspection program for catfish imports, claiming it violates the WTO SPS Agreement. If not resolved in 60 days, Vietnam can request a formal WTO panel. In a separate decision, the ITC voted to continue antidumping duties on certain frozen fish fillets from Vietnam. The Department of Commerce lowered antidumping duties on Vietnam's catfish exports to the United States. Vietnam filed a WTO complaint against the U.S. for imposing anti-dumping duties on frozen fish fillets. China also requested to be part of the consultations due to its seafood exports to the U.S. market. The U.S. has 60 days to respond before Vietnam can request adjudication by a WTO dispute panel. In 1975, U.S. military sales to Vietnam were banned, and in 1984, Vietnam was included on the ITAR list. The U.S. government included Vietnam on the ITAR list, restricting arms sales even after lifting the trade embargo. In 2007, ITAR was amended to allow non-lethal defense articles and services to Vietnam on a case-by-case basis. This restriction hindered diplomatic relations, but Vietnam was later allowed to participate in the FMF program in 2009. This enabled Vietnam to purchase spare parts for helicopters and military vehicles. In 2016, U.S. military sales agreements with Vietnam increased significantly, reaching $20 million. The Obama Administration relaxed restrictions on the transfer of lethal weapons to Vietnam, aiming to enhance maritime security capabilities. President Obama announced the complete removal of restrictions on sales of lethal weapons and related services to Vietnam during his visit to Hanoi in May 2016. The Trump Administration aims to increase U.S. arms sales to Vietnam to reduce the trade deficit and strengthen the security partnership. The State Department is encouraging Vietnam to diversify its sources of arms away from historical suppliers like Russia. This move has been seen as a way to improve Vietnam's capacity to respond to China in the South China Sea. Some have raised concerns about the move being premature without improvements in human rights conditions in Vietnam. The Trump Administration's \"Buy American\" proposal aims to increase U.S. arms sales to Vietnam. The State Department is encouraging Vietnam to diversify its sources of arms. Vietnam is interested in acquiring F-16 fighter aircraft, P-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft, and maritime ISR equipment from the U.S. The potential sale of arms to Vietnam is controversial in Congress due to concerns about Vietnam's human rights record. Congress has oversight of military exports to Vietnam under the Arms Export Control Act, requiring notification before concluding any arms sales. The Trump Administration aims to increase U.S. arms sales to Vietnam, with Vietnam interested in acquiring F-16 fighter aircraft, P-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft, and maritime ISR equipment. Vietnamese leaders seek to change Vietnam's official designation from \"nonmarket economy\" to \"market economy\" under U.S. law, which could impact antidumping and countervailing duty cases. Vietnamese leaders aim to change Vietnam's status from a \"nonmarket economy\" to a \"market economy\" under U.S. law, potentially affecting antidumping and countervailing duty cases. The transition from a centrally planned economy to a market economy has been ongoing for over 20 years in Vietnam. Vietnam has been transitioning to a market economy under its doi moi policy, allowing private enterprise growth. The government still manages the economy, with concerns about state-owned enterprises dominating key sectors despite privatization efforts. State-owned enterprises (SOEs) continue to dominate key sectors of Vietnam's economy, despite efforts to privatize them through equitization. Over the last five years, 530 SOEs have been equitized, with plans for more under the new government led by Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc. In 2017, a directive was issued to facilitate the equitization process, and a blueprint for SOE restructuring aims to continue this trend until 2020. The government aims to equitize 137 more SOEs by 2020, including larger ones like Agribank, Mobifone, and VNPT. The pace of equitization in the first half of 2017 was slow, with only 19 plans approved. Analysts note that the government retains a controlling interest in equitized SOEs, limiting private investor involvement. The doi moi process in Vietnam has led to gradual deregulation of prices and wages, with the government maintaining control over key prices and wages. Workers are paid based on fixed pay scales or market conditions, depending on the type of enterprise. The government asserts that most prices and wages are market-determined, especially for goods exported to the United States. The Vietnamese economy is considered a market economy, with ongoing efforts to privatize state-owned enterprises. Vietnam has sought recognition as a market economy from its trading partners, including ASEAN, Australia, India, Japan, and New Zealand. Despite being designated as a non-market economy by the United States until 2019, Vietnam sees value in being recognized as a market economy for trade relations normalization. This designation affects AD and CVD cases, potentially leading to higher duties. The U.S. government remains critical of Vietnam's record on intellectual property rights (IPR) protection, with ongoing issues in online piracy and counterfeit goods sales. Vietnam is on the Watch List in the U.S. Trade Representative's 2017 Special 301 Report due to enforcement challenges. Stronger action is needed to prevent further worsening of online piracy and counterfeit goods sales. Sales of counterfeit goods in Vietnam are expected to increase with the rise in broadband Internet access and smartphone usage. Counterfeit goods, including high-quality fakes, are readily available in physical markets, and there are concerns about domestic manufacturing of counterfeit products. Talks to establish a bilateral investment treaty (BIT) between the US and Vietnam have been ongoing since 2008, aiming to improve the investment climate by protecting foreign investors and establishing dispute settlement procedures. The US and Vietnam have been in talks since 2008 to establish a bilateral investment treaty (BIT) to protect foreign investors and set up dispute settlement procedures. The existing 2001 Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) includes provisions for investment, dispute settlement, and transparency in laws and regulations. No BIT talks were held after both nations joined the TPP negotiations, as the TPP agreement would cover similar issues. The US and Vietnam have been discussing a bilateral investment treaty (BIT) since 2008. The negotiations have not resumed as of mid-April 2018. Vietnam is part of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and is also involved in negotiations for another regional trade agreement. Vietnam is part of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and is also negotiating the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). Projections show a slight increase in Vietnamese exports to the United States and a small decrease in U.S. exports to Vietnam, leading to a rise in the bilateral trade deficit. The CPTPP is expected to boost Vietnam's GDP by 1.32%, exports by 4.0%, and imports by 3.8%. The report examines trends in bilateral trade and investment statistics, focusing on merchandise trade, trade in services, and foreign direct investment (FDI). The rapid growth in Vietnam's export of clothing and catfish has led to trade tension with the United States. Besides these products, other commodities like electrical machinery, footwear, and furniture are also significant in U.S.-Vietnam trade. Top U.S. exports to Vietnam include aircraft, cotton, and machinery. These product categories may become important touch points in bilateral trade relations. In 2017, electrical machinery became the leading import from Vietnam, while footwear also rose in import ranking. There is a connection between Vietnam's top exports to the United States and the top U.S. exports to Vietnam, with significant cross-trade in various commodities like cotton, wood, and electrical machinery. Vietnam's electrical machinery exports to the United States have grown significantly since 2001, reaching over $11.0 billion in 2017. This sector shows great potential for growth due to Vietnam's skilled yet inexpensive workforce. Vietnamese officials aim to expand production of higher-valued consumer electronics as part of the nation's transition to a middle-income economy. Vietnam's focus on expanding exports of footwear and furniture to the United States has been successful, with footwear accounting for nearly 12% of total U.S. imports from Vietnam in 2017. Additionally, Vietnam has become the 4th largest source of furniture and bedding imports for the United States, surpassing countries like Italy and Taiwan. The United States also maintains a trade surplus in services with Vietnam, particularly in financial services. In 2016, the United States exported $2.2 billion in services to Vietnam and imported $1.2 billion. Vietnam has committed to liberalizing various sectors including financial services, telecommunications, and distribution services. Vietnam licensed 2,613 foreign direct investment projects in 2016, with South Korea being the leading source of FDI. The United States was the 13th largest source of FDI with 65 projects worth $430 million. The accumulated value of FDI in Vietnam from 1989-2016 is $293.7 billion, with South Korea as the leading investor. The United States had 817 projects worth $10.1 billion, impacting possible BIT negotiations. U.S. companies investing in Vietnam may lead to more business disagreements and pressure on Congress. Prospects for U.S-Vietnam trade relations depend on bilateral trade growth and resolving challenges like U.S. catfish regulations. U.S. imports from Vietnam increased by 5.2% according to the USITC. President Trump issued Executive Order 13796 addressing trade agreement violations and abuses, requiring comprehensive performance reviews of trade relations with countries like Vietnam. The Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018 (H.R. 2) introduced in April 2018 includes no provisions regarding catfish regulations. The Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018 (H.R. 2) introduced in April 2018 does not address the catfish inspection program. Senators McCain and Shaheen urged the Trump Administration to end the program, citing it as a trade barrier against Asian catfish imports. It is uncertain if the Senate version of the 2018 Farm Bill will tackle this issue. Trade data between the United States and Vietnam is provided in the table below."
