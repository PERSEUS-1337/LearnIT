During the winter of Valley Forge in 1777-1778, the Continental Army struggled to recruit enough men. Rhode Island, facing British occupation in Newport, was ordered to supply two battalions. General Washington requested help from Rhode Island in recruiting men for the Continental Line. The Rhode Island General Assembly voted on February 14, 1778, to allow the enlistment of able-bodied slaves. Any enlisted slave passing muster before Colonel Christopher Greene would be immediately discharged from servitude and be free. Between February and June 1778, almost 200 men of African and Native American descent were recruited by Greene, Olney, and Ward for the First Rhode Island Regiment, one of the first units in American History to recruit men of every race and ethnicity. At the Battle of Rhode Island on August 28, 1778, the regiment faced British forces in Newport. During the Battle of Rhode Island, the First Rhode Island Regiment bravely held back Hessian forces, causing them to retreat. Their losses included three killed, nine wounded, and eleven missing soldiers. Over the next 5 years, the regiment fought in various battles for American independence before being demobilized at Saratoga in 1783. Colonel Jeremiah Olney praised the regiment for their fortitude and patience throughout the long and severe war. After the Battle of Rhode Island, the First Rhode Island Regiment resisted re-enslavement and fought for back wages from the Rhode Island General Assembly. The regiment included soldiers such as Babcock, Bent, Bours, Brown, Burk, Burroughs, Carpenter, Champlin, Clark, Coddington, Fones, Gardner, Gray, Green, Greene, and Hammond.
