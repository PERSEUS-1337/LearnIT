    "content": "The United States has been actively developing hypersonic weapons for its conventional prompt global strike program since the early 2000s, focusing on glide vehicles and cruise missiles for regional conflicts. Both the Pentagon and Congress are increasingly interested in these programs due to the strategic threat posed by hypersonic flight, driven by advancements in Russia and China. China and Russia have conducted successful tests of hypersonic glide vehicles and are expected to have operational capabilities by 2020. The United States is working on developing hypersonic weapons for its conventional prompt global strike program, with a focus on glide vehicles and cruise missiles. There is disagreement among experts on the impact of competitor hypersonic weapons on strategic stability and the U.S. military's competitive advantage. The U.S. is unlikely to have an operational system before 2023, unlike Russia and China who are expected to have capabilities by 2020. The U.S. is not currently considering or developing hypersonic weapons for use with a nuclear warhead. The United States is developing hypersonic weapons for its conventional prompt global strike program, focusing on glide vehicles and cruise missiles. There is debate on the impact of competitor hypersonic weapons on strategic stability and the U.S. military's advantage. The U.S. is expected to have operational systems by 2023, later than Russia and China. The U.S. is not currently working on hypersonic weapons with nuclear warheads.

It also discusses the implications for congressional authorizations, appropriations, and oversight. The report provides information on the programs and infrastructure in each nation and the state of global hypersonic weapons research development. It concludes with a discussion of issues Congress may address regarding DOD's funding requests for U.S. hypersonic technology. The report delivered to Congress in July 2019 reviews hypersonic weapons programs in the United States, Russia, and China, based on unclassified sources. It discusses the implications for congressional authorizations, appropriations, and oversight, as well as the state of global hypersonic weapons research development. General John Hyten highlights the potential of hypersonic weapons for long-range, responsive strike options against various threats. Hypersonic weapons offer long-range strike options against threats, challenging detection and defense due to speed and maneuverability. Terrestrial radar has delayed detection, compressing response timelines and allowing for potentially only one intercept attempt. Some analysts suggest integrating space-based sensor layers with tracking systems for defending against hypersonic weapons in the future, despite challenges in affordability and technological feasibility. The Department of Defense is developing hypersonic weapons under the Navy's Conventional Prompt Strike program, aiming to enhance the U.S. military's strike capabilities. Analysts highlight challenges in defending against hypersonic missiles due to limitations in current defense systems and command and control infrastructure. The U.S. military is developing hypersonic weapons through the Strike program to enhance its strike capabilities and deterrence. Unlike China and Russia, the U.S. is not developing hypersonic weapons for use with nuclear warheads, which will require greater accuracy and technical challenges to develop. The United States is developing major offensive hypersonic weapons and technology programs, including U.S. Navy's Conventional Prompt Strike, U.S. Army's Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon, U.S. Air Force's AGM-183 Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon, DARPA's Tactical Boost Glide, Operational Fires, and Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept. These programs aim to produce operational prototypes as there are currently no programs of record for hypersonic weapons. The U.S. is developing hypersonic weapons programs with funding in Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation accounts. The Navy is leading the development of a common glide vehicle adapted from an Army prototype. Sandia National Laboratories will build the common glide vehicles, with booster systems developed separately. The Navy's Conventional Prompt Strike is expected to achieve initial operational capability on a Virginia-class submarine in FY2028, with a request for $1 billion. The Navy is requesting $1 billion for the Conventional Prompt Strike program in FY2021, with an increase of $415 million over the previous year. The Army's Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon program aims to pair a common glide vehicle with the Navy's booster system, with a budget of $801 million in FY2021. Flight tests for LRHW are planned from FY2021 to FY2023, with a transition to a program of record in the fourth year. The AGM-183 Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW) is expected to transition to a program of record in the fourth quarter of FY2024. It leverages DARPA's Tactical Boost Glide technology to develop a hypersonic glide vehicle prototype capable of speeds up to Mach 20 and a range of 575 miles. Despite testing delays, ARRW completed a successful flight test in June 2019 and is expected to complete more tests in FY2022. The Air Force has requested increased funding for ARRW, with $382 million in FY2021 and $581 million across the FYDP. ARRW is part of the Air Force's Hypersonics Prototyping Program Element. In February 2020, the Air Force cancelled its Hypersonic Conventional Strike Weapon (HCSW) program due to budget pressures, choosing to focus on the more advanced AGM-183 Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW). ARRW offers more options, is smaller, and can be carried in larger numbers on aircraft like the B-52. DARPA and the Air Force are testing Tactical Boost Glide, a hypersonic glide vehicle capable of Mach 7+ flight, to enable future hypersonic boost glide systems. DARPA is developing air-launched hypersonic boost glide systems, including the Tactical Boost Glide (TBG) and Operational Fires (OpFires) programs. TBG aims for compatibility with the Navy Vertical Launch System and has a budget of $117 million for FY2021. OpFires seeks to penetrate enemy air defenses with a ground-launched system and has a budget of $40 million for FY2021. DARPA is also working on the Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept with Air Force support. DARPA is developing air-launched hypersonic boost glide systems like Tactical Boost Glide (TBG) and Operational Fires (OpFires). The Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC) aims to develop an affordable air-launched hypersonic cruise missile. HAWC could launch from a wider range of platforms and integrate seekers more easily than hypersonic glide vehicles. DARPA requested $7 million for HAWC in FY2021. DOD is also investing in counter-hypersonic weapons capabilities, but a defensive capability against hypersonic weapons is not expected until the mid-2020s. The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) commissioned 21 white papers to explore hypersonic missile defense options, including interceptor missiles, hypervelocity projectiles, laser guns, and electronic attack systems. In January 2020, MDA issued a draft request for prototype proposals for a Hypersonic Defense Regional Glide Phase Weapons System interceptor. MDA awarded four companies with $20 million contracts to design prototype space-based sensors by October 31, 2020 to extend the range at which incoming missiles could be detected. The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is investing in hypersonic missile defense technology, with a focus on extending the range for detecting and tracking incoming missiles. DARPA is also working on a program called Glide Breaker to develop technology for engaging hypersonic threats at long range. The United States has critical hypersonic test facilities and assets to support the development of hypersonic technologies for defense systems. The United States has critical hypersonic test facilities and assets to support the development of hypersonic technologies for defense systems through 2030. These facilities simulate unique conditions experienced in hypersonic flight and include various DOD, NASA, Department of Energy, and industry/academic facilities. However, no current U.S. facility can provide full-scale, time-dependent aerodynamic and thermal-loading environments above Mach 8. Recent developments include the opening of a Mach 6 hypersonic wind tunnel at the University of Notre Dame and the inactivation of at least one hypersonic testing facility. Additionally, Mach 8 and Mach 10 wind tunnels are being developed at Purdue University and the University of. Development of Mach 8 and Mach 10 wind tunnels at Purdue University and the University of Notre Dame is ongoing. The University of Arizona plans to modify a wind tunnel for Mach 5 testing by early 2021, while Texas A&M University, in partnership with Army Futures Command, plans to complete a kilometer-long Mach 10 wind tunnel by 2021. The U.S. also utilizes test ranges in Australia and Norway for flight testing, and the Navy is reactivating a Launch Test Complex for improved testing capabilities. Additionally, a \"hypersonic war room\" has been established to assess the U.S. industrial base for hypersonic weapons. Russia has accelerated its efforts in hypersonic weapons technology in response to U.S. missile defense deployments and the withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. President Putin expressed concerns about the growth of anti-ballistic missiles, leading Russia to seek hypersonic weapons for assured defense. Russia is developing hypersonic weapons like the Avangard and 3M22 Tsirkon to penetrate U.S. missile defenses. The Avangard is a hypersonic glide vehicle with unlimited range, launched from an ICBM and carrying a nuclear warhead. It has been successfully tested multiple times, reaching speeds of Mach 20. In December 2019, Avangard entered combat duty, while Russia is also developing Tsirkon, a hypersonic cruise missile with speeds between Mach 6 and Mach 8. Tsirkon can strike ground and naval targets with a range of 250-600 miles and is launched from various platforms. U.S. intelligence reports suggest Tsirkon will be operational by 2023, alongside the already fielded Kinzhal missile. Russia has fielded the Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missile, successfully test-fired from a MiG-31 fighter, with a top speed of Mach 10 and a range of up to 1,200 miles. It is expected to be combat-ready by 2020 and deployed on various platforms, including the Su-34 fighter and Tu-22M3 bomber. The Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missile, capable of maneuverable flight and striking ground and naval targets, may be fitted with a nuclear warhead. Russia conducts hypersonic testing at various facilities and has tested hypersonic weapons at different locations. Experts prioritize hypersonic technology development to counter security threats from advanced U.S. military technology. China is concerned about U.S. hypersonic weapons technology and is closely following Russian advancements in this area. This could potentially impact China's ability to retaliate against a U.S. strike. China is developing hypersonic weapons, including HGVs mated with ballistic missiles for anti-access/area denial. They are testing the DF-17 and DF-41 missiles, with the latter increasing the nuclear threat to the U.S. mainland. China has not decided whether these weapons will be nuclear- or conventionally-armed. China's rocket force poses a nuclear threat to the U.S. mainland with the DF-ZF hypersonic glide vehicle, tested nine times since 2014. U.S. officials believe it may be operational by 2020. China also tested the Starry Sky-2 hypersonic vehicle in 2018, capable of Mach 6 speeds and maneuvers, potentially operational by 2025. China has a robust research and development infrastructure for hypersonic weapons, conducting numerous tests compared to the United States. China tested three hypersonic vehicle models in September 2018, aiming to develop weapons with variable speeds. They are also investing in hypersonic ground testing facilities and operating hypersonic wind tunnels. China operates multiple hypersonic wind tunnels, including the FD-02, FD-03, FD-07, JF-12, and FD-21, reaching speeds up to Mach 15. They are expected to have a tunnel reaching Mach 25 by 2020. China has tested hypersonic weapons at various satellite launch centers. Congress is reviewing the Pentagon's plans for U.S. hypersonic weapons programs, considering costs and implications for strategic stability and arms control. The Department of Defense is funding hypersonic weapons programs without established programs of record. DOD has not decided to acquire hypersonic weapons but is developing prototypes to identify viable weapon system concepts. Congress may seek information on DOD's evaluation of mission sets, cost analysis, and enabling technologies for hypersonic weapons. The Department of Defense is prioritizing offensive hypersonic weapon programs and developing a robust defensive strategy. In FY2021, $206.8 million was allocated for hypersonic defense programs out of a total $3.2 billion request for all hypersonic-related research. Congress has expressed concerns about the rapid growth in hypersonic research funding. The joint explanatory statement of H.R. 1158 highlights concerns about the rapid growth in hypersonic research funding and the potential for duplicated capabilities and increased costs. To address this, $100 million was appropriated for the Department of Defense to establish a Joint Hypersonic Transition Office for integrated science and technology roadmap development and a university consortium for research and workforce development. Congress may find it challenging to evaluate the balance of funding for hypersonic weapons programs, enabling technologies, test infrastructure, and missile defense due to the lack of defined mission requirements. Analysts are divided on the strategic implications of hypersonic weapons, with some noting the short time-of-flight as a factor with significant implications for strategic stability. The weapon's short time-of-flight and unpredictable flight path could lead to uncertainty about its intended target, increasing the risk of miscalculation or unintended escalation in conflicts. This risk is heightened in countries with both nuclear and conventional capabilities. Analysts warn of unintended escalation due to warhead ambiguity and the difficulty in distinguishing between conventionally armed and nuclear-armed hypersonic weapons. The United Nations report highlights that even if a State knows a hypersonic glide vehicle is conventionally armed, it may still perceive it as a strategic threat and respond accordingly. Some analysts argue that hypersonic weapons may not significantly change the strategic balance or military capability, as countries like China and Russia already possess intercontinental ballistic missiles that can overwhelm U.S. defenses. Traditional deterrence principles still apply to hypersonic weapons. Some analysts believe that hypersonic weapons may not alter the strategic balance as countries like China and Russia already have intercontinental ballistic missiles. Traditional deterrence principles apply to hypersonic weapons. Suggestions to mitigate risks include expanding New START, negotiating new arms control agreements, and transparency measures. The New START Treaty does not cover hypersonic glide vehicles or cruise missiles. Some legal experts suggest including hypersonic weapons in the New START limits through the Bilateral Consultative Commission. Alternatively, analysts propose a new arms control agreement with a test ban on hypersonic weapons to prevent an arms race and maintain strategic stability. Some analysts argue that a test ban on hypersonic weapons may not be feasible due to the technical difficulty in distinguishing them from other conventional capabilities. Instead, they suggest implementing transparency measures like exchanging weapons data, conducting joint studies, providing advance notices of tests, using separate launch locations, and restricting sea-based tests."
