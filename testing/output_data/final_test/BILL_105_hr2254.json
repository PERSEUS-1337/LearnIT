    "content": "Section 1 introduces a new section in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 regarding qualified equity investments in community development financial institutions. The new section in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 introduces the community development financial institution investment credit, where taxpayers can claim a credit for qualified equity investments made in such institutions. The applicable percentage for the credit is 25%, or a lower percentage set by the CDFI Fund. Qualified equity investment refers to stock or partnership interest in a CDFI as defined in the Community Development Banking and Financial Institutions Act of 1994. The CDFI Fund designates institutions for the community development financial institution investment credit. Taxpayers can claim a credit for qualified equity investments in these institutions, acquired at original issue in exchange for money or property. Designations are made based on criteria established by the CDFI Fund. The CDFI Fund sets criteria for the community development financial institution investment credit, with a limit of $100,000,000 for allocated credit amounts. Taxpayers must recapture the credit if they dispose of the investment within 5 years. Taxpayers must recapture the community development financial institution investment credit if the investment is disposed of within 5 years, resulting in an increase in tax for the taxable year of disposition. Exceptions apply to certain gifts, transfers, or transactions. The community development financial institution investment credit is not considered a tax for determining credits or the tax amount under section 55. The basis of a qualified equity investment is reduced by the credit amount. Regulations will be prescribed for credit recapture if institutions no longer meet criteria. This section does not apply to investments made after December 31, 2006. The community development financial institution investment credit is added to the general business credit under section 38 of the Code. Special rules are established for this credit, including a reduction in the basis of qualified equity investments. Regulations will address credit recapture if institutions no longer qualify. This provision does not apply to investments made after December 31, 2006. In the case of the community development financial institution investment credit, section 39 shall be applied separately with respect to the credit. 75 percent of the tentative minimum tax shall be substituted for the tentative minimum tax under subparagraph (A) thereof, and the limitation under paragraph (1) shall be reduced by the credit allowed under subsection (a). The text discusses the community development financial institution investment credit and a conforming amendment to the tax code. It also mentions a limitation on carryback for the credit. The tax code is amended to include a new paragraph regarding the community development financial institution investment credit. Additionally, a deduction for the unused credit is added, and a clerical amendment is made to the table of sections. The tax code is amended to include a new paragraph regarding the community development financial institution investment credit in part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1. The tax code is amended to include a new paragraph on qualified equity investments in community development financial institutions, with the amendments applying to investments made after the enactment of the Act."
