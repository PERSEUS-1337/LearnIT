The Energy Consumers Relief Act of 2013 defines key terms such as \"Administrator,\" \"Covered energy-related rule,\" and \"Direct costs.\" The Administrator refers to the head of the EPA, while a covered energy-related rule regulates energy production with costs exceeding $1 billion. The Energy Consumers Relief Act of 2013 defines key terms such as \"Administrator,\" \"Covered energy-related rule,\" and \"Direct costs.\" Indirect costs, rule, and Secretary are also defined in the document of the Environmental Protection Agency and title 5 of the United States Code. The Energy Consumers Relief Act of 2013 prohibits finalizing energy-related rules causing significant adverse effects on the economy. The Secretary must determine the rule's impact before it can be promulgated. Before finalizing any covered energy-related rule, the Administrator must conduct specific activities and submit a report to Congress. The report must include a copy of the rule, a concise statement about the rule, total costs, benefits, expected realization of benefits, and details about modeling, assumptions, and limitations. The Secretary, in consultation with relevant agencies, must provide an analysis on potential energy price increases and employment effects resulting from the implementation of a covered energy-related rule. This analysis includes estimates on energy price increases for consumers, details on job losses and shifts in employment, and impacts on low-income households, small businesses, and manufacturers. The Secretary must analyze the potential impacts of a covered energy-related rule on energy prices, employment, low-income households, small businesses, and manufacturers. If adverse effects are determined, the Secretary will consult with relevant agencies to address the impacts. The Small Business Administration must assess if a rule will have significant adverse effects on the economy, considering costs, benefits, and impacts on economic indicators. Results of the assessment must be published in the Federal Register."
