    "content": "The \"Residential Solar Energy Act of 2001\" is cited as the short title. It introduces a credit for holders of residential solar energy bonds under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Residential Solar Energy Act of 2001 introduces a tax credit for taxpayers holding Residential Solar Energy Bonds. The credit amount is 25 percent of the annual credit determined for the bond. The tax credit for Residential Solar Energy Bonds is calculated based on the applicable credit rate and the outstanding face amount of the bond. The applicable credit rate is determined by the average market yield on long-term corporate debt obligations. If a bond is issued within a 3-month period ending on a credit allowance date, the credit amount is prorated based on the portion of the period it was held. The tax credit for Residential Solar Energy Bonds is determined based on the portion of the 3-month period during which the bond is outstanding. A similar rule applies when the bond is redeemed. A Residential Solar Energy Bond is defined as a bond issued by a qualified utility where 95% or more of the proceeds are used for qualified solar energy loans, the bond term does not exceed 15 years, and the issuer designates it for this purpose. The term 'qualified solar energy loan' refers to interest-free loans for purchasing and installing photovoltaic cells on qualified residential properties. Conditions include excess electricity being transmitted for others' use, metering of net electricity, and receiving credits for future electricity consumption. The term 'qualified solar energy loan' refers to interest-free loans for purchasing and installing photovoltaic cells on qualified residential properties. The loan amount is payable in equal installments over 15 years and must be used for its intended purpose under a program specified by the utility. A 'qualified utility' is any entity engaged in the sale of electrical energy. The term 'qualified residential property' refers to single-family or multi-family residences. There is a national Residential Solar Energy Bond limitation of $24,000,000,000 allocated among utilities. The Secretary of Energy allocates Energy Bond limitations to qualified utilities from 2002 to 2005, prioritizing those providing subsidies for photovoltaic cell installations. Unused allocations can be reallocated within 6 months. The tax credit for residential solar energy systems is limited based on the amount of tax. The tax credit for residential solar energy systems is limited based on the regular tax liability plus the tax imposed by section 55, minus the credits allowable under part IV of subchapter A. Any excess credit can be carried over to the next taxable year. The term 'credit allowance date' is defined as March 15 or June 15 for this section. The term 'date' refers to specific quarterly dates, including March 15, June 15, September 15, and December 15, for bond obligations. The definition of 'bond' encompasses any obligation. Gross income includes the credit allowed under this section, treated as interest income. Special rules allow temporary investment of bond proceeds for qualified solar energy loans without failing requirements. During a temporary period, earnings on proceeds from qualified solar energy loans are treated as proceeds of the issue. Principal repayments can be used to make qualified solar energy loans, redeem residential solar energy bonds, or acquire zero interest State and local government series bonds without failing requirements. During a temporary period, earnings on proceeds from qualified solar energy loans are treated as proceeds of the issue. Principal repayments can be used to make qualified solar energy loans, redeem residential solar energy bonds, or acquire zero interest State and local government series bonds without failing requirements. Any bond issued as part of the issue financing the loan being repaid must be outstanding. If so, the loan does not need to be interest-free after the last day. Special rules apply to bonds held by regulated investment companies, allowing shareholders to claim the credit. Ownership of a Residential Solar Energy Bond and entitlement to the credit can be separated under regulations. The credit under this section for a Residential Solar Energy Bond can be separated, with the credit allowed to the holder of the instrument evidencing the entitlement. Rules similar to stripped bonds apply, and for estimated tax purposes, the credit is considered for holding the bond. The credit for holding a Residential Solar Energy Bond can be transferred and is treated as a payment of estimated tax. Issuers must submit reports similar to section 149(e) requirements. If a bond no longer meets the qualifications, the issuer must repay a portion of the credit to the United States. If the issuer fails to pay the required amount for a Residential Solar Energy Bond, the tax on bond holders will increase. The increase is based on the decrease in credits allowed for the past three years. The tax for the taxable year will be increased under special rules if credits allowed by this section were used to reduce tax liability. Any increase in tax shall not be considered a tax imposed by this chapter for determining credits or tax amounts. The tax for the taxable year may increase under special rules if credits from this section were used to reduce tax liability. Reporting requirements for interest on residential solar energy bonds are amended under section 6049 of the tax code. The Secretary may prescribe regulations for paragraph application without certain subparagraphs. Regulatory authority allows for detailed reporting requirements. Conforming amendment to the tax code for residential solar energy bonds reporting. The amendments made by this section apply to obligations issued after December 31, 2001. Guidelines for approving applications under section 30B(d)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 will be developed by the Secretary of Energy by January 1, 2002."
