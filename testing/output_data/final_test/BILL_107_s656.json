    "content": "The Act may be referred to as the \"Liberian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act of 2001\". Adjustment of status is addressed in the Act. The Attorney General can adjust the status of eligible aliens to that of a lawful permanent resident if they apply before April 1, 2003, and meet other criteria, excluding certain grounds for inadmissibility. An alien may not be eligible for adjustment of status if convicted of certain crimes under the Immigration and Nationality Act. Despite previous orders, an alien present in the US can still apply for adjustment of status. An alien present in the US, despite previous orders, can apply for adjustment of status under the Immigration and Nationality Act. If the application is granted, the order will be canceled; if denied, the order remains effective. This provision applies to nationals of Liberia who have been continuously present in the US. An alien in the US can apply for adjustment of status under the Immigration and Nationality Act if continuously present from January 1, 2001. Continuous physical presence is not affected by absences totaling up to 180 days. The Attorney General will regulate the stay of removal for aliens with final orders. The regulation allows aliens with final deportation orders to seek a stay based on an application for adjustment of status. The Attorney General cannot order removal if an alien has applied for adjustment of status, except if the application is denied. Aliens applying for adjustment of status may be authorized to work in the US. Upon approval of an alien's application for adjustment of status under subsection (a), the Attorney General shall establish a record of the alien's admission for permanent residence as of the date of the alien's arrival in the United States. The Attorney General shall provide applicants with the same right to administrative review as provided to others. (a) Aliens have the same right to administrative review as applicants for adjustment of status under the Immigration and Nationality Act. \n(f) The Attorney General's decision on adjusting an alien's status under this section is final and not subject to court review. \n(g) When an alien is granted permanent residence status, the Secretary of State is not required to reduce the number of immigrant visas available. \n(h) Provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act apply. The Immigration and Nationality Act provisions apply to the administration of this section, preserving the Attorney General's authority. Eligibility for permanent residence status under this section does not prevent an alien from seeking it under other laws."
