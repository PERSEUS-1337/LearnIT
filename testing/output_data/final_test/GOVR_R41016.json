    "content": "The Vision for Space Exploration, announced in 2004, directed NASA to focus on returning humans to the Moon by 2020 and eventually sending them to Mars and beyond. Efforts are now reaching milestones such as the end of the space shuttle program and design reviews for new spacecraft. In 2009, the Obama Administration initiated a high-level independent review of the future of human space flight chaired by Norman R. Augustine. The Augustine committee conducted a high-level independent review of the future of human space flight, identifying barriers to the Vision for Space Exploration and proposing alternatives. Congress appropriated FY2010 funds for NASA at the President's original request level, stating that significant program changes should await a bona fide proposal. The Administration proposed changes to NASA's Vision for Space Exploration in its FY2011 budget, including canceling the human return to the Moon and the Constellation spacecraft program. The 111th Congress did not pass a regular FY2011 appropriations bill for NASA, leading to uncertainty about the program's future. The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 mandates changes for NASA, including developing a new heavy-lift rocket and commercial crew transportation services. Operating under a continuing resolution may limit NASA's ability to implement these changes. If the continuing resolution is extended through FY2011 without changes to Constellation, NASA may have to spend $575 million on activities it would otherwise not pursue. Fiscal constraints could hinder future appropriations matching NASA's budget growth. Congress faces questions on NASA's purpose, goal prioritization, and balancing broad objectives. NASA is facing questions on how to balance its major programs in human spaceflight, robotic spaceflight, aeronautics research, and education. The agency must decide on priorities for exploration of the Moon, Mars, or other destinations, as well as for its science and aeronautics programs. The report also considers the need for new space vehicles and the future of existing programs like the space shuttle and the International Space Station. Additionally, it addresses cross-cutting issues such as NASA's interactions with other federal agencies and the role of the commercial space industry. During the Eisenhower Administration, the President's Science and Advisory Committee identified reasons for a national space program, including exploration, defense, enhancing prestige, and scientific observation. Analysts today also see economic benefits and technological spinoffs from space program developments. The goals of the U.S. space program include economic benefits, international collaboration, and promoting STEM education. Policy makers debate how to balance these objectives and whether space exploration should prioritize discovery or meeting Earthly needs. Congress's priorities will determine how NASA's programs are managed. Congress's priorities will determine how NASA's programs are managed, with options including emphasizing national prestige through human exploration, scientific knowledge through unmanned missions, international relations through joint space activities, or economic benefits through technological development. The National Academies recommended using three criteria to balance these competing demands for resources. NASA's programs should be maintained for sustained progress with stability and robustness. Rapid downsizing and abrupt redirection should be avoided to prevent disruptions and risks. The agency has programs in human spaceflight, science, aeronautics, and education, with human spaceflight facing uncertainty. The National Academies recommended criteria to balance competing demands for resources. The Vision for Space Exploration, announced by President Bush in 2004, directed NASA to focus on returning humans to the Moon by 2020 and eventually sending them to Mars. NASA was also tasked with returning the space shuttle to flight status, completing the International Space Station, and concluding U.S. participation in the ISS by 2015. President Bush established a Commission to advise NASA on implementing the Vision. President Bush established a Commission on the Implementation of U.S. Space Exploration Policy, chaired by Edward C. \"Pete\" Aldridge, Jr. The Aldridge Commission issued its report in June 2004. NASA established an Exploration Systems Architecture Study (ESAS) in April 2005 to identify a strategy for implementing the Vision. The ESAS issued its final report in November 2005, serving as the baseline for NASA's space exploration plans until 2010. Congress endorsed the Vision in the NASA Authorization Act of 2005, setting milestones for returning to the Moon by 2020. The NASA Authorization Act of 2008 reaffirmed the Vision's goals for human exploration, including the return to the Moon and missions to other solar system destinations. It emphasized inviting America's allies to participate and using a stepping stone approach for lunar exploration activities. Plans for a lunar outpost should not require continuous occupation, and commercial services should be utilized to the maximum extent practicable. The NASA Authorization Act of 2008 outlined plans to retire the space shuttle, rely on non-U.S. vehicles for human access to space, terminate U.S. use of the International Space Station by 2015, and develop new systems for space exploration under the Constellation program. This included the Ares I rocket, Orion crew capsule, Ares V heavy-lift rocket, Altair lunar lander, and lunar surface systems. The NASA Authorization Act of 2008 outlined plans to retire the space shuttle and develop new systems for space exploration under the Constellation program, including the Ares I rocket, Orion crew capsule, Ares V heavy-lift rocket, Altair lunar lander, and lunar surface systems. The 2010 authorization act extended U.S. use of the International Space Station through at least 2020 and replaced Constellation with programs to develop commercial services for launching astronauts into low Earth orbit, a multipurpose crew vehicle, and a new heavy-lift rocket. NASA's Vision for Space Exploration faced funding constraints under the continuing resolution, with cost playing a central role in decision-making. The original plan proposed a limited budget increase, which was later reduced by subsequent administrations and Congress. Funding for the Vision was redirected from other NASA activities, such as the space shuttle program, with no overall cost estimate provided by NASA. The Vision for Space Exploration faced funding constraints, with cost being a central factor. Estimates for human exploration capabilities projected costs of $64 billion up to the first human return to the Moon in 2004. However, the actual cost was expected to be higher. NASA's 2005 plan estimated a cost of $104 billion for returning astronauts to the Moon, excluding robotic missions and ISS servicing. The Government Accountability Office estimated the total cost of the Vision at $230 billion over two decades in 2007. The Congressional Budget Office later updated its analysis in 2009, stating that NASA would need an additional $2 billion per year through FY2025 to stay on schedule. In October 2009, the Augustine report highlighted the need for an extra $3 billion annually to execute NASA's plans, even with potential schedule delays. The report also mentioned that maintaining the planned budget could be achieved by delaying the return to the Moon by three years. The report raised concerns about the viability of human exploration beyond low-Earth orbit under NASA's budget plans at the time, suggesting a potential delay in returning to the Moon until the 2030s. Schedule delays were already evident, with the initial operating capability for Orion and Ares I pushed back from 2012 to 2015, with a more likely target of 2017 according to the Augustine committee. The Augustine committee suggested a potential delay in returning to the Moon until the 2030s due to budget concerns. Some analysts questioned the choice of the Moon as NASA's human exploration destination, citing cost, lack of inspiration, and scientific rationale. Supporters argued that the Moon could serve as a stepping stone for future missions and is of great scientific interest. Missions to the Moon would test technologies and provide space experience. Advocates see the Moon as a staging point for future missions. Congress was motivated by national security and prestige to reestablish a U.S. presence. Completing the Vision for NASA was important for direction and public support. NASA planned to end the space shuttle program in 2010 to fund the Vision and address safety concerns after the Columbia disaster in 2003. The construction of the ISS was completed, with the program ending in 2011 instead of 2010 due to delays. The gap between the end of the shuttle program and the readiness of its successors, Orion and Ares I, raised concerns about U.S. access to space. Russian spacecraft will be the only means of access to the ISS for humans during the gap, while alternatives are being considered for cargo. Former NASA Administrator Michael Griffin criticized the gap as \"unseemly in the extreme.\" The Review of U.S. Human Spaceflight Plans Committee, chaired by Norman R. Augustine, was chartered in 2009 to address concerns about the gap in access to the ISS after the end of the shuttle program. The committee included members from various backgrounds and reported to NASA and the Office of Science and Technology Policy. The committee's charter defined its scope and objectives as conducting an independent review of U.S. human space flight plans and programs to ensure safe, innovative, affordable, and sustainable trajectories. It aimed to identify options for continuing U.S. human space flight activities beyond the Space Shuttle retirement, including supporting ISS utilization, missions to the Moon and beyond, stimulating commercial space flight capability, and fitting within NASA's budget. The committee's final report in October 2009 identified five options for NASA exploration activities, including options within the current budget profile and those requiring an additional $3 billion per year. Developing Ares I, Orion, and other Constellation systems may take longer than planned, leading to expected delays in the proposed options. NASA plans include two options for future exploration activities. Option 1 involves modifying the current program to fund space shuttle flights in FY2011 and deorbiting the International Space Station in FY2016. The first crewed flight of Ares I and Orion is expected no earlier than 2017. Ares V availability is delayed until the late 2020s, with insufficient funds for lunar surface systems until the 2030s. Option 2 extends the International Space Station's use to 2020 and initiates lunar exploration using Ares V Lite, along with developing commercial services for transporting humans into low Earth orbit. Option 3: Additional Budget, Current Program, modified to fund space shuttle flights in FY2011 and deorbit the International Space Station in FY2016. Ares I and Orion crewed flight delayed until after ISS deorbit, with potential human lunar return in mid-2020s. Variant 4A of Option 4: Additional Budget, Extend Space Station, Explore Moon First, extends ISS use to 2020 and utilizes commercial services for low Earth orbit transport, focusing on Moon exploration. Option 5 proposes extending the International Space Station to 2020 and using commercial services for low Earth orbit transport. Missions beyond Earth orbit would follow a \"flexible path\" to distant destinations, with a lunar landing possible by the mid to late 2020s. Variant 5A involves the Ares V Lite, while Variant 5B utilizes a commercial heavy-lift rocket. The committee's report did not recommend a specific launch vehicle option but highlighted the need for additional funding for a viable exploration program beyond the current budget profile. Options 3, 4, and 5 were deemed necessary for an exploration program that would be a source of pride for the nation and provide a significant return on investment. The extension of the International Space Station's life is crucial for enhancing partnerships with states and international partners. Commercial services for launching crews into Earth orbit are feasible and could offer cost advantages. Ares V Lite is considered the most capable heavy-lift alternative. The shuttle-derived vehicle Variant 4B, extending the space shuttle's operation to 2015, is seen as the best option to eliminate the need for a new heavy-lift vehicle. The Augustine committee identified key questions for the future of U.S. human spaceflight, including the fate of the space shuttle, the International Space Station, the next heavy-lift launch vehicle, crew transportation to low Earth orbit, and exploration beyond low Earth orbit. They emphasized the importance of extending the space shuttle's operation to 2015 as a way to bridge the gap in U.S. human-launch capability and suggested exploring the Moon first before aiming for Mars. The Obama Administration proposed cancelling the Constellation program and eliminating the return of humans to the Moon as NASA's primary goal. Instead, NASA would encourage the private sector to develop commercial space transportation services for human spaceflight beyond low Earth orbit. NASA's proposal under the Obama Administration aimed to cancel the Constellation program and shift focus to commercial space transportation services for human spaceflight beyond low Earth orbit. The International Space Station's operation would continue until at least 2020, with Mars as the ultimate goal for future human exploration. Congress and the public expressed concerns about the impact on aerospace industry employment and the lack of a specific destination and schedule for human space exploration. The media focused on the proposed cancellation of Constellation, with less notice of the programs that would replace it, such as increased technology development and stimulation of commercial space transportation services. Press accounts often reported the Administration's proposals as cutting NASA's budget, even though the proposed FY2011 budget for NASA was actually an increase over previous plans. Supporters of Constellation were concerned about its status during FY2010. NASA officials responded to concerns about the Constellation program's funding in FY2010, stating they were in compliance with the law despite plans to terminate the program in FY2011. GAO opinions supported NASA's actions, and in June 2010, NASA announced contract prioritization to avoid a $1 billion shortfall. President Obama addressed the program's future in a speech at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. In a speech at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, President Obama announced modifications to the FY2011 budget request proposals. These included continuing development of a modified Orion crew capsule for emergency escape capability to the International Space Station. The next human mission beyond Earth orbit would be to an asteroid in 2025, with subsequent missions to orbit Mars in the mid-2030s. NASA's increased technology efforts would focus on developing a new heavy-lift rocket for deep space exploration. In 2015, a decision was made on a heavy-lift rocket for deep space exploration. An Administration task force aimed to boost economic development in Florida's Space Coast. Congress passed the NASA Authorization Act of 2010, authorizing funding for NASA through FY2013 with changes in fund allocation. The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 reduced funding for certain elements of the human spaceflight program to allocate resources for the full Orion crew capsule and a new heavy-lift rocket. The 112th Congress will determine appropriations for the years covered by the act. The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 discusses the budget allocation for human spaceflight and unmanned science missions, including Earth science, planetary science, heliophysics, and astrophysics. Concerns about climate change have led to increased emphasis on Earth science, prompting NASA to create a separate Earth Science Division in 2006. The National Research Council recommended renewing investment in Earth observing systems in 2007. The United States increased funding for Earth science at NASA in response to recommendations to renew investment in Earth observing systems. Congress and the Administration allocated more funding for Earth science, including a $2.1 billion global climate initiative. The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 authorized these funding increases for FY2011 through FY2013, aiming for a balanced variety of R&D approaches in NASA's science program. The NASA Authorization Act of 2008 emphasized the importance of mission-enabling activities in the science program, including technology development, suborbital research, and research grants. Funding for planetary science technology has increased significantly, while Earth science technology funding has only slightly increased. Suborbital rocket operations funding saw an increase from $51 million in FY2008 to $66 million in FY2010. Funding for R&A grants at NASA has recovered, partly due to the Administration's initiatives and congressional action. The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 emphasized the importance of a balanced and adequately funded set of activities for a robust science program. The National Research Council recommended ways to improve mission-enabling activities through more active management. The NASA Authorization Acts of 2008 and 2005 mandated periodic reviews of NASA's science programs by the National Academies, known as decadal surveys. These reviews aim to improve mission-enabling activities and ensure transparency in budgets and objectives. The NASA Authorization Acts of 2008 and 2005 mandated periodic reviews of NASA's science programs by the National Academies, known as decadal surveys, to improve mission-enabling activities and ensure transparency in budgets and objectives. The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 directed NASA to implement missions identified by the Earth science decadal survey and consider space science decadal surveys in budget requests. The National Academies' expertise is primarily scientific, raising questions about the authority of their analysis on mission cost and readiness. NASA's largest activity after human spaceflight and science is aeronautics research. NASA's aeronautics programs focus on long-term R&D for reducing noise and emissions, improving safety, and air traffic control. Congress directed the President to develop a national policy for aeronautics R&D in 2005. The Science and Technology Council (NSTC) issued a national aeronautics R&D policy in December 2006, outlining goals for federal aeronautics activities and directing the NSTC to release a national aeronautics R&D plan every two years. The NASA Authorization Act of 2008 aligned NASA's aeronautics research program with the national policy. In 2006, the National Research Council released a decadal strategy for civil aeronautics activities, emphasizing NASA's research program and identifying 51 technology challenges. The report identified 51 technology challenges for aeronautics research at NASA for the next decade. Congress directed NASA to align its research program with these challenges and involve universities and external organizations. Independent cost and technical readiness assessments are mandated for the program. The aeronautics program faced challenges with shared facilities like wind tunnels and supercomputers. NASA's introduction of full-cost accounting in FY2004 led to increased costs due to facility expenses. In response, NASA established separate programs for testing and strategic capabilities assets. Balancing stewardship of aeronautics facilities with maintenance costs has been a struggle. In 2005, Congress directed NASA to create a separate account for funding aeronautics test facilities. The Aeronautics Science and Technology Subcommittee of the NSTC developed a national aeronautics research, development, test, and evaluation infrastructure plan to align with the national aeronautics R&D plan. Congress has ongoing interest in the relationship between NASA's aeronautics program and efforts by the FAA and DOD, including the development of the Next Generation Air Transportation System. NASA has been directed by Congress to align its Airspace Systems program with the objectives of the JPDO and NGATS. A National Academies review in 2008 found that NASA's education programs lack effectiveness and recommended the development of an evaluation plan to improve them. NASA's education programs, funded by the Office of Education, focus on coordination and oversight. Congress directed NASA to prepare a plan in response to recommendations for inclusion of education activities in operating directorates' programs. Unlike other federal agencies, NASA's education role is viewed as secondary to its primary efforts in spaceflight and science. Congress is generally supportive of NASA's education programs. NASA's education programs receive more funding from Congress than requested, leading to challenges in planning and managing a unified program. Concerns arise over the balance between human spaceflight and other NASA activities like science and aeronautics, with fears that funding redirection for exploration may impact other programs. Congress supports NASA's Vision for human exploration activities but emphasizes the need for balance. The NASA Authorization Acts of 2005 and 2008 directed NASA to maintain a balanced set of programs, including human space flight, aeronautics R&D, and scientific research. NASA Administrator Charles Bolden assured scientists in 2010 that the future of human spaceflight would not be funded at the expense of the science budget. Balancing these priorities requires addressing questions raised earlier. NASA's purpose is debated, with some prioritizing economic benefits while others emphasize national pride and inspiration. The space shuttle program, the only U.S. vehicle for human space travel, is set to end after remaining flights in 2011. There are calls to extend the program, but the balance between exploration and tangible benefits remains uncertain. The space shuttle program is scheduled to end, with advocates wanting to extend it but facing technical and management issues. Congress is focused on managing the transition of the shuttle workforce and facilities and addressing the gap in U.S. space access. The shuttles are aging systems with outdated technology, originally designed for cost-effectiveness but never achieving the projected flight rate. The projected cost savings for a second-generation reusable launch vehicle depended on a flight rate never achieved. NASA's attempts to develop a replacement for the shuttle were unsuccessful. After the Columbia disaster in 2003, NASA established the Columbia Accident Investigation Board to determine the causes and recommended 15 actions to make the shuttle safe for future flights. The Columbia Accident Investigation Board recommended replacing the aging space shuttle due to safety risks and outdated technology. NASA's Vision for Space Exploration in 2004 also pushed for the shuttle program's end to allocate funds for future missions. Despite safety risks and the need to reallocate funding, some policymakers and advocates want to extend the shuttle program. Options were proposed to extend it to 2015, with the NASA Authorization Act of 2010 allowing for an additional flight in 2011. Extending the program would pose challenges in cost, schedule, and safety as contracts for shuttle components have already expired. Some contracts for shuttle components have expired, leading to personnel layoffs. Reestablishing program capability will incur costs and delays, with potential growing as termination date nears. Recertification process post-Columbia Accident Investigation Board could be costly and time-consuming. Maintaining a continuous flight schedule might be difficult. Policy makers could choose to continue flying parallel to recertification, but risk political repercussions in case of another accident. The pending retirement of the space shuttle in 2010 was identified as an urgent issue during the 2009 presidential transition. NASA estimated that keeping the shuttle flying past 2010 would cost $2.5 billion to $4 billion per year. The transition of assets and personnel at the end of the shuttle program is a major challenge for NASA, as the workforce holds unique expertise and experience that would be difficult to reassemble. Maintaining key human spaceflight expertise and capabilities is a priority for NASA managers. The loss of the shuttle workforce will have a significant economic impact in certain communities. The pending retirement of the space shuttle in 2010 was a major challenge for NASA due to the unique expertise and experience of the workforce. The loss of specialized, well-paid employment will have a significant economic impact on certain communities. NASA's transition management plan outlines the post-shuttle transition timeline, organizational responsibilities, goals, and challenges. The program has a vast array of assets, facilities, equipment, and employees that need to be managed effectively. The Space Shuttle Program (SSP) employs over 2,000 civil servants and more than 15,000 contractor personnel. It also has over $12 billion in equipment acquisition value and $5.7 billion in facilities replacement cost. There are 1,200 active suppliers and Congress directed NASA to utilize SSP assets in developing new vehicles. NASA was directed by Congress to develop a strategy for minimizing job losses during the transition from the shuttle program to its successor, including workforce projections and actions taken by NASA and its contractors. Additionally, NASA was directed to submit a plan for the disposition of shuttles and associated hardware, establishing a Space Shuttle Transition Liaison Office to assist those affected. The Congress directed NASA to develop a strategy to minimize job losses during the transition from the shuttle program to its successor. This included workforce projections, actions by NASA and its contractors, and the establishment of a Space Shuttle Transition Liaison Office. NASA was also directed to analyze facilities and personnel made available by the shuttle program termination for other federal programs. Congress prohibited NASA from implementing reductions in force or involuntary separations without cause. The ISS is a space station with crew living space, laboratories, and solar arrays. Crews have occupied the ISS since 2000, with completion scheduled for 2011. NASA was directed to minimize job losses during the transition from the shuttle program. The International Space Station (ISS) completion was initially scheduled for 2011, with operations possibly continuing through 2022 according to NASA briefing charts in 2003. The U.S. utilization was planned to end after 2015 under the Vision announced in 2004, but the NASA Authorization Act of 2010 extended it through at least FY2020. The Intergovernmental Agreement on Space Station Cooperation, signed in 1998, governs international cooperation on the ISS among various countries including the United States, Russia, Japan, Canada, and others. The International Space Station (ISS) partnership includes Roskosmos, JAXA, CSA, and ESA, with a separate agreement with Brazil. Due to cost and schedule issues, the ISS's original multifunctional concept was downsized to primarily a laboratory. Russia joined in 1993, adding foreign policy goals. NASA's goals for the station by 2001 were world-class research, a permanent human presence in space, and accommodating all. The ISS program focused on long-term effects of space travel on human biology, leading to legislative actions to prioritize research. The NASA Authorization Act of 2005 mandated at least 15% of funds for non-exploration related research. NASA issued a research plan in 2006, describing R&D activities across six disciplinary areas and characterizing the ISS as a test-bed for future lunar missions. The ISS serves as a test-bed for future lunar missions, a flight analog for Mars missions, and a laboratory for research related to human space exploration. The National Academies expressed concern that the ISS no longer prioritizes fundamental biological and physical research. The 2005 authorization act allocated funds for non-exploration related research. The 2005 authorization act designated the U.S. portion of the ISS as a national laboratory, available for use by federal agencies and the private sector. NASA's plan stated that NASA's use of the ISS must have first priority, with non-NASA entities funding their use. The availability of cost-effective transportation services is crucial for the ISS to operate as a national laboratory. NASA established agreements for ISS use with federal agencies, private firms, and a university. NASA's plan for the ISS involves collaboration with federal agencies, private firms, and a university. The ISS is designated as a national laboratory, with a focus on education, biotechnologies, aerospace, and defense research. Half of the U.S. research capacity on the ISS is available for non-NASA use, managed through a nonprofit organization. The U.S. ISS components have a 15-year lifetime, with a managing organization to be selected in 2011. The U.S. ISS components were designed for a 15-year lifetime from the date of deployment, with the possibility of extension past February 2016. The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 extended operation and utilization of the ISS through at least FY2020, requiring a comprehensive review for spare and replacement parts. The extension of the ISS beyond its original 15-year design life poses technical challenges such as the inability to return failed parts to Earth for refurbishment after the conclusion of the shuttle program. New parts will need to be manufactured and sent up, but some ISS components may be too large for post-shuttle cargo alternatives. Recertifying components at the end of their design life is also a complex and costly process. The U.S. space shuttle and Russian Soyuz spacecraft are major vehicles for transporting crews and cargo to the ISS. The Soyuz serves as a \"lifeboat\" and must be replaced every six months. Paying Russia for Soyuz flights is the only short-term option for U.S. human access to the ISS. Congress extended a waiver to allow these payments until July 1, 2016. NASA's Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program is part of the plan to ensure cargo access to the ISS during the gap. The Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program aims to develop commercial cargo spaceflight capabilities. SpaceX is working on the Dragon vehicle, while Orbital Sciences is developing Cygnus. Dragon can return cargo to Earth and launch it into space, with a successful test flight in December 2010. Cygnus has not flown yet. Congress directed NASA to create a contingency plan for post-shuttle cargo resupply of the ISS in 2008. Other noncommercial options for cargo include the European ATV and the Russian Progress. The European Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) and the Japanese H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV) are noncommercial alternatives for cargo resupply to the ISS. Contracting with Russia for the Progress would require passing an additional waiver. These options have smaller cargo capacity than the space shuttle and cannot return cargo to Earth. The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 also authorized the development of commercial crew transportation services. Under the NASA Authorization Act of 2010, new vehicles will be needed for crew transportation services to the ISS. Options include the crew capsule Orion, Ares I rocket, Ares V rocket, multipurpose crew vehicle, space launch system, and commercial services for low Earth orbit. These alternatives provide backup options in case commercial services are not available. Development of Orion and Ares I is progressing well, with Ares V sharing some components. The first crewed flight of Orion and Ares was initially planned for 2015, but the Augustine committee suggested a more realistic date of 2017, with a possible delay until 2019. Orion, designed to carry six astronauts for up to six months in space, is seen as suitable for various space exploration tasks, although concerns about operational costs have been raised. The committee suggested a smaller, lighter four-person version of the Ares I rocket to reduce operational costs for ISS support. Ares I, combined with Orion, aims to improve crew transport safety by 10-fold compared to the space shuttle. Ares V is designed to launch 160 metric tons of cargo into low Earth orbit, significantly more than the space shuttle's capacity. Ares V, a heavy-lift rocket, is a conceptual design weighing 350 metric tons. It is intended for human missions beyond low Earth orbit, launching equipment for rendezvous with an Orion spacecraft. The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 directed the development of a multipurpose crew vehicle based on Orion, known as the space launch system, for missions beyond low Earth orbit. The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 directed the development of a space launch system for missions beyond low Earth orbit, with a target date of December 31, 2016, for achieving full operational capability. This system would include lifting payloads into low Earth orbit and delivering crews and cargo to the ISS if other services are unavailable. NASA submitted a preliminary report to Congress in January 2011 outlining its plan for implementing the act's requirements. The Augustine committee identified three alternatives to Ares V for heavy-lift launchers: Ares V Lite, a shuttle-derived rocket, and an Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle. These options could carry humans and cargo, with Ares V Lite being slightly lower in performance but capable of launching about 140 metric tons. Using two launches of Ares V Lite for human missions beyond Earth orbit could significantly increase payload capacity compared to using Ares I and Ares V. The payload for human missions beyond Earth orbit could be carried by a single Ares V Lite launch. Shuttle-derived vehicles would use the same main engines, solid rocket boosters, and external tanks as the space shuttle, with options for in-line or side-mount configurations. The side-mount option was considered less safe for carrying a crew. A shuttle-derived launcher could lift 90 to 110 metric tons into orbit, while the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle program resulted in the development of Delta IV and Atlas V rockets. The Aerospace Corporation testified to the Augustine committee that a human-rated variant of the Delta IV Heavy could carry Orion to the ISS. A super-heavy EELV variant could handle a cargo payload of 75 metric tons. The committee concluded that using an EELV variant for launching Orion would only be feasible if a super-heavy EELV variant was chosen for heavy-lift cargo launch. The alternatives differed in capability, life-cycle costs, operational complexity, and \"way of doing business.\" The committee favored Ares V Lite as the most capable option, a shuttle derivative for utilizing existing infrastructure, and an EELV derivative for potentially lower operating costs. The committee did not explicitly recommend any of the alternatives for NASA's new space launch system. The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 directed NASA to extend or modify existing contracts. The most cost-effective design concept is likely to be an \"in-line\" vehicle design with a large center tank structure and multiple liquid propulsion engines. The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 authorized the establishment and funding of a program to advance the development of commercial services for carrying astronauts. NASA officials are working with Congress to determine an appropriate transportation architecture, aiming to influence the conversation to consider all possible options. The Commercial Crew Development program, funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, involves companies like SpaceX, Orbital, Boeing, Virgin Galactic, and Sierra Nevada Corporation offering commercial crew launch services. The program aims to provide safe commercial crew transport to low Earth orbit, with the U.S. aerospace industry capable of building and operating a crew taxi for this purpose. The commercial crew transport services to low Earth orbit should include a strong mission assurance role for NASA. Private-sector customers could share operating costs with NASA, reducing the program cost to about $5 billion by 2016. If the private sector effort fails, NASA can revert to crew transport. NASA should continue developing Orion and a human-rated heavy-lift rocket as a backup. The Augustine committee found that creating an initial market in the commercial space industry could potentially reduce government costs. NASA's emphasis on safety is a top priority, but concerns remain about the implementation of safety policies. The Columbia Accident Investigation Board highlighted NASA's historical struggles with safety programs and a broken safety culture. Intense schedule pressure was identified as a contributing factor to the Columbia disaster. The Columbia disaster investigation found that intense schedule pressure was a contributing factor. Recommendations included establishing a technical engineering authority independent of the space shuttle program to verify launch readiness. NASA made changes, such as creating the NASA Engineering and Safety Center. However, concerns remain about potential problems due to schedule pressures. The deadline for completing the space station and retiring the space shuttle was extended to early 2011. NASA extended the deadline for completing the space station and retiring the space shuttle to early 2011. In 2006, despite safety concerns raised by officials, NASA proceeded with a shuttle mission due to a perceived reliance on past success. The decision was justified by the NASA Administrator citing the vehicle's history of successful flights. The Advisory Panel in late 2009 highlighted NASA's recent focus on safety requirements for commercial crew transport services. NASA is implementing initiatives to enhance safety, including training, safety culture, software validation, and improved tools. The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 directed NASA to develop detailed human rating processes for crewed commercial spacecraft. NASA issued human rating processes for crewed commercial spacecraft in December 2010, aiming for safety equivalent to NASA spacecraft. The Vision for Space Exploration focused on the Moon and Mars as future goals, with some suggesting Mars as the immediate objective. The Augustine committee found current technology insufficient for a safe Mars mission. The Augustine committee concluded that current technology is not advanced enough for a safe Mars mission. Mars is seen as the ultimate destination for human exploration but not the best first destination due to challenges with overcoming the gravity well. Potential alternatives considered include fly-by missions, orbiting missions, landing on moons of Mars, missions to near-Earth objects, and missions to Lagrange points. NASA's plan for future space exploration includes sending unmanned science spacecraft to planned locations beyond low Earth orbit, such as asteroids and Mars. The ultimate goal is international exploration of Mars, as outlined in the NASA Authorization Act of 2010. However, due to the costs and risks involved, Congress may need to reassess and potentially delay human exploration missions. The cost and risks of human exploration missions may lead Congress to consider shifting focus to other space endeavors. Alternatives such as robotic exploration or technology development could be pursued to achieve similar goals. Advocates of robotic missions argue that they can achieve scientific goals at a lower cost and with greater safety compared to human missions. Robotic exploration is seen as important for paving the way for human exploration, and examples like the Mars rovers demonstrate the success of robotic science missions in capturing public attention. Advocates of human missions argue that exploring with humans is more effective than robotic exploration for inspiring the public, enhancing national prestige, and satisfying the human urge to explore and discover. They also claim that human missions can be more flexible in seizing unforeseen scientific opportunities or adapting to unexpected changes in plans, citing the successful human missions to repair and upgrade the Hubble telescope as evidence. The Hubble repairs and upgrades were not a real-time response to an unexpected event. Robotic missions can be modified through software updates and other changes by scientists and engineers on Earth. Analysts view robotic exploration as complementary, not exclusive, to human exploration. The Augustine committee emphasized the importance of both human and robotic missions for a successful space program. Without human missions, support for NASA would decrease, impacting resources for robotic missions. If cost and safety concerns make human exploration unaffordable, policymakers may scale back NASA's human spaceflight program and focus on technology development. This strategy could involve visiting less challenging destinations before attempting a Moon landing or focusing on human missions in low Earth orbit without immediate plans for more distant destinations. It could also be part of a program that abandons human spaceflight. Developing new technology effectively would likely be difficult without a means of testing it in realistic missions. A program without any human spaceflight would risk losing existing expertise through inactivity. The Augustine committee, National Academies, and Administration's FY2011 budget proposals recommended a greater emphasis on technology development as a complement to ongoing human spaceflight programs. NASA's space technology program has significantly atrophied over the years, and revitalizing it is crucial according to these recommendations. The National Academies recommended NASA establish an independent technology development organization similar to DARPA. The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 accepted this recommendation but provided less funding than proposed. NASA was directed to provide an implementation plan for the program by February 2011 and develop a national policy for space technology development programs through 2020. NASA also faces challenges in acquisition, financial management, and relationships with other agencies and commercial space launch. Since 1990, the GAO has identified acquisition management at NASA as a high-risk area for the federal government. Despite NASA's efforts to improve acquisition management, many major development projects have exceeded their baseline thresholds since fiscal year 2006. In response, NASA issued an improvement plan and was directed by the NASA Authorization Act of 2010 to submit annual reports on its implementation. The Act of 2005 established requirements for baselines and cost controls, including additional reviews for programs exceeding cost or schedule baselines by certain percentages. The NASA Inspector General identified financial management as a serious challenge, with weaknesses in processes and systems leading to disclaimed audits of financial statements since FY2003. Progress has been made in addressing deficiencies, but the FY2009 audit was disclaimed again. The FY2010 audit was qualified, showing some improvement. The NASA Inspector General noted improvements in the FY2010 audit, which was qualified instead of disclaimed. Various governmental and nongovernmental organizations help coordinate U.S. space policy, including the Office of Science and Technology Policy and the National Science and Technology Council. The National Academies recommend aligning agency strategies and identifying new opportunities for space-based endeavors. The Obama Administration plans to reestablish the National Aeronautics and Space Council (NASC) to oversee civilian, military, commercial, and national security space activities. The NASC, established in 1958, was influential during the Kennedy Administration, recommending the Apollo program. It was chaired by Vice President Johnson and abolished in 1973, reestablished in 1989 as the National Space Council, then absorbed into the NSTC in 1993. Presidential statements outline aspects of space policy, with the Bush Administration issuing one in 2006. The Bush Administration issued a statement of national space policy in 2006, replacing the previous one that had been in place for 10 years. The policy established principles and goals for U.S. civilian and national security space programs, addressing specific issues like the use of nuclear power in space and debris in orbit. It defined the roles and relationships of NASA and other federal agencies. The Obama Administration updated the policy in 2010, emphasizing international cooperation and commercial space industry development. National security space programs by the Department of Defense and intelligence community have less visibility but significant budgets. The Department of Defense (DOD) and the intelligence community have budgets comparable to NASA's and face challenges with cost growth and schedule delays in projects. NASA issues can impact national security programs, such as concerns about the industrial base for solid rocket motors. The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 directed NASA to assess the effects of the end of the space shuttle program on the U.S. industrial base for rocket motors. Congressional policy makers have a longstanding interest in national security space programs. Congressional policy makers have mandated joint NASA-NOAA coordination, evaluation of NASA science missions for operational capabilities, and transition plans before transferring missions to NOAA. The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 mandated joint NASA-NOAA coordination, evaluation of NASA science missions for operational capabilities, and transition plans for transferring missions to NOAA. It also directed OSTP to develop a strategic plan for greater cooperation among U.S. civilian Earth observation programs. The provisions in the 2005, 2008, and 2010 acts show overlap, indicating earlier acts have not fully achieved Congress's goals for the NASA-NOAA relationship. The commercial satellite launch industry is expected to grow with space tourism development. Private space travel is expanding beyond trips to the International Space Station, with commercial companies developing reusable spacecraft for short-duration flights. Several companies and states are developing spaceports to accommodate commercial space launches, with the Federal Aviation Administration regulating the safety of these activities. Challenges faced by the FAA include maintaining space expertise, avoiding conflicts in its roles, and integrating spacecraft into the air traffic control system. Export control regulations, such as ITAR, limit the export of satellites and related components due to military system concerns. The U.S. industry advocates transferring the regulation of technologies from ITAR to the Department of Commerce. Changes in the export control system were proposed in April 2010, including a single licensing agency. The development of commercial space vehicles for cargo flights and crew launch services is discussed. NASA Authorization Act of 2010 and appropriations for NASA are also mentioned. The NASA appropriations for FY2011 are provided in the Commerce, Justice, Science (CJS) appropriations bill. NASA is currently operating at FY2010 funding levels under a continuing resolution. The CJS bill for FY2010 was passed by the House and Senate as H.R. 2847 and included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010. For more information on NASA appropriations, refer to CRS Report R40644 for FY2010 and CRS Report RL34540 for FY2009. Several bills related to NASA were introduced during the 111th Congress. P.L. 111-125 extended third-party liability indemnification for commercial launch services companies through 2012. P.L. 111-314 restated existing laws on NASA and space topics. Bills that did not become law included H.R. 4804 and S. 3068, which aimed to extend space shuttle and ISS programs, develop a National Space Transportation system, and authorize appropriations for NASA programs. Several bills related to NASA were introduced during the 111th Congress, including H.R. 5614, which would have required expenditure of appropriated FY2010 Constellation funds on the program, S. 3180, which would have prohibited the use of the Anti-Deficiency Act for terminating Constellation contracts, and other bills addressing space policy issues such as human exploration beyond Earth orbit and NASA's focus on missions in Earth orbit, robotic exploration, and technology development. NASA faces several challenges regarding the transition of shuttle workforce and facilities, effective management of the International Space Station, development of new spacecraft for human exploration, prioritization of objectives, and maintaining a balance between human spaceflight, science, aeronautics, and education programs amidst budget constraints."
