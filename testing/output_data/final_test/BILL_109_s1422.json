The Congress finds that in July 1999, a joint statement was issued by the Public Health Service, American Academy of Pediatrics, and American Academy of Family Physicians calling for the removal of thimerosal-containing vaccines. Similar conclusions were reached in a meeting in July 2000 attended by European regulatory agencies, European vaccine manufacturers, and the US FDA. The AAFP, AAP, and PHS reaffirm the goal to remove or greatly reduce thimerosal from vaccines due to feasibility, substantial progress, ongoing discussions with FDA and manufacturers, and public concern about mercury. The PHS projects the US will transition to thimerosal-free pediatric vaccines. The Institute of Medicine's Immunization Review Committee recommended removing thimerosal from vaccines for children and pregnant women due to concerns about neurodevelopmental disorders. Federal regulatory agencies and manufacturers have made progress in removing thimerosal from childhood vaccines, but it still remains in some non-routinely administered vaccines. Thimerosal remains in some childhood and influenza vaccines, with no current law prohibiting its reintroduction. The EPA estimates 1 in 6 infants have high blood mercury levels, which can be harmful, especially to young children and pregnant women. Reducing mercury exposure through vaccines is crucial.
