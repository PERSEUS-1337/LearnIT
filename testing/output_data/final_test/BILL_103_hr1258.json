FINDINGS.\" The Congress finds that interstate public offerings of debt securities by corporations and other entities must be covered by a trust indenture meeting the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939. A trust indenture is a contractual agreement between the issuer and a financial institution as trustee for the benefit of public debtholders, outlining responsibilities, rights, and events of default triggering actions by the trustee on behalf of debtholders. The Trust Indenture Act of 1939 requires a trust indenture for interstate public offerings of debt securities, outlining responsibilities, rights, and default actions by the trustee on behalf of debtholders. The Act does not mandate successor corporations to assume payment responsibility for predecessor's debt securities, creating a gap addressed by sample trust indenture provisions. The Trust Indenture Act of 1939 requires trust indentures for public offerings of debt securities, but does not mandate successor corporations to assume payment responsibility for predecessor's debt securities. Some issuers have engaged in share exchange transactions to avoid payment responsibility on debt securities. The Trust Indenture Act of 1939 requires successor payment responsibility provisions in trust indentures for debt securities to protect public purchasers, even if the language does not explicitly cover share exchanges or similar transactions. Successor to an issuer of debt securities resulting from a merger cannot avoid payment responsibility, protecting public debtholders. The Trust Indenture Act of 1939 is amended to include a new section regarding merger, consolidation, conveyance, or transfer. The Trust Indenture Act of 1939 is amended to include a new section (Sec. 329) that imposes conditions on transactions involving the consolidation, merger, conveyance, or transfer of properties and assets of a security issuer. The issuer must meet certain requirements before engaging in such transactions. The Trust Indenture Act of 1939 is amended to include a new section (Sec. 329) that imposes conditions on transactions involving the consolidation, merger, conveyance, or transfer of properties and assets of a security issuer. The issuer must meet certain requirements before engaging in such transactions, including the corporation assuming the payment of securities and no default events occurring. Upon any consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer, equity or share exchange transaction, or any transaction having a substantially equivalent effect, the issuer must provide a certificate and opinion of counsel to the trustee, stating compliance with the Trust Indenture Act and all conditions precedent. Upon such transactions, the successor corporation assumes the rights and obligations under the indenture. Upon consolidation, merger, or other transactions, the successor corporation assumes all rights and obligations under the indenture, without releasing the issuer from liability on the securities."
