    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Direct Check for Education Act\" and emphasizes the importance of education as a national priority while maintaining local control. It highlights the need for empowering parents, teachers, and local school districts to set education priorities and for schools to be accountable to the people and children they serve. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This section defines key terms such as \"local educational agency,\" \"Secretary,\" and \"State.\" The Secretary will make direct awards to local educational agencies for programs for K-12 students using appropriated funds. $3.5 billion for 2000-2001, $4 billion for 2002-2003, and $5 billion for 2004 are authorized. Funds will also be used for multiyear awards. The Act repeals several provisions of law, including the Goals 2000: Educate America Act and various sections of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Payments will be made for the duration of multiyear awards. The Secretary will determine the amount per child for the programs. The Secretary determines the per child amount by dividing the total appropriation by the average daily attendance of students. The amount provided to each local educational agency is calculated by multiplying the per child amount by the average daily attendance of students served by the agency. Each local educational agency must conduct a census to determine student attendance and submit the data to the Secretary by March 1. If false information is knowingly submitted to gain more funds, the agency will be fined double the difference between the received amount and the correct amount. The Secretary disburses funds to local educational agencies under this Act by July 1 each year, based on accurate information submitted. The Secretary may conduct audits of local educational agencies' expenditures to ensure compliance with this Act. Sanctions and penalties may be imposed if funds are misused."
