    "content": "The United States and Russia signed the new START Treaty on April 8, 2010, to further reduce and limit strategic offensive arms. The treaty replaced the 1991 START Treaty that expired in 2009. After Senate hearings and approval, the treaty was ratified on December 22, 2010, and entered into force on February 5, 2011. The new START Treaty entered into force on February 5, 2011, after the United States and Russia exchanged ratification instruments. During the final years of the George W. Bush Administration, discussions were held to preserve parts of the START legacy while exploring a new direction for arms control. Russia aimed to replace START with a new treaty maintaining similar limits on deployed warheads and delivery vehicles, while the Bush Administration proposed a modified version of the 2002 Moscow Treaty. The U.S. and Russia agreed on the value of continuing some monitoring and verification provisions in the new START Treaty to build confidence and cooperation. Both nations sought to simplify the regime, reduce costs, and maintain transparency. Members of Congress also recognized the importance of these provisions. Several Members of Congress support extending the monitoring and verification regime in START, emphasizing the importance of transparency in fostering cooperation between the U.S. and Russia. Senator Richard Lugar and Senator Jon Kyl both advocate for preserving the START Treaty to avoid increasing distrust between the two sides. Senator Jon Kyl supported START's verification regime, highlighting the loss of crucial information for both the U.S. and Russia after its expiration. The Obama Administration shifted the U.S. approach towards arms control, with negotiations for a new treaty to replace START initiated in April 2009. The new treaty aimed to reduce strategic offensive arms and include effective verification measures. The negotiating teams from both parties, including inspectors from the original START Treaty, modified the monitoring and verification regime for the new START Treaty. The Obama Administration highlighted the simpler and less costly verification procedures in the new Treaty, incorporating elements from the 1991 START Treaty with new tailored limitations. The new START Treaty features a more effective and transparent verification method, with quicker data exchanges and notifications compared to the previous START Treaty. The United States and Russia have conducted over 1,700 exchanges of notifications and inspections at various facilities as mandated by the treaty. The new START Treaty includes verification measures such as exchanges of notifications and inspections at facilities. The Bilateral Consultative Commission addresses implementation and compliance issues, with concerns raised about monitoring provisions and access to information on nuclear forces. The monitoring and verification regime in the new START Treaty includes notifications, on-site inspections, and cooperative measures to ensure compliance between the United States and Russia. This regime evaluates treaty terms, monitoring systems, and analysis tools to maintain confidence in compliance. The new START Treaty's verification provisions are crucial for assessing compliance with arms control agreements. Verification involves assessing if a country is following the treaty's limits and obligations. A verifiable treaty has multiple provisions to prevent cheating and detect violations. Key components of a verification regime include notifications, on-site inspections, and cooperative measures to ensure compliance between countries like the United States and Russia. The verification regime of a treaty consists of five key components: treaty language, monitoring, analysis, evaluation, and resolution. Treaty language defines limits and obligations, helping countries focus on compliant activities during monitoring. Collateral constraints aid in determining compatibility with treaty terms, including restrictions and obligations. Monitoring systems, such as national technical means of verification (NTM), are used by the United States and Russia to collect data on each other's forces and activities. These systems include photoreconnaissance satellites, radar installations, and electronic surveillance capabilities. On-site inspections are also conducted inside each other's territory to verify compliance with arms control agreements. Monitoring systems like NTM are used by countries for inspections and data collection on each other's forces. These systems include satellites, radar installations, and electronic surveillance. On-site inspections verify compliance with arms control agreements, operating within treaty verification regimes. Data collected for compliance may differ from intelligence purposes, which may include information on weapons characteristics or military operations not limited by treaties. This intelligence can assess adversary capabilities but may not be necessary for treaty compliance assessment. The verification regime for compliance with treaties is tailored to provide specific information needed to verify limits. It is important to distinguish between intelligence value and verification value of monitoring systems data. The relationship between treaty limits and monitoring provisions is crucial in assessing the value of a treaty's verification regime. The analysis process refines data collected by monitoring systems to develop a picture of the other country's forces and activities. The United States and Russia gather vast information with their NTM, which must be sorted and interpreted to determine treaty compliance. Analysts evaluate, compare, and combine data from various sources to understand the other country's activities. While the analysis process makes data more usable, it may not always determine the precise meaning. The evaluation portion of the verification regime determines if the other country has complied with the arms control treaty terms. It is a political process that assesses if the information collected reveals forces and activities within treaty limits. The results may be unclear at times due to ambiguities in the treaty language. Verification of compliance with arms control treaties involves assessing whether the other country's activities align with treaty obligations. This process requires political judgment to determine if ambiguous activities pose risks. If a violation is suspected, the country must decide how to address it. The process of addressing a possible violation of an arms control treaty involves raising concerns with the other country, engaging in dialogue through diplomatic channels or established forums, making changes to one's own forces to register objections, and potentially abrogating the treaty if the violation persists. This response aims to restore security and offset any benefits gained by the violating country. The response to a violation of an arms control treaty involves raising concerns, engaging in dialogue, making changes to forces, and potentially abrogating the treaty. The verification regime in a treaty aims to provide confidence in compliance by detecting evidence of violations and deterring them. The verification regime in an arms control treaty aims to increase the likelihood of detecting significant violations. If a country considers violating the agreement, the costs and consequences may deter them. Concealing noncompliant activities would add to the cost and reduce confidence in the military value, potentially discouraging the violation. The verification regime in an arms control treaty aims to increase confidence in compliance and deter violations by providing a better understanding of each country's forces and activities. This contributes to building and maintaining support for arms control efforts, as demonstrated during the implementation of the START Treaty. The START verification regime allows nations to monitor forces, resolve compliance questions, and enhance understanding. Analysts emphasize the importance of communication and cooperation between governments for national security goals. The new START Treaty's transparency and cooperation are seen as valuable, despite limitations on deployed forces. All treaties carry some risk of noncompliance going unnoticed, impacting treaty viability and participant security. During treaty negotiations, analysts assess the risk of undetected violations that could threaten participant security. In the 1980s, the Reagan Administration argued for stronger verification standards due to concerns about potential Soviet violations. The Reagan Administration argued for stronger verification standards during treaty negotiations with the Soviet Union to detect and respond to potential violations, even if they posed no military risk. This new standard of \"effective verification\" aimed to ensure the ability to detect any violations, including politically sensitive ones, in a timely manner. During the INF Treaty negotiations, Paul Nitze emphasized the importance of effective verification measures to prevent the deployment of military components without detection. The intelligence community plays a crucial role in assessing the verifiability of arms control agreements. The intelligence community plays a crucial role in assessing treaty violations, considering the motivations and opportunities for cheating scenarios. The likelihood of a party exceeding treaty limits may depend on the political climate at the time. Some believe parties may seek to retain excess forces for military advantages, while others trust in both parties' commitment to treaty implementation. During the 1970s and 1980s, the United States feared Soviet Union's potential cheating scenarios in missile deployment. Monitoring provisions in INF and START Treaties aimed to detect such actions. In the 1990s and 2000s, improved US-Russia relations reduced concerns about Russian noncompliance. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld noted this shift in the 2002 Moscow Treaty testimony. In the 2002 Moscow Treaty, the Bush Administration did not include detailed verification measures as both sides had no interest in evading the terms. The assessment of treaty verifiability does not guarantee a response to violations, depending on the US capability and political will. This was a key consideration in past assessments of treaty verifiability. During the Cold War, it was assumed that Soviet violations of treaties would undermine U.S. security. However, the Bush Administration indicated it was not concerned about potential Russian violations to the 2002 Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty. Secretary Rumsfeld noted that the U.S. no longer tailored its military forces in response to the Russian threat. The United States planned to reduce its weapons in response to the Russian threat, with or without a treaty. Even if Russia violated the treaty, the US would not increase its forces. Verification provisions were included in arms control agreements since the late 1950s, relying on National Technical Means (NTM) for monitoring. Agreements benefited from technological advancements, allowing parties to gather information for compliance and violation detection. Cooperation in monitoring compliance was also called for in agreements from the 1950s and 1960s. The Antarctic Treaty and Outer Space Treaty allowed on-site inspections for peaceful purposes but did not provide access to U.S. or Soviet military activities. The Limited Test Ban Treaty did not authorize the collection of information about military activities despite the use of National Technical Means for monitoring compliance. The Limited Test Ban Treaty did not allow for the collection of military activity information and did not cover underground tests due to disagreements between the US and Soviet Union on inspection numbers. Bilateral arms control agreements in the 1970s relied on each nation using its own National Technical Means for monitoring compliance, with some cooperative measures included to facilitate access to necessary information. Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) between the United States and Soviet Union in the 1970s focused on using National Technical Means (NTM) to monitor treaty-limited systems. The SALT II Treaty in 1979 expanded the pledge not to interfere with information collection, specifically banning the deliberate denial of telemetry data that would impede verification. However, the treaty did not specify which data were necessary for verification, leaving the decision on encryption up to the country conducting the tests. In SALT II, countries adopted measures to distinguish between different types of weapons restricted by the treaty, requiring observable differences for similar weapons subject to different limits. The exchange of a database listing weapon numbers subject to limits was included. Arms control agreements in the late 1980s and early 1990s built on earlier provisions, relying on NTM for monitoring restricted forces and activities. The 1986 Stockholm Conference on Confidence and Security-Building Measures in Europe expanded cooperative measures, including on-site inspections and aerial overflights, to understand military operations. The 1987 INF Treaty included extensive cooperative measures. The INF Treaty included cooperative measures such as displaying ground-launched ballistic missiles on mobile launchers, exchanging detailed data on systems, continuous monitoring at missile assembly facilities, and on-site inspections. The 1991 START Treaty followed similar precedents and adopted measures from the SALT agreements. The START Treaty, following the INF Treaty, included extensive data exchange and on-site inspections for various types of facilities and equipment to ensure compliance with treaty limitations. It also allowed for random, short-notice inspections of deployed missiles to verify warhead numbers. The START Treaty required parties to provide notifications of activities, display treaty-limited items, exchange telemetry data from missile tests, and share information for monitoring each other's forces. The START Treaty required monitoring and tracking of forces throughout their service lives, with detailed data to minimize ambiguities. Despite its expiration, parties retain this data for strategic knowledge. The Moscow Treaty in 2002 lacked verification provisions. The Moscow Treaty in 2002 lacked verification provisions for monitoring compliance with the treaty's limits on warheads and nuclear forces. The parties simply declared their numbers without agreed definitions or means to confirm accuracy. The new START Treaty, unlike the Moscow Treaty in 2002, includes a monitoring and verification regime with detailed definitions, data gathering using NTM, an extensive database, notifications, and inspections to confirm information shared during data exchanges. The parties agreed to have no more than 2,200 deployed strategic warheads by December 31, 2012. The new START Treaty has a monitoring and verification regime that differs from the START Treaty due to changes in the U.S.-Russia relationship and assumptions about violations. Verification provisions in the original START Treaty were designed to detect and deter Soviet efforts to hide or deploy extra missiles and warheads. The U.S. was concerned about uncertainty in estimates of each other's forces, such as the number of mobile missiles produced by the Soviet Union before START entered into force. The new START Treaty's verification regime reflects changes in the U.S.-Russia relationship. The U.S. now has a better understanding of Russia's missile stockpile, reducing concerns about hidden missiles. Aging missiles and improved monitoring lessen worries about treaty violations. The new START Treaty's verification regime has been streamlined to reflect the current U.S.-Russia relationship. Russia is expected to reduce its forces regardless of the treaty, making the verification regime less costly and complex. Transparency, cooperation, and openness are emphasized to deter and detect potential violations. The provisions governing the use of NTM in START and new START are virtually identical, emphasizing verification of compliance and prohibiting interference with each other's NTM. Both treaties also prohibit the use of concealment measures that impede verification. Both START and new START treaties prohibit the use of concealment measures that impede verification, including at test ranges. While extensive data exchanges and on-site inspections are called for, both treaties rely on National Technical Means (NTM) as the foundation of their verification regimes, including telemetry data from missile flight tests. The START Treaty between the United States and Soviet Union allows for the exchange of telemetry data from missile flight tests to evaluate missile capabilities. Encryption or denial of access to telemetry data is prohibited to ensure transparency in evaluating missile systems. The START Treaty prohibits the use of encryption, jamming, and broadcasting telemetric information in missile tests. The US and Soviet Union agreed to exchange data and interpret it. Exceptions were allowed for missiles incapable of recording data, but efforts to conceal new missile capabilities were limited. The Bush Administration released an Article-by-Article Legal Analysis with the START Treaty, stating that access to telemetric information helps verify treaty provisions on missile capabilities. Monitoring missile flight tests and analyzing telemetric data would assist in determining compliance with limits on ballistic missile throwweight and the number of warheads. This information would aid in calculating the number of warheads attributed to each missile type for treaty limits. During the negotiations on the new START Treaty, Russia resisted provisions for broadcasting telemetry from missile tests, arguing it was unfair due to developing new missiles. The US insisted on some telemetry exchange, citing new verification technologies. The US and Russia negotiated telemetry data exchange during the new START Treaty talks. Russia initially resisted, citing unfairness in sharing data on new missiles. However, the US argued for telemetry exchange, mentioning new verification technologies. Eventually, an agreement was reached in January 2010, allowing for limited telemetry exchange from a small number of missile flight tests each year. The Protocol to the new START Treaty requires the exchange of telemetric information on a limited number of missile launches each year, not exceeding five launches of ICBMs and SLBMs. Despite not needing telemetry from Russian missile tests for verification, the parties agreed to share some telemetry to enhance transparency and mutual understanding of their strategic offensive forces. The previous START Treaty limited the US and Russia to 1,100 warheads on mobile ICBMs. The Treaty limited the US and Russia to 1,100 warheads on mobile ICBMs, with concerns about monitoring Soviet mobile ICBM deployments and potential hidden stockpiles. The US never deployed mobile ICBMs but considered it for the Peacekeeper missile. The United States designated the Peacekeeper missile as a mobile type to convince the Soviet Union to accept continuous monitoring at mobile ICBM final assembly facilities. The monitoring regime in START aimed to limit the ability of either side to hide extra missiles near the deployed force or increase the number of deployed missiles quickly. START limited the numbers of non-deployed missiles and launchers for mobile ICBMs. START limited the numbers of non-deployed missiles and launchers for mobile ICBMs to 250 missiles and 110 launchers, with additional restrictions for rail mobile ICBMs. The treaty aimed to control the risk of \"breakout\" by monitoring missile facilities and implementing complementary monitoring mechanisms. The START treaty aimed to control the risk of \"breakout\" by monitoring missile facilities and implementing monitoring mechanisms to accurately count the number of ballistic missiles in the Soviet force. This included recording unique identifiers for mobile ICBMs to provide a more accurate estimate of the total number of missiles. The START treaty required parties to list missile numbers in a database for tracking and identification during inspections. Notifications were needed for mobile ICBM movements between facilities to prevent unauthorized missile deployment or maintenance. The START treaty mandated notifications for the movement of mobile ICBMs between facilities to prevent unauthorized deployment or maintenance. Parties had to provide notifications within specific timeframes for various activities related to mobile ICBMs, including exercises and dispersals. Inspections were also allowed to verify the identity of missiles using unique identifiers. The new START Treaty includes provisions for monitoring mobile ICBMs from deployment to elimination, aiming to prevent unauthorized activities and maintain an accurate count of missiles. While there is no sublimit on mobile ICBMs or warheads, the treaty is designed to complicate any efforts to hide extra missiles and raise the risk of detection. The new START Treaty does not contain a sublimit on mobile ICBMs or their warheads, but it does not limit the number of non-deployed mobile ICBMs or launchers. These will count towards the overall treaty limits. The United States will still need to monitor Russia's mobile ICBMs to verify compliance and deter any attempts to exceed the limits. Monitoring mobile ICBMs may be less complex now due to improved estimates after 15 years of START implementation and Russia's reduced production of new missiles compared to the Soviet Union. The New START Treaty allows the United States to monitor missile production with NTM, but does not permit perimeter and portal monitoring at missile assembly facilities. Russia withdrew its presence from the US when production of Peacekeeper missiles stopped. The US shut down operations at Votkinsk in 2009. Parties must provide notification before mobile ICBMs leave production facilities, but not during exercise dispersal. Post-dispersal inspections are not allowed. The New START Treaty allows on-site inspections at mobile ICBM deployment areas. Parties must list serial numbers for all treaty-limited items in a shared database and update it when items move between facilities. Inspectors have the right to verify the location of designated deployed ICBMs and SLBMs. The New START Treaty allows on-site inspections to verify the location of designated deployed ICBMs, SLBMs, non-deployed ICBMs, non-deployed SLBMs, and heavy bombers at the inspection site. This provision aims to prevent the mixing of uncounted systems with deployed systems. However, concerns have been raised about the treaty's limitations on independent counting of new missiles entering Russia's missile force and the inability to confirm each missile's serial number. The New START Treaty allows on-site inspections to verify the location of designated deployed ICBMs, SLBMs, non-deployed ICBMs, non-deployed SLBMs, and heavy bombers at the inspection site. U.S. negotiators insist on \"cradle-to-grave\" monitoring for mobile ICBMs, despite limitations on confirming each missile's serial number and concerns about Russia potentially bringing extra missiles into deployment areas. Inspectors will confirm numbers during on-site inspections, and Russia's low production rates reduce the chance of hiding extra missiles. During the 1980s, the Soviet Union produced many missiles annually, while Russia now only adds six to seven missiles per year. Under Secretary of State Ellen Tauscher mentioned the U.S.'s ability to monitor Russia's mobile ICBMs without oversight at the Votkinsk facility. The 1991 START Treaty included 12 types of on-site inspections to confirm information collected by other means. The START Treaty inspections were not just about confirming information but also fostered communication and cooperation, easing suspicions and reducing misunderstandings. They played a broader role in ensuring transparency and predictability, confirming baseline information for monitoring compliance. Inspections focused on technical characteristics of missiles, launchers, and bombers, distinguishing between those capable of carrying cruise missiles. The START Treaty inspections were crucial for distinguishing between bombers capable of carrying cruise missiles and nuclear weapons. These inspections increased transparency and confidence in each side's deployed weapons. Inspections also confirmed the removal of weapons or facilities from the treaty database to ensure they were no longer capable of strategic missions. The START Treaty inspections ensured transparency and compliance by confirming the elimination or conversion of weapons. Inspections prevented violations by making it difficult to operate facilities secretly or retain weapons beyond treaty limits. These inspections also verified data on the numbers and locations of limited weapons. The START Treaty inspections included baseline inspections at declared facilities, new facility inspections for those housing treaty-limited weapons, data updates, suspect site inspections, and post-exercise dispersal inspections. All facilities with treaty-limited items underwent baseline inspections, with short-notice inspections for data confirmation. Mobile ICBM deployment areas were also subject to inspections after exercises. The START Treaty inspections were designed to deter and detect violations by making it difficult to hide weapons systems at declared facilities. The inspections included baseline and short-notice inspections to confirm data and prevent the deployment of extra missiles at undeclared or hidden facilities. Conducting random reentry vehicle inspections helped ensure that the number of warheads deployed did not exceed the treaty limits. The START Treaty inspections aimed to prevent the addition of extra warheads to ballistic missiles. Inspections were conducted to ensure that the number of reentry vehicles on a missile did not exceed the limit, making it difficult to hide violations. Inspectors could shield the front end of the missile, so the actual number of warheads could be concealed if it fell below the listed number in the database. The new START Treaty verification regime will include on-site inspections and exhibitions to monitor and verify the number of warheads on missiles. It will be simpler, less costly, and more streamlined than the previous START Treaty. The parties will conduct fewer and more focused inspections to achieve multiple goals during a single inspection. Baseline inspections to confirm the number of weapons at each facility will not be conducted. The baseline information for the new START Treaty remains the same as the old START Treaty. The new START Treaty verification regime includes on-site inspections and exhibitions to monitor warheads on missiles. Inspections will be focused and allow for demonstrations of new weapons. Random, short-notice inspections will begin in early April 2011 at all listed facilities. The new START Treaty verification regime includes Type One and Type Two inspections, starting in early April 2011. Type One inspections will confirm data on strategic arms at ICBM, submarine, and air bases, while Type Two inspections will verify warhead numbers on deployed missiles and bombers. The new START Treaty allows for simultaneous inspections of different types, combining them into one quota. The counting rules for ballistic missiles have changed, with the treaty database now listing the actual number of warheads deployed on each individual missile. This is a departure from the previous method where all missiles of a certain type were counted as carrying the same number of warheads. The new START Treaty allows for simultaneous inspections of different types of missiles, with the actual number of warheads deployed on each missile being counted. Parties can designate one ICBM or SLBM for inspection during Type One inspections, and must use individual covers for each reentry vehicle to show the actual number of warheads. The inspections will not be used to calculate the total number of warheads on deployed missiles, but will be random and occur on short notice. The new START Treaty allows for random Type Two inspections at facilities housing non-deployed or converted launchers and missiles to detect any concealment of extra warheads. These inspections provide transparency and understanding by counting the actual number of deployed warheads, deterring efforts to hide additional warheads on the deployed force. The new START Treaty allows for random Type Two inspections at facilities to confirm accuracy of declared technical characteristics and data on non-deployed ICBMs and SLBMs, first stages, and launchers. Type Two inspections also verify elimination of solid-fueled ICBMs, SLBMs, and mobile launchers. Each country can conduct 18 random, short-notice inspections annually, with Type One inspections achieving two goals in one inspection, equivalent to 28 inspections. The new START Treaty allows for random Type Two inspections at facilities to confirm accuracy of declared technical characteristics and data on non-deployed ICBMs and SLBMs. Russia had 60 facilities subject to inspection under the old START, but may now have only 34 under the new START. U.S. officials believe they will conduct inspections at a greater proportion of Russia's facilities. The treaty also allows for exhibitions to demonstrate distinguishing features of new types of weapons. The parties can use exhibitions to confirm technical characteristics of new types of missiles and bombers, adding transparency to the process. This information may help deter violations of the treaty and promote openness and understanding. The new START Treaty encourages transparency and openness to increase understanding of weapons capabilities. Comparing verification regimes between the two treaties may not provide useful answers on the verifiability of the new treaty. Monitoring measures should be determined by the treaty's specific limits and the need to verify those limits. The new START Treaty aims to increase transparency and understanding of weapons capabilities. While no verification regime can guarantee absolute compliance, some argue that the treaty serves U.S. interests by providing access to Russian forces. The possibility of undetected violations may be a concern, but the treaty's monitoring provisions are essential for verifying limits. The new START Treaty includes an extensive database detailing Russian weapons, aiming to increase transparency and trust between the United States and Russia. The verification regime in the treaty is seen as crucial for monitoring compliance and easing tensions. Some argue the new treaty may not enhance U.S. security as Russia's forces are already decreasing, and Russia is not a significant threat. Others view it as a sign of a new partnership, leading to a revamped nuclear security regime and aiding U.S. nonproliferation goals. Progress in U.S.-Russian arms control could show commitment to nuclear obligations. The new START Treaty may demonstrate U.S. commitment to nuclear obligations and strengthen the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. It could also provide the U.S. with valuable information on Russian nuclear forces, enhancing national security interests."
