    "content": "Title V of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 is amended to include a new section, SEC. 512, focusing on vegetation management for electric transmission and distribution facility rights-of-way on federal lands. The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture must provide direction for utility vegetation management activities on public lands and National Forest System lands to enhance grid reliability and reduce wildfire threats to electrical facilities. This includes ensuring that rights-of-way and easements for transmission facilities comply with federal and state electric system reliability and fire safety requirements. The text chunk discusses safety requirements for utility vegetation management activities in electrical transmission corridors, aiming to minimize the need for case-by-case approvals and provide expedited review and approval processes. The text chunk discusses the development of integrated vegetation management plans for electric transmission and distribution facilities to ensure compliance with safety and reliability requirements. The Secretaries of Interior and Agriculture will jointly develop a streamlined process for reviewing and approving integrated vegetation management plans for electric transmission and distribution facilities. The process aims to ensure timely approval, compliance with the law, and cost minimization for both the reviewing agency and the plan submitter. The Secretaries of Interior and Agriculture will develop a streamlined process for reviewing and approving integrated vegetation management plans for electric transmission and distribution facilities. The process includes notification of changed conditions, submission of proposed plan amendments, and continued implementation of approved plan elements. The approved integrated vegetation management plan becomes part of the authorization for the right-of-way or easement. The owner/operator must notify the agency of planned activities for the year, ensuring compliance with the plan. The integrated vegetation management plan is a long-term, cost-effective strategy for managing vegetation within electric transmission and distribution rights-of-way to enhance reliability, promote safety, and prevent fire hazards. The plan must be prepared by the owner or operator of the facility and is part of the authorization for the right-of-way or easement. If a transmission or distribution facility owner needs to conduct vegetation management activities within a right-of-way or easement granted by the Secretary of the Interior or Agriculture and clearance requirements are not met, the owner can proceed with the activities after notifying the Secretary. If the Secretary fails to authorize vegetation management, a liability waiver may be granted. The owner or operator of a transmission or distribution facility on lands under the jurisdiction of the Secretary must manage vegetation to comply with electric system reliability and fire safety requirements. If vegetation causes wildfire damage, the owner/operator shall not be liable for the cost of fire suppression. The owner or operator of a transmission or distribution facility on federal lands may be liable for wildfire damages and fire suppression costs if found negligent. The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture are encouraged to provide training on vegetation management for electric system reliability and fire safety. The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture must establish regulations to implement electric reliability and fire safety requirements for transmission and distribution facilities on federal lands within one year of this Act's enactment."
