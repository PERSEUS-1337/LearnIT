    "content": "The companies challenging the contraceptive coverage requirement alleged violation of their religious exercise rights under the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause and RFRA. The Supreme Court reinterpreted the Free Exercise Clause in 1990, stating that it does not exempt individuals from complying with neutral laws. Congress responded by enacting RFRA to reinstate a heightened standard of protection for religious exercise rights. RFRA reinstated a heightened standard of protection for religious exercise rights by stating that the government cannot substantially burden a person's exercise of religion. The term \"person\" was not defined by Congress when enacting RFRA, leading to the requirement that a court must determine if the party challenging the government's action is a person under the statute and exercises religion to address the case's merits. The Hobby Lobby decision declared closely held corporations as \"persons\" protected under RFRA, relying on the Dictionary Act's definition of person to include corporations. The Court rejected the idea that businesses organized as corporations are excluded from RFRA's protections, emphasizing that Congress did not discriminate based on business structure for those running their businesses according to their religious beliefs. The Hobby Lobby decision declared closely held corporations as \"persons\" protected under RFRA, emphasizing that Congress did not discriminate based on business structure for those running their businesses according to their religious beliefs. The Court reasoned that RFRA provides broad protection for religious liberty, with the definition of person not limited by for-profit status. Previous cases involving individuals who owned for-profit businesses and nonprofit corporations exercising religion were cited. The majority in the Hobby Lobby decision held that for-profit corporations, specifically closely held ones owned by a single family, are protected under RFRA, regardless of their corporate status. The decision only applies to companies challenging specific requirements, not large publicly traded corporations. The majority in the Hobby Lobby decision recognized RFRA's applicability to closely held corporations owned by a single family. It was noted that future cases may extend RFRA protection to other types of corporations, but it is unlikely for large publicly traded corporations to assert RFRA rights. The dissent disagreed with this stance. The dissent in the Hobby Lobby decision criticized the broadness of extending RFRA protection to for-profit corporations, suggesting potential future implications for expanding the protection further. The majority's explanation that the Dictionary Act's definition of person does not distinguish between types of corporations based on profit status raises concerns about potential future applications. The Court examined the burden imposed by the contraceptive coverage mandate on companies challenging it, stating that compliance would violate their religious beliefs. Non-compliance would result in substantial penalties under the ACA. The Supreme Court ruled that companies facing penalties for not providing contraceptive coverage could also risk different penalties if they stopped providing insurance altogether to avoid the mandate. Justice Ginsburg criticized the majority's view that a sincere religious objection equates to a substantial burden. The dissent argued that the connection between a person's religious belief and the burden of providing contraceptive coverage is too attenuated to be considered a substantial burden. They emphasized that the decision to use contraceptives is made by the covered employees and dependents, not by the companies like Hobby Lobby or Conestoga. The dissent argued that the burden imposed by the government's mandate on religious beliefs would be undermined by independent decision-makers, such as the woman and her health counselor. The Court was skeptical of the government's interest in requiring contraceptive coverage, citing a need for a more focused inquiry under RFRA. The Court discussed exemptions for businesses from offering contraceptive coverage, with the majority conceding the compelling interest prong of the RFRA analysis. The dissent addressed the exemptions in detail, citing other federal laws with similar provisions. The Department of Health and Human Services' argument about ensuring coverage without burdening religious companies was rejected. The Court suggested alternatives to ensure contraceptive coverage without burdening religious companies, such as the government assuming the cost or utilizing the accommodation already in place for nonprofit employers with objections. The accommodation was noted as a potential less restrictive alternative, although its sufficiency under RFRA for other legal challenges was not determined. The accommodation currently available to certain nonprofit religious organizations allows them to self-certify their objection and have the insurance issuer provide coverage to employees outside of the employer's group health plan. The dissent questioned the extent to which employers with religious objections can avoid compliance with government mandates. The majority's decision in Hobby Lobby only applies to the contraceptive coverage requirement, not all insurance mandates conflicting with religious beliefs. Legislative responses have been discussed post-decision, emphasizing the decision's basis on RFRA protections, not First Amendment rights. The Court's decision in Hobby Lobby focused on the RFRA protections, not First Amendment rights. Congress has the authority to amend RFRA to clarify the definition of person and the scope of its applicability. This could range from including only natural persons to all natural and artificial persons. Congress has the authority to amend RFRA to clarify the definition of person and the scope of its applicability, including natural and artificial persons. The Court's decision in Hobby Lobby provided a compromise definition, but Congress may choose to adopt it explicitly to prevent future cases from altering the status quo. Alternatively, Congress can look to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as an example of protecting religious objectors from generally applicable mandates. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employers from discriminating against employees based on their religious beliefs. However, there is an exemption for religious entities, allowing them to hire individuals of a particular religion. Courts consider the organization's purpose, ownership, requirements, and affiliations when interpreting this provision. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits religious discrimination in employment, with exemptions for religious organizations. One option to address conflicts like Hobby Lobby is to consider preempting RFRA in federal legislation, as Congress cannot bind future actions. This could involve making RFRA not applicable to certain federal actions. Congress could enact legislation to specify that RFRA would not apply to certain federal actions, such as the contraceptive coverage mandate. This approach would require Congress to consider RFRA's applicability on a case-by-case basis for present and future laws. Legislation introduced after the Hobby Lobby case took a similar approach, with the Protect Women's Health From Corporate Interference Act of 2014 prohibiting employers from denying coverage of required health care services, regardless of RFRA exemptions. The Hobby Lobby decision clarified the scope of protection under RFRA, specifically regarding the contraceptive coverage requirement. HHS has developed regulations to address religious objections, with an exemption for certain entities. If enacted, the prohibition in federal law would override RFRA, potentially impacting parties covered by RFRA. The exemption for religious employers under the contraceptive coverage requirement includes churches, church auxiliaries, and other religious orders. Employees of these employers would not receive contraceptive coverage. Other eligible organizations can seek protection through an accommodation by objecting to coverage based on religious beliefs. The accommodation for eligible organizations allows employees to receive contraceptive coverage directly through health plan issuers at no cost, following the Hobby Lobby case which broadened eligibility. The regulations also provide accommodation for closely held for-profit corporations with religious objections. The Court did not address the sufficiency of regulations for other entities with religious objections. The Court's decision in Hobby Lobby expanded eligibility for organizations to receive contraceptive coverage directly through health plan issuers at no cost. Legal questions remain regarding employer obligations, particularly for religious organizations. The Court also addressed procedural requests from nonprofits objecting to the certification process for accommodation. In Wheaton College v. Burwell, an injunction was issued to prevent enforcement of the contraceptive coverage requirement pending a final decision. The Supreme Court issued an injunction in Wheaton College v. Burwell to prevent enforcement of the contraceptive coverage requirement. The college can claim eligibility for accommodation by providing a letter to HHS instead of using the official form. Three Justices dissented, stating that the college's objection was not a viable claim under RFRA. Despite the attention, the order did not express the Court's views on the case's merits. The Wheaton College order did not provide a final decision on the challenge to the accommodation for contraceptive coverage. The Hobby Lobby case mentioned the accommodation as a possible \"less restrictive\" option but did not determine it as the least restrictive means. The Obama Administration issued final regulations in July 2015 clarifying the scope and procedure for seeking accommodation. The final rules allow certain nonprofit religious organizations and closely held for-profit entities to oppose providing coverage for required contraceptive services by self-certifying their objections. Implementation of the accommodation has faced challenges in courts, especially by nonprofit religious entities. The Supreme Court announced in November 2015 that it would review seven cases related to this issue. The Supreme Court announced in November 2015 that it would review seven cases related to the accommodation granted for closely held corporations under RFRA. Prior to this, federal circuit courts had upheld the accommodation, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit granted a preliminary injunction in September 2015. This decision affects only federal law, as some states have separate contraceptive coverage requirements predating the ACA. State RFRA laws may require companies protected by RFRA to provide contraceptive coverage if no state exemption exists. Some states have laws similar to federal RFRA to protect religious exercise. The scope of protection for different organizations depends on each state's legislation. Courts may use Hobby Lobby as guidance but are not bound by it. Recent state RFRA legislation shows a broader approach to religious freedom protections. Indiana enacted a version of RFRA in March 2015, extending protections to individuals, religious organizations, and various business entities. Arizona vetoed a similar law in February 2014. The controversy over expanding RFRA protections raised concerns about potential avoidance of compliance with laws, such as public accommodations requirements in civil rights laws. Indiana amended its RFRA to clarify that it does not allow discrimination based on various protected characteristics in public accommodations, employment, or housing. The amendments do not apply to tax-exempt churches, nonprofit religious organizations, or their ministerial employees."
