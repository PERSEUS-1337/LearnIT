    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges the Supreme Court order to reduce California's prison population to 137.5% of design capacity by 2013. Despite efforts like the 2011 Public Safety Realignment, the prison population was still at 140% of capacity in 2014, exceeding the final cap by 2,104 inmates. Over 100,000 offenders were diverted to county supervision instead of state prisons. Proposition 47, passed in 2014, mandates misdemeanor sentencing for certain crimes in California, allowing inmates to petition for resentencing. 132 inmates have been released as of December 4, 2014, with an estimated reduction of 1,900 inmates in the 2015-16 prison population due to resentencing and fewer new admissions. Research shows that formerly incarcerated individuals benefit from training and job opportunities, reducing repeat offenses and lowering the number of people in prison. Providing workforce training to reentering individuals ensures they gain necessary skills for employment after release. Investing in services and supports for the reentry population aligns with California's workforce goals. The State Workforce Investment Board will administer a grant program with criteria for selection and outreach to eligible applicants, prioritizing small population and rural counties. Grants will be awarded competitively. The grant program, administered by the State Workforce Investment Board, prioritizes small and rural counties in awarding funds competitively. Applicants are encouraged to develop evidence-based practices for workforce training and education for individuals with postsecondary education or those needing basic education for entry-level jobs. The program will have at least two rounds of funding, with the first phase awarded by May 1, 2015. Each county can apply for the grant program, with the option for multiple counties to apply together. The application must include a partnership agreement with local workforce investment boards outlining project actions. Projects must include an education and training assessment for participants, which can be done by the applicant or another entity. Prior assessments may be used if deemed accurate by the State WIB. Eligible uses of grant funds include vocational training, stipends for trainees, and apprenticeship opportunities for the supervised population. Preference is given to applications with matching funds, involvement of nonprofit organizations, and counties with existing workforce training programs for the supervised population. Applications must meet specific requirements. An application for grant funds must set a specific purpose, define the supervised population subset, specify industry sectors for training, and outline monitoring methods for progress evaluation. Grant recipients must provide detailed information to the State Workforce Investment Board (WIB) to meet reporting requirements. The State WIB requires annual reports on fund usage and program outcomes, with an overall evaluation of program success and effectiveness based on set goals and metrics. The State WIB will submit a report to the Legislature by January 1, 2018, using information from grant recipients. The report will include recommendations on the long-term viability of workforce training programs for the supervised population, as well as an assessment of education and workforce readiness upon program entry, alignment with high-demand sectors, and job market availability for developed skills. The report will assess the effectiveness of workforce training programs for the supervised population in obtaining certifications, job readiness skills, employment opportunities, and program objectives alignment. The requirement for submitting a report will be inoperative on January 1, 2021. The report to be submitted must comply with Section 9795 of the Government Code. This act is an urgency statute for immediate cost savings by making the grant program more efficient."
