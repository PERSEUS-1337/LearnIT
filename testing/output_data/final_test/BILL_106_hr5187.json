Registration of Canadian Pesticides by States: Amending Section 24 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act to include definitions for \"Canadian pesticide\" and requirements for registration in the U.S. if it meets certain criteria. The term 'comparable domestic pesticide' refers to a pesticide registered under section 3 of the Act, not under suspension or subject to cancellation, used as a basis for comparison for required determinations. The authority to register Canadian pesticides is subject to specific criteria, including registration for the intended site of application, no pending interim administrative reviews, no sales limitations or production caps, and not classified as a restricted use pesticide. The Act allows states to register Canadian pesticides for use within the state if it complies with specific criteria and is consistent with the Act's purposes. Registration under this provision is considered a registration under section 3 of the Act. The Act allows states to register Canadian pesticides for use within the state if they meet specific criteria and are consistent with the Act's purposes. Registration must demonstrate the pesticide's similarity to a domestic pesticide and submit approved labels from the Pest Management Regulatory Agency. The Act allows states to register Canadian pesticides if they meet specific criteria, including demonstrating similarity to a domestic pesticide and obtaining approved labels from the Pest Management Regulatory Agency. The Act allows states to register Canadian pesticides if they meet specific criteria, including demonstrating similarity to a domestic pesticide and obtaining approved labels from the Pest Management Regulatory Agency. The registration process involves obtaining a label approved by the Administrator that duplicates relevant statements from the approved labeling of a comparable domestic pesticide and identifies the state in which the product may be used. The Act allows states to register Canadian pesticides if they meet specific criteria, including obtaining approved labels from the Pest Management Regulatory Agency. The label must indicate the state where the product can be used, prohibit sale and use outside that state, state that it is unlawful to use the pesticide inconsistently with approved labeling, and include the establishment number where the approved labeling will be affixed. The Administrator must be notified by the State of the registration issuance, including details like the effective date, formula, and approved labeling. If the Administrator disapproves the registration within 90 days, it will not be effective. The Administrator can disapprove a State's registration of a Canadian pesticide if it does not meet the criteria. The registration of Canadian pesticides by the State must comply with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Containers must bear the Administrator-approved label, securely attached and the only visible label. The original Canadian label must be preserved underneath the approved label. The registrant must prepare approved labels for Canadian pesticides and oversee all labeling. Labeling must be done at a registered establishment. Establishments solely for labeling are exempt from reporting requirements. The Administrator can revoke registration if necessary. If a Canadian pesticide is found to be different from a domestic pesticide, the Administrator can issue an emergency order to revoke its registration. This order can immediately stop the sale, distribution, and use of the Canadian pesticide, and require the registrant to dispose of any remaining product. A hearing can be requested within 10 days, but if not, the order becomes final without judicial review. If a State is unable to control Canadian pesticides' registration properly, the Administrator can suspend its authority. Judicial review can only be sought after a final revocation order is issued following a hearing. If a State fails to control Canadian pesticides' registration, the Administrator can suspend its authority until it can demonstrate proper control. The Administrator must notify the State and provide reasons before suspending registration. The Administrator can suspend a State's authority over pesticide registration if it fails to control it. The State must be notified and given a chance to respond within 30 days before any final action is taken. No monetary damages can be claimed against a State acting as a registering agency for injuries resulting from the use of a product registered by the State. The Administrator may disclose necessary information to a State seeking to register a Canadian pesticide, if the State certifies it can make required determinations. No tort actions can be maintained in Federal court against a registrant for damages from product adulteration if they had no knowledge of it. Upon request, the registrant of a comparable domestic pesticide must provide necessary information to a State seeking to register a Canadian pesticide, if the State can maintain confidentiality of trade secrets. The registrant of a comparable domestic pesticide must provide necessary information to the State within 15 days of a written request, or face a penalty based on cost differences between domestic and Canadian pesticides. The State registration process requires timely submission of necessary information by registrants of comparable domestic pesticides. Failure to comply may result in penalties based on cost differences. Penalties can only be assessed after providing notice and a hearing. Confidential information containing trade secrets must not be disclosed by the State. The State registration process mandates timely submission of information for comparable domestic pesticides. Failure to comply may lead to penalties. Confidential trade secrets must not be disclosed, with penalties outlined in the Act for willful disclosure. Data compensation is exempt for registrants of Canadian pesticides if held by the same entity as the domestic pesticide registration. Formulation changes must be reported to the Administrator.
