    "content": "The \"Competitiveness Tax Credit Act\" allows for a temporary investment credit for new manufacturing and productive equipment. The \"Competitiveness Tax Credit Act\" introduces a manufacturing and other productive equipment credit under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. This credit includes a domestic equipment credit and a nondomestic equipment credit. The domestic equipment credit for any taxable year is 10 percent of the product of the domestic equipment ratio and the qualified increase amount. The domestic equipment ratio is a fraction with the numerator being the aggregate bases of qualified manufacturing and other productive equipment. The nondomestic equipment credit for any taxable year is 7 percent of the amount equal to the product of the nondomestic equipment ratio and the aggregate bases of all qualified manufacturing and other productive equipment properties placed in service during that year. The nondomestic equipment ratio is a fraction that determines the credit for nondomestic equipment in a taxable year. It is calculated based on the aggregate bases of qualified non-domestic equipment properties placed in service during the year. The domestic origin of property placed in service during the taxable year is determined based on completion in the United States and at least 50% of the property's basis attributable to value added within the United States, including Puerto Rico and U.S. possessions. Qualified manufacturing and other productive equipment property refers to tangible property used in the manufacture or production of tangible personal property, increasing efficiency, and meeting specific criteria outlined in the tax code. Qualified manufacturing and other productive equipment property includes tangible property used in manufacturing or production processes, such as computer software that controls or monitors production processes and increases efficiency, eligible for depreciation or amortization. The text chunk discusses the definition of qualified increase amount for manufacturing and productive equipment property, including the base amount calculation based on fixed-base percentage and average annual gross receipts. The text chunk explains the base amount calculation for the taxpayer in the preceding taxable years, ensuring it is not less than 50 percent of the amount determined under subparagraph (A)(i). The fixed-base percentage is calculated based on the aggregate amounts described in subparagraph (A)(i) for specific taxable years. The text chunk outlines rules for rounding percentages, coordination with other credits, and the application of progress expenditure rules for certain properties. The Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990 applies to this subsection, with a termination date for property placed in service. Technical amendments include additions to section 49(a)(1)(C) and section 50(a)(2) of the Code. Section 48's heading is also amended. The Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990 applies to section 48, with amendments regarding other credits. The effective date applies to property acquired or constructed after the enactment of the Act."
