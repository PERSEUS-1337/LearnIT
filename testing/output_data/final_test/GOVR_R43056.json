    "content": "Federal rulemaking is a key mechanism for implementing policy by federal agencies under statutory authority granted by Congress. Congress may oversee regulations by measuring federal regulatory activity, often using the number of rules issued annually and total pages in the Federal Register as indicators. However, quantifying regulatory activity may not accurately reflect the total rulemaking burden, as many rules are routine and impose minimal regulatory impact. The Federal Register documents government regulatory actions, with the total number of pages used as a measure of regulatory activity. However, this may not accurately reflect the true regulatory burden as the Federal Register includes items unrelated to regulations. This report analyzes different methods to measure federal rulemaking activity to inform the congressional debate. The report provides an overview of how agencies issue rules, including statutory requirements, executive orders, and guidance documents. It analyzes the total number of rules issued each year, categorizing them as \"major,\" \"significant,\" or \"economically significant.\" These categories trigger specific requirements, such as cost-benefit analysis and review by OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. Data on the number of pages and documents in the Federal Register each year is also presented. The report analyzes the content of the Federal Register and describes the statutory and executive requirements governing the rulemaking process. The Administrative Procedure Act of 1946 is the most significant statute in this process. The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) defines a rule as an agency statement implementing law or policy. It sets standards for rulemaking procedures, including informal rulemaking. Agencies must publish a notice of proposed rulemaking, accept comments, and wait 30 days before a rule becomes effective. The APA allows agencies to skip notice and comment if traditional procedures are impracticable, unnecessary, or against the public interest. The APA allows agencies to skip notice and comment procedures if they are deemed impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. Additional statutory requirements, such as the Paperwork Reduction Act and the Regulatory Flexibility Act, have been added to the rulemaking process since the enactment of the APA in 1980. Agencies must consider paperwork burdens and conduct regulatory flexibility analyses for rules impacting small entities. Title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) of 1995 added requirements for agencies to analyze costs resulting from regulations containing federal mandates upon state, local, and tribal governments and the private sector. The analysis requirement in UMRA is triggered when a rule \"may result in the expenditure by State, local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100,000,000 or more (adjusted annually for inflation) in any 1 year.\" The Congressional Review Act (CRA), enacted in 1996, established a mechanism for reviewing rules with significant economic impact on small entities. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) of 1996 allows Congress to overturn federal regulations through a joint resolution of disapproval. Major rules with a $100 million economic impact must have a delayed effective date of at least 60 days. The CRA has been used once to overturn a rule. Presidents have issued executive orders and OMB has provided guidance for agencies on rulemaking. E.O. 12866 requires OIRA to review significant regulatory actions at proposed and final rule stages. E.O. 12866 requires agencies to assess costs and benefits for significant rules, perform cost-benefit analysis for economically significant regulatory actions, and consider feasible alternatives. OIRA review and cost-benefit analysis guidelines do not apply to independent regulatory agencies. OMB Circular A-4 provides best practices for agencies' regulatory impact analyses. President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama issued guidelines and executive orders on rulemaking and guidance documents for agencies. E.O. 13563 instructed agencies to conduct retrospective reviews of regulations, with E.O. 13579 extending this to independent regulatory agencies. The number of rules published in the Federal Register has been in the thousands each year since 1976. The number of regulations issued each year is generally in the thousands, but many are routine matters. For example, a temporary deviation from the operating schedule of the Third Street Drawbridge in San Francisco was issued by the U.S. Coast Guard. These temporary changes do not affect the permanent rules in the Code of Federal Regulations. Regulations are published in the \"Rules and Regulations\" section of the Federal Register, including both new regulations and deregulatory actions. The APA defines \"rulemaking\" as the agency process for formulating, amending, or repealing a rule. Not all regulations issued each year are new regulatory actions; some may be minor amendments or deregulatory actions. The CRA, enacted in 1996, established procedures for congressional review of agency regulations. Each federal agency must send its covered final rules to GAO and Congress before they can take effect. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) requires federal agencies to send their final rules to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and Congress before they can take effect. The CRA also defines \"major\" rules as those with significant economic impacts or adverse effects on competition, employment, or innovation. Major rules must meet specific requirements before they can become effective. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) mandates that major rules have delayed effective dates and require a report from the Comptroller General to congressional committees within 15 days. The report includes agency compliance details and is posted on GAO's website. Data on major rules published since 1997 are available in GAO's database. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) requires major rules to have delayed effective dates and a report from the Comptroller General to congressional committees within 15 days. A 2011 CRS report analyzed major rules published in 2010, identifying various reasons for their classification, such as transfers of funds, consumer spending prompts, establishment of fees, and expected annual benefits or costs of at least $100 million. Under E.O. 12866, significant rules must have annual effects of $100 million or more, impact the economy, productivity, jobs, environment, or create legal or policy issues. Agencies (excluding independent regulatory agencies) must submit rules to OIRA for centralized review. Under E.O. 12866, significant rules with annual effects of $100 million or more must be submitted to OIRA for centralized review. Agencies need to provide specific information including the text of the action, rationale, costs and benefits, and alignment with the President's priorities. Data on the number of significant rules issued annually is not readily available, but the number of reviews at OIRA can be tracked. The number of \"significant\" rules reviewed at OIRA each year may give an idea of annual regulatory activity. Data on the total number of reviews at OIRA annually from 1994 to 2015, including various types of rules, is available. \"Economically significant\" rules are those with annual effects on the economy of $100 million or more. The curr_chunk discusses the criteria for rules to be considered \"economically significant\" and the requirement for agencies to conduct a cost-benefit analysis for such rules. It highlights the similarities and differences between the definitions of \"economically significant\" and major rules, with the main distinction being the broader scope of major rules. The curr_chunk discusses additional rules captured by the CRA definition that may not be considered \"economically significant\" under E.O. 12866, particularly those affecting US-based enterprises' competitiveness. Tables show the number of reviews by OIRA each year and average review times for different types of reviews from 1994 to 2015. OIRA has specific timelines for reviewing regulatory actions, with a 10-day response time for preliminary actions and a 90-day review period for proposed and final rules. There are no consequences for missing deadlines. Economically significant rules are reviewed faster, possibly due to their higher importance and collaboration between OIRA and regulatory agencies before the official review. Under the APA, agencies must follow specific steps when issuing a rule, including publishing a proposed rule, allowing for public comments, and a 30-day waiting period before the rule takes effect. Agencies can bypass some requirements with \"good cause\" but must provide reasons and face judicial review. The good cause exception allows federal agencies to bypass typical notice-and-comment procedures when issuing rules. This exception can be used for interim final rulemaking, where a post-promulgation comment period is held, or for direct final rulemaking for routine or noncontroversial rules. Agencies must provide reasons for invoking the good cause exception and may face judicial review. The Federal Register requires agencies to publish proposed and final rules, along with other related items. If no adverse comments are received, a rule will become effective. Scholars use the total number of Federal Register pages as a proxy for regulatory activity, although this may not be entirely accurate. The Federal Register was created in 1935 to document the increasing number of rules and regulations associated with the New Deal. It may not accurately measure regulatory activity due to the changing role of federal agencies during that time. The Federal Register, created in 1935, serves as a centralized mechanism for documenting federal government actions. Approximately 30% of its pages are dedicated to publishing final rules, with the rest used for presidential documents, proposed rules, notices, and corrections. The Federal Register, established in 1935, is a central hub for federal government actions. Around 30% of its pages contain final rules, while the rest cover presidential documents, proposed rules, notices, and corrections. Additional sections in the Federal Register often contain blank pages or skips to allow for other materials. Many final rules are amendments to previously issued rules, and eliminating an existing rule is also considered a \"rulemaking\" action. When agencies publish rules, they include a preamble in the Federal Register. The Federal Register contains final rules, presidential documents, proposed rules, notices, and corrections. When agencies publish rules, they include a preamble with relevant information and history, comments received, final decisions, and required analyses. The actual regulatory text in a rule may be small compared to the entire document. For example, a rule issued by the Department of Health and Human Services was 137 pages, with 121 pages for the preamble and 16 pages amending regulations. The preamble of a rule in the Federal Register can be extensive, with a large portion dedicated to discussing comments received, costs, benefits, and information collections. The number of pages in the Federal Register may not accurately reflect the regulatory burden of a rule, as a short rule could impose a significant burden on many entities, while a lengthy rule may have less burdensome requirements but more detail. The length of a rule in the Federal Register could be influenced by factors such as the number of comments received or the depth of the cost-benefit analysis. The number of pages in the Federal Register has increased over time, reaching a peak of 87,012 pages in 1980, decreasing to 47,418 pages in 1986, and then fluctuating between 65,000 and 85,000 pages for the past two decades. Table 6 provides a detailed breakdown of the total page count and the number of rulemaking documents in each section of the Federal Register from 1976 to 2015. The number of documents published in the proposed rule and final rule sections of the Federal Register from 1976 to 2015 may not accurately reflect the total number of rules issued each year due to inclusion of non-rule documents. For example, a document related to regulation but not a regulation itself was published in the final rules section in 2012. Some pages and documents may be reducing the burden of a previously issued rule by amending or repealing it, as an amendment or repeal is considered a rule under the APA's definition of \"rulemaking.\""
