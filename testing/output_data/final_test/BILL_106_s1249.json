    "content": "The Act titled \"Nazi Benefits Termination Act of 1999\" denies federal public benefits to Nazi persecutors. The \"Nazi Benefits Termination Act of 1999\" prohibits individuals determined to have participated in Nazi persecution from receiving Federal public benefits. The \"Nazi Benefits Termination Act of 1999\" prohibits individuals involved in Nazi persecution from receiving Federal public benefits or citizenship if obtained illegally or through misrepresentation. SEC. 3. DETERMINATIONS. If the Attorney General suspects an individual receiving a Federal public benefit may have been involved in Nazi persecution, a hearing may be held before an immigration judge. Respondents, including U.S. citizens and permanent residents, have the right to appear at the hearing. Respondents who are not citizens, permanent resident aliens, or present in the United States during the proceeding may appear via video conference. The Act does not allow the return of individuals inadmissible under certain sections of the Immigration and Nationality Act. At the hearing, respondents can have legal representation at no cost, present evidence, cross-examine witnesses, and request subpoenas. The immigration judge can conduct hearings, examine witnesses, issue subpoenas, and apply rules of evidence similar to removal proceedings. Within 60 days of the hearing, the judge must make findings and conclusions on whether the respondent participated in Nazi persecution. The immigration judge can issue an order declaring the respondent ineligible for Federal public benefits if they find by a preponderance of evidence that the respondent has been a participant in Nazi persecution. The immigration judge can issue an order dismissing the proceeding if there is insufficient evidence that the respondent has been a participant in Nazi persecution. The order issued shall be effective immediately, and there is a limitation of liability for providing a benefit. The Attorney General may review any finding or order under subsection (c) within 30 days. If no review is done, the finding or order becomes final. The Attorney General is responsible for serving the final order. The Attorney General serves the final order with findings of fact and conclusions of law to the respondent. Any party can seek a review of the final order by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit within 30 days. Issue and claim preclusion rules apply in administrative or judicial proceedings under this Act. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has jurisdiction over appeals from final orders issued under the Nazi Benefits Termination Act of 1999, as per an amendment to Section 1295(a) of title 28, United States Code."
