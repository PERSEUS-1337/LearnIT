    "content": "In the individual market, individuals and families can buy health plans on their own. The group market offers health plans through a plan sponsor, usually an employer, and is divided into small and large segments based on the number of individuals in the group. States can define small groups as having 50 or 100 individuals, while large groups have at least 51 or 101 individuals depending on the state's small-group definition. The group market refers to health plans purchased by employers or plan sponsors from state-licensed issuers for employees. Plans can be fully insured or self-insured, with employers bearing the risk for self-insured plans. States regulate health insurance, with each state requiring insurance issuers to be licensed. The 1945 McCarran-Ferguson Act codifies state requirements for health insurance issuers to be licensed in each state. State regulations vary widely and have evolved over time in response to changing attitudes and federal policies. State oversight applies to state-licensed issuers, while self-insured plans are not subject to state law. Federal regulations also govern state-licensed issuers and their plans, following a federalism model where federal law sets standards. The federal government establishes minimum standards for health insurance, with states responsible for monitoring compliance. States can add extra requirements as long as they don't conflict with federal law. For example, federal rating restrictions limit premium variations based on four factors. Some states have further restrictions on premium variations. Federal regulations also apply to self-insured plans under federal oversight of employment-based benefits. Federal requirements for health plans, governed by the Public Health Service Act (PHSA), ERISA, and the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), differ for self-insured plans compared to fully insured plans. PHSA applies broadly across private plans, while ERISA and IRC focus on group plans. Some plans are exempt from certain federal requirements. Federal requirements for health plans sold in the PHI market affect insurance offered to groups and individuals, establishing a federal floor for coverage, premiums, benefits, cost sharing, and consumer protections. Plans exempt from federal requirements are not discussed in this report. The requirements are categorized under obtaining coverage, keeping coverage, health insurance premiums, covered services, cost-sharing limits, consumer assistance, patient protections, and plan requirements. Federal requirements for health plans in the PHI market vary depending on the type of plan. Plans in the individual and small-group markets must cover essential health benefits, while large-group and self-insured plans are not required to do so. These requirements were established under the ACA, with some modifications made to pre-existing regulations. Under the ACA, certain health plans must be offered on a guaranteed-issue basis, accepting all applicants as long as they agree to the terms. Plans in the group market must be available for purchase at any time, but can deny coverage in specific circumstances. Plans cannot base eligibility on health status. Plans must offer coverage to all applicants without considering health status-related factors. Dependent coverage must be available for children under 26, both married and unmarried. Sponsors of health plans are prohibited from setting eligibility criteria. Sponsors of health plans are prohibited from establishing eligibility criteria based on any full-time employee's salary. Discrimination in favor of higher-wage employees is not allowed. Self-insured plans must comply with these rules, while fully insured plans do not have to until regulations are issued. Waiting periods longer than 90 days are prohibited. Plans are prohibited from establishing waiting periods longer than 90 days. Guaranteed renewability allows for plan renewal at the option of the policyholder or plan sponsor, with discontinuation only under specific circumstances such as non-payment of premiums or fraud. Rescission is the retroactive cancellation of medical coverage after an enrollee becomes sick. Rescission refers to the retroactive cancellation of medical coverage after an enrollee becomes sick or injured, allowed only in cases of fraud or intentional misrepresentation. Plan sponsors with at least 20 employees must offer continuation coverage to eligible employees and their dependents for up to 18 months following a qualifying event, charging up to 102% of the premium. Beneficiaries may be charged up to 102% of the premium for coverage, with plans prohibited from varying premiums based on health status-related factors. Premium discounts can be offered for wellness program participation. Adjusted community rating rules must be used to determine premiums, allowing variation based on factors like type of enrollment. Plans may vary premiums based on type of enrollment, geographic rating area, tobacco use, and age. Tobacco users may be charged up to 1.5 times the premium. Older individuals cannot be charged more than three times the premium of a 21-year-old. States can establish rating areas based on counties, zip codes, or metropolitan areas. Uniform age rating curves must be used for specifying rates across age bands. For plan years starting in 2018, health insurance plans must use specific age bands for premium pricing. The rate review program evaluates proposed rate increases meeting or exceeding a 15% threshold for 2019. States can set their own thresholds. Plans under review must justify rate hikes to CMS and states before implementation, with disclosure requirements. The process does not grant authority to deny rate increases but aims to publicly expose them. The rate review program evaluates proposed rate increases meeting or exceeding a 15% threshold for 2019. States can set their own thresholds. Plans under review must justify rate hikes to CMS and states before implementation, with disclosure requirements. A risk pool is used to develop rates for coverage, with all enrollees in individual plans considered members of a single risk pool. Plans are prohibited from restricting the length of a hospital stay for childbirth for either the mother or newborn. Health insurance plans must cover mental health and substance use disorder services at parity with medical and surgical services. They must also cover mastectomies, prosthetic devices, and reconstructive surgery. Insurance issuers are prohibited from using genetic information for coverage decisions. Plans must cover essential health benefits (EHB) which are not defined in federal law but include 10 broad categories. The HHS Secretary directs each state to select an EHB benchmark plan. States can still maintain or establish state-mandated benefits. States can maintain or establish state-mandated benefits as part of the Essential Health Benefits (EHB) requirement. However, any additional benefits mandated after December 31, 2011, must be covered by the state. Plans are required to cover preventive health services without cost sharing, including evidence-based items and immunizations recommended by the CDC. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and preventive care guidelines supported by HRSA recommend preventive services for infants, children, adolescents, and women. Plans are not required to cover additional services not recommended by USPSTF without cost sharing. Out-of-network providers may not be covered for required preventive services, and cost-sharing may apply for out-of-network preventive services. Plans can determine coverage limitations for preventive services without specified details by relying on established techniques and evidence. They cannot exclude coverage for preexisting health conditions and may offer premium discounts for wellness program participation. If a wellness program provides a reward based on meeting health standards, it must comply with federal regulations. The reward cannot exceed 30% of employee-only coverage cost, but may be increased to 50% at the discretion of HHS, Labor, and Treasury. Plans must also adhere to annual limits on out-of-pocket spending, with 2018 limits at $7,350 for self-only coverage and $14,700 for other coverage. In 2019, these limits will be $7,900 and $15,800 respectively. The self-only limit applies to each individual, regardless of their coverage type. Plans must adhere to specific levels of actuarial value, which determine the share of cost sharing imposed on enrollees. Lower actuarial values result in higher cost sharing. Federal law requires plan generosity levels to be designated by a precious metal and correspond to an actuarial value. Regulations allow plans to fall within a specified actuarial value range. Plans must adhere to specific levels of actuarial value, which determine cost sharing for enrollees. Plans are prohibited from setting lifetime and annual limits on Essential Health Benefits (EHB). Lifetime and annual limits are dollar limits on covered health benefits. Plans can place limits on non-EHBs if permitted by law. Plans must provide a Summary of Benefits and Coverage (SBC) at various stages, meeting specific requirements. Plans must provide a Summary of Benefits and Coverage (SBC) to enrollees, including a uniform glossary of terms. They must also report the percentage of premium revenue spent on medical claims (MLR), with minimum MLR requirements of 80% for individual and small-group plans and 85% for large groups. States can adjust these percentages, and the HHS Secretary has the authority to lower them if necessary. Plans must implement an effective appeals process for coverage determinations and claims, including an internal claims appeals process, notice to enrollees about available appeals processes, and the ability for enrollees to review their files and receive continued coverage pending the outcome. Plans are also required to allow enrollees to designate a participating primary care provider. Enrollees can designate any available participating primary care provider or pediatric care for plan participants. Plans covering obstetrical or gynecological care cannot require authorization for female enrollees seeking care from in-network specialists. Emergency services in hospital emergency departments must be covered without prior authorization or limitations. Plans must provide coverage for emergency services regardless of the provider's network status. They are also required to allow qualified individuals access to approved clinical trials without discrimination. Additionally, plans cannot discriminate against healthcare providers acting within their scope of practice. The ACA does not mandate plans to contract with all healthcare providers, allowing for varying reimbursement rates based on quality or performance measures. The HHS Secretary was tasked with developing quality reporting requirements and regulations for provider reimbursement structures within two years of the ACA's enactment. The GAO was required to conduct a study on the impact of these activities on quality and cost within 180 days of the regulations being published. The HHS Secretary was required to develop quality reporting requirements and regulations for provider reimbursement structures under the ACA. The GAO study on the impact of these activities has not been published yet. The DOL proposed a rule to modify annual reporting requirements for pension and employee benefit plans, which would satisfy quality reporting requirements once implemented. Plans would report on financial condition and operations using standardized forms. Plans will submit annual reports to the HHS Secretary, DOL, and Treasury, as well as enrollees, to address whether benefits and reimbursement structures improve health outcomes through quality reporting, care coordination, and chronic disease management. The HHS Secretary will make these reports public and can impose penalties for noncompliance. Wellness activities include services for smoking cessation, weight management, stress management, and diabetes prevention. Wellness activities such as disease prevention, healthy lifestyle support, and diabetes prevention may be provided by health care providers through health risk assessments and intervention efforts for program participants."
