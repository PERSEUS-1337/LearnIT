    "content": "The United States and the European Union have a longstanding trade dispute over the EU's ban on hormone-treated meat since the 1980s. Despite WTO decisions, disagreements persist on legal, procedural, and scientific issues. The U.S. sees the ban as disguised protectionism. In 2009, changes to EU products subject to increased tariffs were announced by the U.S. Trade Representative. In 2009, the EU and the US signed a memorandum of understanding to resolve a trade dispute over hormone-treated meat. The EU granted market access to US beef raised without growth promotants, and the US suspended retaliatory tariffs. However, in 2016, the US reinstated tariffs due to concerns about beef access to the EU market. The EU and US signed a memorandum of understanding in 2009 to resolve a trade dispute over hormone-treated meat. In 2016, the US reinstated tariffs due to concerns about beef access to the EU market. A public hearing is scheduled for 2017 to address ongoing trade negotiations between the two countries. Members of Congress are pushing for the EU's hormone ban to be lifted as part of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership negotiations. The EU maintains restrictions on U.S. beef imports, banning hormone-treated meat. Hormones are widely used in U.S. beef production to promote growth. Producers use hormones in beef production to allow animals to grow larger and leaner more quickly, reducing production costs. Growth-promoting hormones include natural and synthetic compounds like estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, zeranol, and trenbolone acetate. Melengestrol acetate can also be used to improve weight gain and feed efficiency. The FDA and USDA regulate the use of hormones in livestock to ensure safety. The FDA and USDA regulate the use of growth promotants for livestock, including hormones in beef production. Several countries, such as the United States, Canada, Australia, and others, have approved the use of growth-promoting hormones in beef production. However, the European Union and some European countries prohibit the use of hormones in beef production. The European Commission banned the production and importation of meat from animals treated with growth-promoting hormones in the early 1980s. The ban covers six hormones, with one permanently banned and the others provisionally banned. The EU banned the use of five hormones in meat production as a precautionary measure to protect consumer health. This ban restricts trade of meat from countries using these growth promotants, stemming from concerns over health effects and illegal hormone use in the past. The EU banned the use of hormones in meat production due to health concerns and illegal use in the past. This decision was influenced by outbreaks of mad cow disease in British cattle herds during the 1990s, leading to consumer distrust in the safety of the meat supply. The discovery of BSE-infected cattle in some European countries further complicated the meat hormone dispute. EU beef producers are hesitant to use hormones, fearing it may deter consumers from buying meat. The EU's ban on hormone-treated beef is influenced by health concerns, consumer distrust, and political/economic factors. Opposition to hormone-treated meat persists, with pressure from producer and consumer groups to maintain the ban. The EU's beef sector faces challenges with surplus beef and competition from cheaper imports. The EU's ban on hormone-treated beef is influenced by health concerns, consumer distrust, and political/economic factors. The United States challenges the ban in the WTO, questioning its consistency with EU obligations. The dispute involves internal regulations, domestic policies, and trade restrictions. The EU maintains a ban on hormone-treated beef, citing consumer worries, animal welfare, and health risks. The US questions the validity of the ban and claims there is scientific consensus supporting the safety of hormone-treated meat. The United States imposed trade sanctions on the EU for banning hormone-treated meat, authorized by the WTO. A mixed ruling in 2008 allowed the US to continue sanctions while the EU maintained its ban. Detailed timeline and dispute settlement process information available in the report. In the 1980s, the United States invoked GATT dispute settlement over the EU ban on hormone-treated meat, leading to retaliatory tariffs. The dispute continued with WTO consultations and a panel case against the EU, joined by Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. The EU maintained the ban despite challenges, resulting in a prolonged trade dispute. In August 1997, the WTO dispute settlement panel agreed with the United States that the EU ban on hormone-treated meat violated SPS Agreement provisions. The EU appealed, and in February 1998, the WTO Appellate Body confirmed the violation but allowed for a risk assessment. Subsequently, a WTO arbitration panel ruled for a 15-month deadline for compliance. The EU did not complete its scientific review by the deadline set by the WTO, leading to US trade sanctions on EU products in July 1999. The EU continued the ban on hormone-treated meat citing concerns about carcinogenic effects of estradiol-17\u03b2. Additional scientific reviews were conducted in 2000, 2002, and 2007. In 2003, the EU concluded that estradiol-17\u03b2 was carcinogenic and provisionally banned five other hormones due to insufficient scientific knowledge. The EU issued a new directive to permanently ban estradiol-17\u03b2 and provisionally ban the other hormones, claiming compliance with WTO obligations. The United States questioned the EU's risk assessments, while the EU sought more scientific information for the provisional ban. The EU replaced its original ban with a provisional ban, claiming compliance with WTO obligations. U.S. officials rejected EU studies on hormone-treated meat, stating they do not establish a risk to consumers. The EU initiated counteractions against the U.S., requesting WTO consultations to remove retaliatory measures. The EU initiated new WTO dispute settlement proceedings against the United States and Canada in 2005. The final panel report in 2008 faulted all three parties for various substantive and procedural aspects of the dispute. The EU was criticized for not providing enough scientific evidence to justify the import ban, while the US and Canada were faulted for maintaining their trade sanctions. Both parties were found to have violated procedural rules under the WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding. The WTO Appellate Body issued a ruling in October 2008 allowing trade sanctions on the EU by the US and Canada, but also permitting the EU to maintain its ban on hormone-treated beef imports. The EU's ban was deemed compatible with WTO law, giving the EU more authority in setting food safety regulations. Compliance panel proceedings were recommended to determine EU's adherence to WTO obligations in the beef hormone dispute. The EU requested consultations under Article 21.5 and may request a panel later. The WTO Appellate Body's decision on scientific evidence could set a precedent for dispute settlement panels to be more deferential to national governments. This might lead to more flexibility in imposing SPS requirements in future compliance panels and change how panels operate on burden of proof and post-retaliation situations. Typically, complainants bear the burden of proof in compliance panel proceedings. In November 2008, the EU filed a new WTO challenge against U.S. and Canadian sanctions in response to the EU's ban on hormone-treated beef. In January 2009, USTR made changes to the list of EU products subject to increased tariffs, leading to further escalation of the dispute. After negotiations, the United States and the EU signed a memorandum of understanding in May 2009 to phase in certain changes over several years. The EU maintains a lack of data on hormone-treated meat residues, leading to a disagreement on the safety for human consumption. A 1997 WTO decision found the EU's ban on hormone-treated meat imports inconsistent with WTO obligations due to a lack of risk assessment. The EU commissioned 17 studies to address the scientific basis of the import ban on meat and meat products treated with hormones for growth promotion purposes. The studies covered toxicological and carcinogenicity aspects, residue analysis, potential abuse and control problems, and environmental aspects of six growth promotants. The EC's Scientific Committee on Veterinary Measures issued opinions on the potential risks to human health from hormone residues in bovine meat and meat products. The first review's opinion stated that estradiol-17\u03b2, used in U.S. cattle production, is carcinogenic. The EU commissioned 17 studies to address the import ban on meat treated with hormones for growth promotion. The EC's Scientific Committee on Veterinary Measures concluded that estradiol-17\u03b2 used in U.S. cattle production is carcinogenic. Subsequent reviews in 2000, 2002, and 2007 reaffirmed these findings regarding the potential health risks to consumers from hormone residues in bovine meat. The EFSA's Scientific Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain concluded that there is convincing evidence linking red meat consumption to hormone-dependent cancers. However, the association between hormone residues in meat and cancer risk remains unknown. Excess intake of hormone residues from all six hormones and their metabolites could pose a risk to consumers, with estradiol-17\u03b2 being considered a carcinogen. The new data available do not provide quantitative information for risk assessment, and no revision of previous assessments is deemed necessary. The EFSA's Scientific Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain found that all six hormones, including estradiol-17\u03b2, may have harmful effects on health, particularly for vulnerable groups like children. The panel concluded that there is no safe threshold level for these hormones and recommended against their use in cattle for growth promotion. The EU argues that the US tariffs on EU exports are not in line with WTO rules. The United States maintains that tariffs on EU exports are not compliant with WTO rules and should be stopped. They argue that U.S. beef from cattle treated with approved growth hormones is safe, supported by scientific consensus and international standards. Numerous studies support the safety of these hormones when used in accordance with good veterinary practices. The United States cites various scientific studies supporting the safety of hormones in cattle, including reports from the U.S. FDA, international food safety institutions, and committees such as the JECFA and Codex Alimentarius Commission. The United States cites scientific studies supporting the safety of natural hormones as growth-promoting agents in cattle, stating they do not pose a risk to consumers. Reports recommend acceptable intake levels for synthetic hormones and highlight the lack of evidence for health risks from natural hormones in meat production. The report states that scientific evidence does not show any identifiable risk to human health from using hormones for growth promotion if good practices are followed. The United States criticizes the EU for focusing on estradiol-17\u03b2's genotoxicity and neglecting other hormones, claiming the EU's studies lack solid evaluative methods and disregard evidence showing estradiol does not increase cancer risk in meat from treated animals. The United States disputes the EU's scientific reviews on hormone use in meat, claiming they lack new evidence and do not serve as a risk assessment. The US argues that the EU's 2003 update to its hormone ban is not compliant with WTO obligations and should be stopped, a view echoed by industry groups like the National Cattlemen's Beef Association. The National Cattlemen's Beef Association and other U.S. farm groups oppose the EU's ban on hormone-treated beef, citing lack of scientific justification. Trade analysts believe the U.S. has a strong case under WTO rules. Pressure is being exerted on U.S. trade officials to maintain their position on the issue. The United States imposed retaliatory tariffs on EU imports in the 1980s due to the EU's ban on hormone-treated beef. The tariffs were initially suspended in 1987 but reinstated in 1989. The higher tariffs remained in place until May 1996 when the EU sought a WTO panel against the U.S. In 1999, the U.S. and Canada obtained WTO authorization to retaliate against EU trade due to the EU's failure to implement WTO recommendations. The U.S. imposed retaliatory tariffs on EU imports in the 1980s due to the EU's ban on hormone-treated beef. In 1999, the U.S. announced a 100% ad valorem rate of duty on specific products from certain EU member states, targeting France, Germany, Italy, Denmark, and others. The list of products included beef, pork, cheese, truffles, onions, carrots, soups, yarn, mustard, juices, chocolate, and jams. The U.K. was not included in the list due to its support for lifting the ban. Appendix A lists the products affected by U.S. trade sanctions in 1999, imposed to restore trade concessions under the WTO. Critics argue that these retaliatory duties are ineffective and harm U.S. and EU consumers. The U.S. beef industry believes the EU ban is a trade barrier to protect domestic producers, while some in Congress question the ban's motives. The EU maintains that the U.S. sanctions are unjustified. In October 2008, USTR initiated action to modify the retaliation list of EU products subject to 100% tariffs in connection with the U.S.-EU beef hormones dispute, consistent with legislation enacted by Congress in 2000. The law included a provision requiring the Administration to periodically rotate the types of products targeted for trade retaliation. USTR considered modifying the retaliation list in 2006 but ultimately decided not to do so. Public comments were sent to USTR in late 2008. In late 2008, public comments were sent to USTR regarding the modification of the retaliation list of EU products subject to increased tariffs. The USTR announced changes to the list in January 2009, adding products from newly acceded EU countries and additional products like pork, cut flowers, fruits, nuts, and oats. Some products were removed from the list. The USTR modified the retaliation list of EU products in January 2009, adding new items and increasing tariffs on Roquefort cheese to 300%. The EU considered this an escalation of the dispute and planned to seek a dispute settlement panel. In March 2009, USTR delayed imposing additional duties on EU products until May 2009. In April 2009, USTR extended the delay on imposing additional duties on EU products until May 2009 to negotiate a settlement. Key issues included increased market access for U.S. beef and the EU refraining from seeking a new WTO ruling. In May 2009, a memorandum of understanding was signed between the United States and the EU, setting up three phases to resolve the dispute, including expanded market access for beef to the EU. The United States and the EU signed a memorandum of understanding in May 2009 to resolve a dispute over beef imports. The agreement included three phases, with Phase 1 involving a new quota of 20,000 MT of hormone-free beef and a delay in implementing increased duties for certain EU imports. Phase 2 would expand market access for High Quality Beef to 45,000 MT and reduce increased duties to zero. Phase 3 would maintain the tariff-rate quota for High Quality Beef. Phase 3 of the agreement between the United States and the EU maintains a tariff-rate quota for High Quality Beef at 45,000 MT. The United States would remove import duties on selected EU products, potentially leading to a longer-term resolution of the dispute. Some U.S. farm organizations were unhappy with the agreement as it did not address the EU's ban on beef from hormone-treated cattle or the safety of hormone-treated beef. In 2010, the United States shipped about 16,500 MT of beef products to the EU under a quota that requires animals to be hormone-free. The U.S. agreed not to implement higher retaliatory duties on EU exports in Phase 1 of the agreement. Trade sanctions were to remain on certain EU exports until the final phase of the agreement. In May 2011, USTR terminated higher duties for imported products listed under the dispute, ahead of schedule to encourage a successful transition to Phase 2 of the MOU. In June 2012, the EU increased the HQB quota to 48,200 MT and changed the quota management system to \"first come, first served\" basis, aiming to provide easier quota access to new and smaller importers of U.S. beef. In October 2013, the EU approved a two-year extension of the deal, allowing access to U.S. beef raised without growth promotants in exchange for the U.S. suspending retaliatory import duties on some EU food products. The EU and United States opted not to proceed to Phase 3, which would require the EU to maintain its annual TRQ of 45,000 MT and the U.S. to end its retaliatory import duties. As of year-end 2016, Phase 3 of the MOU has not been entered into. USTR and the U.S. beef industry continue to monitor EU policies affecting market access for U.S. beef products. The EU increased the TRQ for high-quality beef to 45,000 MT in 2012, but most of it has been filled by other countries, not the U.S. The EU has been unwilling to allocate a significant part of the TRQ for the U.S., leading to concerns about U.S. beef access to the EU market. A public hearing is scheduled for 2017 to address this issue. Several countries, including Argentina, Brazil, India, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Paraguay, and Uruguay, argue that the U.S.-EU agreement on TRQ is discriminatory and violates WTO rules. They claim that all most-favored-nation countries should have access to the TRQ. Brazil may request a WTO investigation into potential preferential treatment for U.S. and Canadian beef over Brazilian beef. These countries invoke MFN status to demand equal treatment and trade advantages for all trading partners. The EU maintains that it has complied with the 2009 Memorandum of Understanding with the U.S. regarding the TRQ. The U.S-EU beef hormone dispute is a key issue in the T-TIP negotiations. Some Members of Congress want the EU's hormone ban lifted to resolve trade disputes. Concerns include meat and poultry production methods, BSE regulations, and plant processing rules. In 2014, the EU indicated it would not change its stance on hormone use. In February 2014, European Commissioner Karl De Gucht stated that the EU would maintain its ban on imports of meat raised with growth promotants, including hormone-treated meat. The EU restricts most meat exports to a limited quantity of hormone-free beef. The U.S. is seeking to resolve issues with the EU's disapproval of using antimicrobial treatments in the beef industry to prevent contamination. The EU has lifted its ban on using lactic acid as a pathogen reduction treatment on beef carcasses in 2013, but still prohibits other types of treatments and antimicrobial washes. Some U.S. importers are contesting higher tariffs on U.S. imports to the EU. Gilda Industries protested higher tariffs on toasted breads to U.S. Customs and later sued the United States in the U.S. Court of International Trade. The United States and Canada have maintained trade sanctions on hormone-treated meat despite EU claims. The CIT ordered a refund of punitive duties on affected goods imported after July 29, 2007, which the United States appealed. Toasted breads were eventually removed from the retaliation list. Nestle Waters of North America, Inc. also contested proposed changes adding imported waters to EU products subject to higher U.S. tariffs. Nestle Waters of North America, Inc. filed a preliminary injunction against higher U.S. tariffs. Gilda Industries and other importing companies sought a refund of retaliatory duties. The U.S. Court of Appeals decision in the Gilda Industries case may make certain food importers eligible for refunds. U.S. beef exports lost due to the EU ban were estimated at $100 million annually. The EU ban on U.S. beef exports includes quotas and certification requirements to prevent hormone-treated beef. Discrepancies in trade data complicate evaluating actual export trends. EU import data since 1999 is examined due to concerns about U.S. export data accuracy. The EU ban on U.S. beef exports, including quotas and certification requirements to prevent hormone-treated beef, has impacted U.S. beef exports to the EU. Data from 1999 onwards show that U.S. beef accounted for less than 1% of EU beef imports, with the majority coming from Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay. U.S. beef exports to the EU averaged between $11 million and $13 million annually from 1989 to 1998, but rose to an estimated $165 million in 2010. In recent years, U.S. beef exports to the EU have increased, especially for fresh and chilled beef products, reaching nearly $260 million in 2015. U.S. beef accounted for about 17% of EU fresh/chilled beef imports, up from 4% in 2008. The rise in exports may be due to the approval of more U.S. beef plants to export to the EU under the Non-Hormone Treated Cattle Program. Volume shipments are limited by the EU's \"Hilton quota\" for high-quality beef. The EU has a quota for high-quality beef imports, allowing 11,500 MT of fresh/chilled beef from North America at a 20% tariff. Additionally, there is an annual TRQ for 45,000 MT of hormone-free beef from certain countries, including the U.S. Beef shipments to the EU have doubled in recent years, with 12,000 MT shipped in 2009. In 2009, U.S. beef shipments to the EU doubled to 12,000 MT under the revised quota. Only beef from cattle raised under USDA's NHTC Program is eligible for export to the EU, with more than a dozen approved sources as of December 2016. All export shipments must be accompanied by a health certificate issued by FSIS. All export shipments to the EU must be accompanied by a health certificate from FSIS certifying that the meat is from non-hormone treated cattle. Import licenses are issued by EU member states, with the quantity available published monthly. Initially, few U.S. plants were approved for export, leading to low volume exports. Negotiations to increase the quota have been unsuccessful in the past, but recently larger facilities have been approved, leading to higher volume exports. Some larger facilities have been approved for export, with volume exports approaching or exceeding the quota limit. The EU has offered to expand access for U.S. beef by 58,000 metric tons, but unresolved issues remain in negotiations. The United States is seeking changes to simplify the current system and reduce requirements for plants. The United States is seeking to simplify the current system and reduce requirements for plants, as well as reduce the number of chemical residues inspectors must test for. The EU objects to antimicrobial washes on beef exports without adequate labeling. Previous disputes over hormone detection in beef shipments have also slowed negotiations. In the 1990s, the EU and the United States discussed various options to resolve a dispute over hormone-treated beef imports. The US rejected options like compensation and labeling, preferring full removal of the ban. Retaliatory tariffs imposed in 1999 significantly reduced imports of selected US agricultural products from the EU. The US later suspended these tariffs in 2009 under a Memorandum of Understanding. Imports of EU products to the United States significantly declined from $130 million in 1997-1998 to under $15 million in 2008, with products like meat, fish, fruit juices, processed foods, and others experiencing the most significant drop. Some products, such as Roquefort cheese, mustard, and coffee, also saw lower imports. The U.S.-EU hormone dispute has been a concern for Congress, with the U.S. beef industry fearing the EU ban is a disguised trade barrier to protect domestic producers. The U.S.-EU hormone dispute led to trade barriers to protect EU domestic beef producers. Congress enacted the carousel retaliation provision in response to the dispute, with various legislative actions taken to address unjustified trade restrictions. Former Senator Max Baucus introduced the Trade Injury Compensation Act to establish a Beef Industry Compensation Trust Fund. Resolutions were also passed to urge the Administration to continue taking action. The U.S.-EU hormone dispute involves trade barriers against U.S. beef exports due to EU non-tariff barriers. Congress has taken various actions to address the issue, including urging the Administration to continue efforts to resolve the dispute. Former Representative Menendez introduced bills to exempt small importing businesses from higher tariffs on EU products in the U.S. The resolution of the hormone dispute could improve the U.S.-EU trade relationship and set a precedent for future WTO disputes involving SPS measures. The 1997 WTO meat hormone decision affirmed the need for SPS measures to be based on scientific justification and risk assessment, testing the durability of internationally agreed-upon rules for resolving disputes. The EU institutes restrictions on livestock production, banning the use of hormones and prohibiting imports of hormone-treated animals. The US raises the hormone ban issue in trade discussions, leading to a dispute settlement under the GATT. In late 1987, President Reagan announces retaliatory tariffs on EU imports worth $100 million. Various scientific reviews are initiated to study growth promotants in meat imports. In 1989, the EU fully implements its ban on meat imports from animals treated with six hormones. In 1995, the EU bans six hormones used in U.S. beef, leading to retaliatory tariffs. The GATT Uruguay Round Agreement comes into force, with Codex deciding on Maximum Residue Limits for hormones. In 1996, the EU maintains the ban, prompting the U.S. to request a WTO dispute settlement panel. Australia, Canada, and New Zealand join the complaint. In 1997, a WTO dispute settlement panel rules that the EU ban on hormones in cattle growth is not based on science, leading to an appeal by the EU and initiation of scientific studies on the hormones. In 1998, the WTO Appellate Body upholds the panel's decision but disputes some findings regarding cancer risks to consumers. The WTO rules that the EU ban on hormones in cattle growth is not based on science and poses a cancer risk to consumers. The EU is given 15 months to implement the ruling, offering options for resolution including compensation, a labeling system, or converting the ban to a temporary measure. The United States proposes a labeling system as a solution. In response to the EU ban on hormones in cattle growth, the United States considers trade sanctions and publishes a list of products that could face increased tariffs. The EU conducts additional risk reviews and issues an opinion stating that a growth hormone used in U.S. cattle production is carcinogenic. The EU ban on hormones in cattle growth leads to health risks for consumers. The United States and Canada seek WTO authorization to retaliate against the European Union with tariffs on various products. The U.S. imposes a 100% ad valorem rate of duty on specific products from certain EU member states, excluding the United Kingdom. In May, the EU issues its second review on human health risks from hormone-treated beef, concluding no need for revision. Congress passes legislation for periodic revision of product list for retaliation. In 2001, the US and EU start compensation discussions, and in 2002, studies and journals are provided for publications. In 2002, the EU issues its third review confirming previous findings on hormone-treated beef. In 2003, Directive 2003/74 bans estradiol in farm animals and provisionally bans five other hormones, citing WTO obligations. In October, the EU issues a press release claiming its ban is supported by SCVPH reviews, fulfilling WTO obligations. The United States questions the SCVPH studies as a risk assessment. The EU refers the dispute to the WTO for a multilateral decision in December. In 2004-2005, the EU initiates a new dispute, claiming the US and Canada should remove trade sanctions as the ban has been modified. The cases are effectively merged under one panel due to identical substance. In September 2005, Australia and Mexico join consultations as the EU requests a new WTO panel. The panel's meeting is open to the public, but due to complexity, work is delayed until October 2006. In 2006, the USTR decides not to revise the list of EU products subject to higher U.S. import tariffs. The U.S. Court of International Trade supports this decision under \"carousel retaliation.\" In 2007, the WTO panel delays its final report until June due to scientific complexity and scheduling issues. The European Food Safety Authority concludes that new data does not warrant a revision of previous risk assessments. The WTO panel's interim report is issued in July, with the final report delayed until October and eventually released in December. In 2008, the WTO panel finds fault with the EU, United States, and Canada on various substantive and procedural issues. The WTO panel finds fault with the EU, United States, and Canada on various aspects of a dispute over import bans on hormone-treated beef. The panel allows trade sanctions to continue but also grants the EU the right to maintain its ban on imports from the US and Canada. The USTR seeks public input on potential actions. In October, the USTR seeks comments on modifying EU products subject to increased tariffs. In January 2009, changes are made to the list, escalating the dispute. In May 2009, a memorandum of understanding is signed to resolve the beef hormone dispute by opening up the EU market to non-hormone treated beef. In Phase 1 of the MOU signed in May 2009, the EU opened a tariff quota for 20,000 metric tons of high-quality beef to the United States, avoiding higher retaliatory duties. In October 2010, a U.S. Court of Appeals decision could lead to refunds for importers from the EU. In June 2012, Phase 2 of the MOU was implemented by the EU. In June 2012, the EU increased the HQB quota to 48,200 MT and changed the quota management system to \"first come, first served.\" In October 2013, the EU approved a two-year extension of Phase 2 of the MOU, allowing access to U.S. beef raised without growth promotants in exchange for the U.S. suspending retaliatory import duties on some EU food products until August 2015. In 2016, USTR reinstated retaliatory tariffs. In December 2016, USTR reinstated retaliatory tariffs on EU products under dispute, with a public hearing scheduled for 2017."
