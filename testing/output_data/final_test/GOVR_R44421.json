    "content": "A REIT is a real estate company that is taxed similarly to a partnership, avoiding corporate-level tax. It must meet certain tests, have 75% of assets in real estate, and distribute 90% of profits to shareholders. Dividends to individual shareholders are taxed at ordinary income tax rates. The rules governing REITs have been relaxed over time to allow more involvement in managing properties and services, expanding their scope of operations. The introduction of taxable REIT subsidiaries in 1999 further expanded the possibilities for REITs to operate properties directly. The rules governing REITs have been relaxed over time, allowing more involvement in managing properties and services. Taxable REIT subsidiaries have also expanded operations by shifting profits into the REIT parent through higher rents. The number of firms spinning off properties into separate REITs has been growing, but restrictions were introduced in the Consolidated Appropriations Act. REITs are organized as equity, mortgage, or hybrid REITs, with most being equity REITs. Public REITs fall into three classes for regulation and trading. REITs are classified into three categories for regulation and trading: public REITs traded on the stock exchange, public REITs not traded on the stock exchange but registered with the SEC, and private REITs. They are subject to various restrictions and rules, including limitations on holding property for sale. Gain from property sales is subject to a prohibited transactions tax, except for property obtained through foreclosure. Foreign entities are generally not taxed on U.S. source capital gains income. Foreign individuals or corporations are not taxed on U.S. source capital gains income, except for income from selling U.S. real property, which is taxed under FIRPTA rules. The rules, established in 1980, treat investment in real property as effectively connected to business and subject to U.S. taxes. There are exceptions for investments made through qualified entities, publicly traded U.S. real property, and limited ownership percentages. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 expanded the exceptions to cover capital gains distributions and stock sales, aiming to encourage investment. The Consolidated Appropriations Act included liberalizing FIRPTA rules to encourage investment in REITs by foreign persons. REITs have evolved from holding real estate mortgages to holding standard properties directly and now include nontraditional assets. Tax-free spin-offs of real property into tax-exempt REITs have also been common. Real estate trusts were ruled non-taxable entities in a 1911 Supreme Court case after the introduction of corporate income tax in 1909. In 1935, the Supreme Court ruled that realty trusts were corporations subject to the corporate tax. REITs, largely experiencing losses during the depression, made no appeals to reverse the treatment through legislation and most were eventually liquidated. President Eisenhower vetoed the first real estate investment trust bill in 1956, citing differences between REITs and regulated investment companies. The REIT proposal in 1958 was initially dropped but eventually added to the Cigar Excise Tax Act of 1960, allowing for REITs exempt from corporate-level tax on distributions. This was due to the need for real estate financing and to provide a vehicle for taxpayers of more modest means to invest in real estate. Treasury objections were withdrawn after the resignation of Dan Throop Smith, who opposed the legislation. The growth of REITs was influenced by changes in tax laws, allowing them to own and manage properties. Initially more restricted, REITs evolved to become predominantly equity REITs, constituting over 90% of the total value today. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 played a significant role in this transformation by enabling REITs to provide services to tenants. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 allowed REITs to provide customary services to tenants, leading to the emergence of UPREITs in 1992. Changes in ownership rules in 1993 made it easier for pension plans to invest in REITs. IRS guidance in 1996 expanded the services REITs could offer, including cable television. Legislative changes in the late 1990s further fueled the expansion of REITs in scope and size. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 allowed REITs to offer customary services to tenants, leading to the emergence of UPREITs in 1992. Legislative changes in the late 1990s expanded the types of services REITs could provide, including timber REITs and taxable subsidiaries. In 2001, the IRS ruled that rental activity was considered an active business, allowing firms to spin off real estate assets tax-free. The IRS rulings in the late 1990s allowed for the spin-off of real estate assets in a tax-free reorganization, leading to the creation of a Fortune 500 company through a merger. Various assets such as billboards, electrical distribution systems, and data storage were classified as real property. This led to the growth of tax-exempt REIT conversions, sparking concerns about the erosion of the corporate base and resulting in legislative proposals. In the 1980s, Congress enacted FIRPTA provisions imposing capital gains taxes on real estate investments, including those made through REITs, to equalize treatment of foreign and domestic investors. Tax law changes in 2003 and 2013 reduced the tax advantage of REITs by lowering tax rates on dividends, discouraging foreign investment in some cases. In response to concerns about foreign investment in U.S. real estate, tax laws were changed to equalize treatment of foreign and domestic investors. Changes in tax rates on dividends and capital gains were made in 1997, 2003, and 2004 to address these concerns. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) estimates the market capitalization of public REITs at $935 billion, with equity REITs accounting for $875 billion. REITs traded on the stock market own $1.8 trillion of real estate and paid $42 billion in dividends in 2014. Tax benefits from REITs vary depending on the taxpayer's circumstances, with tax-exempt investors receiving the largest benefit. Private REITs are estimated to be worth less than $100 billion. Tax-exempt investors benefit the most from REIT treatment compared to regular corporations due to zero personal level tax and no unrelated business income tax. Without REIT treatment, income would face a 35% corporate tax rate. Individual investors with high tax rates would pay 50.47% tax with regular corporate investments, compared to 39.6% plus 3.8% tax with REIT treatment. The tax rate for a REIT can be higher than for an ordinary corporation at 43.4% versus 35%. REIT tax treatment is most advantageous when individual income tax rates are low and the investor prefers dividend payouts. Evidence does not suggest that tax-exempt investors heavily invest in REITs, with DB pension fund holdings in REITs at 0.6% of their portfolios. The majority of REIT assets are in traditional asset types like retail, industrial, office, residential, and health. Nontraditional REIT asset types, including timber, data centers, cell towers, prisons, hotels, and more, account for a small percentage of the market. In a 2014 study, timber REITs had a market capitalization of $31.4 billion, data center REITs had $35.7 billion, and cell tower REITs had $65.4 billion. These nontraditional assets are not commonly passive building rentals but are gaining attention in the market. Nontraditional REIT asset types, including timber, data centers, cell towers, prisons, hotels, and more, account for a small percentage of the market. Five data center REITs accounted for $35.7 billion; two cell tower for $65.4 billion; one real estate for $6.3 billion; two prison for $6.9 billion; one hotel for $2.5 billion; one document storage facility for $6.9 billion; one casino for $3.7 billion; two billboards for $9.0 billion; and one communication center for $6.8 billion. The nontraditional or recently converted REITs amount to a value of $175 billion, or approximately a fifth of REIT valuations, and appeared to be accelerating. A New York Times article has a somewhat overlapping list of spin-offs since 2010, which included an additional 13 tax-free spin-offs, totaling $15.8 billion. Several spin-offs were grandfathered in recent legislation, including Caesars Casinos, MGM Resorts, Boyd Gaming, Hilton, and Energy Future Holdings Corporation. The Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 114-13) outlines revisions allowing tax-free spin-offs under certain conditions, such as the distributing corporation being engaged in an active business. The IRS permitted spin-offs into REITs in 2001, leading to an increase in real property spin-offs. The Consolidated Appropriations Act restricts REITs from participating in tax-free spin-offs, except in certain cases. The provision also includes exceptions for spin-offs involving REITs and their subsidiaries. Treasury regulations were issued to address potential ways to bypass these restrictions. The regulations aim to prevent tax-free spin-offs involving REITs, with exceptions for spin-offs with subsidiaries. Changes affecting foreign shareholders of REITs cost $2,923 million in forgone revenue over 10 years. Major provisions include increasing ownership share exempt from taxation under FIRPTA to 10% and exempting foreign pension funds from FIRPTA, totaling $4,250 million in lost revenue over FY2016-FY2025. The remaining three provisions gain revenue, not specifically from the treatment of REITs. One provision increases withholding rate on real property sales to foreign interests from 10% to 15%, generating $209 million over FY2016-FY2025. Another provision excludes REITs from the cleansing rule, resulting in a revenue gain of $256 million over the same period. The final provision relates to the dividends-received deduction. The final provision in the context relates to the dividends-received deduction, which prevents multiple levels of taxation due to intercorporate ownership. Dividends received from a corporation holding stock in another corporation are deductible based on ownership percentage. Dividends from REITs are not eligible for the deduction, while dividends from RICs are 70% deductible from other corporations. Foreign corporations' dividends are generally not eligible, except for income earned in the U.S. and taxed. The new law clarifies that dividends from RICs and REITs do not qualify for the dividends-received deduction. Several minor provisions in the law impact REITs, including reducing the asset share for taxable REIT subsidiaries and increasing the safe harbor limit for prohibited transactions tax. These provisions are estimated to raise $762 million in federal tax revenue from FY2016 to FY2025. The new law impacts REITs by allowing preferential dividends for publicly offered REITs, changing the designation of distributions, and imposing limits on asset tests. The new law impacts REITs by changing the designation of distributions, imposing limits on asset tests, and expanding the definition of hedging income that is disregarded for income tests. The new law impacts REITs by changing the designation of distributions, imposing limits on asset tests, and expanding the definition of hedging income that is disregarded for income tests. Profits can be overstated due to anomalies in earnings and profits measurement for REITs, with a correction of -$4 million. Services provided by taxable REIT subsidiaries are expanded, allowing for non-arms-length prices relating to services, resulting in a reduction of -$65 million. The Consolidated Appropriations Act may result in a period without further REIT revisions. However, tax reform could impact REITs directly or indirectly. Former Chairman Dave Camp's proposed Tax Reform Act of 2014 included revenue-raising REIT provisions not enacted in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, potentially becoming targets in tax reform. Differences between the bills include a more restrictive limit on spin-offs and imposing a tax on gain for conversions to REIT status. The 2014 bill aimed to restrict nontraditional assets qualifying for REIT status. The tax reform bill aimed to restrict nontraditional assets qualifying for REIT status, disallowing assets with a life of less than 27.5 years. This change would impact billboards and timber REITs. Additionally, there was a provision to cap the amount of rent or interest based on a fixed percentage of income or sales. Changes in corporate tax rates could indirectly affect REITs. A reduction in corporate tax rates could impact REITs by reducing their tax benefits, potentially making taxes on REIT dividends higher than those on ordinary corporations. Proposed changes in tax law, such as corporate tax integration, could also have consequences for REITs."
