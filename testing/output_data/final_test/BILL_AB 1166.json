    "title": "AB 1166",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 51225.1 of the Education Code is amended to exempt pupils in foster care or homeless children transferring between schools after their second year of high school from additional coursework requirements, unless they can reasonably graduate by the end of their fourth year. If a pupil in foster care or homeless youth can graduate within five years of high school, the school district must inform them of the option to stay for a fifth year. They should also be informed about the impact on postsecondary education and transfer opportunities at California Community Colleges. The school district must inform pupils in foster care or homeless youth of the option to stay for a fifth year to complete graduation requirements if they are 18 years or older, or with parental agreement if under 18. Credits earned or length of enrollment can determine exemption eligibility for these students. Within 30 days of a foster care pupil transferring to a school, the district must notify them, their educational decision-maker, and social worker about the exemption from local graduation requirements. If the district fails to provide timely notice, the pupil is still eligible for the exemption once notified, even after the court's jurisdiction ends, if they qualify. Within 30 days of a homeless child or youth transferring to a school, the district must notify them, their educational decision-maker, and the liaison for homeless children and youth about the exemption from local graduation requirements. If the district fails to provide timely notice, the pupil is still eligible for the exemption once notified, even if they are no longer homeless, as long as they qualify. If a pupil in foster care or homeless, exempted from local graduation requirements, completes statewide coursework by end of fourth year in high school, school cannot require graduation before that time. If a pupil in foster care or homeless is exempted from local graduation requirements, the school district must notify them and their educational decision-maker about the impact on postsecondary education admission and provide information on transfer opportunities through California Community Colleges. A pupil in foster care or homeless status can be exempted from local graduation requirements. They have the right to remain in school and take necessary courses, including those for higher education. If not exempted initially, they can request exemption at any time if they qualify. If a pupil in foster care or homeless status is exempted from local graduation requirements, the exemption shall not be revoked by the school district. The exemption continues even after the termination of court jurisdiction or when the pupil transfers to another school. A school district cannot force a foster care or homeless student to switch schools to qualify for an exemption. Requests for transfers solely for exemption purposes are not allowed for these students. The Commission on State Mandates will provide reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for costs mandated by this act."
