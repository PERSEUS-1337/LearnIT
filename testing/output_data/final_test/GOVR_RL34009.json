    "content": "The FY2008 Energy and Water Development bill, enacted as Division C of the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2008 (P.L. 110-161), provided $31.4659 billion for Energy and Water programs, slightly below the FY2007 appropriation but above the Administration's request. The bill was passed by Congress on December 19, 2007, and signed by the President on December 26, 2007. The House Appropriations Committee reported out its FY2008 Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill, H.R. 2641, on June 6, 2007, without specific project funding. After a supplement specifying funding for individual projects was submitted on July 12, the House approved the bill. The Energy and Water Development bill for FY2007 was approved by the House on July 17, 2007, and by the Senate on June 28. Funding for various programs, including civil works projects, was detailed in the Department of Energy's \"operating plan\" submitted to Congress on March 16, 2007. The Energy and Water Development bill for FY2007 was approved by the House and Senate. Budget totals for energy and water development appropriations enacted for FY2001 to FY2008 are listed in tables. Adjustments of accounts within the bill's four titles are also included. Amounts are derived from various sources including the Administration's FY2008 Congressional Budget Requests and explanatory statements for the FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act. Tables 4 through 16 detail budget allocations for various government agencies for FY2005-FY2006. P.L. 110-161 allocated $5.587 billion for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, exceeding the Administration's request. Funding for the Corps' civil works program is often a point of contention between the Administration and Congress, with Congress typically providing more funding than requested. The Corps' civil works program has been criticized for lacking focus, with a backlog of authorized projects causing construction delays and cost overruns. Congress often directs funding to projects not in the Administration's request, leading to ongoing policy debates on budget and priorities. The $23 billion Water Resources Development Act in 2007 addressed concerns about the backlog's size, which varied from $11 billion to over $60 billion. The Corps' backlog of authorized projects and concerns about fiscal planning contribute to support for performance-based criteria for budgeting and concentrated appropriations on priority projects. Critics argue that the criteria used are too simplistic and focusing on priority projects results in less investment in other cost-beneficial projects and regions without priority projects. The Administration has been using performance-based budgeting to address the backlog of Corps projects, focusing on projects with high benefits to costs ratios or cost-effectiveness. The FY2008 budget request categorized the agency's budget into \"business lines\" like navigation, flood control, and recreation, with a significant portion allocated to commercial navigation and flood and coastal storm damage reduction. The Corps' budget allocation includes funds for commercial navigation, flood and coastal storm damage reduction, aquatic ecosystem restoration, and environmental stewardship. There are differing opinions on how to manage the budget, with the House generally supporting the Administration's performance-based budgeting approach, while the Senate has concerns about funding levels. The Senate Appropriations Committee report criticized the Administration's budget allocation for the Corps, emphasizing the need for more investment in water resources. It questioned the focus on a few projects and lack of support for projects at different stages of development. The report also raised concerns about the impact on partnering with local project sponsors for other authorized projects. The Administration's request limited new activities to address the backlog, with a focus on construction projects that could be completed in FY2008. The President's FY2008 budget request includes funding for construction projects that align with previous years' priorities. The House and Senate reports show differing opinions on managing the Corps' budget, with the Senate recommending a limited number of new construction starts. The focus is on completing projects in FY2008, with exceptions for major rehabilitation at specific locks on the Ohio and Mississippi River systems. The FY2007 and FY2008 budget requests for the Corps of Engineers did not specify individual project funding for Operations and Maintenance (O&M). Instead, funding was divided into 21 regions for various activities, allowing flexibility to reallocate funds as needed. Individual project estimates were provided separately from the formal budget request. The FY2007 and FY2008 budget requests for the Corps of Engineers did not specify individual project funding for Operations and Maintenance (O&M). Funding was divided into 21 regions for flexibility in reallocating funds as needed, causing discomfort among some project stakeholders. The House and Senate had differing opinions on managing the Corps' budget, with the Senate rejecting the regional budgeting approach for O&M. The omnibus report language directed the Corps of Engineers to prepare integrated O&M budgets for four regions and provided guidance on reprogramming funds and budget submission materials. The agency received $131 million for FY2008 Everglades restoration activities, lower than the $162 million requested. The Corps plays a significant coordination role in the restoration of the Central and Southern Florida ecosystem. The funds for Everglades restoration projects in FY2006 included Central and Southern Florida Project ($82 million), Kissimmee River Restoration Project ($31 million), Everglades and South Florida Restoration Projects ($8 million), and Modified Water Deliveries Project ($10 million). The Mod Waters project was previously funded through Department of the Interior appropriations but is now included in the Corps budget. Appropriators expressed concerns about the project's changing design and directed the Corps and Interior to submit plans for its completion and funding. The Corps is responsible for Everglades restoration projects funded through Energy and Water Development and Department of the Interior appropriations. Concerns about funding levels and progress are discussed in CRS reports. Most of the Corps' work on hurricane protection in coastal Louisiana is funded through emergency supplemental appropriations, not annual appropriations. The Corps has received over $7 billion in emergency supplemental funds for flood protection and water resources repair. The majority of the appropriations are for structural hurricane defenses, with coastal wetlands restoration receiving less than $200 million. The 110th Congress enacted an additional $1.64 billion for the Corps to accelerate completion of flood and storm damage reduction projects in New Orleans and south Louisiana. The Interior Department requested increased funding for the Central Utah Project (CUP) Completion Account and a reduction for the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) for FY2008. The total approved funding for Title II is $1.1509 billion, $149.5 million above the President's request. The BOR's FY2008 request totaled $958.4 million, with a net current authority of $906.8 million after offsets. The total budget request for Title II funding was $1.0014 billion, with the Water and Related Resources account being BOR's largest. The Administration requested $816.2 million for the Water and Related Resources Account for FY2008, which is $58.5 million less than enacted for FY2007. The House Appropriations Committee recommended funding at the amount reflected in the President's Budget for CUP, Policy and Administration, and the CVP. The Committee recommended increases of $55 million for Water and Related Resources and $9 million for CALFED. The Committee's final recommendation for Water and Related Resources matched. The Committee's final recommendation for Water and Related Resources matched the President's request for facilities and operations and maintenance (O&M), with additional funding recommended on the Resource Management side of the budget. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding at the amount reflected in the President's Budget for the CUP and Policy and Administration. Recommended funding for Water and Related Resources is $134 million more than the President's request and $79 million more than the level recommended by the House. The CALFED recommendation increased by $9 million over the President's request, matching the House. The Committee provided $7.5 million less funding for the CVP Restoration Fund, indicating that the Administration's proposed San Joaquin River Restoration Fund was not yet authorized. The House and Senate agreed on final appropriations for the BOR. The House and Senate agreed on final appropriations for the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) that closely matched previous chamber recommendations. The CVP Restoration Fund remained at $59.1 million as requested by the President, but $7.5 million intended for the San Joaquin River Restoration Fund was reallocated. Water and Related Resources and CALFED were funded at levels similar to the Senate's recommendations. The total approved funding for Title II was $1.1509 billion, $149.5 million above the President's request. The Bureau of Reclamation played a significant role in building dams and water diversion structures in the West. The Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) manages dams and water projects in the West, providing water to farmland and millions of people. They are the largest water supplier in 17 western states and the second-largest hydroelectric power producer in the nation. BOR projects also offer flood control, recreation, and wildlife benefits, but face controversy over their impact on sensitive species and water conflicts. The Administration requested $31.8 million for the California Bay-Delta. The Administration requested $31.8 million for the California Bay-Delta Restoration Account (Bay-Delta, or CALFED) for FY2008, with funds allocated for environmental water, storage, conveyance, science, water quality, planning, management, and ecosystem restoration. The House Appropriations Committee recommended funding all CALFED programs at the requested level, with additional allocations for Water Use Efficiency and Delta Levees. Funding for Delta Levees is to be transferred to the Corps of Engineers, resulting in a recommended net increase of $9 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved funding at the amount recommended by the House Appropriations Committee, resulting in a final appropriations level of $40.1 million for CALFED. BOR requested $1 million in FY2008 to establish a loan guarantee program for water districts. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended funding this program at the recommended level. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended funding the program at the requested level. The Administration requested $35.5 million for site security for FY2008, a decrease of $4.1 million from FY2007. The funding covers activities such as surveillance, law enforcement, antiterrorism, and security upgrades. Annual costs for guard and patrol activities would be treated as project O&M costs. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended funding the Water 2025 program at the requested level of $35.0 million for FY2008. The program aims to reduce water use conflicts by increasing certainty, diversity, and flexibility of water supplies. The budget request for the program is $11.0 million, a decrease of $3.5 million from the previous year. The House Appropriations Committee did not fund Water 2025 for FY2007 due to lack of authorization, while the Senate recommended $14 million for efficiency and water improvements. Both chambers agreed on $5.9 million. General provisions authorized $66 million in Nevada for water projects, including dam removal and fish passage. Section 210 authorized two water reuse projects in California with a total of $30 million. Additional $20 million was authorized for the Southern California Desert Region Integrated. An additional $20 million is authorized for the Southern California Desert Region Integrated Water and Economic Sustainability Program (\u00a7214). Section 204 authorizes funding grants at a 50% cost share for irrigation or water districts and states for water conservation projects. The Energy and Water Development bill funds DOE programs including research on renewable energy, nuclear power, environmental cleanup, and fossil fuels. The Administration's FY2008 request for DOE programs was $24.7627 billion, compared with $24.2282 billion appropriated for FY2007. The final omnibus act provides $24.4466 billion, $218 million above FY2007 but $316 million below the request. Section 312 of the act imposes an across-the-board rescission on all DOE programs, requiring funding levels to be reduced by 1.6% of earmarked funds and 0.91% for all other funding. DOE is mandated to submit a report to the Appropriations Committees within 30 days with detailed numbers reflecting the rescission. The omnibus appropriations act provides $1,722.4 million for DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) for FY2008, with key increases in funding for Vehicles, Weatherization, Hydrogen, Geothermal, Water technologies, and Solar. There is a reduction of $30.9 million for Facilities in the FY2008 appropriation. The FY2008 omnibus appropriations act provides $1,722.4 million for DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), with cuts in funding for construction of new buildings. The main cuts include $9.5 million for International Renewables and $5.4 million for State Grants. The Administration's Advanced Energy Initiative aims to reduce America's dependence on imported energy sources through hydrogen, biofuels, and solar energy initiatives supported by EERE programs. The Hydrogen Initiative aims to commercialize hydrogen infrastructure and fuel cell vehicles by 2015, the Biofuels Initiative seeks to develop cellulosic ethanol, and the Solar America Initiative aims to reduce the cost of photovoltaics technology. The Solar America Initiative aims to reduce the cost of photovoltaics technology, increase commercial use, and displace natural gas for power generation. The President's 2007 State of the Union address set goals to reduce gasoline use by 20% and increase alternative fuels production. Concerns were raised about terminating Geothermal and Hydropower programs in the FY2008 DOE budget hearings. The House approved $1,873.8 million and the Senate Appropriations Committee approved $1,715.6 million for FY2008 EERE programs, with policy directives to quantify and track progress. The Senate Appropriations Committee directs DOE to quantify and track progress and impact of investments in the EERE portfolio, implement programs with Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic Serving Institutions, support state-wide pilot programs for reduced electricity and natural gas use, and study five special topics. The Senate Appropriations Committee directs DOE to conduct a study on increasing consumption of ethanol-blended gasoline, prepare updates on the National Biofuels Action Plan, report on planned procedure for cellulosic biofuels grants, study methods to improve fuel efficiency of alternative fueled vehicles, and identify potential for distributed energy equipment to provide energy savings. The DOE is directed to focus on the commercial potential of distributed energy equipment to provide energy savings. Funding for the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability is $138.7 million, with a focus on increasing energy storage efforts for intermittent wind and solar power production. Additionally, DOE received $1.037 billion for nuclear energy research and development in FY2008. The omnibus appropriation for FY2008 allocates $970.5 million for the nuclear energy program, with $181 million for the Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative (AFCI) and $281 million for the mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel program. This funding level is lower than the Administration's request, which aimed to increase AFCI funding to $395.0 million. The omnibus appropriation for FY2008 allocates $970.5 million for the nuclear energy program, with $181 million for the Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative (AFCI) and $281 million for the mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel program. The House provided a funding level of $835.2 million for nuclear energy, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $795.5 million, opposing the MOX funding transfer. The nuclear energy R&D program aims to secure nuclear energy as a viable, long-term commercial energy option. Opponents criticize DOE's nuclear research program for providing wasteful subsidies to an industry they believe should be phased out. The GNEP initiative aims to recycle plutonium from spent fuel to expand nuclear fuel supply and reduce radioactive waste. Supplier nations would lease fuel to others to prevent nuclear weapons material production. The GNEP initiative aims to recycle plutonium from spent fuel to expand nuclear fuel supply and reduce radioactive waste. A Statement of Principles signed by the United States and 15 other countries preserves the right to develop fuel cycle facilities while encouraging alternatives to sensitive fuel cycle technologies. DOE issued a Spent Nuclear Fuel Recycling Program Plan in May 2006 for a Technology Demonstration Program to achieve GNEP's goals. The GNEP initiative aimed to recycle plutonium from spent fuel to expand nuclear fuel supply and reduce radioactive waste. The National Academy of Sciences criticized DOE's deployment schedule for GNEP and recommended focusing on research and development instead of technology demonstration facilities. Nuclear critics oppose GNEP's emphasis on spent fuel reprocessing due to weapons proliferation risks. The omnibus appropriation cuts the Administration's GNEP request to $181 million. The omnibus appropriation cuts the Administration's GNEP request to $181 million, with $30 million for facility upgrades and $151 million for research and development activities. President Bush mentioned \"clean, safe nuclear power\" in his 2007 State of the Union address, emphasizing the interest in new commercial reactors. DOE's focus is on the Nuclear Power 2010 Program to support regulatory approval for new reactor sites and licenses. The Nuclear Power 2010 Program aims to support new reactor sites and licenses by providing funding for advanced versions of existing commercial nuclear plants. Two industry consortia are receiving DOE assistance to design and license new nuclear power plants, with a funding increase of $21.0 million in FY2008 to accelerate progress on new reactor licenses. The House approved flat funding for the Nuclear Power 2010 program, arguing against funds for reactor design work. The program aims to test the \"one-step\" licensing process for nuclear license applications. NRC may grant a combined construction permit and operating license (COL) under this process. Industry consortia funded by DOE are receiving COL assistance, including a consortium led by Dominion Resources for an advanced General Electric reactor at the North Anna plant in Virginia. Dominion Energy submitted a COL application for a new unit at the existing North Anna plant in Virginia with NRC early-site permit. NuStart Energy Development consortium, including Exelon, sought COLs for reactors at Bellefonte plant in Alabama and Grand Gulf plant in Mississippi. The Nuclear Power 2010 Program funded review and approval of the Bellefonte COL and helped utilities seek NRC Early Site Permits for new reactors in Illinois, Mississippi, and Virginia. The DOE funded Early Site Permits (ESPs) for new reactors at Clinton, Grand Gulf, and North Anna plants. The Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems Initiative received $116.0 million in funding, with $74 million allocated to the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP). At least $38 million of the NGNP funding is for developing a conceptual design. The DOE allocated $36 million for NRC pre-licensing activities and $38 million for developing a conceptual design of the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP). NGNP will utilize Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) technology with helium as a coolant and coated-particle fuel capable of withstanding high temperatures. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 authorizes $1.25 billion for NGNP development and construction, based on Generation IV program research. Phase I research will continue until 2011, with a decision on Phase II design and construction to follow. The Generation IV Program focuses on developing a sodium-cooled fast reactor (SFR) that uses fast neutrons to induce fission in a wider range of isotopes, including all major plutonium isotopes. This reactor design aims to increase efficiency and reduce the amount of isotopes needed in nuclear fuel. The Generation IV Program is focused on developing a sodium-cooled fast reactor (SFR) that uses fast neutrons to induce fission in a wider range of isotopes, including all major plutonium isotopes. Fast reactors have the ability to fission most heavy radioactive isotopes, called \"transuranics\" (TRU), allowing for continuous recycling of materials from spent fuel. This technology is being prioritized over thermal reactors due to its potential for sustained nuclear chain reactions through multiple separation cycles. The DOE Program Plan highlights the limited experience with fast burn reactor fuels. The House Appropriations Committee prioritized the gas-cooled NGNP over fast reactors for GNEP. The Generation IV program is focused on gas-cooled reactors and monitoring international research on various reactor types. The Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative is now part of Fuel Cycle Research and Facilities. The FY2008 funding request for AFCI, a component of GNEP, was $395 million, more than double the FY2007 level. The omnibus act reduced AFCI funding to $181.0 million. AFCI aims to develop nuclear fuel cycles to reduce spent fuel hazards and recover energy through technologies like UREX+ for separating plutonium and uranium from spent fuel. The FY2008 funding for AFCI, a part of GNEP, was reduced to $181.0 million from the requested $395 million. The process involves removing uranium and other elements from spent fuel, leaving plutonium and highly radioactive elements. The funding was also intended for conceptual design work on an Advanced Fuel Cycle Facility (AFCF) for demonstrating AFCI technologies, but funding for AFCF development was rejected in FY2008. The UREX+ process aims to reduce the volume of spent nuclear fuel for disposal at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, by removing cesium and strontium for separate storage. Plutonium and long-lived elements would be fissioned to reduce long-term nuclear waste hazards. The economic viability of this waste processing is uncertain, and it faces opposition on nonproliferation grounds. DOE is seeking funding for the Nuclear Hydrogen Initiative to support hydrogen-fueled vehicles. The FY2008 omnibus act provides $10 million for the Nuclear Hydrogen Initiative, which is 10% above the FY2007 funding level. The program aims to select a hydrogen-production technology for pilot-scale demonstration by 2013. Additionally, the FY2008 omnibus act includes $566.8 million for Fossil Energy Research and Development, representing a 20.7% increase from FY2007. Major funding categories in the request include the President's Coal Research Initiative, with allocations for Clean Coal Power Initiative, FutureGen, and Fuels and Power Systems. The FY2008 omnibus act allocated $750 million for Fossil Energy Research and Development, with $70 million designated for the Clean Coal Power Initiative. Coal-related activities made up over 75% of the budget request, with funds also allocated for Program Direction, Environmental Restoration, and Special Recruitment Programs. The act deferred $257 million in unobligated Clean Coal Technology balances to FY2008 and transferred $166 million to the R&D account. The FY2008 omnibus act allocated $750 million for Fossil Energy Research and Development. Within this allocation, $70 million was designated for the Clean Coal Power Initiative, $75 million for FutureGen, $352.9 million for Fuels and Power Systems, $20 million for Natural Gas Technologies, $5 million for Petroleum-Oil Technologies, $150 million for Program Direction, $13 million for Plant and Capital Equipment, $0.7 million for Special Recruitment Programs, $5 million for Cooperative Research and Development, and $48.9 million for congressionally directed projects. The Clean Coal Power Initiative aims to demonstrate advanced clean coal-based power generation technologies, while the FutureGen project focuses on building an advanced coal-based Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) plant. The FutureGen Industrial Alliance has selected Mattoon, Illinois as the site for an Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) plant with CO2 capture and sequestration capabilities. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 authorizes annual funding of $200 million for the Clean Coal Power Initiative, with 70% allocated to coal-based gasification technologies. The Coal and Related Technologies Program is authorized significant funding for coal-based gasification technologies aimed at FutureGen, including advanced combustion and turbines for synthesis gas derived from coal. DOE proposed terminating programs in Natural Gas Technology and Petroleum-Oil Technology in FY2008, rated as ineffective by OMB. Funding was not requested for Plant and Capital Equipment or the Cooperative Research and Development program. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was established in 1975 and currently holds 690 million barrels of crude oil in caverns in Louisiana and Texas. Its purpose is to provide an emergency source of oil in case of supply interruptions. Additionally, a Northeast Heating Oil Reserve (NHOR) was created during the Clinton Administration to store 2 million barrels of home heating oil. The NHOR houses 2 million barrels of home heating oil in above-ground facilities in Connecticut, New Jersey, and Rhode Island. Program costs for the SPR have been dedicated to maintaining facilities and readiness. The FY2007 request for the SPR was $155.4 million, with an additional $168.1 million for expansion to 1.5 billion barrels. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 authorized the expansion of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to 1 billion barrels. The FY2008 budget requested adding 115 million barrels at existing sites and creating a new site in Mississippi with 160 million barrels capacity. There were plans to seek authority to expand the SPR to 1.5 billion barrels, with anticipated controversial spending of $10 billion for additional capacity and $55 billion to fill it. The House Committee on Appropriations did not support the expansion at that time. The House and Senate Committees recommended $163.5 million for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve program in FY2008, with an additional $25 million allocated for land acquisition at a new site. The expansion of the SPR to 1 billion barrels was authorized in 2005, with plans to potentially expand it further to 1.5 billion barrels. The Appropriations Committees do not support expanding the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to 1.5 billion barrels. Critics argue against filling the SPR with royalty-in-kind (RIK) oil during tight markets, while supporters believe the fill rate is too low to impact markets significantly. Deliveries of RIK oil to the SPR have increased, with 15 million barrels scheduled for delivery through July 2008. The Office of Science conducts basic research in six program areas funded by the Department of Energy. In FY2008, DOE requested $4.398 billion for Science, reflecting a 16% increase from the previous year. The final appropriation was $4.018 billion, a 6% increase from the request but $380 million less. The requested funding for the Office of Science in FY2008 was $4.018 billion, $380 million less than requested but a 6% increase from FY2007. The largest program, basic energy sciences, received $1.270 billion, a 2% increase from FY2007. The final appropriation did not allocate the reduction relative to the request to specific activities. The FY2008 budget for the Office of Science requested $4.018 billion, with basic energy sciences receiving $1.270 billion. The budget justification highlighted the development of the International Linear Collider (ILC) as a priority. The House provided the requested amount, including an increase for the ILC, while the Senate committee recommended funding for the ILC and allocated $7 million to ramp up the Joint Dark Energy Mission (JDEM). The final appropriation was $688 million, $94 million less than requested. The final appropriation for the FY2008 budget for the Office of Science was $688 million, $94 million less than requested. Funding for the International Linear Collider (ILC) was reduced to $15 million, with directives for JDEM collaboration with NASA. Fermilab and SLAC received less funding, leading to planned layoffs. Biological and environmental research saw increases in funding, with the House and Senate recommending additional funds for research areas like climate change. The Senate committee recommended an increase of $73 million for congressionally directed projects in the FY2008 budget for the Office of Science, with a final appropriation of $544 million. Biological and environmental research has historically been the main focus for such projects. The request for nuclear physics was $471 million, up 11% from the previous year. Despite the Energy Policy Act of 2005 directive, no funds were allocated for the construction of the Rare Isotope Accelerator (RIA). The House and Senate committees provided funding for nuclear physics research in the FY2008 budget. The final appropriation was $433 million, with an increase for fusion energy sciences, mainly for the U.S. share of the ITER project. The House rejected a new program in high energy-density physics and redistributed funds among existing activities. The Senate committee supported the new program. The Senate committee recommended the requested amount for the new program in high energy-density physics but the final appropriation was $287 million, $141 million less than requested. $150 million for U.S. contributions to ITER was not included, with $10 million for related R&D. ITER officials expect no immediate impact on the project's planned start in 2008. The U.S. share of ITER construction costs is 9.1%, estimated at $1.122 billion through FY2014. The request for advanced scientific computing research was $340 million, up 20% from FY2007. The final appropriation for advanced scientific computing research in FY2008 was $351 million, with $79 million allocated for laboratory infrastructure. The House provided $152 million, mainly for facility cleanup, replacement, renovation, and upgrades at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). The Senate committee recommended $89 million, expressing support for PNNL facilities and questioning the lack of funding for an agreement signed in 2006 with the Department of Homeland Security. The final appropriation for PNNL was $65 million, $10 million less than requested, but DOE was directed to increase future funding by $10 million to restore the baseline. The omnibus appropriations act provides $386.5 million in FY2008 for the nuclear waste program at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, which is below the Administration's request. This funding cut may impact plans to submit the Yucca Mountain license application and open the repository by 2017. The House approved the full request, while the Senate Appropriations panel voted to hold the program at $446.1 million. Funding for the program is provided under two appropriations accounts. The omnibus appropriations act provides funding for the nuclear waste program at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. The Administration requested money from the Nuclear Waste Fund and the Defense Nuclear Waste Disposal account. The funding provided in the omnibus measure is lower than the request. Yucca Mountain is designated as the sole candidate site for a national geologic repository. Congress passed a resolution authorizing the project to proceed to the licensing phase. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act required the Department of Energy to begin taking waste from nuclear plant sites by January 31, 1998. The Department of Energy (DOE) was required to start taking waste from nuclear plant sites by January 31, 1998. Nuclear utilities have won court decisions upholding DOE's obligation to meet the deadline and compensate for damages. DOE estimates liability payments of $7 billion if waste is received by Yucca Mountain in 2017 and $11 billion if delayed until 2020. The DOE Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program was established in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to support energy projects using new technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The DOE will guarantee repayment of up to $38.5 billion in loans for energy projects during FY2008 and FY2009, with allocations for nuclear power plants, coal projects with carbon capture, renewable energy, and uranium enrichment facilities. The House approved $7 billion in loan guarantees for FY2008, excluding nuclear power from the allocation. The Stockpile Stewardship Program was established by Congress to maintain the safety and reliability of the U.S. nuclear stockpile. It is operated by the National Nuclear Security Administration and consists of Directed Stockpile Work, Campaigns, and Readiness in Technical Base. The National Nuclear Security Administration manages Directed Stockpile Work, Campaigns, and Readiness in Technical Base and Facilities. Stewardship activities occur at the nuclear weapons complex, which includes three laboratories and four production sites. NNSA sets policy for the complex, with contractors operating the sites. The FY2008 request document includes data from NNSA's Future Years Nuclear Security Program (FYNSP) projecting the budget through FY2012. The House Appropriations Committee requested a review of reconfiguring the nuclear weapons complex due to concerns about high costs, security of fissile material, and the age of the facilities. A task force recommended a Consolidated Nuclear Production Center to consolidate uranium and plutonium, and possibly close some sites. The committee supported these recommendations in the FY2007 report. The Committee supported the task force's recommendations in its FY2007 report and rejected NNSA's \"Complex 2030\" plan. They recommended $100.0 million for transition planning and site selection for a consolidated nuclear production site. NNSA did not request funds for this purpose in FY2007 or FY2008 but proposed funds for upgrading and consolidating the Complex. In January 2007, NNSA submitted a report to Congress on its plan for transforming the Complex, which included evaluating the CNPC. The House Appropriations Committee expressed displeasure with the Administration's rationale for the nuclear weapons program and NNSA's plan for Complex 2030. They believe it is premature to proceed with further development of the Reliable Replacement Warhead program or a significant nuclear complex modernization plan without a comprehensive nuclear defense and nonproliferation strategy in place. The Senate Appropriations Committee expressed reservations about Complex 2030 and the Reliable Replacement Warhead program, citing a lack of long-term efficiency and consolidation strategy. They called for a more vigorous analysis and debate on national strategic defense policy before deciding on RRW development. The Committee rejects the premature deployment of the NNSA Complex 2030 consolidation effort based on the Reliable Replacement Warhead systems. Concerns were raised about the lack of critical details regarding the RRW system's size and military mission, future stockpile makeup, and the need for new pit manufacturing capability. Additionally, there are worries about sustaining science capability at the laboratories, with a directive for DOE to provide a long-term strategy for computation and an R&D plan addressing unresolved physics and materials questions. On December 18, 2007, NNSA announced plans for the Nuclear Weapons Complex Transformation, which includes retaining existing sites, reducing the weapons program footprint, closing or transferring structures, reducing the number of weapons workers, dismantling weapons more rapidly, and building new facilities. This program involves direct work on nuclear weapons. The FY2008 DSW request for the Nuclear Facility at Los Alamos National Laboratory includes support for life extension programs for the B61 gravity bomb and the W76 warhead for Trident II submarine-launched ballistic missiles. It also funds surveillance, maintenance, dismantlement, and disposition of retired warheads, as well as the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program. The Reliable Replacement Warhead Program aims to enhance the reliability, longevity, and certifiability of existing weapons and components. Funding for the program has increased over the years, with projections reaching $179.9 million by FY2012. The program is seen as enabling significant changes in the Complex to make it more modern and efficient, leading to long-term savings. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended increased funding for the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program to accelerate planning, development, and design for a more reliable and efficient modern complex. The program aims to improve the reliability, longevity, and certifiability of existing weapons and components while staying within military requirements and design parameters validated by past nuclear tests. P.L. 109-163 set objectives for the RRW program, including increasing the reliability, safety, and security of the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $52.7 million for the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program, linking it with a restructured nuclear weapons complex. They also directed the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) to conduct a peer review of RRW designs and analyze the feasibility of designing a new warhead without nuclear testing. Additionally, they reduced the funding for warhead life extension programs by $80.0 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee supported the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program, urging the NNSA to accelerate the transition to a responsive infrastructure and proceed expeditiously with the RRW design. It noted that DOD and the Nuclear Weapons Council no longer support the W80 warhead for cruise missiles. The Senate Appropriations Committee supported the RRW program, recommending $62.7 million for RRW activities and reducing funds for warhead dismantlement to $35.0 million. DOE's FY2007 operating plan included $35.8 million for RRW, $264.4 million for Life Extension Programs, and $75.0 million for weapons dismantlement and disposition. NNSA requested $88.8 million for RRW for FY2008 to develop a detailed cost, scope, and schedule baseline for RRW. Additional funds for RRW were requested by the Navy in the defense appropriations bill. The House Appropriations Committee expressed dissatisfaction with the RRW program in FY2008, stating that it goes beyond the original congressional intent. They are unconvinced of the need to pursue the RRW design competition to a production phase at this time. The House Appropriations Committee recommended providing no funds for the RRW program in FY2008, reducing funding for DSW by $110.6 million. This includes reductions for RRW and Stockpile Systems, and an increase for weapons dismantlement and disposition. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended transferring NNSA's activity to build a Pit Disassembly and Conversion Facility from the Office of Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation to the Office of Defense Programs. They directed DOE to begin the siting process to build the facility at Pantex Plant (TX) instead of Savannah River Site (SC) to avoid security risks in transporting pits. Additionally, $66.0 million was provided for NNSA for RRW to complete Phase 2A, with a request for more analysis and debate before proceeding with Phase 3. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended more analysis and debate before proceeding with Phase 3 of the RRW program. They wanted specific details on the future stockpile, effects on nonproliferation efforts, and comparative costs. The committee recommended funds for Phase 2A work on the first RRW type but barred funds for initial research on a second type. They also recommended a net reduction of $37.7 million in other areas of DSW, expressing concern with cost growth in the W76 LEP. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended more analysis and debate before proceeding with Phase 3 of the RRW program, expressing concern with cost growth in the W76 LEP. The consolidated appropriations bill eliminated NNSA funds for RRW and called for a new strategic nuclear deterrent mission assessment for the 21st century. Funding for weapons dismantlement and disposition was increased under DSW, with specialized scientific knowledge and technical support provided for the nuclear weapons stockpile. The FY2008 request includes six Campaigns for work on the nuclear weapons stockpile, with goals such as improving warhead performance assessment without testing and maintaining scientific infrastructure. Campaigns fund experimental facilities like the National Ignition Facility and propose building a Modern Pit Facility. The NNSA proposed building a Modern Pit Facility (MPF) at Sandia National Laboratories to address the inability to manufacture certified pits for nuclear weapons since 1989. The plan aimed to increase pit production capacity to maintain the stockpile, with TA-55 currently manufacturing a limited number of pits per year. H.R. 2419, the FY2006 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill, delayed MPF funding until long-term stockpile size requirements and infrastructure strategy were determined. The Senate passed a bill providing no funds for the Modern Pit Facility (MPF) and directed the NNSA to focus on improving manufacturing capability at TA-55 instead. NNSA requested $237.6 million for the Pit Manufacturing and Certification campaign for FY2007, with plans to increase capacity at TA-55. The FY2007 operating plan included $242.4 million for the campaign, and the FY2008 request is $281.2 million. NNSA envisions a new pit manufacturing facility delivering 125 pits per year by 2022 as part of Complex 2030. The House Appropriations Committee recommended providing $150.0 million for pit manufacturing and certification for FY2008, a reduction of $131.2 million due to concerns about unnecessary expenditures and lack of accountability. The Committee linked pit funding to a strategic plan and stated they will not fund activities that are not part of a clearly articulated facilities strategy until a new nuclear weapons strategic plan is received. No funds were included for the consolidated plutonium center. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $256.3 million for pit manufacturing for FY2008, a reduction of $24.9 million. They did not endorse the consolidated plutonium center proposal due to a lack of coherent policy and pit requirement for the stockpile. The consolidated appropriations bill provided $215.8 million for pit manufacturing and certification, with no funds allocated for the consolidated plutonium center. The NNSA is directed to limit out-year planning for plutonium operations to a pit production capacity of no more than 80 pits per year until a modern nuclear weapons strategy is developed. The NNSA is directed to limit pit production to 80 pits per year and provide quarterly reports to Congress. There is a debate over the appropriate test readiness posture, with NNSA and Armed Services Committees favoring an 18-month posture while Appropriations Committees prefer a 24-month posture. The FY2006 appropriation was $19.8 million, and NNSA achieved a 24-month readiness posture in FY2005. In FY2007, NNSA achieved a 24-month readiness posture and requested $14.8 million for test readiness. For FY2008, no funds were requested, but the House provided $20.0 million to restore funding. The Senate recommended no funds for test readiness. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended no funds for test readiness, but the consolidated appropriations bill provided $5.0 million for this activity. Additionally, $15.0 million was allocated for a new campaign called Advanced Certification, focused on addressing scientific uncertainties related to nuclear stockpile certification without underground testing. The Engineering Campaign includes the Enhanced Surveillance Program (ESP) to develop predictive capabilities for identifying stockpile aging concerns. Experiments are being conducted to determine the service life of pits based on plutonium aging characteristics. The FY2007 request for ESP was $86.5 million, the operating plan provided $87.5 million, and the FY2008 request is $80.6 million. The House provided $152.7 million for the Engineering Campaign, including funding for Enhanced Surety. The Senate recommended an additional $20.0 million for Enhanced Surety. The consolidated appropriations bill allocated $171.1 million for the Engineering Campaign, with $9.6 million for Enhanced Surety and $10.0 million for refurbishing a laboratory. The goal of the Inertial Confinement Fusion and High Yield Campaign is to create extreme conditions in laboratory settings. The National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory is part of a campaign to develop laboratory capabilities for weapons-related research in extreme conditions. The project's cost has increased from $1.1 billion to $3.5 billion, with concerns raised by Congress. NNSA requested $451.2 million for the campaign in FY2007, including $111.4 million for NIF construction. The Senate criticized NNSA for pursuing a \"NIF-at-all-costs strategy.\" The NNSA has faced criticism for prioritizing an aggressive spending baseline for the NIF campaign over other stewardship responsibilities. The Committee reallocated funding to ensure program balance, recommending $412.3 million for the campaign with $81.4 million for NIF construction. The FY2008 request includes $10.1 million for NIF construction, reflecting a decrease as the project nears completion. The House Appropriations Committee recommended increasing the request by $111.8 million to support reaching the 2010 ignition goal. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended increasing the request by $46.9 million, with $28.9 million shifted from RTBF to fully reestablish experimental capabilities on the Z facility at Sandia National Laboratories. The Z facility uses high-energy x-rays for research on materials, plutonium performance evaluation, and validating computer simulations for stockpile stewardship. The consolidated appropriations bill provided $474.4 million for the Inertial Confinement Fusion campaign, including $15.1 million to accelerate NIF target development. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended increasing the request by $46.9 million, with $28.9 million shifted from RTBF to fully reestablish experimental capabilities on the Z facility at Sandia National Laboratories. The bill provided an additional $15.1 million to accelerate NIF target development, $29.7 million for the Inertial Fusion Technology program, and an extra $13.0 million for Z machine operations. The FY2007 operating plan included $1,613.2 million, and the FY2008 request is $1,662.1 million, with various subprograms under RTBF receiving funding. The FY2007 operating plan included $262.5 million for construction and $1,613.2 million overall. The House Appropriations Committee recommended reducing RTBF by $27.0 million, including a $100.0 million cut for the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Facility Replacement (CMRR) at Los Alamos. The committee suggested terminating CMRR construction and relocating production capabilities to support future requirements. The committee noted NNSA's plan to build a Consolidated Plutonium Production Center by 2022 to support RRW and long term stockpile requirements. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1,780.8 million for RTBF, including funding for CMRR, stating its importance in the plutonium mission at Los Alamos. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $1,479.6 million for RTBF for FY2008, with a reduction of $182.5 million. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $1,479.6 million for RTBF for FY2008, with reductions in various areas including Operations of Facilities and construction. They recommended no funds for CMRR, stating that proceeding with the project as currently designed would strongly prejudice any nuclear complex transformation plan. The NNSA is directed to develop a long-term plan for maintaining the nation's nuclear stockpile requirements without assuming a case for the current program. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding amounts for RTBF for FY2008, including reductions in various areas and an increase in construction funds. The consolidated appropriations bill provided slightly less funding than requested, with a specific allocation for CMRR construction. Weapons Activities include programs for Secure Transportation Asset to transport nuclear weapons safely. The FY2008 request for weapons, components, and materials security is $215.6 million, with a recommended amount of $213.4 million in the consolidated appropriations bill. Nuclear Weapons Incident Response funding for FY2008 is $161.7 million, with a provided amount of $160.1 million. Facilities and Infrastructure Recapitalization Program (FIRP) addresses deferred maintenance. The Facilities and Infrastructure Recapitalization Program (FIRP) provides for deferred maintenance and infrastructure improvements for the nuclear weapons complex. The FY2007 request for FIRP was $291.2 million, with the House Appropriations Committee recommending a reduction of $145.0 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $283.2 million for FIRP to restore, rebuild, and revitalize the physical infrastructure of the nuclear weapons complex. The FY2008 request for the Facilities and Infrastructure Recapitalization Program (FIRP) is $293.7 million. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $137.7 million, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $262.7 million. The consolidated appropriations bill provided $181.6 million for FIRP. Safeguards and Security (S&S) funds operations and maintenance for security, with changes in threats post-9/11. Ambassador Linton Brooks emphasized the need for addressing old facilities that are draining resources. Ambassador Linton Brooks highlighted the increased security costs due to the changing threat landscape, with a shift towards denying access to nuclear warheads. Proposed changes include reducing the area to be guarded and consolidating materials at fewer sites. The FY2006 S&S appropriation was $797.8 million, with subsequent requests and operating plans showing fluctuations in funding levels. The FY2008 S&S budget request was $881.1 million, with the House Appropriations Committee recommending $911.6 million and the Senate Appropriations Committee recommending $893.1 million. The increase in funding would be used for cyber security upgrades at Los Alamos. The consolidated appropriations bill provided $907.6 million, including funds for refurbishing buildings at Idaho National Laboratory. The committee expressed concerns about the rising costs of S&S and recommended a National Academy of Sciences report on the issue. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) receives funding for nonproliferation and national security programs to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. In FY2007, funding was $1.818 billion, with $135 million from H.R. 2206. The FY2008 request was $1.673 billion, with the House Appropriations Committee recommending $1.684 billion. Construction projects were recommended to be moved to other programs. The House Appropriations Committee recommended a net appropriation of $1.3369 billion for nonproliferation and verification R&D programs in FY2008. Funding for these programs was boosted to $484.3 million due to the urgent need for advanced proliferation detection technology. Additionally, nonproliferation and international security programs, including international safeguards and export controls, received $133.2 million in FY2007. In FY2006, three programs received $133.2 million. The FY2007 DOE Operating plan allotted $128.9 million. The FY2008 request was $124.9 million. The House Appropriations Committee recommended increasing funding to $144.9 million. The omnibus act provided $151.4 million. International Materials Protection, Control and Accounting (MPC&A) received $413.18 million in FY2007, compared to $422.73 million in FY2006. P.L. 110-5 specified $472.7 million for MPC&A. The FY2008 request was $371.8 million. The House Appropriations Committee recommended boosting MPC&A funding to $831.8 million. The House Appropriations Committee recommended increasing funding for the MPC&A program to $831.8 million in FY2007, reflecting a shift in priorities towards nuclear nonproliferation efforts. The omnibus measure provided $630.2 million, falling short of the requested $653.1 million for the Fissile Materials Disposition program. Funding for the Savannah River facility was cut for FY2006 due to delays in agreement with Russia, resulting in a final appropriation of $468.8 million. The final appropriation for FY2006 was $468.8 million. For FY2007, the Administration requested $603.3 million, but the House Appropriations Committee proposed cutting funding to $248.0 million due to Russia's lack of participation in the MOX-light water reactor plan. The Senate supported the U.S. program to convert surplus weapons plutonium to MOX at Savannah River. The Senate version of H.R. 5427 would fund the Fissile Materials Disposition program at $618.4 million, $15 million more than requested. P.L. 110-5 specified a delay in construction activities for Project 99-D-143 at Savannah River Site. DOE's FY2007 Operating Plan allocated $470.1 million for Fissile Materials Disposition. For FY2008, the Administration requested $609.5 million, including $393.8 million for construction. The House Appropriations Committee noted Russia's decision to pursue fast breeder reactors instead of MOX reactors for plutonium disposition. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $609.5 million for the Fissile Materials Disposition program, including full funding for the MOX plant and the Pit Disassembly and Conversion Facility (PDCF) at Savannah River, SC. They instructed DOE to proceed with construction expeditiously and focus on delivering the project at cost and on time. The committee declared the bilateral agreement a failure and recommended transferring the MOX plant and PDCF to the nuclear energy program and NNSA's weapons program respectively. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended full funding for the MOX plant and PDCF at Savannah River, SC, but due to delays in the Russian side of the program, $57 million was rescinded from U.S. construction projects. The omnibus funding act transferred the MOX plant and PDCF to other programs, reducing the net appropriation to $66.8 million. The United States ceased nuclear weapons production in the late 1980s, leading to environmental challenges from past production. The environmental challenges from past nuclear weapons production continue to pose risks today. The adequacy of funding for addressing health and environmental risks is a long-standing issue. The DOE established the Office of Environmental Management in 1989 to oversee cleanup efforts at former nuclear weapons sites, including disposal of hazardous wastes, remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater, and decommissioning of excess facilities. The DOE oversees cleanup efforts at former nuclear weapons sites, including disposal of wastes and remediation of contamination at 114 sites in 30 states. Ongoing challenges include risk-based approaches, waste treatment facility designs, high-level radioactive waste disposal, incentive-based cleanup contracts, and overall cleanup pace and adequacy. The Environmental Management Program requires substantial resources, representing approximately one-fourth of DOE's efforts. The DOE's Environmental Management Program receives a significant portion of the Department's budget, with a total of $5.75 billion provided in FY2008. However, this funding is subject to rescissions, with nearly all of it facing a 0.91% reduction and $17.5 million for specific projects facing a higher 1.6% reduction. The House proposed $6.21 billion, the Senate recommended $6.00 billion, and the President proposed the lowest amount for consideration. The President proposed $5.66 billion for the Environmental Management Program in FY2008, while Congress appropriated $6.19 billion for FY2007. The House initially proposed $6.21 billion for FY2008, but nearly $200 million of the increase was not for the program itself. The Senate Appropriations Committee rejected the House's proposal to consolidate funding for the Office of Legacy Management with the Environmental Management Program. In FY2008, Congress allocated $5.75 billion for the Environmental Management Program, a decrease from the $6.19 billion allocated in FY2007. The funding difference is mainly due to a decrease in funds for \"accelerated closure\" sites like Rocky Flats and Fernald. In FY2008, Congress allocated $5.75 billion for the Environmental Management Program, a decrease from the $6.19 billion allocated in FY2007. Funding decreased for sites like Rocky Flats and Fernald, where cleanup work is nearing completion. Challenges remain at other sites with large quantities of waste and contamination. The funding differences in the Environmental Management Program for FY2008 compared to FY2007 are due to varying priorities, competing needs in the federal budget, and factors at individual sites. The Hanford site, the largest and most complex site in the program, has been a point of controversy due to concerns about radioactive contamination migrating into the Columbia River. The delayed construction of the Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant at Hanford is a costly cleanup challenge due to engineering and design issues. The facility is crucial for treating high-level radioactive waste from underground tanks and solidifying it for permanent disposal. The President requested $690.0 million for construction in FY2008, with an additional $273.4 million for managing the waste in the tanks. The House initially proposed $590.0 million for the waste treatment plant, while the President requested $690.0 million. The Senate recommended the full request for the plant and a higher amount of $326.0 million for managing the tank wastes. The House proposed $590.0 million for the waste treatment plant, while the Senate recommended $326.0 million for managing tank wastes in FY2008. Congress enacted appropriations for the Environmental Management Program, reflecting concerns about annual funding for nuclear waste site cleanup. The ongoing concern within Congress about the long-term financial liability of the United States to clean up nuclear waste sites has sparked much debate on ensuring public health, safety, and environmental protection in a cost-effective manner. The Department of Energy (DOE) has made progress in cleaning up some sites but acknowledges that significant work remains, especially at larger and more complex sites like Hanford, Savannah River, and the Idaho National Laboratory. Cleanup is expected to continue for decades at these sites due to high-level radioactive waste and contamination issues. The Department of Energy (DOE) expects cleanup and disposal of radioactive waste at Savannah River to be complete in 2031, at the Idaho National Laboratory in 2035, and at Hanford in 2042. Accurately estimating the time and funding needed for cleanup is challenging due to technical limitations and uncertainties. DOE periodically revises its cost estimates for cleanup as project baselines and assumptions change, with financial liabilities varying by billions of dollars over time. DOE's annual financial statements report liabilities for the Environmental Management Program, estimating $159 billion in FY2006 for cleanup and waste disposal. Future inflation and regulatory requirements could increase costs beyond this estimate. The DOE's $159 billion estimate for cleanup and waste disposal in FY2006 may not cover all costs, especially if initial cleanup actions are insufficient over the long-term. Predicting the effectiveness of containment methods for radioactive waste over thousands of years is challenging. Additional funding may be necessary for sites where cleanup was thought to be complete. Long-term care costs for disposed waste sites are not included in the estimate, and ensuring protection of human health and the environment into the future is crucial. The DOE estimated that $18 billion would be needed for cleanup and post-closure site responsibilities after completing the Environmental Management Program by FY2081. Long-term site care costs beyond 75 years are uncertain and cannot be reasonably estimated due to distant time frames. Funding for long-term site care and related responsibilities is discussed. The DOE's Office of Legacy Management is responsible for long-term care of sites once cleanup is completed. Congress allocated $190.6 million in FY2008, with $156.4 million for defense sites and $34.2 million for non-defense sites. This funding was a significant increase from previous years. The House recommended consolidating funding for the Office of Legacy Management with the Environmental Management Program for FY2007. The Senate did not support this change but proposed funding within the existing account structure. The enacted FY2008 appropriation was slightly lower than proposed but still $126.5 million higher than FY2007. The enacted FY2008 appropriation includes a $126.5 million increase above the FY2007 amount, primarily for long-term care, pension, and post-retirement benefits at defense sites transferred from the Environmental Management Program. Funding needs for Legacy Management will continue to grow as more sites are transferred in the future. DOE's four Power Marketing Administrations were established in response to dam construction projects by the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers. The Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) were established to market excess power generated by federal projects focused on water resource management. PMAs prioritize selling power to municipal utilities, co-ops, and other public bodies at the lowest possible rates. They are responsible for covering expenses, repaying debt, and federal investments in generating facilities. The Administration's FY2008 request for PMAs was $240.4 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding for SWPA and SEPA at the same levels requested in the President's budget and recommended by the House. However, the Senate recommended a funding increase of $30 million for WAPA based on concerns for transmission system reliability. The final bill enacted by Congress provides approximately $30 million above the Administration's request for WAPA. PMA appropriations are affected by a 0.91% across-the-board rescission on all Department of Energy discretionary accounts. In FY2008, PMA appropriations were affected by a 0.91% rescission on all Department of Energy discretionary accounts, resulting in a final appropriation of $268.0 million. BPA's borrowing authority was increased to $4.45 billion in FY2003, with plans to use $538 million in FY2008. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended no additional borrowing authority for BPA. Beginning in FY2008, BPA proposed to use secondary net revenues beyond $500 million for advance amortization payments. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) received a total budget of $926.1 million for FY2008, including $8.7 million for the NRC inspector general's office. This appropriation is about $10 million above the Administration's request and more than $100 million above the FY2007 funding level of $824.9 million. Major activities conducted by NRC include safety regulation and licensing of commercial nuclear reactors. The NRC's budget request for FY2008 included $216.9 million for new reactor activities, $37.3 million for licensing DOE's Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, and $246.4 million for reactor oversight and incident response. Plans for more than 30 reactor license applications have been announced due to higher fossil fuel prices and incentives provided by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The NRC's FY2008 budget request included $246.4 million for reactor security inspections and exercises. The omnibus appropriations measure reduced the nuclear waste licensing request by $8 million due to delays in the Yucca Mountain Repository application. Additional funding was allocated for nuclear science education and foreign security over radioactive material. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 requires 90% of NRC's budget to be offset by licensee fees. The omnibus appropriations measure reduced the nuclear waste licensing request by $8 million due to delays in the Yucca Mountain Repository application. Additional funding was allocated for nuclear science education and foreign security over radioactive material. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 requires 90% of NRC's budget to be offset by licensee fees, with exceptions for certain expenditures. The curr_chunk discusses various CRS reports on topics such as hydrogen and fuel cell vehicle R&D, Klamath River Basin water conflicts, nuclear energy policy, nuclear power plant vulnerability to terrorist attacks, nuclear warhead production, nuclear weapon initiatives, phosphorus mitigation in the Everglades, and radioactive waste classification. The curr_chunk mentions CRS reports on radioactive waste classification and terrorism and security issues in the water infrastructure sector."
