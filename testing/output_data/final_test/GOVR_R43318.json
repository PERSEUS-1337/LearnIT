    "content": "Lawmakers and the public are concerned about the solvency of the Disability Insurance (DI) trust fund, which pays Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits. The fund was projected to run out in 2016, but a reallocation of the Social Security payroll tax rate extended its solvency. Without further action, the DI trust fund may not be able to pay scheduled benefits. The report provides an overview of the DI trust fund's financial outlook, including its past 20 years' status, causes of financial imbalance, and projected status under different laws. It also discusses Congress's use of reallocations and a House rules change related to payroll tax reallocations. The appendix explains the rationale for creating a separate DI trust fund in 1956. SSDI is a form of social insurance under the Social Security Act that provides benefits to nonelderly insured workers meeting the disability definition. In 2015, over 10.8 million recipients received SSDI benefits, including disabled workers, spouses, and children. Workers must be under the full retirement age to qualify for SSDI. To qualify for SSDI, workers must be under the full retirement age, insured for disability, and statutorily disabled. Insured status requires a certain amount of work experience, with exceptions for younger workers. SSDI provides disability insurance coverage to millions of nonelderly workers. Disability is defined as the inability to engage in substantial gainful activity due to a medically determinable impairment. The SGA earnings limit in 2016 is $1,130 per month. The Social Security Administration sets the SGA earnings limit at $1,130 per month for most workers and $1,820 per month for statutorily blind workers. Disability determinations are based on a five-step evaluation process considering medical records, age, education, and work experience. Workers must have a severe impairment preventing substantial work. Cash benefits start five months after disability onset, based on career-average earnings adjusted for inflation through COLAs. Monthly benefits are determined by the CPI-W. In November 2015, disabled workers received an average monthly benefit of $1,166, with spouses receiving $318 and children $350. Medicare coverage is available after 24 months of cash benefits. Disabled workers can keep benefits if they meet certain criteria. The Social Security program is funded by two separate trust funds, the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund. Each fund has its own account in the U.S. Treasury and cannot borrow from each other. Administrative costs are covered by the trust funds. The OASI trust fund was established in 1939 under the Social Security Amendments. The DI trust fund was created in 1956 as a compromise to address concerns about SSDI's cost and impact on the OASI trust fund. SSDI and OASI are financed by payroll and self-employment taxes under FICA and SECA. The Social Security FICA tax rate for employees and employers is 6.2%, with 1.185% for the DI trust fund and 5.015% for the OASI trust fund. The combined FICA tax rate is 12.4%, with 2.37% for DI and 10.03% for OASI. SECA tax rate is the same as combined FICA rate, levied on earnings up to $118,500. Rates are specified in the Internal Revenue Code and Social Security Act. The Social Security Act specifies the allocation of the Social Security tax rate to the DI and OASI trust funds. The DI trust fund receives 2.370% of the tax rate, while the OASI trust fund receives 10.030%. Additionally, income from the taxation of Social Security benefits contributes to these trust funds based on certain thresholds. Provisional income, which includes adjusted gross income, tax-exempt interest income, and 50% of Social Security benefits, determines if certain thresholds are exceeded. Taxes on Social Security benefits are allocated to the OASI and DI trust funds based on the type of benefits taxed. The trust funds also receive reimbursements from the General Fund for various costs, such as compensating for revenue loss from temporary payroll tax reductions. Additionally, income from investments contributes to the trust funds. The trust funds receive income from investments, with surplus credited in the form of special-issue securities backed by the U.S. government. The accumulated securities represent the fund's balance, which can be used to pay benefits when program costs exceed income. The Board of Trustees presents an annual report to Congress on the financial status of the Social Security trust funds. The Board of Trustees for the Social Security trust funds consists of six members, including the Secretary of the Treasury as the Managing Trustee. The trustees set assumptions for future trends, advised by the Office of the Chief Actuary. The latest report was released in 2015, detailing the income, cost, and reserves of the DI trust fund. The majority of income for the fund comes from net payroll tax contributions. The DI trust fund received $109.7 billion from net payroll tax contributions, with $3.4 billion earned from investments. Income from SSDI benefits and reimbursements totaled $1.8 billion. Total cost for the year was $145.1 billion, with 98% going towards benefit payments. Administrative expenses and financial interchange with the Railroad Retirement Board amounted to $3.3 billion. The purpose of the financial interchange is to align the OASI and DI trust funds with railroad employment coverage. In 2014, the DI trust fund redeemed $30.2 billion in government bonds to cover the shortfall between total income and cost, decreasing its asset reserves from $90.4 billion to $60.2 billion. Between 1995 and 2004, the fund generated annual surpluses as non-interest income exceeded total cost. However, in 2005, total cost began to exceed non-interest income, leading to a decrease in the fund's balance. The DI trust fund's asset reserves began to decline in 2009 as total cost exceeded total income, leading to a $35.2 billion balance at the end of November 2015. The fund's solvency is decreasing due to an imbalance between income and cost, with the annual DI income rate remaining flat at 1.81% of taxable payroll over the past 20 years. The annual DI income rate has remained flat at 1.81% of taxable payroll, while the annual DI cost rate has increased from 1.44% in 1995 to 2.36% in 2014. The rise in the cost rate is mainly due to the growth in the number of SSDI beneficiaries, which increased by 85% from 1995 to 2014. This increase in beneficiaries drove up the annual DI cost rate. The increase in the number of SSDI beneficiaries from 1995 to 2014 was mainly driven by demographic changes in the insured-worker population, including the aging of the baby-boomer generation and the growth in the labor force participation rate of women. Economic downturns also led to a temporary increase in enrollment rates for SSDI. During the last recession, the number of SSDI awards per 1,000 insured workers increased by 25%, from 5.6 in 2007 to 7.0 in 2010. Amendments to the Social Security program, such as raising the full retirement age, also contributed to the increase in SSDI beneficiaries. The increase in the full retirement age (FRA) and changes in disability evaluation criteria led to more individuals aged 62 to FRA applying for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI). The shift towards beneficiaries with mental and musculoskeletal disorders increased the average duration of benefit receipt and SSDI caseloads. Researchers attribute much of the growth in SSDI beneficiaries to changes in the working-age population's demographic characteristics. The growth in SSDI beneficiaries is attributed to various factors such as changes in work opportunities, federal policy, and demographic shifts. Experts predict that the share of the insured population receiving SSDI will stabilize in the future due to aging and increased female enrollment rates. The DI trust fund's financial outlook is analyzed under different laws, including the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015. The discussion focuses on the projected depletion year of the DI trust fund, which is when the fund's balance reaches zero. Once depleted, the trust fund continues to receive income from payroll taxes and benefits taxation, but there is uncertainty on how benefits will be paid when current tax revenues are insufficient. The Antideficiency Act prohibits federal agencies from spending beyond available funds, posing a challenge for making SSDI benefit payments solely from the DI trust fund without a change in the law. The DI trust fund may face delayed or reduced monthly cash payments without a law change. Trustees projected depletion in 2016, with OASI trust fund depletion in 2035. Combined OASDI trust funds could be depleted in 2034. Trust fund ratios show asset reserves compared to total cost. The Congressional Budget Office estimated the DI trust fund would be depleted in FY2017, OASI trust fund in 2031, and combined OASDI trust funds in 2029. Different projections exist due to varying assumptions. Upon depletion in 2016, tax revenues would cover 81% of SSDI benefits, projected to rise to 90% in the 2030s and decline to 81% in 2089. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 authorized a temporary reallocation of the Social Security payroll tax rate to provide the Disability Insurance (DI) trust fund with a larger share for 2016 through 2018. Specifically, the DI trust fund's share of the tax rate for employees and employers each increased by 0.285 percentage point at the beginning of 2016, from 0.900% to 1.185%. The reallocation of the Social Security payroll tax rate in 2016 increased DI's share by 0.570 percentage points to 2.370%. OASI's share decreased by 0.285 percentage points to 5.015%. Both DI and OASI trust funds are scheduled to return to their 2015 levels in 2019 and later. The reallocation of the Social Security payroll tax rate in 2016 increased DI's share by 0.570 percentage points to 2.370% and decreased OASI's share by 0.285 percentage points to 5.015%. This reallocation is projected to extend the solvency of the DI trust fund to approximately the third quarter of 2022, while slightly reducing the solvency of the OASI trust fund. The depletion year for the theoretical combined OASDI trust funds is estimated to remain unchanged at 2034. The depletion year for the theoretical combined OASDI trust funds is projected to remain unchanged at calendar year 2029 under CBO's extended baseline projections. Congress has authorized the reallocation of the payroll tax rate multiple times in the past to put the OASI and DI trust funds on a more or less equal financial footing. Lawmakers historically included payroll tax reallocations in major amendments to the Social Security Act. Reallocation of payroll tax rate has been used to balance the OASI and DI trust funds. Legislation may change the allocation multiple times. FICA taxes are crucial for Social Security trust funds. The House adopted a rule to address this issue. The House adopted the \"Johnson Rule\" in the 115th Congress to make structural changes to SSDI. The rule allows a point of order against legislation reducing the OASI trust fund balance by 0.01% over 75 years, unless it improves the combined OASI and DI trust funds. This allows for short-term financing measures with revenue increases or cost reductions. In their 2015 report, trustees project a future taxable payroll of nearly $421 trillion from 2015 to 2089. The reallocation schedule in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 will increase income to the DI trust fund by $117 billion and reduce income to the OASI trust fund by the same amount. The act could have faced a point of order under the new rule if proposed separately, but other provisions in the budget agreement are projected to improve the long-term actuarial balance of the combined OASDI trust funds. To improve the long-term financial outlook of the DI trust fund, Congress could consider legislative changes such as increasing tax revenues or reducing program costs. The last major effort to address the financial condition of Social Security trust funds was in the early 1980s with the passage of the Social Security Amendments of 1983. Similar legislation could be enacted to improve the long-term solvency of the trust funds. Congress could enact legislation to improve the long-term solvency of the DI trust fund or both trust funds. Various reform proposals are available to address the solvency of the DI trust fund, including increasing tax revenues or reducing program costs. Resources for these proposals can be found in CRS Report R43054, CBO's reports from 2012 and 2015, OACT's Summary of Provisions, and cost estimates for different proposals affecting the trust funds. The creation of a separate DI trust fund was established during the debate over the establishment of SSDI as part of the Social Security Amendments of 1956. Policymakers had discussed proposals to amend the Social Security Act to provide covered workers with disability insurance since the late 1930s. By the 1950s, there was enough support for the creation of a federal disability insurance program for Congress to consider the matter. In 1955, Representative Jere Cooper introduced a bill to amend the Social Security Act for disability benefits for insured workers aged 50 to 64. The House passed the bill, but it faced opposition in the Senate. The Senate Committee on Finance removed the disability insurance provisions from H.R. 7225 due to concerns about the potential cost and uncertainty over its impact on the OASI trust fund. Lawmakers were worried that economic downturns could lead to more unemployed workers applying for benefits, affecting solvency. The Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration highlighted the challenges in estimating costs for disability benefits, especially under varying employment conditions. The Senate Committee on Finance removed disability insurance provisions from H.R. 7225 due to concerns about cost and impact on the OASI trust fund. Senator George proposed reinstating disability insurance with a separate trust fund to prevent cost increases to the OASI fund. Senator Thomas C. Hennings, Jr. supported the proposal for a separate trust fund for disability insurance to prevent endangering the old-age and survivors insurance fund. Opponents, like Senator Wallace F. Bennett, argued that this approach may not address concerns about the program's cost. The Senate narrowly passed the George amendment to establish a separate DI trust fund for social security on July 17, 1956. The House adopted the Senate provision, and the conference report on H.R. 7225 was cleared without amendments. Senator George emphasized the need for additional funds to support the program. Senator George supported his amendment by highlighting the separation of funds for disability payments in a distinct trust fund. Contributions and disbursements for disability benefits will be kept separate, ensuring transparency in costs. The disability program is limited to specific percentages of payroll from employers, employees, and the self-employed, with disbursements not exceeding available funds. This addresses concerns about the original proposal's cost determination. Our amendment addresses concerns about the original proposal's cost determination and ensures transparency in costs by separating funds for disability payments in a distinct trust fund. Additionally, it addresses worries that the program may end up costing more than estimated and divert funds from old-age or survivors insurance. The DI trust fund was established in 1956 with key dates projected for the Social Security Trust Funds."
