    "content": "\"Conveyances of covered land.\" In this Act, definitions include County (Mohave County, Arizona), Covered land (Federal land in Mohave County), Map (Mineral Park Land Status Map), and Qualified entity (owner of mining claims or successor). The owner must have the right of possession of mining claims, millsites, or tunnel sites on the covered land and have paid the annual claim maintenance fee or filed a waiver by September 1, 2016, for the upcoming assessment year. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior. Land conveyances are subject to certain requirements, and must be completed within 180 days of a specified date. The Secretary of the Interior must offer for sale the remaining right, title, and interest of the United States in covered land to qualified entities within 180 days of the enactment of the Act. The conveyance must be completed within 1 year of the acceptance of the offer by a qualified entity. Upon delivery of the conveyance instrument, any prior mineral interests held by the qualified entity will merge with the conveyed right, ensuring the entity receives fee simple title to the purchased land. An appraisal is required to determine the fair market value. The Secretary determines fair market value of land to be conveyed under specific guidelines. The qualified entity must cover all costs related to the conveyance, including surveys. The map of the land is available for public inspection. The Secretary can make minor corrections to the Map or land description. The authority to sell covered land will end 10 years after the Act's enactment."
