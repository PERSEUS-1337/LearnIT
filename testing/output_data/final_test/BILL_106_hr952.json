    "content": "The \"Local Zoning Preservation Act of 1999\" is the short title of this Act. The purpose of the Act is outlined in Section 2, which includes findings and objectives. The \"Local Zoning Preservation Act of 1999\" preserves local zoning authority over decisions regarding personal wireless service facilities, with specific requirements for zoning applications and decisions. State and municipal zoning decisions have traditionally been given deference by Federal courts due to the local nature of land use issues. Issues of land use are local and fall under State authority. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 aimed to regulate personal wireless service facilities while preserving local zoning authority. However, limitations in the Act have led to unnecessary litigation between States and localities over facility applications, with courts sometimes misinterpreting the Act's intent. Many States and localities are facing pressure to approve unsightly personal wireless service towers, despite concerns from residents about their impact on property values and community aesthetics. Some localities have refused to approve these facilities due to citizen concerns. The Communications Act of 1934, as amended in 1996, includes limitations on state and local government decisions regarding these requests. State or local government decisions to deny requests for personal wireless service facilities must be supported by substantial evidence in writing. This standard has led to litigation in Federal courts, with judges sometimes overturning local zoning board decisions. Federal courts are divided on what constitutes substantial evidence to uphold a zoning board's denial of permits for construction. Some Federal courts have refused to acknowledge citizen concerns about aesthetics or property value as valid reasons for denying a personal wireless service facility permit, stating that such concerns do not meet the substantial evidence requirement. Some Federal courts have held that local residents' concerns about the impact of personal wireless service facilities on community aesthetics can be considered \"substantial evidence\". Some courts have ruled that local residents' worries about the aesthetics of personal wireless service facilities can be seen as substantial evidence, suggesting a need to amend the Telecommunications Act of 1996 for clearer guidance. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 may need to be amended to address concerns about the aesthetics of personal wireless service facilities. The proposed changes would encourage collaboration between wireless providers and local authorities to design alternatives that do not intrude on residential communities, avoiding costly litigation. SEC. 3 of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended to include testimony from local residents expressing concerns about the impact of personal wireless service facilities. Additionally, in cases involving tower facility placement, construction, or modification, the burden of proof falls on the person seeking these actions."
