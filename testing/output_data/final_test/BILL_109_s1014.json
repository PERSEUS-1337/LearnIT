Congress finds that from September 2001 to November 2004, around 410,000 reserve component members were mobilized for military operations.

Increased funding of $2,000,000 for fiscal year 2006, $2,100,000 for fiscal year 2007, and $2,200,000 for fiscal year 2008 is authorized for the Office of Veterans Business Development.
