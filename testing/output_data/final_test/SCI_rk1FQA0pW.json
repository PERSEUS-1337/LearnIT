Deep learning methods in medical imaging often work on reconstructed images, but it is desirable to train DNNs directly from original data. A proposed end-to-end DNN for abnormality detection in medical imaging aligns acquisitions with radiologist annotations using an unrolled version of iterative reconstruction algorithms. The proposed end-to-end DNN for lung nodule detection in low-dose chest CT utilized an unrolled version of iterative reconstruction algorithms to map acquisitions to images. A 3D CNN was then employed to detect abnormalities in the reconstructed images, resulting in better sensitivity and accuracy compared to a two-step approach. The DNN significantly reduced false positive rates on suspicious lesions, addressing the issue of over-diagnosis in low-dose lung CT imaging. Deep neural networks (DNN) have shown promising performance in computer vision for various applications such as segmentation, detection, and recognition in medical imaging. DNN-based computer vision is desirable for radiologists to handle large amounts of data and reduce misdiagnosis risks. Low-dose CT scans are preferred to minimize radiation harm, but increased noise levels make it challenging for radiologists to make accurate decisions. Most DNNs in medical image analysis are constructed in the same domain where radiologists observe images. In medical imaging, data are often acquired in different domains from images, leading to the need for inverse problems to reconstruct images. Noise in measurements, especially in low-dose scans, can result in information loss during reconstruction. Iterative methods and DNN-based reconstruction approaches have been proposed to address this issue, but there is still a gap between image quality improvement and utility in diagnosis for both radiologists and computer-aided systems. In recent years, there has been a trend towards task-based signal processing with DNNs, where decisions are made directly by the DNNs without intermediate representations. Various applications have shown improved performance with end-to-end DNNs compared to multiple-step learning approaches. This paper proposes an end-to-end DNN for predicting the location of objects. The paper proposes an end-to-end DNN for predicting the location of abnormalities in images. A reconstruction DNN aligns the data with annotations from radiologists using a 3D CNN to detect abnormalities. The method was evaluated on lung nodule detection for early cancer screening using ultra low-dose CT scans. The end-to-end DNN method for abnormality detection in medical imaging was evaluated using entropy loss and ROC. It outperformed a two-step approach and provided a more comprehensive understanding of the DNN. The acquisition domain's low coherence with the image domain necessitates alignment with radiologists' annotations for practical application. In the proposed end-to-end DNN for abnormality detection in medical imaging, a reconstruction network is used to map data to the image domain, followed by a detection network to identify lesions. The reconstruction problem involves a measurement matrix, noise weighting matrix, a function incorporating prior knowledge, and a hyper-parameter to balance data fidelity and prior knowledge terms. The optimization algorithm SQS is commonly used to solve this problem efficiently. The reconstruction model involves algorithms with simple updating formulas and fast convergence rates. Prior functions like total variation or wavelet transform are used, but they limit the expression power of the model. One solution is to approximate iterative solutions with finite steps using DNNs. This approach has been successful with algorithms like ISTA, steepest descend, ADMM, and primal-dual. By replacing operations on prior functions with neural networks, the updating formula is modified. The reconstruction model involves updating formulas using neural networks, with CNNs f n (\u00b7) and g n (\u00b7). The formula is modified for efficiency by omitting g n (x) and adding an adaptive step size \u03bb n. The reconstruction network minimizes L2-distance between reconstructed images and ground truth. The structure of the DNN follows prior work by Adler & \u00d6ktem (2017). The reconstruction model involves updating formulas using neural networks with CNNs. The system matrix A is constructed using multi-slice fan-beam geometry for efficiency in training. The input to the DNN contains L successive layers of images to utilize correlation between adjacent slices during reconstruction. In the context of CT imaging systems, lung nodules are abnormal tissues that may develop into cancer. Detecting these nodules early is crucial for cancer screening. Various CAD systems, including those using deep neural networks, have been developed for automatic nodule detection. A patch-based solution that works on 3D patches with specific spatial resolution has shown promise in detecting lung nodules accurately. The study focused on detecting lung nodules in CT imaging using a patch-based solution with specific spatial resolution. A coarse segmentation of the lung was performed to limit detection to that region. The end-to-end DNN combined reconstruction and detection networks, with cross entropy used for training. Memory issues with GPU were noted due to the memory-intensive nature of the reconstruction DNN. The algorithm proposed in the study aimed to detect lung nodules using a patch-based approach. It involved forward and backpropagation steps, with weights initialized from pre-trained results. The patches were extracted within lung regions, with denser sampling on nodules due to limited positive samples. Sub-layers were non-overlapping to reduce computational load. The algorithm for detecting lung nodules involved sampling on nodules due to limited positive samples. Patches were augmented before being fed to the detection network, and flips were applied during aggregation. The reconstructed image was obtained by aggregating patches and labels. Network parameters for reconstruction and detection were returned at the end. The reconstruction and detection networks utilized non-overlapped sub-layers without normalization factors. The gradient with respect to \u03b8 r was calculated, leading to algorithm 1's step 16. The Jacobian matrix J x (\u03b8) was defined for backpropagation through the reconstruction neural network. Changes to the neural network weights were made based on gradients in step 18 using the Adam algorithm. The TCIA LIDC-IDRI dataset with 1,018 chest CT scans annotated by radiologists was used for simulation. The dataset was split into a training set and testing set, with images resampled and padded. Low-dose CT scans were simulated using forward projection with ultra low-dose settings. Photon counts were assumed to follow a Poisson distribution for each detector unit. The reconstruction neural network was trained using 5 random successive layers for 5,500 iterations with Adam algorithm. The weights were initialized following Gaussian distribution, except for PReLU units which were initialized to ReLU. The trained network was used for the training of the nodule detector. The reconstruction network was trained for the nodule detector using non-small nodules. Positive samples were augmented and annotated multiple times. Negative samples included non-nodules and lung tissues. 400 patches were randomly selected in the lung region, and 100 patches on the edges, away from nodules. The detection network was trained with 64,720 positive samples and 522,694 negative samples. Adam algorithm was used with a step size of 1 \u00d7 10 \u22124. A mini-batch size of 100 and 12 epochs were used. Fine-tuning was done with 40 successive layers for each iteration. Patches were extracted from the testing dataset in the same way as the training dataset. Patch-wise cross entropy loss was calculated for both two-step and end-to-end trained neural networks. ROC analysis was performed. In the study, entropy loss was calculated for two-step and end-to-end trained neural networks. ROC analysis was conducted by adjusting the decision threshold. Streaking artifacts were observed in reconstructions due to lack of intensity control, leading to insensitivity of the detection network to biases. Overlapped reconstruction with a step size of 1 was performed to eliminate artifacts. Operations were carried out on a Tesla K40m using CUDA and Tensorflow. The reconstruction operations were integrated into Tensorflow using CUDA on a Tesla K40m. Patch extraction and gradient aggregation were CPU-based, while gradient backpropagation utilized a dummy operation. Patch-wise entropy losses were calculated for validation data in two-step and end-to-end training. Cross entropy losses and ROC analysis were conducted, showing improved results with end-to-end training. The end-to-end training scheme showed significant sensitivity gains for lung nodule detection compared to two-step training. Cross entropy analysis revealed reduced errors on non-nodules, with small gains on other sample types. Reconstruction network outputs for validation images were visualized. The DNN based reconstruction results showed reduced noise in the lung region compared to FBP. End-to-end training yielded CT images with better contrast and more details in the lung region. CNN feature maps during reconstruction provided insights into the differences between two-step and end-to-end networks. Correlations between feature maps were calculated for each channel. The most correlated and uncorrelated feature maps were presented in Figure 11, showing that the end-to-end network emphasized lung tissue preservation. A novel end-to-end DNN was proposed for abnormality detection in medical imaging, achieving higher non-small lung nodule detection accuracy compared to two-step training. There was a significant reduction in false positive rate on suspicious lesions and an overall improvement in detection accuracy. The end-to-end method showed fair improvement in detection sensitivity and accuracy for suspicious lesions. The reconstructed images resembled ordinary CT images with more details but increased noise. The mean entropy loss for nodule detection was smaller or similar to the two-step method in most cases, indicating statistical improvement. However, there was one case with significantly higher entropy loss due to misclassification of positive samples. While there was no significant improvement in total AUC, the ROC study showed a significantly improved true positive rate at small false positive rates. The end-to-end DNN method showed improved sensitivity for cancer screening tasks, with higher spatial resolution in lung images compared to the two-step training. Despite some misclassification due to increased noise, the overall performance for nodule detection was promising. The end-to-end training scheme improved nodule detection performance by focusing on sharper edges and clearer lung tissue structures, compared to the two-step method. This approach prioritizes selecting appropriate data representations for better detection accuracy. In this work, the feasibility of end-to-end DNN for abnormality detection in medical imaging was demonstrated for lung nodule detection in chest CT. It was concluded that integrating the reconstruction process into the detection pipeline can improve CAD systems' accuracy and value to radiologists."
