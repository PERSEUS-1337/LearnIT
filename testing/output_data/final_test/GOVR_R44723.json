    "content": "Congress uses an annual appropriations process to fund discretionary spending for federal government agencies through 12 regular appropriations bills each fiscal year. If these bills are not enacted by October 1, continuing resolutions (CRs) provide temporary funding until the process is completed. Extensions of CRs may be enacted until all regular appropriations bills are completed or the fiscal year ends. H.R. 5325 provided continuing appropriations for projects and activities covered by 11 of the 12 regular appropriations bills for the period from October 1, 2016, through December 9, 2016. It also included appropriations for the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act for FY2017, as well as emergency funds for Zika virus and flood relief. H.R. 5325 was signed into law on September 29, 2016. Subsequently, H.R. 2028 was passed in December 2016, providing further continuing appropriations for FY2017. The report analyzes additional provisions in Division A of H.R. 2028, extending appropriations through April 28, 2017. It includes funding for Overseas Contingency Operations for the fiscal year and provisions for Senate consideration of a waiver for the nomination of James N. Mattis as Secretary of Defense. The report summarizes the overall funding provided and budget enforcement issues associated with statutory discretionary spending limits. It also provides short summaries of agency-, account-, or program-specific provisions in the CR, organized by appropriations act title. For more information on CRs and historical data, refer to CRS Report R42647. The Continuing Resolution (CR) provides funds for projects and activities specified in previous appropriations acts, with a funding rate based on annual budget authority. The duration of a CR determines the period of budget authority provided for covered activities. The Continuing Resolution (CR) provides budget authority for projects and activities funded in previous appropriations acts, prorated based on the duration of the CR. The CR includes budget authority subject to statutory limits on discretionary spending for FY2017 established by the Budget Control Act of 2011 and modified by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015. The Continuing Resolution (CR) includes budget authority subject to statutory limits on discretionary spending for FY2017. It also provides budget authority exempt from those limits, such as for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism, continuing disability reviews, health care fraud and abuse control, disaster relief, and emergency requirements. The CR extends provisions from FY2016 appropriations acts and restricts the use of funds for activities not available in FY2016. The Continuing Resolution (CR) extends funding for FY2017 through April 28, 2017, allowing budget authority for projects and activities funded in FY2016 appropriations acts. Funding may be superseded by regular appropriations acts or another CR before April 28, with budget authority ceasing for projects not funded in subsequent appropriations acts. The Continuing Resolution (CR) extends funding for FY2017 through April 28, 2017, based on FY2016 amounts. Most projects face a 0.1901% decrease in funding, except for specific exemptions like OCO/GWOT, health care fraud control, and disaster relief. The Continuing Resolution (CR) extends funding for FY2017 through April 28, 2017, based on FY2016 amounts. Most projects face a 0.1901% decrease in funding, except for specific exemptions like OCO/GWOT, health care fraud control, and disaster relief. The decrease does apply to advance appropriations enacted in previous fiscal years that first became available in FY2017, subject to statutory discretionary spending limits on defense and nondefense categories. Sequestration may occur if spending exceeds statutory limits, resulting in across-the-board cuts. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provides a report at the beginning of the year with adjusted discretionary spending caps for FY2017. OMB evaluates spending relative to limits and determines if sequestration is necessary. The first evaluation under the Budget Control Act (BCA) is scheduled after Congress adjourns, with an adjusted schedule for FY2017 provided by P.L. 114-254. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates the budgetary effects of interim CRs on an \"annualized\" basis. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates the budgetary effects of interim CRs on an \"annualized\" basis. The total amount of annualized discretionary budget authority for regular appropriations subject to the Budget Control Act (BCA) limits is $1,069.599 billion, approximately the amount of the combined statutory discretionary spending limits for FY2017. CBO estimates that under P.L. 114-254 defense spending would total $548.122 billion. Under P.L. 114-254, defense spending is estimated at $548.122 billion, slightly below the limit, while nondefense spending is projected to be $521.477 billion, slightly above the limit. Section 184 adjusts the timetable for enforcing spending limits, with OMB required to make a determination within 10 days after the end of the second session of the 114th Congress. Final sequestration reports may be delayed if enacted appropriations for FY2017 do not exceed the spending limits. Further appropriations legislation for FY2017 could impact these projections. CBO estimates total annualized budget authority resulting from this CR and prior appropriations for FY2017 to be $1,166.296 billion. CRs typically include provisions specific to certain agencies, accounts, or programs, with anomalies designated to preserve Congress's prerogative in appropriations. Congress has the authority to provide appropriations as it sees fit, including short-term funding. Provisions in continuing resolutions can create new laws or modify existing ones, often renewing expiring provisions or establishing new policies temporarily. The President may request these changes, but Congress can accept, reject, or modify them during the appropriations process. Members can also propose additional anomalies or law changes for inclusion. This section of the report summarizes agency-, account-, or program-specific provisions in the CR, alphabetically organized by appropriations act title. It includes brief explanations and additional information on provisions, such as whether they were requested by the President or included in prior year CRs. Contact CRS appropriations experts for more details. OMB can apportion funding to the Department of Agriculture's Farm Loan Program as needed during the CR. The CR allows for funding of approved farm loans at a necessary rate, potentially providing the entire FY2016 amount. It also permits funding for USDA's FNS Summer EBT demonstration projects to fully operate by May 2017, benefiting low-income households with school-age children. The Administration requested anomaly funding in March 2017 to provide EBT benefits to low-income households with school-age children over the summer months. This provision funds the USDA National Hunger Clearinghouse for FY2017, extending funding that expired in September 2016. Additionally, the section allows the Rural Utilities Service to transfer budget authority to support increased subsidy costs for Treasury direct telecommunication loans. The FY2016 subsidy rate for the Treasury direct telecommunication loan program will increase from 0.03% to 0.89% in FY2017. RUS has 10 loans that will not have funds without approval for transfer of budget authority. The FY2016 budget authority level would support $11.7 million in loan authority. RUS is estimated to transfer about $1.08 million to support a loan level of $120 million. This provision allows OMB to apportion funds for the Section 538 Guaranteed Multi-Family Housing Loan Program at a higher rate to fund approved loans. The CR includes a new provision for loan guarantees for affordable rental housing in rural areas. It provides emergency funding for USDA land rehabilitation programs without specific disaster requirements. Funding can be used according to program authorities, not limited by the Stafford Act. These programs typically receive ad hoc appropriations. The CR includes a provision for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to receive an additional $20 million for FY2017 under the 21st Century Cures Act. This funding is part of a total of $500 million authorized over a nine-year period to support FDA activities and programs. The release of funds is controlled through the annual appropriations process. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is allocating funds to maintain launch schedules for the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) to ensure continuous satellite coverage for weather forecasting. JPSS will replace current satellite systems with JPSS-1 launching in 2017 and JPSS-2 in 2021, addressing concerns about potential coverage gaps. JPSS will provide essential global environmental data for weather prediction models. The CR includes provisions for maintaining launch schedules of JPSS, allowing flexibility for NASA to spend at a faster rate to ensure planned launches. The Census Bureau can draw on funds from the Periodic Censuses and Programs account to maintain the 2020 census schedule. NASA is accelerating spending to maintain launch schedules for the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion crew capsule for future human space exploration. $7 million is allocated for security costs related to President-elect Donald Trump through the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) program. The JAG program provides funding for various criminal justice initiatives, including law enforcement, prosecution, prevention, corrections, drug treatment, technology improvement, and victim programs. $75 million is allocated for repairs at NASA facilities damaged by Hurricane Matthew. The language providing continuing appropriations at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida does not allow for new projects or multi-year contracts. P.L. 114-254 includes provisions for three major weapons programs, including funding for new missile-launching submarines to replace the Ohio-class fleet. Navy officials warn of delays if design work is not started soon. Section 156 of the bill allows the U.S. Army to sign multi-year contracts for helicopter upgrades and purchases, saving nearly $1 billion over five years. Section 157 exempts the Air Force's KC-46A tanker program from production rate restrictions, enabling the purchase of 15 planes in FY2017. Section 158 provides funding for the National Nuclear Security Administration's Atomic Energy Defense. Section 158 allows funding for the National Nuclear Security Administration's Atomic Energy Defense Activities to differ from the levels specified in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016. FY2016 funding levels will not apply to Atomic Energy Defense Activities in FY2017 if the Secretary of Energy informs the House and Senate Appropriations Committees of any significant deviations. Section 159 authorizes the Secretary of Energy to draw down and sell up to $375.4 million of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in FY2017 for the Energy Security and Infrastructure Modernization Fund. The Life Extension II project for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve will receive funding from the Energy Security and Infrastructure Modernization Fund. The Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund will have an annual funding rate of $767.0 million. Funding levels specified in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 must be adhered to for programs, projects, and activities under this account. Section 123 of the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2017 will no longer be in effect, superseded by new provisions. Approximately $1.025 billion in funding is allocated for efforts related to the Corps of Engineers. The bill provides $1.025 billion in funding for Corps of Engineers Civil Works projects affected by natural disasters. Sections 187 and 188 allocate funds for emergency situations, repairs, and dredging of navigation projects. The funding is not limited to specific natural disaster response efforts. Section 189 allocates $259.6 million to dredge federal navigation projects and repair damages caused by natural disasters. Section 190 provides $419.9 million for flood control and coastal emergencies, including preparation and response to floods, hurricanes, and other natural disasters. This funding is used for repairing flood control works, funding flood fighting activities, and certain emergency beach nourishment projects. The Former Presidents Act provides funding for former Presidents' pensions equal to Cabinet secretaries' pay. An amendment to the Scholarships for Opportunity and Results Act establishes new requirements for unobligated funds. Anomalies in funding have been included in recent years to maintain staffing for U.S. Customs and Border Protection personnel. The anomaly in Section 163 of the CR for FY2017 provides flexibility for maintaining staffing levels of various agencies, including CBP, ICE, TSA, and Secret Service, to ensure border security, immigration enforcement, and aviation security. This flexibility covers both salaries and non-pay expenses to respond to unpredictable surges in migration. Congress authorized the apportionment of appropriations up to the necessary rate for staffing and maintenance. The CR authorizes appropriations for staffing, maintenance, security, and administrative expenses of the National Gallery of Art, including the East Building renovation with new exhibition space. It also covers funding for the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened in 2016, to support operations and staffing. The CR provides funding for operating and staffing newly constructed Indian Health Service facilities, allowing for higher rates of funding than usual. Additionally, it includes an extra $100 million for capitalization grants for the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund. Section 196(b) of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 allows states to use Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) funding to provide assistance to water systems facing contamination issues, such as lead in drinking water. This includes additional subsidies like grants and forgiveness of debt incurred prior to the enactment of the Act, in cases where there is a threat to public health from lead exposure or a state of emergency declaration due to lead contamination in municipal water supplies. An emergency declaration has been issued to use over 20% of DWSRF capitalization grants for subsidies. $20 million is appropriated to EPA for loans under the WIFIA program. Section 197 requires fees from WIFIA to be credited to appropriations. The WIFIA program is new and will provide credit support to borrowers. Fair share collections will fund administrative activities related to FECA. The U.S. Postal Service and certain federal entities must pay for their share of FECA administrative costs. The Obama Administration requested an increase in fair share collections to combat fraud in the FECA program. Section 169 extends budget authority for the Secretary of Education to pay guaranty agencies. The Higher Education Act provides budget authority for the Secretary of Education to pay account maintenance fees to guaranty agencies under the FFEL program. These fees compensate guaranty agencies for administering federal loan guarantees, and are equal to 0.06% of the original principal balance of outstanding FFEL loans. Although new FFEL loans are no longer being originated, many existing loans remain outstanding. FFEL loans terminated in 2010, but many remain outstanding, leading guaranty agencies to continue administrative tasks. The Department of Health and Human Services can transfer up to $300 million to Refugee and Entrant Assistance programs for unaccompanied alien children. This program has seen increased demand due to a rise in apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border. Funds for this transfer come from the HHS Nonrecurring Expenses Fund. The CR allows for the transfer of funds from the Department of Health and Human Services to Refugee and Entrant Assistance programs for unaccompanied alien children. The transfer must not be made available before February 1, 2017, and additional appropriations may be made after March 1, 2017, based on caseload increases. $100 million is rescinded from the Nonrecurring Expenses Fund, with specific instructions for fund transfers to HHS agencies. The FY2017 CDC prevention budget is $1 million less than FY2016 due to higher sequestration percentage. $150 million is set aside for SSA's ODAR backlog. Plan includes hiring more judges and staff. The LAE account allocated $150 million for renovating the Altmeyer Building. Section 172 repurposes this funding to address the ODAR hearings backlog. Additionally, the section extends funding for TANF block grants and child welfare activities. Section 194 of the CR appropriates $352 million in the NIH Innovation account for four NIH Innovation Projects as described in the 21st Century Cures Act. The projects include the Precision Medicine Initiative, Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies Initiative, cancer research, and regenerative medicine. These funds are necessary to fulfill the requirements of the Cures Act. Section 194 of the CR appropriates $352 million in the NIH Innovation account for four NIH Innovation Projects as described in the 21st Century Cures Act, including Precision Medicine Initiative, Brain Research, cancer research, and regenerative medicine. The NIH director has the authority to transfer funds between accounts for these projects. Section 195 appropriates $500 million for state grants to address opioid abuse. Section 1003 of the Cures Act authorizes appropriations for grants to states to address the opioid abuse crisis. The funds must be appropriated to be available for expenditure, as stated in Section 195 of the CR. These appropriations support specific HHS activities authorized in related acts. Section 198 also appropriates an additional $20. Section 198 appropriates $20 million to the CDC Environmental Health account for lead contamination in city drinking water systems. It establishes a voluntary registry for exposed residents and an advisory committee. $17.5 million is for the registry and $2.5 million for the committee. Funds can be transferred to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. $20 million is allocated to the CDC Environmental Health account for childhood lead poisoning prevention programs. An additional $15 million is appropriated for the Healthy Start Program to address family, maternal, and child health issues. $170 million of mandatory spending for FY2017 CHIP allotments is rescinded. Section 201 of MACRA rescinds $170 million from the FY2017 CHIP allotments, reducing the appropriation to $14.53 billion. It also prohibits an increase in salaries for Members of Congress during FY2017, keeping the salary level at $174,000. The automatic adjustment for Member pay each year is determined by changes in private sector wages, limited by law to the GS base pay increase. The maximum potential pay adjustment for January 2017 was 1.6%, or $2,800. The O'Neill Building is transferred to the House of Representatives for custody and control by the Architect of the Capitol. The Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Federal Building, previously known as Federal Office Building 8, was designated by P.L. 112-237 on December 28, 2012. It is located in Washington, DC and was reopened in late 2013 after extensive renovations. The building is under the custody and control of the Architect of the Capitol, who can lease space to federal departments and agencies with approval from the House Office Building Commission. Funds from these leases are deposited into the House Office Buildings Fund for specific use as outlined in the legislation. Section 178 of the 115th Congress continues the Senate National Security Working Group, suspending changes to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's hours of service rules for commercial truck drivers. The 2013 rule change for commercial truck drivers required a 34-hour off-duty period covering two consecutive 1 a.m.-5 a.m. periods. This change aimed to reduce driver fatigue and promote highway safety. Congress suspended enforcement of these changes in FY2015 and FY2016 pending a study on costs and benefits. The CR includes provisions for the FAA's Operations and Facilities and Equipment accounts, allowing for funding apportionment to avoid disruptions and shifting $9.4 million in funding. Additionally, it allows the Maritime Administration to reprogram funding for the midshipmen Sea Year training program and removes a requirement for funding allocation at the Merchant Marine Academy. The Department of Transportation (DOT) submitted a plan to Congress detailing how funding will be used at the academy, including provisions in the CR requested by the President. This provision allows for higher funding apportionment to the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Tenant-Based Rental Assistance account to support the Tribal HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing program for Native American veterans. Additionally, $1.0 billion is appropriated to the Federal Highway Administration's Emergency Relief Program to repair highway infrastructure damage. The CR includes a provision for the Department of Transportation to provide funds for repairing highway infrastructure damaged by flooding. An additional $1,808,976,000 is allocated for Community Development Block Grant-Disaster Relief activities to aid in disaster recovery efforts. The funds will be used for housing, infrastructure, and economic recovery in areas affected by severe weather events in 2016. The Budget Control Act sets aside $3,000,000 for overseeing the obligation and expenditure of CDBG-DR funds. P.L. 114-223 appropriated $500,000,000 for communities and states affected by disasters in 2016. Sections 167 and 179 of P.L. 114-254 establish additional authorities unrelated to appropriations acts, including expanding eligibility for a health care plan for United Mine Workers of America retirees in 2017. The provision in Section 113(a) of the budget act transfers funds from the federal government to cover health benefits for eligible retirees in the bituminous coal industry affected by bankruptcy. It also establishes expedited procedures for Senate consideration of legislation related to the Secretary of Defense's military service. The legal restriction in Title 10 of the U.S. Code prevents individuals from being appointed as Secretary of Defense within seven years of active duty. This could affect retired Marine Corp General James N. Mattis, selected by President-elect Donald J. Trump. Waiver legislation must be introduced within 30 days of the 115th Congress convening for Mattis to serve as Secretary of Defense. The legislation for a waiver to appoint a Secretary of Defense within seven years of active duty is stipulated and must be referred to the Senate Committee on Armed Services. If the committee does not report the legislation within five session days, it is automatically discharged. A non-debatable motion can be made to proceed with the legislation on the Senate Calendar of Business. If the motion is adopted, there would be up to 10 hours of debate before the Senate considers and disposes of the measure. The Senate would have up to 10 hours of debate on the waiver legislation, controlled by party leaders. Amendments and dilatory motions are not allowed. Passage of the waiver legislation requires a three-fifths majority vote. If vetoed, Senate consideration of the veto message would be limited to 10 hours. The Senate can adjust these procedures by unanimous consent. Section 179 does not establish expedited procedures for House consideration of waiver legislation. Such legislation would likely come to the House floor under a special rule reported by the House Committee on Rules or under the suspension of the rules procedure."
