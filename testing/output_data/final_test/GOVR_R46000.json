The poverty rate decreased from 12.3% in 2017, with 39.6 million individuals in poverty. The Census Bureau's estimates are used to determine poverty levels based on family income compared to a poverty threshold. These poverty estimates are released annually in September. This report discusses year-to-year comparisons and statistical significance at the 90% confidence level. It also includes historical data on poverty for demographic groups and states. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) is introduced as an alternative research measure that considers taxes and in-kind benefits on poverty. Comparisons between the official measure and the SPM are provided at the end of the report. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) considers taxes and in-kind benefits on poverty, providing insights for policymakers. The Census Bureau determines poverty status by comparing resources to a poverty threshold. Policymakers may be interested in historical trends for developing poverty-related legislation and overseeing programs aiding the low-income population. The poverty threshold is determined by family size and composition, using money income before taxes. In-kind benefits are not considered income for the official poverty measure. Threshold amounts vary based on family size and ages of family members. The poverty threshold is determined by family size and composition, using money income before taxes. In-kind benefits are not considered income for the official poverty measure. The poverty line in 2018 is around $25,701 for a family of four, updated annually for inflation. Geographic variations in living expenses are not accounted for in the thresholds. The federal government's definition of poverty is used for statistical purposes. The poverty threshold, determined by family size and income before taxes, is around $25,701 for a family of four in 2018. The poverty rates in the U.S. have fluctuated over time, with notable lows in 1973 and 2000, and peaks in 1983, 1993, and 2010. Poverty rates fell through the 1960s and have generally risen and fallen according to economic cycles. The poverty rate in the U.S. peaked in 1983, 1993, and 2010. It tends to rise during and after recessions, lagging behind leading economic indicators like new housing construction. The poverty rate in 2018 decreased for the fourth consecutive year but remained higher than in 2000. The drop from 12.3% in 2017 to 11.8% in 2018 affected certain demographic groups more, such as female-householder families, children, the population aged 18 to 64, and non-Hispanic whites. In 2018, female-householder families had a poverty rate of 24.9%, higher than married-couple families (4.7%) and male-householder families (12.7%). In 2018, female-householder families had a poverty rate of 24.9%, higher than married-couple families (4.7%) and male-householder families (12.7%). Female-householder families saw a 1.3% decline in their poverty rate from 2017, one of the lowest rates on record. Individuals not in families had a poverty rate of 20.2% in 2018, similar to the previous year. Poverty rates vary by age groups: under 18, 18 to 64, and 65 and older, each with distinct income sources and circumstances. In 2018, the aged population, aged 65 and older, did not see significant changes in poverty rates compared to children and the working-age population. The poverty rate for those age 65 and over used to be the highest among the three groups historically, but it has decreased over the years. In 2018, poverty rates varied by age group, with people under 18 having the highest rate. Poverty rates also varied by race and Hispanic origin, with non-Hispanic whites experiencing a decrease. Having a job reduced the likelihood of poverty, but did not guarantee avoidance, as many working-age adults living in poverty were employed. Among 18 to 64-year-olds, poverty rates were 5.1% for all workers, 2.3% for full-time year-round workers, and 12.7% for part-time or part-year workers, with no significant changes from the previous year. Poverty status can be influenced by a family member's work status. In 2018, 58.9% of those without jobs lived in families where someone else worked. Poverty rates vary across the country, with states in the Appalachians, Deep South, and Southwest showing higher rates. Mississippi had one of the highest poverty rates at 19.7%. In 2018, poverty rates varied across the country, with Mississippi having one of the highest rates at 19.7%. Poverty rates in New Mexico (19.5%) were similar, while New Hampshire had the lowest rate at 7.6%. Poverty thresholds are not adjusted for cost of living differences, leading to higher rates in areas with lower wages. Puerto Rico and 14 states saw declines in poverty rates, with Connecticut being the only state to not experience a decrease. The poverty rates in 2018 varied across the country, with Mississippi and New Mexico having high rates. Poverty thresholds, developed in the 1960s, focused on food costs. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) was created to address criticisms of the official measure. The poverty thresholds developed in the 1960s focused on food costs, with the USDA providing recommended food budgets to determine total family income. Adjustments were made for smaller households, and the official poverty measure has been used for over 50 years to calculate poverty statistics. The official poverty measure in the United States has been criticized for not accounting for benefits from major aid programs, tax credits, and in-kind benefits like SNAP or housing assistance. It also has been questioned for its method of determining poverty thresholds based on outdated food expenditure data. The official poverty measure in the United States has been criticized for not accurately reflecting current needs and available goods and services. A panel from the National Academy of Sciences recommended improvements to the poverty measure in 1995, including adjusting thresholds to reflect the costs of basic necessities and considering geographic variations in the cost of living. The National Academy of Sciences recommended adjustments to the poverty measure in 1995, including incorporating out-of-pocket medical expenses and subtracting work-related costs from income. The goal was to align the measure with the real-life needs of low-income individuals and reflect changes in the economy and society. The Census Bureau implemented the Supplemental Poverty Measure in 2011, providing a more detailed view of living arrangements and resources. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) takes into account detailed living arrangements and resources of individuals and families, providing an updated view of the circumstances of the poor. It offers policymakers a clearer understanding of how government policies impact the poor population today. The SPM was developed as a research measure and is expected to be periodically revised for improved measurement methods and data sources. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) provides a more detailed view of poverty, showing slight differences in the poverty population compared to the official measure. In 2018, the SPM was 1 percentage point higher than the official poverty rate, with more people aged 18 to 64 and 65 and over in poverty under the SPM. The poverty rate for people under age 18 was lower under the SPM, which includes in-kind benefits and subtracts work-related expenses. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) adjusts for work-related expenses and medical out-of-pocket expenses, showing variations in poverty rates by region in 2018. The SPM was slightly higher than the official measure, with differences in poverty rates for different age groups."
