    "content": "The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulates disability-related telecommunications services, including video relay service (VRS) for persons with hearing disabilities to communicate using American Sign Language (ASL) through video equipment. VRS allows users to have signed conversations with a communications assistant (CA) in real-time, incorporating facial expressions and body language. VRS offers features not available in text-based TRS, making it a popular service for the hearing impaired. VRS calls are like telephone conversations between hearing persons, allowing interruptions and natural flow. They use video links and sign language, not text, and rely on the Internet. VRS is not mandatory, free for callers, and reimbursed through the TRS Fund. VRS providers are reimbursed for costs from the TRS Fund, administered by RLSA since July 1, 2011. Providers must meet requirements like answering 80% of calls within 120 seconds, offering 24/7 service, providing a 10-digit number for 911 calls, and handling calls in the order received without preferential treatment. The VRS program is funded through the TRS Fund, which is financed by contributions from providers of interstate telecommunications services. The FCC sets VRS rates annually, with a compensation rate of $5.29 per minute for providers with 500,000 or fewer monthly minutes. The funding requirement for the 2018-2019 fund year was $1,497,699,377. The FCC has made changes to the VRS program to reduce fraud and abuse, manage funding better, and utilize technological advancements. The deaf and hard-of-hearing community is concerned about potential cuts to the fund leading to fewer qualified ASL interpreters, decreased service quality, reduced competition among providers, and challenges for users. They plan to engage with Congress on any proposed changes to the VRS program. The deaf and hard-of-hearing community will continue to engage with Congress regarding proposed changes to the VRS program. While they rely heavily on the program, the FCC aims to modernize TRS technology and prevent financial abuse. Congress should monitor the proposed changes to ensure that the concerns of the community are considered."
