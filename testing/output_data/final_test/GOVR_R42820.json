    "content": "Gambling is legal in all states except Hawaii and Utah, with online gambling regulated at the state level. Congress has historically influenced the industry through various laws, including those governing Indian gaming and sports betting. A survey found that 3% of U.S. adults gambled online in 2012, with online gambling expected to grow. Online gambling is on the rise in the U.S., with concerns from some casino operators about losing customers to online platforms. The industry has been transformed by technology, with the first online poker site launched in 1998. Currently, there are about 1,700 unregulated websites generating billions in revenue annually. Many popular sites are licensed in the EU. The online gambling market is valued at $40 billion annually, with projections to exceed $50 billion by 2018. Despite restrictions in countries like China, Japan, South Korea, and the U.S., Americans gambled $3 billion on foreign gaming websites in 2012. Federal officials have taken action against online gambling under laws like the Wire Act, making it a federal crime to conduct illegal gambling using telecommunications. In 1998, Sports Exchange founder Cohen was arrested for violating the Wire Act by accepting illegal wagers in the U.S. He was sentenced to 21 months in prison and fined $5,000. The DOJ warned against advertising gambling websites, leading to Microsoft, Google, and Yahoo paying $31.5 million in 2007 for promoting illegal gambling. In 2006, Congress passed UIGEA, prohibiting gambling businesses from accepting outlawed payments. UIGEA prohibits banks and credit card companies from processing payments to online gambling sites, but it does not ban specific types of internet gambling. States and tribes can still engage in online gambling with certain safeguards. However, older laws like the Wire Act have been used to prosecute internet gambling. In 2011, the founders of major online poker sites were indicted for disguising illegal payments to their operations. In 2011, major online poker sites were indicted for disguising illegal payments to their operations. DOJ charged overseas companies for violating UIGEA, the Wire Act, and other laws. Civil complaints against PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker were dismissed in 2012 after settlements with DOJ. Full Tilt Poker was purchased by PokerStars, but Americans cannot access the website. DOJ's view on Internet gambling shifted in 2011, stating the Wire Act applies only to sport-related gambling activities. The DOJ's opinion on Internet gambling changed in 2011, allowing states to permit online gambling excluding sports betting. Several states and tribes have utilized this memo to legalize online betting on horse races and lotteries. Nevada, Delaware, and New Jersey have authorized various forms of online gambling, ensuring players are within state borders and of legal age. UIGEA regulations have facilitated credit card payments for state lotteries and legal gaming operators. The lifting of restrictions has made it easier for state lotteries and gaming operators to accept credit card and electronic payments. Various entities in the gambling industry, including Indian tribes, state lottery commissions, and casino operators, are exploring ways to expand their involvement in remote gaming. Internet sweepstakes cafes, which generate over $10 billion annually, are facing bans in some states like Ohio, Florida, and Mississippi. Many traditional forms of gaming are being affected by these changes. The legalization of remote gambling is impacting traditional forms of gambling, with potential effects on land-based casinos. Online gambling could help casinos expand but also pose a competitive challenge. The gambling industry and casino hotels employed nearly 400,000 people nationwide in 2013, with a 2% decrease in employment from 2003 to 2013. The U.S. gambling industry saw a 2% decrease in employment between 2003 and 2013. In 2013, gambling industry employees earned an average wage of $29,679, while casino workers earned $35,832. Lotteries are the most widespread form of gambling in the U.S., regulated by state governments in 44 states and the District of Columbia. State lotteries have evolved from basic games to include scratch-off tickets, lotto games, and video lottery terminals offering casino-type games like blackjack and poker. Lotteries in the U.S., known as VLTs, offer casino-type games like blackjack and poker. States retain 30%-40% of gaming revenues. Mega Millions and Powerball, operated across state lines, allow for multi-million dollar jackpots. In 2012, Mega Millions had a record jackpot of $656 million. The U.S. does not have a national lottery, with lottery revenues estimated at $29.4 billion in FY2013, a 3% increase from the previous year. State lotteries have experimented with strategies to boost sales, including online options. Illinois, Indiana, and New Jersey have privatized their lotteries to boost sales. Georgia and Illinois sell lottery tickets online, while other states like New Jersey and Florida are considering online sales. Colorado prohibits online lottery sales, and Maryland has a moratorium until April 2015. Illinois Lottery started selling Mega Millions tickets online in 2012, with $36.9 million in sales. A mobile app allows players to buy tickets on their phones. According to the American Gaming Association (AGA), there were 464 commercial casinos and 49 racinos in the United States in 2012, with total revenues of $37.3 billion. Commercial casinos are regulated by states and employ almost 332,000 people. Many large casino companies like Caesars Entertainment and MGM Resorts are publicly traded on U.S. stock exchanges. Slot machines now account for 70% of revenue on commercial casinos' floors, with machines becoming more sophisticated and offering combined jackpots that can reach millions of dollars. Nevada has the largest number of commercial casinos, with over 260 locations grossing more than $1 million in gambling revenue in FY2013. Other major locations with commercial casinos include Atlantic City, Chicago, Detroit, Connecticut, Philadelphia, St. Louis, and South Dakota. In 2012, major casinos in Detroit, Connecticut, Philadelphia, St. Louis, and the Mississippi Gulf Coast each generated $1 billion or more in casino revenues. Casinos in Las Vegas and Atlantic City market themselves as vacation destinations with high-end amenities and big-name entertainers. Indian gaming operations by 237 federally recognized tribes generated $27.9 billion in gross gaming revenue in 2012. Since the passing of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act in 1998, Indian gaming revenues have steadily increased, with major casinos like Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods Resort Casino contributing significantly. The 20 largest Indian gambling operations make up over half of tribal gaming revenues. Some tribes are exploring online gambling opportunities, such as the Alturas Indian Rancheria tribe and the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes. The Tribal Internet Gaming Alliance includes the Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Tribe and the Bad River Band Chippewa. The Tribal Internet Gaming Alliance, formed in 2013, aims to shape federal Internet gambling policy for Native American tribes. Under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA), tribes can negotiate agreements with states to offer various forms of gambling. IGRA authorizes three classes of gaming: class I social gaming, class II bingo and card games, and class III casino games. Class II and class III casino gaming on tribal land is regulated by both federal and tribal authorities through a tribe-state compact. This compact must comply with a federal framework and be negotiated with a state that permits such gaming. The interpretation allows tribes to conduct any type of gaming permitted in the state without state limits or conditions. Controversy surrounds the concept of \"reservation shopping\" in this context. The Secretary of the Interior oversees tribe-state compacts for casino gaming. NIGC regulates class II gaming and tribal ordinances. IGRA limits tribal revenue use, allowing for education, healthcare, and development activities. Tribes, as sovereign nations, are not taxed on income from commercial activities but pay employment and wagering taxes. Some tribes share proceeds from class III gambling with states. Indian gaming industry returned $9 billion in taxes and revenue sharing in 2012. Some tribal operations struggle with debt, like the Mashantucket Pequot Nation and the Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority. Tribes are sovereign nations and not taxed on income from commercial activities. The Mohegan tribe's constitution grants exclusive jurisdiction over gaming disputes to its Gaming Disputes Court, which may pose complications for lenders. The tribe and its subsidiaries may not be eligible for federal bankruptcy protection, potentially limiting creditors' ability to seek liquidation of assets. The Gaming Disputes Court may not have powers typically associated with a federal bankruptcy court. The Gaming Disputes Court has limited jurisdiction and may not have authority over all creditors or territories where business is conducted. A dispute between Wells Fargo Bank and the Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians could impact gaming financing, with Wells Fargo suing the tribe over missed payments on a $50 million tribal bond for a casino operation in Mississippi. The U.S. District Court found the bond deal invalid in 2010 for not being reviewed by the National Indian Gaming Commission as required by IGRA. Pari-mutuel betting, legal in 43 states, involves player-banked betting with pooled bets and prizes awarded from the pool. Common examples include dog and horse racing, jai alai, and other ranked sporting events. The industry has expanded to include Internet and off-track wagering. Congress amended the definition of \"interstate off-track wager\" in 2000 to allow tracks to accept online bets from states where pari-mutuel betting is legal. Appeals and rulings on bond documents related to gaming financing are ongoing. Interstate pari-mutuel betting with remote devices is growing through advance deposit wagering (ADW) despite legal uncertainty. Consumers set up accounts with companies like Twinspires, XpressBet, or TV Games Network to place electronic bets on races using various devices. The Oregon Racing Commission licenses and audits many firms taking advanced deposit wagers. The Interstate pari-mutuel betting with remote devices is growing through advance deposit wagering (ADW). The Oregon Racing Commission reports that online wagering via its licensed companies rose to $2.5 billion in 2013, from $830 million in 2003. The Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) generally barred state governments from engaging in sports gambling, with exceptions for Nevada, Oregon, Delaware, and Montana. Currently, Nevada is the only state to permit wagers on a full complement of sporting events and leagues. Nevada allows wagers on various sporting events and leagues, with $3.5 billion wagered in 2012. Delaware initially had limited sports betting but tried to expand with a state sports lottery in 2009. However, legal challenges restricted their efforts. New Jersey also faced legal battles to authorize sports betting at casinos and racetracks. In September 2013, the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that New Jersey's sports wagering law conflicts with PASPA and should not be implemented. Two bills related to sports gambling have been introduced in the 113th Congress. The New Jersey Betting and Equal Treatment Act of 2013 (H.R. 626) would exempt New Jersey from PASPA, while the Sports Gaming Opportunity Act (H.R. 625) would create an exemption for states that establish sports gambling laws after January 1, 2013. Federal remote gambling legislation could impact different sectors of the industry. State lottery officials and commercial casinos are concerned about proposals that could give existing gambling establishments an advantage in the online poker market. If federal online gambling legislation is passed and all states opt in, H2 Gambling Capital predicts a $26 billion U.S. online gambling market five years after enactment. Interest groups and gaming companies are divided on remote gambling, with the Poker Players Alliance supporting legalized online poker and large casino operators like Caesars Entertainment and MGM urging Congress to regulate Internet gambling to avoid a patchwork of laws. The Coalition for Consumer and Online Protection urged Congress to regulate Internet gambling to avoid state regulations and different tax rates. Opposing them are groups like the Coalition to Stop Internet Gambling, while state lottery officials and gaming companies are divided on the issue. Indian tribes have mixed views on federal gaming regulations, with some seeing online gambling as a business opportunity. The American Indian Gaming Association wants conditions met in any bill to legalize interstate Internet gambling, including no taxation on tribal revenues, participation of qualified tribal operations in the online market, and protection of existing state-tribal compacts. Concerns exist about potential disadvantages for tribal operations if commercial casinos and other businesses gain early entry into the market. Federal remote gaming legislation could lead to growth in gambling revenues and employment nationally but may cause declines in certain locations depending on the details of the legislation passed by Congress. Enforcement of remote gaming laws presents logistical difficulties, including monitoring websites to prevent underage gambling and verifying gamblers' locations. Consumers may struggle to resolve disputes with online operators located in countries with weak law enforcement. Federal rules require financial firms to ensure Internet gambling businesses have legal operating authority and verify clients' age and location. The Department of Justice, State Department, and state attorneys general have concerns about fraud and money laundering in online poker. J. Britt Johnson of the FBI warned about criminals using online poker for money laundering, but also mentioned that detection methods could be implemented. The Oregon Racing Commission has addressed regulatory issues for firms offering advanced deposit wagering on horse races. Some firms faced challenges after UIGEA regulations were enforced. Several credit card issuers blocked payment to companies offering advanced deposit wagering on horse races after UIGEA regulations took effect. Oregon now requires these firms to be licensed and audited by the commission, regardless of their physical location. ADW firms must provide financial information, maintain a segregated account, pay a security fee, and demonstrate an operational presence in Oregon. The Remote Gambling Association has issued anti-money laundering guidelines for the industry. In July 2010, the Remote Gambling Association (RGA) issued anti-money laundering guidelines for the Internet casino industry, recommending third-party verification of data and validating customer documents. In August 2012, RGA published technical guidelines for online gambling, including responsibilities for credit card payments. Some states have programs funded through tax revenues for treating problem gamblers. The National Council on Problem Gambling estimates that about 1% of the population are pathological gamblers. The National Council on Problem Gambling estimates that about 1% of the population are pathological gamblers, with another 3% classified as problem gamblers. Problem gambling affects 6 to 8 million Americans, with adolescents and males at higher risk. NCPG released standards for responsible Internet gambling in 2012. Nearly 40 states offer publicly funded gambling addiction services, with varying levels of funding. NCPG endorsed legislation before Congress to include problem and pathological gambling in federal mental health programs. Opponents of legislation to expand remote gaming cite the potential for an increase in problem gambling if the ease of online gambling encourages more people to gamble. John Kindt, a Professor at the University of Illinois, warns that allowing Internet gambling could lead to a significant rise in problem gambling rates. The Committee aims to introduce Internet gambling widely, but its effects on problem gambling are still uncertain. Some experts suggest that online gambling may not necessarily lead to more gambling problems. The Iowa Department of Public Health studied the health issues related to legalizing Internet poker in Iowa. The study found that Internet poker may contribute to problem gambling, but it cannot be claimed to cause people to become problem or pathological gamblers. State gambling revenues have increased significantly from $15 billion in 2000 to $25.8 billion in 2012 due to the introduction of more casinos, racinos, and lottery products. Gambling taxes are crucial for certain states, representing an average of 2.4% of own-source general revenue raised by state governments in FY2012. In some states, gambling taxes play a significant role in revenue generation. Nevada's gaming taxes accounted for 24% of the state's general fund revenue in 2013, while Delaware's lottery contributed $235.3 million to the general fund, making it the fourth-largest revenue source. Indiana saw gaming revenue of $752 million in FY2013, representing 5% of the state's general fund revenues. Rhode Island's casino revenue ranked third in income sources, bringing in over $300 million in FY2011. Pennsylvania collected the most commercial casino tax revenue in the nation. Pennsylvania surpassed Nevada in commercial casino tax revenue, collecting $1.5 billion compared to Nevada's $869 million. Pennsylvania's higher tax rates of 55% on slot machine revenue and 16% on table games contribute to this difference. Despite a nationwide recovery in gambling revenues post-recession, market saturation is evident in some regions like the Northeast, where New Jersey saw a 6% decline in casino revenue in 2013. Some states have legalized online gambling, while others are considering legislation on Internet gambling. Nevada was the first state to regulate online gambling in 2001, focusing on online poker. Online poker games approved in Nevada are restricted to players within the state. Three casinos in Nevada offer online poker, generating around $2.5 million in revenue from February to April 2014. Analysts predict an annual revenue of $50-60 million for Nevada's online poker market. Delaware was the first state to legalize full online casino-style gambling, including poker, table games, and video lottery. Delaware was the first state to authorize full online casino-style gambling in June 2012, with revenues estimated at $3.75 million for FY2013. New Jersey followed suit in October 2013, allowing licensed casinos to offer online poker, table games, and slots. Seven of New Jersey's 12 casinos offer online gambling, generating $50.5 million in revenue from December 2013 to April 2014. California has debated legislation for Internet gambling, with Native American tribes having exclusive rights. Legal online poker in California could generate over $260 million in revenue in the first year. Pennsylvania is considering allowing Internet poker, slots, and table games. A study in May 2014 concluded that Internet gambling in Pennsylvania may have a small cannibalization effect on traditional offline casino gaming. New York's stance on online gambling is unclear. New York is considering an Internet poker-only bill, requiring operators to purchase a $10 million gaming license and taxing gross gaming revenue at 15%. The state's Gaming Commission could issue up to 10 licenses for interactive gambling. Several states expressly prohibit online gambling, while recent Congresses have debated bills to legalize or regulate interstate Internet gambling nationwide. In 2010, the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that licensing fees from the Internet Gambling Regulation Act would increase federal revenue by $283 million over 10 years. The legislation would authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to regulate Internet wagering, with operators paying fees for licensing and oversight. The federal government was also projected to collect an additional $42 billion. The Internet Gambling Regulation and Tax Enforcement Act of 2011 would have imposed a 2% license fee on online gambling operations, with states and tribes having the option to receive a 6% fee from licensees. The estimated revenue increase over 10 years was $42 billion, assuming no states opted out of the system. In the 112th Congress, draft legislation was circulated to restrict online gambling, except for poker, off-track horse race wagering, and certain state lottery sales. The draft legislation in the 112th Congress aimed to restrict online gambling, with exemptions for poker, off-track horse race wagering, and certain state lottery sales. A proposed bill in the 113th Congress, the Restoration of America's Wire Act, sought to prohibit all forms of Internet gambling in the United States, including in states where online gambling is already regulated. The bill would not make online games illegal but would prohibit using the internet to play games like poker or bingo, restoring the original interpretation of the Wire Act. Representative Peter King introduced the Internet Gambling Regulation, Enforcement, and Consumer Protection Act of 2013 (H.R. 2282) to create an Office of Internet Gambling Oversight in the Department of the Treasury. The bill would permit most forms of gambling, except sports betting, and includes an \"opt-out\" provision for states or tribes. Representative Jim McDermott sponsored a companion bill, the Internet Gambling Regulation and Tax Enforcement Act of 2013 (H.R. 3491), which would impose a 12% tax on licensed operators offering Internet wagering. The Internet Poker Freedom Act (H.R. 2666) proposed in the 113th Congress would allocate one-third of Internet wagering revenue to the federal government and two-thirds to participating states and tribes. Licensed online poker sites would be regulated by a state or tribal gambling oversight commission approved by the Office of Internet Poker Oversight. The bill aims to prevent minors from playing, stop money laundering, identify problem gamblers, and prohibits the use of credit cards for gambling. Certain established gambling businesses would have preference for licenses. Government-supported gambling has been part of America's development since the earliest days of colonization, starting with a 1612 London lottery to raise money for the Virginia Colony. Lotteries were used to finance public works projects and establish universities. By 1832, there were more than 400 lotteries in eight states, but public opinion soured due to scandals and graft. Legal lotteries were halted by the time of the Civil War, and some gambling moved west with the Gold Rush. Louisiana created a special lottery during Reconstruction to help rebuild the state. The Louisiana Lottery was created during Reconstruction to help rebuild the state and drew players from around the nation. Despite evidence of mismanagement and theft, the lottery continued for years. Congress intervened in 1876 by banning lottery advertising through mail, and in 1890 and 1895, they passed bills to further restrict the sale and transport of lottery tickets. Legal gambling in the U.S. declined by 1910, except for horse racing. However, during the Great Depression, state-sanctioned gambling made a comeback to raise money for charity and government services. Bingo games were legalized in the 1930s, and Nevada legalized casino gambling in 1931. Illegal gambling also increased, leading to a congressional investigation in 1950, which resulted in the Johnson Act in 1951, banning the transport of gambling machines. In 1951, the Johnson Act banned the transport of gambling machines in interstate commerce. From 1955 to 1960, laws were passed to combat gambling and racketeering. New Hampshire reinstated a lottery in 1964, and New Jersey allowed casinos in Atlantic City in 1976. Indian gambling began in Florida in 1979, and in 1987, the Supreme Court upheld tribes' rights to offer unregulated gambling on sovereign lands. Congress passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act in 1988, and the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act in 1992 limited states' ability to offer sports gambling. States began approving non-Indian casinos, riverboat gambling, and racinos after the success of Indian gaming. By 2012, 22 states had commercial casinos. State-licensed boat or barge casinos are permitted in six states, including Mississippi, Louisiana, and Missouri. Online lottery sales are legal in six states, online gambling is allowed in three states, and explicitly outlawed in nine states, including Louisiana, Montana, and South Dakota."
