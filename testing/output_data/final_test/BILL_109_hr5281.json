    "content": "The \"Campaign Reform Act of 2006\" is also known as the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, which includes provisions for matching funds for House candidates. The \"Campaign Reform Act of 2006\" provides matching funds for eligible House of Representatives candidates, with a maximum aggregate matching payment limit of $175,000. If an opponent receives contributions exceeding $500,000, the matching payment limit will be adjusted to match the opponent's contributions. The aggregate matching payment limit for a candidate in an election is determined by the contributions received by their opponent. If an opponent in a contested primary election receives over $50,000 in contributions, the matching payment limit increases by $75,000. In a runoff election, the limit increases by $50,000. A \"qualified contribution\" is defined as a contribution from an individual in the candidate's state that does not exceed $500 in aggregate contributions. Contributions to the candidate for the election must not exceed $500 and must be in the form of a gift of money made by a written instrument. All payments under this title will be made from the House of Representatives Election Campaign Account. \"SEC. 502. ELIGIBLE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES CANDIDATE DEFINED.\" An eligible House of Representatives candidate must meet specific criteria, including receiving $10,000 in contributions, qualifying for the election ballot, having an opponent, and adhering to a spending limit of $500,000 or the matching payment limit. If an eligible House of Representatives candidate exceeds the spending limit, they must repay the House of Representatives Election Campaign Account an amount equal to the excess spent. The candidate also agrees to cooperate with any audit by providing necessary campaign records and information to the Commission. \"House of Representatives candidates must repay excess spending to the Election Campaign Account and cooperate with audits by providing campaign records.\" The Secretary maintains a separate House of Representatives Election Campaign Account within the Presidential Election Campaign Fund.

Repayments and appropriations also contribute to this account. The Secretary maintains a separate House of Representatives Election Campaign Account within the Presidential Election Campaign Fund. This account receives deposits for eligible House of Representatives candidates after ensuring adequate funds for presidential campaign payments. Repayments and appropriations also contribute to this account. Any amount appropriated for the supplemental authorization described in paragraph (3) ensures that payments under this title during a fiscal year are adequate. All amounts in the Account remain available without fiscal year limitation. The Commission certifies payment to eligible House of Representatives candidates within 5 days of request. The Secretary promptly pays the certified amount from the Election Campaign Account. Initial payment is $10,000 and made within 48 hours of certification, subject to proportional reduction. The amendment allows for proportional reduction in payments from the Election Campaign Account if there is an insufficient balance. The Commission will withhold certification for incorrect requests and inform the candidate on how to correct it. Effective for elections after December 2006."
