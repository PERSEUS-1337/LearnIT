    "content": "Tax credits reduce tax liability dollar-for-dollar, up to the credit value. Refundable credits can exceed tax liability, with the excess refunded by the IRS. Unlawfully present aliens may claim refundable tax credits based on specific restrictions, not a general prohibition in the Internal Revenue Code. Unlawfully present aliens face restrictions on claiming tax credits, including prohibitions on nonresident aliens, requirements for Social Security numbers, and the restriction that only \"lawfully present\" aliens may claim a credit. Nonresident aliens are denied some credits, making unlawfully present nonresident aliens ineligible. Federal tax law classifies individuals as resident or nonresident aliens based on citizenship status. Resident aliens include lawful permanent residents or those present in the U.S. for a significant period, while other noncitizens are nonresident aliens. Unlawfully present aliens are categorized as either resident or nonresident aliens under these rules. Some tax credits are denied to nonresident aliens and those without valid Social Security numbers. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) currently requires valid SSNs for the taxpayer, spouse, and qualifying children to claim the credit. Nonresident aliens were also denied the American Opportunity tax credit, Making Work Pay credit, 2008 stimulus credit, and First-Time Homebuyer credit. The EITC and 2008 stimulus credits required valid SSNs for claiming, limiting access for nonresident aliens. Some resident aliens may attempt to use an SSN to claim credits, despite not being lawfully present. Congress intended to restrict these credits to taxpayers authorized to work in the US. Taxpayers can claim tax credits with an SSN or an ITIN issued by the IRS. ITINs are for those not eligible for SSNs, and having one does not affect immigration status. It is not necessary to have an SSN to claim a credit, and having an SSN or ITIN does not determine residency status. Some resident aliens have ITINs, while some nonresident aliens have SSNs. The ACA allows individuals buying health insurance through an exchange to be eligible for credits. Individuals purchasing health insurance through an exchange can receive a refundable premium assistance tax credit under the ACA. Aliens not \"lawfully present\" are ineligible for the credit, but can claim it for eligible family members. The eligibility for refundable tax credits is subject to certain regulations, including Section 401 of the PRWORA. The Reconciliation Act of 1996 bars unlawfully present aliens from receiving federal public benefits, including refundable tax credits. The definition of \"Federal public benefit\" includes various forms of assistance provided by the U.S. government. Despite potential arguments, the IRS allows unlawfully present aliens to claim refundable tax credits. The IRS allows unlawfully present aliens to claim refundable tax credits, which are not restricted under the IRC. There is uncertainty whether this position could be legally challenged in court, as no court has examined if refundable tax credits are considered federal public benefits. If the IRS does not interpret Section 401 to include refundable tax credits, it could be seen as a permissible interpretation unless Congress addresses it legislatively. The IRS allows unlawfully present aliens to claim refundable tax credits, which are not restricted under the IRC. There is uncertainty whether this position could be legally challenged in court, as no court has examined if refundable tax credits are considered federal public benefits. If the issue were to come before a court, there appears to be support for the IRS's determination that refundable credits are not federal public benefits. Congress would need to address the matter legislatively to change this interpretation. The Attorney General consults with the Secretary of Health and Human Services for verifying immigration status for federal benefits, but not with the Treasury Department, suggesting tax benefits were not affected. Congress included SSN requirements for certain tax credits, indicating PRWORA Section 401 may not apply to refundable tax credits. The terms \"grant\" or \"benefit\" are not defined, leaving room for interpretation. The terms \"grant\" and \"benefit\" are not statutorily defined, so courts may interpret them based on their ordinary meanings. Courts have previously considered \"other similar benefits\" in PRWORA to include services aiding those in economic hardship or potentially incentivizing illegal immigration. This could lead to some refundable tax credits being classified as federal public benefits. Some courts have held that the child tax credit is not considered a public assistance benefit under state law, unlike the EITC, which is refundable and grant-like to assist low-income families. The determination of whether refundable tax credits are federal public benefits under PRWORA Section 401 depends on the specific characteristics and purpose of each credit. The IRS, court, or Congress has not addressed whether refundable tax credits are federal public benefits. The only clear restrictions for aliens claiming these credits are in the IRC. Specific refundable tax credits include the Earned Income Tax Credit, Additional Child Tax Credit, American Opportunity Tax Credit, Health Coverage Tax Credit, and Making Work Pay Credit. The curr_chunk discusses various tax credits such as the Adoption Tax Credit, First-Time Homebuyer Tax Credit, and Making Work Pay Tax Credit."
