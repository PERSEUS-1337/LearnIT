They are requesting the reactivation of the Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP) to subsidize U.S. dairy exports. DEIP, reauthorized under the 2008 farm bill, allows the USDA to make cash payments to exporters who can then sell dairy products at lower prices. This program aims to develop export markets and increase the U.S. farm price of milk. The Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP) can increase the U.S. farm price of milk by removing dairy products from the domestic market. USDA is considering reactivating DEIP due to declining competitor prices and reduced demand, with a proposed funding level of $100 million in FY2009 and $25 million in 2010. The Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP) advocates argue for its reactivation to increase dairy farmer income and compete against EU dairy export subsidies. Both the EU and U.S. can subsidize dairy exports under WTO limits. This report discusses the current dairy market situation, DEIP program operations, effectiveness for addressing milk price environment, and trade policy implications. In 2007 and 2008, U.S. milk prices were high due to strong export demand and a lower-valued dollar. However, demand fell in the second half of 2008, leading to a mismatch with milk production and a 36% drop in farm prices. USDA forecasts a 2009 average annual farm price of $12.10 per cwt., down 18% from the 10-year average. Dairy producers are facing challenges due to the decline in milk prices. The decline in milk prices has been challenging for dairy producers as feed costs remain high. Federal programs have been activated to financially support dairy farmers, including the dairy product price support program and the Milk Income Loss Contract program. Payments continue due to milk prices remaining below the target. The Federal Milk Marketing Order system mandates minimum prices for milk paid to producers, regardless of market conditions. The Dairy Export Incentive Program provides cash bonuses to exporters of U.S. dairy products to counter foreign subsidies. For more information on federal dairy programs, refer to CRS reports R40205 and RL34036. The Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP) was first authorized in 1985 to assist in surplus removal of U.S. milk powder exports and reduce expenditures on supporting milk prices. Subsequent farm bill reauthorizations expanded DEIP's role to include market development. DEIP funding is provided through the Commodity Credit Corporation, and the program is operated by USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service. Authorization for DEIP has been extended through various legislation, most recently until December 31, 2012. The Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP) is funded through the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) borrowing authority, not USDA appropriations bills. Expenditures total $1.1 billion since inception, with bonuses peaking at $162 million in 1993. DEIP has moved over 1 million metric tons of dairy products, primarily nonfat dry milk. The program has not been used since FY2004 due to market strength and decreased need for export subsidies. The Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP) facilitated the export of dairy products, primarily nonfat dry milk, with annual amounts ranging from 50,000 to 100,000 tons. Private exporters, not the U.S. government, made all sales under the program. Awards were determined through a bid process and reimbursed exporters for the price difference between purchasing and selling the products in importing countries. Exporters had to provide company information and negotiate selling prices before participating in the program. The Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP) allows companies to negotiate selling prices with buyers, contingent on USDA approval of a cash bonus. Exporters submit bids to USDA for the bonus, which is granted upon evidence of shipment. USDA allocates regional market quotas for products like nonfat dry milk. DEIP's export subsidies are limited by WTO constraints on quantities and budgetary outlays. The EU has significantly higher WTO allowable export subsidies for dairy products compared to the United States. The EU can subsidize nearly 2 million metric tons of dairy products, while the US is limited to less than 93,000 metric tons. In terms of value, the EU's allowable maximum is over 2.3 billion Euros, while the US is at $116.6 million. The quantity limits represent a small percentage of US production and a larger percentage of EU production. In the year before the EU suspended dairy export subsidies, their outlays were 478.3 million Euros for approximately 1 million tons of dairy products. The EU has higher WTO allowable export subsidies for dairy products compared to the US. In the year before the EU suspended dairy export subsidies, their outlays were 478.3 million Euros for approximately 1 million tons of dairy products. The US DEIP activity in 2004 had budget outlays of $2.7 million for 68,201 metric tons of SMP and 3,030 metric tons of cheese. The EU resumed intervention buying of butter and skim milk powder in March 2009 until August 2009. Export refunds for dairy products like butter, SMP, whole milk powder, and cheese were reactivated due to market conditions and global financial crisis. Refunds will be available through a tendering process. The EU has resumed intervention buying of dairy products and reactivated export refunds through a tendering process. Exporters bid for specific volumes at specific refunds, with licenses awarded based on management committee criteria. Refunds are intended to compensate for higher buying prices and will be provided in line with EU WTO obligations. The amount of refunds will depend on offers received and committee criteria. The reactivation of DEIP could impact the U.S. milk market and dairy farm income, as well as counteract foreign subsidies and affect U.S. trade policy. DEIP exports would increase demand for dairy products, potentially raising milk prices and enhancing farm income. The maximum quantity of subsidized U.S. exports allowed under WTO limits is a small percentage of total U.S. milk production. DEIP-assisted exports account for a small share of total U.S. milk production, with limited impact on dairy farm income. Removing DEIP could reduce the farm price of milk by $0.13 per cwt. and decrease gross receipts for dairy farmers by $267 million annually. The removal of the Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP) could lead to a decline in government payments under the MILC program by $267 million annually. This would result in a decrease in the price of Class I milk by $0.16 per cwt., or about 1%. The aim of DEIP was to counter export subsidies and unfair trade practices of competing dairy exporters, such as the EU. The Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP) aimed to increase the U.S. market share in overseas markets, particularly countering EU export subsidies. A 2006 assessment found DEIP moderately effective but unable to permanently expand exports. However, DEIP successfully offset EU export subsidies for dairy products to Mexico, allowing the U.S. to dominate the market with a 90% share of nonfat dry milk imports in 2008. The United States' dominance in supplying dairy products to Mexico was influenced by factors such as proximity to dairy areas in the western U.S. and trade liberalization under NAFTA. Both the EU and the U.S. claim their dairy export subsidy programs comply with WTO rules, but the EU's decision to restart export subsidies has been criticized by major dairy exporting countries like New Zealand. Ministers and the Cairns Group expressed concerns about the EU's decision to resume dairy export subsidies, which goes against efforts to eliminate trade-distorting support measures. The Cairns Group has been advocating for the elimination of export subsidies, as agreed upon by WTO member countries in 2005. However, progress on this commitment is dependent on reaching a comprehensive agreement in the stalled WTO Doha Round negotiations. The U.S. repealed the Export Enhancement Program in support of ending agricultural export subsidies in the WTO Doha Round negotiations. If no comprehensive agreement is reached, the U.S. may restart the smaller DEIP program. Trading partners like New Zealand and the Cairns Group oppose export subsidies, especially those of the EU. Factors such as EU export subsidies, opposition from trading partners like New Zealand and the Cairns Group, and the Doha Round agreement to eliminate export subsidies could influence the U.S. decision on reactivating the DEIP program."
