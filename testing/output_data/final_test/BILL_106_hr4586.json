The Consumer Product Safety Act is amended to allow the Commission to order manufacturers, distributors, or retailers to take specific actions if their chosen action is not in the public interest. The Consumer Product Safety Act allows the Commission to order manufacturers, distributors, or retailers to take specific actions if their chosen action is not in the public interest. If the Commission determines the elected action is not in the public interest, they shall order a different action to be taken. The Commission can order manufacturers, distributors, or dealers to take specific actions if their chosen action is not in the public interest. If the Commission deems the elected action as not in the public interest, they will order a different action to be taken. The Commission can order manufacturers, distributors, or dealers to take specific actions if their chosen action is not in the public interest. If the Commission determines that both remaining actions are in the public interest, the manufacturer, distributor, or dealer must choose one of those actions. SEC. 3. CIVIL PENALTIES. Section 20(a) of the Consumer Product Safety Act is amended to set civil penalties for violations of section 19, with fines not exceeding $7,000 per violation. Each violation of specified sections constitutes a separate offense, and ongoing violations result in separate daily offenses. The amendment excludes certain violations from this provision. The penalty amount for violations of section 19 of the Consumer Product Safety Act is adjusted for inflation every 5 years. Penalties can reach up to $7,000 per violation, with ongoing violations resulting in separate daily offenses. Certain violations are excluded from this provision. The penalty amount for violations of section 19 of the Consumer Product Safety Act is adjusted for inflation every 5 years. The increase is rounded up based on the penalty amount, with specific multiples for different ranges. The Commission will publish the authorized penalty amount in the Federal Register by December 1 of every 5th calendar year. The Consumer Price Index is used for this adjustment. The Federal Hazardous Substances Act is amended to adjust civil penalties for violations, with a maximum penalty not to exceed $7,000 for each violation. A violation of subsections (a), (b), (c), (d), (f), (g), (i), (j), or (k) of section 4 constitutes a separate offense for each substance involved. Violations of section 4(e) for failure to allow or perform required acts are separate violations for each instance, with each day of violation being a separate offense. Exceptions apply for violations of subsections (a) or (c) of section 4 if the violator is not the manufacturer, importer, or distributor of the substance involved. Upon commencing an action seeking to assess a penalty for a violation of section 4, the Commission will consider the nature of the substance, the risk of injury, occurrence of injury, amount distributed, and the size of the business of the person charged. Civil penalties may be imposed based on these factors. The Commission may compromise civil penalties for violations, considering factors like business size, substance nature, injury risk, and amount distributed. The penalty amount can be deducted from any sums owed by the United States. The term 'knowingly' refers to having actual knowledge or presumed knowledge. The penalty amount authorized in paragraph (1) shall be adjusted for inflation by increasing the amount referred to in paragraph (1) by the cost-of-living adjustment for the preceding 5 years. The increase determined shall be rounded up based on specific criteria. The Commission shall prescribe and publish the authorized penalty amount for violations every 5 years based on the Consumer Price Index. The penalty amount will be adjusted for inflation by increasing it with the cost-of-living adjustment for the preceding 5 years. The authorized penalty amount for violations is adjusted every 5 years based on the Consumer Price Index for the month of June preceding the adjustment date. SEC. 4. CRIMINAL PENALTIES. Section 21 of the Consumer Product Safety Act is amended to impose fines or imprisonment for individuals or organizations knowingly violating section 19. Individual directors, officers, or agents of a corporation involved in such violations may also face penalties. Section 5(a) of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act is amended to impose criminal penalties for violations of section 4, including fines or imprisonment for individuals or organizations. Repeat offenses or willful violations may result in increased penalties, up to 3 years of imprisonment. The penalty for violations of section 4 of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act can result in imprisonment for up to 3 years or a fine under title 18, United States Code, for individuals or organizations."
