    "content": "The Small Business Prepayment Penalty Relief Act of 1993 may be cited as the title II. Sec. 201 authorizes the Administration to buy-down interest rates on debentures issued by development companies or small business investment companies. The buy-down is limited to the current year and aims to reduce the interest payment to 7.5% of the outstanding principal amount. The Administration is authorized to reduce the interest rate on debentures issued by small business investment companies to make the interest payment for the current year equal to 7.5% of the outstanding principal amount. TITLE III: The Administration is authorized to reduce the interest rate on debentures issued by small business investment companies to 7.5% of the outstanding principal amount for the current year. Sec. 301 of the Act authorizes the Administration to calculate prepayment penalties for debentures issued by small business investment companies. If sufficient funding is available, the Administration will notify issuers of debentures about prepayment options. The Administration, under section 201 of the Act, will inform issuers of debentures about prepayment options, including the penalty amount, time period for offers, and available funds. The Administration will evaluate offers based on prepayment penalty percentages, with higher percentages receiving higher priority. Offers will be approved in order of priority until all available funds for the fiscal year are utilized. The issuer of a debenture purchased by the Federal Financing Bank and guaranteed by the Small Business Administration may offer to prepay the debenture under certain conditions, including using state or personal funds for prepayment. The issuer of a debenture guaranteed by the Small Business Administration can prepay the debenture under specific conditions, with benefits passed through to the borrower. No additional fees or penalties can be imposed, except for specified fees outlined in the Investment Act. If the debenture is refinanced, the issuer may require the borrower to pay a fee based on the unpaid principal balance. The issuer of a debenture guaranteed by the Small Business Administration can prepay the debenture under specific conditions outlined in the Investment Act. Refinanced debentures are subject to various provisions, including payment of expenses and commissions, with the issuer waiving any origination fee on the new debenture. The Investment Act allows issuers of debentures guaranteed by the Small Business Administration to prepay under certain conditions. Personal funds must be used for prepayment, and no additional fees or penalties can be imposed. If new guaranteed debenture proceeds are used, the interest rate reduction period will be shortened. Sec. 304 allows small business investment companies to prepay debentures guaranteed by the Administration under certain conditions. Personal funds must be used for prepayment, and no extra fees or penalties can be imposed. Debentures refinanced under title III of the Investment Act are subject to all provisions of the Act, including payment of expenses and commissions to brokers. Title IV outlines additional provisions and regulations for debentures refinanced under title III of the Investment Act. Sec. 401 of the Act provides miscellaneous provisions including borrower and small business investment company options, with regulations to be issued by the Small Business Administration within sixty days. Any new credit or spending authority is subject to appropriations acts. Sec. 402 authorizes necessary appropriations for Act provisions, with funds not to be obligated unless full assistance amount is provided. Sec. 403 defines key terms in the Act, including the Small Business Administration and the Small Business Investment Act of 1958. The Administration is required to provide full assistance authorized under title II, and if funds are insufficient, interest rates may be adjusted accordingly. No funds can be used for title III."
