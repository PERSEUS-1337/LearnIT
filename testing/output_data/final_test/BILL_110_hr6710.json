    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Oil for Iraq Liberation Act of 2008\". Congress finds that Middle Eastern countries with significant petroleum resources have historically nationalized those assets. There are concerns that US interests may undermine the nationalized Iraqi oil sector, as the Bush Administration has pushed for privatization. President George W. Bush set benchmarks for success in Iraq, including the passage of a \"hydrocarbon act\". The Hunt Oil Company, based in Dallas, Texas, has signed a production sharing agreement for oil exploration in Iraq, facilitated by its CEO's close ties to President Bush. This deal is now under investigation by the Department of State. Investigation by the Department of State reveals former Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard Perle pursued oil-drilling contracts with Iraq's Kurdistan Regional Government. Perle, a key advisor during the Iraq war, resigned amid controversy over potential profit from the war. The Department of State led a team to assist Iraq Oil Ministry in negotiations. Advisers helped Iraq Oil Ministry negotiate service contracts for oil production, seen as a way for US oil interests to gain future access. The Hunt Oil deal and actions by Richard Perle contradict US policy of revenue sharing. Some believe the \"hydrocarbon act\" is a privatization scheme to give control of Iraq's oil to foreign companies. PROHIBITIONS ON CERTAIN ACTIVITIES RELATING TO THE PETROLEUM RESOURCES OF IRAQ. Prohibitions on entry, performance, or approval by a United States person of contracts related to the development of petroleum resources in Iraq. The Act prohibits United States persons from entering into contracts for financing the development of petroleum resources in Iraq, providing guaranties for such contracts, investing in Iraqi petroleum resources, or engaging in transactions that evade the prohibitions.
