    "content": "The federal government has historically managed and tested for foreign animal diseases like mad cow disease, with states and veterinarians playing a role under federal oversight. After the first confirmed case of mad cow disease in the US, the USDA implemented an enhanced surveillance program in 2004 to test more cattle, including older animals at slaughter, using rapid test kits to detect abnormal proteins in brain tissue. The USDA implemented a new testing program to quickly detect abnormal BSE-related proteins in brain tissue, identifying infected cows in Texas and Alabama. Despite this, some countries like Japan found the testing inadequate and demanded all US cattle be tested before allowing beef imports. Japan initially banned US beef after a BSE case in 2003 but later allowed limited imports under an interim trade program. In 2004, Japan allowed some U.S. beef imports under an interim trade program. U.S. imports were halted in 2006 due to prohibited materials found in veal shipments. U.S. beef imports resumed in 2006, accounting for 25-30% of Japanese beef consumption. Creekstone Farms sought USDA approval for BSE rapid testing but was rejected in 2004. The USDA rejected Creekstone's request for BSE rapid testing, citing concerns about consumer safety implications and maintaining confidence in U.S. cattle and beef products. Creekstone filed a lawsuit against the USDA in 2006 seeking permission to use the rapid test kits for routine screening of BSE-infected cattle. The USDA rejected Creekstone's request for BSE rapid testing, leading to a lawsuit. The USDA argued the case was moot due to Japan reopening its markets to U.S. beef. The legal dispute revolves around the USDA's refusal to allow Creekstone to test all its cattle for BSE. The analysis examines the USDA's authority to regulate private testing and the arguments in the lawsuit. The USDA cites the Viruses, Serums, Toxins, Antitoxins, and Analogous Products Act (VSTA) as the source of authority for regulating animal testing and licensing rapid test kits. The VSTA was enacted in 1913 to prevent the introduction of dangerous and worthless products for treating domestic animals. The USDA cites the Viruses, Serums, Toxins, Antitoxins, and Analogous Products Act (VSTA) as the source of authority for regulating animal testing and licensing rapid test kits. The VSTA was enacted in 1913 to prevent interstate shipment of dangerous and worthless products for treating domestic animals. Congress later amended the VSTA in the Food Security Act of 1985 to enhance regulation of biological products and prevent burdens on commerce. The Viruses, Serums, Toxins, Antitoxins, and Analogous Products Act (VSTA) prohibits the preparation and sale of harmful biological products for domestic animals in the U.S. Compliance with USDA regulations and licensing is required for establishments handling these products. The VSTA also regulates the importation of such products. The VSTA prohibits the importation of harmful biological products without a permit from the Secretary of Agriculture. USDA regulations govern the licensing of these products for use in animal treatment. Biological products act primarily through the direct stimulation, supplementation, enhancement, or modulation of the immune system or immune response. They include vaccines, bacterins, allergens, antibodies, and diagnostic components. \"Treatment\" refers to the prevention, diagnosis, management, or cure of animal diseases. \"Prepare\" or \"preparation\" involves the manufacture or production of biological products. The regulations require a valid U.S. Veterinary Biologics Establishment License and at least one valid U.S. Veterinary Biological Product License for those preparing biological products subject to the VSTA. A USDA permit is needed for importing biological products. The USDA's rejection of Creekstone's request to test all cattle for BSE with rapid test kits has sparked controversy over the validity of the agency's decision. The USDA's decision to reject Creekstone's request to test all animals for BSE with rapid test kits is being questioned for its validity. APHIS's regulatory authority over rapid test kits and private companies conducting voluntary tests for BSE is also under scrutiny. The USDA has licensed multiple companies' rapid test kits for BSE testing. The USDA has licensed multiple companies' rapid test kits for BSE testing, including Bio-Rad's ELISA kit. The USDA argues that these kits may be regulated as diagnostic tests intended for disease diagnosis in cattle. The USDA regulates rapid test kits for BSE to ensure they are safe and effective for animal treatment. Creekstone argues that these kits are not subject to USDA regulation as they are not used in the treatment of live animals. The court will likely have to determine the USDA's authority over these test kits. The court will likely examine the scientific mechanisms of rapid test kits in relation to regulations. The USDA has only licensed kits for \"surveillance\" purposes, limiting private entities' access. Creekstone's proposal to test 100% of its cattle for BSE for \"marketing\" purposes is at the center of the debate. The USDA denied Creekstone's request to use rapid test kits for BSE testing, citing lack of scientific justification. The authority of APHIS to regulate the use of biological products is less defined than its authority over preparation. The validity of agency actions is determined by Congress's granted authority, as established in Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council. The court will defer to agency interpretation of a statute if congressional intent is unclear. As long as the agency stays within Congress's delegation of authority, its policy choices are entitled to deference. APHIS's authority under the VSTA is broad, allowing the USDA to make rules and regulations. The VSTA grants authority to the USDA to regulate biological products for animal treatment, including issuing licenses for establishments. Congress delegated broad authority to APHIS for creating a regulatory scheme. The VSTA does not specify who can use biological products or the extent of license restrictions. The USDA regulates the use and distribution of biological products through a comprehensive regulatory scheme under the VSTA. Restrictions on product use can be imposed by the Administrator for the protection of domestic animals or public health. Notice No. 04-08 issued by APHIS's Veterinary Services placed restrictions on Veterinary Biological Product Licenses. The USDA imposed restrictions on the use and distribution of veterinary diagnostic test kits for BSE under the VSTA. These kits can only be used by approved laboratories and must be supervised by APHIS's Veterinary Services. Arguments for and against the restrictions are discussed, with the USDA citing authority from the VSTA to ensure the safety and accuracy of the test kits. The VSTA grants APHIS broad authority to regulate biological products, including issuing licenses and implementing restrictions on sale, exchange, and shipment. APHIS has placed a sale restriction on veterinary diagnostic test kits, controlling their use and distribution. This aligns with their authority to issue regulations and licenses for biological products. The USDA restricts the sale and use of BSE rapid test kits to approved laboratories for surveillance purposes only. Using these kits for other reasons may yield results outside accepted parameters. APHIS oversees test kit performance to ensure accurate results for their intended purpose. The USDA restricts BSE rapid test kits to approved labs for surveillance. Private testing could impact compliance with federal standards. Courts have found APHIS regulations preempt state laws on biological product safety. APHIS's oversight in the field of animal biologics is broad, with regulations preempting state common law tort claims. The restriction on the \"use\" and \"distribution\" of rapid test kits aligns with APHIS's mission to ensure the safety and efficacy of biologics for animal treatment. Rapid test kits may be effective for large-scale surveillance but may not be reliable for certifying individual animals as BSE-free due to potential false results. The USDA aims to maintain market confidence by restricting the use and distribution of rapid test kits for BSE in animals. APHIS emphasizes the importance of testing for diseases like Chronic Wasting Disease to uphold the credibility of the U.S. animal health system. Creekstone's lawsuit highlights the focus on manufacturing rather than the intended use of biological products under the VSTA regulations. The VSTA regulations only authorize the licensing of establishments that manufacture biological products, not the products themselves. APHIS's regulatory control through one subpart of the licensing regulation may be questioned compared to FDA's comprehensive oversight of human drugs and biological products. FDA collaborates with other agencies to oversee the actual use of tests in laboratories. The FDA collaborates with other agencies like the CDC to oversee the use of tests in laboratories. There may be doubt regarding the USDA's authority to regulate the use of biological products under \u00a7102.5(d) compared to the CLIA framework. The VSTA regulations are intended to regulate the manufacture of biological products to prevent the sale of contaminated or harmful products. The USDA's authority to regulate the use of properly made biological products is being challenged by Creekstone in a lawsuit. Dr. A. M. Farrington emphasized the need to supervise the manufacture of hog cholera serums to ensure quality and protect farmers from improperly made products. The regulations emphasize the need for establishments to have proper licenses to prepare biological products, including serums, toxins, and viruses. This requirement limits the USDA's authority over private companies using rapid test kits. The definition of \"prepare\" includes manufacturing, testing, packaging, labeling, and storing of biological products. Private companies may argue against the regulations imposed on biological product licenses. The USDA has broad regulatory authority over the preparation, manufacture, and sale of biological products, including rapid test kits. Private companies may argue against the regulations on biological product licenses, as it may be difficult to demonstrate that they are actually \"preparing\" a biological product as defined by the regulations. The USDA has regulatory authority over the use and distribution of rapid test kits. The VSTA may be ambiguous, but APHIS could argue that their restrictions are within Congress's authority. However, there may be a lack of legal framework to support these restrictions. Creekstone filed a lawsuit against the USDA questioning its authority to regulate rapid test kits, issue regulations affecting their distribution and use, and deny Creekstone the use of USDA-approved BSE rapid test kits. Creekstone seeks an injunction against USDA's prohibition on acquiring or using these kits. The lawsuit filed by Creekstone challenges the USDA's authority to regulate rapid test kits for BSE screening. If the court deems USDA's regulation incompatible with the VSTA, Creekstone may receive relief. The court may also review if APHIS has the authority to regulate the use of rapid test kits and if its actions were reasonable under the \"arbitrary and capricious review\" standard. The court may review if APHIS's decision to deny Creekstone a license for BSE testing was arbitrary and capricious, based on factors like congressional intent and evidence presented. Creekstone's lawsuit challenges USDA's authority to regulate BSE test kits. Creekstone was denied a license for BSE testing by APHIS, which may be difficult to overcome due to deference to agency regulations. APHIS is concerned about consumer safety and has found no scientific justification for 100% testing based on expert findings. APHIS has concerns about the reliability of BSE testing for food safety, citing potential negative impacts on the economy and international trade. They argue that testing for Chronic Wasting Disease should be done exclusively by federal and state regulatory agency laboratories to maintain international credibility. The credibility of the U.S. animal health system relies on government labs, with arguments about APHIS's role in ensuring a safe food supply. However, claims of USDA authority and the impact of rapid tests may not align with the VSTA's intent to protect farmers and livestock. APHIS questions the meaningfulness of testing bovines for BSE at slaughter. The USDA does not consider testing bovines at slaughter for BSE to be meaningful for human or animal health. The lack of an animal health element in APHIS's reasoning for rejecting the Creekstone permit raises questions about the validity of the VSTA. The USDA now argues that its policy against private testing promotes animal health, but evidence suggests otherwise. Despite APHIS's argument that testing all animals is not scientifically justified, the USDA has tested over 2,000 cattle under 30 months old for BSE in the past. Creekstone believes testing younger animals could provide a negotiating advantage with foreign markets. Creekstone may argue that testing younger animals could provide a negotiating advantage with foreign markets like Japan by disproving the theory that testing all animals is necessary. They may also demonstrate that their BSE test program enhances surveillance without implying consumer safety. Additionally, they could point out that USDA certifies food items for quality assurance that may not necessarily relate to food safety. The lack of precedent and inconsistent statements from the USDA may make it challenging for them to support their claims in the Creekstone lawsuit. However, courts typically defer to agency decisions supported by evidence, so if APHIS can justify keeping BSE testing within federal and state laboratories, a court may uphold their decision."
