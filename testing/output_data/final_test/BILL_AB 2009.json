    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature aims to increase enrollment and graduation rates for students eligible under Assembly Bill 540 by designating Dream Resource Liaisons and promoting Dream Resource Centers at public higher education institutions. Approximately 65,000 undocumented students graduate from high schools each year, but only 20 percent attend college. Many are unaware of laws like Assembly Bill 540, the California Dream Act, and DACA that make college more accessible. Most college campuses lack centralized support services for students eligible under Assembly Bill 540. The creation of Dream Resource Centers would streamline financial aid and academic opportunities for students eligible under Assembly Bill 540, aiming to empower and support them in a safe environment. These centers are expected to boost enrollment, transfer, and graduation rates among this student population. Several college campuses have established Dream Resource Centers to support undocumented students, offering workshops, legal clinics, and peer mentoring to increase awareness of available resources and enhance professional development. These centers aim to empower students eligible under Assembly Bill 540 in a safe environment, with the goal of improving enrollment, transfer, and graduation rates among this population. Starting in the 2017-18 academic year, California Community Colleges and California State University are required to designate a Dream Resource Liaison on each campus to assist students eligible under Section 68130.5 with accessing financial aid and academic opportunities. The University of California is also encouraged to designate liaisons. Each campus of California Community Colleges and California State University must have a designated Dream Resource Liaison knowledgeable in financial aid and academic opportunities for students meeting Section 68130.5 requirements, including undocumented students. Liaisons should be placed in the campus' extended opportunity programs, services, or financial aid offices. The University of California, California Community Colleges, and California State University are encouraged to designate Dream Resource Liaisons and establish Dream Resource Centers on their campuses. These centers may offer various support services for students meeting specific requirements, including undocumented students. The section allows Dream Resource Centers to be housed within existing student service or academic centers, and the space where the Dream Resource Liaison is located can be considered a Dream Resource Center. The Trustees of the California State University, the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, and the Regents of the University of California are permitted to seek and accept gifts to aid in the creation and operation of Dream Resource Centers. The section will be inoperative on July 1, 2022, and repealed on January 1, 2023, unless a later statute extends these dates. If the Commission on State Mandates finds this act imposes state-mandated costs, reimbursement will be made to local agencies and school districts."
