The National Trails System Act is amended to include the revision of feasibility and suitability studies for existing national historic trails, considering possible additions to the trails. The revision includes definitions for terms like \"route\" and \"shared route.\" The National Trails System Act is amended to include a study requirement for the Oregon National Historic Trail routes, to be completed and submitted to Congress within three fiscal years. The National Trails System Act is amended to include a study of various routes of the Oregon Trail from 1830-1870 to determine their feasibility as components of the Oregon National Historic Trail.
