The Congress finds that the People's Liberation Army of China is responsible for repression, occupying Tibet, massacring protesters in Tiananmen Square, and running labor camps. They are also engaged in a significant military buildup and ballistic missile modernization program that could threaten peace in East Asia. The People's Liberation Army of China is engaged in a significant military buildup, including intercontinental missile programs, submarine-launched missiles, long-range cruise missiles, and upgrading of ballistic missiles. They are also working with Russia to coproduce the SU-27 fighter and purchasing weapons systems like the Kilo-class submarine and Sunburn missile system. Additionally, they have carried out acts of aggression in the South China Sea, including the seizure of the Mischief Reef in the Spratley Islands. In July 1995 and March 1996, the People's Liberation Army conducted missile tests to intimidate Taiwan during historic free elections, effectively blockading Taiwan's ports. They have also contributed to the proliferation of technologies for refining weapons-grade nuclear material and provided ballistic missile components, cruise missiles, and chemical weapons ingredients to Iran. In May 1996, US authorities caught the People's Liberation Army enterprise Poly Technologies. The People's Liberation Army enterprise Poly Technologies and Norinco attempted to smuggle 2,000 AK-47s into Oakland, California, and offered shoulder-held missile launchers to urban gangs. Communist Chinese authorities only punished 4 low-level arms merchants for this. The People's Liberation Army also contributes to China's failure to meet intellectual property rights standards by pirating videos, CDs, and computer software in their factories. The People's Liberation Army of China engages in commercial activities that subsidize its expansion and operations, often for military or foreign policy purposes. These activities include transshipment of textile products to the United States through third countries, contributing to China's failure to meet standards set in a 1997 agreement with the United States. The International Emergency Economic Powers Act authorities will be applied to Chinese military companies. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with other key officials, will compile and publish a list of Communist Chinese military companies operating in the US or its territories within 90 days of the enactment of the Act. Updates to the list will be made regularly based on the latest information. The term \"Communist Chinese military company\" refers to a person engaged in commercial services owned or controlled by the People's Liberation Army, including those identified in specific US Defense Intelligence Agency publications for the purposes of the Act. The President has the authority to enforce the International Emergency Economic Powers Act with respect to commercial activities in the US by Communist Chinese military companies. Penalties for violations of this authority are outlined in the Act. The term \"People's Liberation Army\" in this Act refers to the military services, police, and intelligence services of the Communist Government of China, including its members. Passed by the House of Representatives on November 7, 1997."
