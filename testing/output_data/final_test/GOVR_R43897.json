Recent congressional activity shows increased interest in U.S. income distribution, with a focus on various measures and indicators. This report provides descriptive analysis of the U.S. income distribution to illustrate trends. The report provides an overview of income distribution in the United States, focusing on measurement complexities, data sources, and statistical analysis. It also explains the Gini index and includes information from the U.S. Census Bureau on income dispersion indicators. Measuring income involves choices in defining and organizing income data, such as narrow or broad definitions, pre-tax or post-tax status, and individual or household levels. These choices impact how the income distribution is portrayed, but typically do not drastically change household rankings. When analyzing income distribution, the inclusion of government transfers and types of taxes can impact how households are categorized. Disagreements often arise due to differing definitions of income, which can range from simple earnings to more comprehensive measures. The level of income analysis, whether at the individual, household, or family level, also affects how income is characterized. The Census Bureau offers various income formulations to data users, including money income, market income, post-social insurance income, and disposable income. Different definitions of income can be preferred based on the analysis being conducted, such as assessing trends or households' ability to meet basic needs. This flexibility in defining income allows for a more comprehensive understanding of income distribution and outcomes. The Census Bureau provides different income measures, including money income, market income, and disposable income. These measures vary in their inclusivity of income components, with money income being the broadest and disposable income being the most comprehensive. The curr_chunk discusses the components included in the income formulation, such as EITC, SNAP, school lunches, housing subsidies, and tax deductions. It emphasizes the importance of how these components are treated in income distribution analysis for different income groups. The curr_chunk discusses how income components are treated differently by low-, middle-, and high-income individuals and households, impacting income distribution and shares. One key difference is the exclusion of capital gains in Census money income statistics, limiting the accuracy of income levels and trends, especially for higher-income households. The curr_chunk highlights how capital gains are more visible among high-income households due to IRS reporting methods. There is debate over the one-time valuation of capital gains income, with some arguing for continuous accounting while others believe it is a theoretical exercise. The treatment of taxes in income distribution analysis considers post-tax disposable income, impacting consumption availability. Tax payments and credits vary among income groups, with low-income individuals potentially benefiting from tax credits like the EITC. Government-supported health insurance, such as Medicare and Medicaid, is a significant aspect of income not accounted for in traditional income definitions. Excluding this component may underestimate the resources available to low-income individuals, as these benefits are often received more by them. This omission can provide a misleading picture of the income distribution, with post-tax income formulations likely to benefit low-earners and reduce incomes for high-earners compared to pre-tax income definitions. When applying different income definitions to Census data in 2007, it was found that the percentage of households with no income varied. The most restrictive measure showed 4.0% of households with zero income, which decreased to 1.2% with the money income definition. The disposable income definition, considering government benefits and taxes, resulted in the fewest no-income households. The addition of income dimensions to different income definitions in 2007 affected the distribution of household incomes. Moving from market income to disposable income reduced the number of households with no income at the bottom of the distribution but increased it at the top. The percentage of households with high incomes decreased with broader income definitions. Individual or pooled income can be presented at various levels. The Census Bureau defines family and household as distinct concepts for statistical purposes. A family consists of two or more people with a direct familial relationship, while a household includes one or more people living together, whether related or not. Tax units, an IRS concept, represent individuals or groups filing a tax return. Income distribution varies based on whether it is organized at the individual or household level. Income analysis can be organized at the individual or household level. Individuals have lower average income levels than households due to multiple earners in the latter. Analyzing income at the individual level reveals more low-income persons, like college students with summer jobs. Comparability issues arise when comparing income data organized at multi-member levels, as the number of members can vary significantly across households, families, and tax units. The quality of income distribution analysis relies on the data source used, with government sources like Census Bureau and IRS providing the most reliable data. Adjustments are made to account for differences in resource sharing among different household compositions. Census and IRS data offer official statistics on U.S. income distribution annually, with some public access to individual records. The U.S. Census Bureau collects income data annually from a random sample of households through the Current Population Survey (CPS) Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC), measuring income from the previous year. Census reports on money income, including pre-tax cash income and public cash transfers, publishing official income statistics in the Income and Poverty in the United States report. The U.S. Census Bureau collects income data annually from a random sample of households through the Current Population Survey (CPS) Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC), measuring income from the previous year. Census reports on money income, including pre-tax cash income and public cash transfers like Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). However, Census income estimates may not accurately characterize households at the top of the distribution due to the sensitivity of sample composition in estimating incomes spread farther apart. The U.S. Census Bureau limits reported incomes in the CPS-ASEC data to $9,999,999 due to data recording restrictions. Census edits income data to minimize errors, with an internal processing limit of $999,999 for each income source. The Census Bureau faces challenges in accurately capturing interest and dividend income, especially for high-income households. Methodological changes in the CPS-ASEC survey affect income estimate comparability over time. IRS data, based on tax returns, are considered superior for analyzing the top income distribution. IRS data, based on tax returns, provide a better view of incomes at the top but have less coverage among low-income individuals and households. Certain types of government assistance received by lower-income households are not reported on federal tax returns, leading to potential undercounting of income for this group. Changes to the federal tax code can impact how income is reported and taxed, influencing household behavior and earnings. IRS data may not accurately capture incomes of lower-income filers, who may be untaxed and unreported. Analyses in this report use U.S. Census Bureau statistics on household income. The Census Bureau report on Income and Poverty in the United States defines money income at the household level, excluding capital gains and in-kind income. Data for 2013 is used, with comparisons made from 1993-2013 in 2013 dollars. Adjustments are made using the Consumer Price Index Research Series. The mean and median are key measures used to describe household income distribution, calculated using the Consumer Price Index Research Series. Mean income is the average income per household if total income were distributed equally, providing insight into the typical household's experience. The median is a better indicator of typical household income compared to the mean. It divides the population into two equal-sized groups based on income levels. For example, the median household income in the United States was $51,939 in 2013, with 50% of households earning above this amount and 50% earning below. The mean household income can be skewed by extreme values, such as lottery winnings, while the median provides a more accurate representation of typical household income. In the example given, despite a significant increase in mean income due to a lottery win, the median income remains unchanged at $52,000. This highlights the importance of considering both the mean and median when analyzing household income distribution. The range, the simplest measure of dispersion, in household income is the difference between the richest and poorest households. Data collection challenges make calculating the range difficult, with no official data available on the highest and lowest incomes in the US. The shape of income distribution can be symmetric, right-skewed, or left-skewed, indicating how households cluster along the income spectrum. When the distribution of household income is right-skewed, there is a cluster of households with lower incomes and a tail to the right, pulling up the mean above the median. In contrast, left-skewed distributions have a concentration of high-income households with a tail to the left, causing the mean to be lower than the median. The distribution of U.S. household income in 2013 is right-skewed, with lower-income households forming its tail. The median household income was $51,939, while the average was $72,641. Census data lacks detail on high-income households. In 2013, U.S. household income distribution is right-skewed, with lower-income households forming the tail. Income is grouped in bins with a $5,000 range up to $199,999, then changes at $200,000. Analysis can inform discussions on program participation, resource access, trends in household experiences, and social mobility. Recent conversations compare income groups using quantiles for cross-group analysis. Quantiles are a useful tool for cross-group income analysis, dividing households into equal size groups based on income. Quartiles divide the population into quarters, quintiles into fifths, and deciles and percentiles into tenths and hundredths. Quantiles do not necessarily create equally spaced income brackets, especially where households are clustered together. The Census Bureau publishes various quantile-based measures of income dispersion each year, including household income at selected percentile limits, income ratios, mean income by quintile, and share of total household income held by quintiles. For example, the 50th percentile limit represents the median income level, while the 90th percentile limit indicates that the bottom 90% of households earned less than $150,000 in 2013. In 2013, 60% of households had incomes between $20,900 and $105,910. The income ratio in 2013 was 12.10, indicating that the 90th percentile household earned over 12 times more than the 10th percentile household. Census reports quintile mean income as the average income within a quintile. The quintile mean income is the average income within a quintile, rising throughout the distribution. The quintile share of total income shows the percentage of income held by each quintile, with the bottom 20% receiving 3.2%, the middle 60% receiving 45.8%, and the top 20% receiving 51% in 2013. The section discusses the importance of using a common data source for income comparisons over time to avoid misinterpretation. It emphasizes the need to note any differences in data sources, definitions, and methodologies. Simple indicators like median income can help describe the typical household's experience over time. Between 1993 and 2013, median household income increased from $49,594 to $51,939, with fluctuations during economic recessions in 2001 and 2007-2009. The mean-to-median ratio can indicate the distribution shape, with symmetrical distributions having a ratio of one and right-skewed distributions showing the mean exceeding the median. The mean-to-median ratio, greater than one, indicates a right-skewed distribution of income from 1993 to 2013. The ratio increased from 1.33 to 1.40, showing a rise in average income surpassing growth in median income. This suggests an increasingly right-skewed distribution over time. Quantile trend analysis reveals changing patterns in U.S. household income distribution from 1993 to 2013. Mean income among the top quintile consistently exceeds the other four quintiles, with the top quintile's income at least twice as large as the fourth quintile. Income growth is highest in the top quintile and decreases moving down the quintiles. Income growth stalls or declines during recessions. Figure 7 displays income ratios between different percentiles over the same period, providing insight into relative income experiences. Between 1993 and 2013, income ratios increased, indicating a growing gap between income groups. The 90-10 ratio saw the most significant change, rising from 10.6 to 12.1. The question arises whether this increase reflects a widening gap between bottom and middle households or high-income growth at the very top. Between 1993 and 2013, income ratios increased, showing a growing gap between income groups. Figure 8 illustrates the cumulative percentage change since 1993, with the 90-10 ratio rising significantly. The 90-50 ratio closely tracked the 90-10 ratio's growth, while the 50-10 ratio showed minimal growth. Figure 9 compares income shares across 1993, 2003, and 2013, revealing a concentration of income at the top of the distribution over the past 20 years. The top 20% consistently held a disproportionate share of income. The share of income among the top 20% increased from 48.9% in 1993 to 51% in 2013. The lower quintiles saw a decrease in their income shares. Figure 10 shows a shift in income shares since 1993, with a notable change around 2000. The top quintile saw a steady increase in income share, while the bottom three quintiles experienced a decline. The data points in Figure 10 represent cumulative change since 1993, not year-by-year changes. Figure 9 and Figure 10 visually present the same information differently, with the decline in income share among lower quintiles appearing more pronounced in Figure 10 due to percentage change sensitivity to base values. For example, a small absolute change in percentage points for the lowest quintile in 1993 (3.6%) results in a large percentage change. The fall in income share for the lowest quintile between 1993 and 2013 is shown as a 0.4 percentage point decrease. Comparing income statistics across U.S. states reveals economic and distributional variation. State median income in 2013 shows geo-economic patterns, with southern states having lower median incomes compared to states on the northeast coast. Price levels also fluctuate across states, affecting purchasing power comparisons. Adjusting time series income data for inflation is standard practice to account for changes in prices over time. Prices can vary significantly across geographical divisions, with the District of Columbia having price levels more than 18% higher than the national average in 2012, while Mississippi had prices nearly 14% below the national average. The Gini index is used to measure income dispersion and assess changes in income distribution within a population. The Lorenz curve is a tool used to analyze changes in income distribution over time and across different groups. It plots the cumulative percentage of the population by income against the cumulative percentage of total income. The curve shows how income is distributed, with a straight line representing equal distribution and the curved line showing the actual distribution. The Lorenz curve illustrates income distribution, with a curved line showing uneven distribution. The Gini coefficient measures inequality by comparing the area between the Lorenz curve and the equidistribution line. Perfect equality is when the two curves overlap, resulting in a Gini index of zero. In the scenario of perfect inequality, one household holds all income, leading to a Gini index of 100%. The Gini index ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating perfect equality and 1 indicating perfect inequality. It is used to compare income distribution over time or between different groups. However, the index does not show the shape of the income distribution and different shapes can result in the same Gini value. The Gini index ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating perfect equality and 1 indicating perfect inequality. It is not well-suited for comparing income dispersion within and between groups. The Gini index for the United States ranged from 0.450 to 0.477 between 1993 and 2013, showing an upward trend. IRS data is superior for studying incomes at the top, but privacy rules limit the information that can be shared publicly. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) combines CPS and IRS data to analyze income distribution, focusing on the top 20% of households. In 2011, the top 20% received an average after-tax income of $188,200, with the top 1% averaging $1,031,900. CBO's data show a wide range of incomes at the top of the spectrum. The top 1% of earners have incomes far below the highest earners, with the average adjusted-gross income of the top 400 filers in 2009 being $202 million. The U.S. Census Bureau reports summary indicators of income dispersion, such as the Gini index, mean log deviation of income (MLD), Theil index, and Atkinson index, which characterize overall income distribution. The MLD, Theil, and Atkinson indices are relative inequality measures based on ratios of incomes to the mean. They provide valuable insights into income distribution analysis, with the MLD and Theil index being popular generalized entropy measures. These indices are defined by sensitivity parameters and offer a different perspective compared to the Gini index. The MLD and Theil index are relative inequality measures that rise as income dispersion increases. They are scale invariant and respond intuitively to income transfers within a distribution. They are also perfectly decomposable by subgroups. The MLD and Theil index are relative inequality measures that respond differently to changes in income distribution. MLD is sensitive to changes at the bottom of the distribution, while Theil index rises faster with disproportionate growth at the top. The Atkinson Index is a welfare-based measure using a specific function to quantify social welfare. The Atkinson Index quantifies social welfare by comparing a given income distribution to perfect equality. It ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating perfect equality. For example, an index of 0.10 means a society would be content with 90% of total income distributed equally among all members. The Atkinson index measures social welfare by comparing income distribution to perfect equality. It is parameterized with the inequality aversion parameter epsilon, which prioritizes lower-income households. The index is scale invariant and registers more inequality as income shifts from the bottom to the top of the distribution. The Atkinson index measures social welfare by comparing income distribution to perfect equality, prioritizing lower-income households. It registers more inequality as income shifts from the bottom to the top of the distribution, unlike the MLD and Theil index."
