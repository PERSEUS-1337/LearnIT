    "content": "The bilateral economic relationship between the United States and European Union (EU) is characterized by a high level of commercial interaction, including significant trade and investment ties. However, there are also growing trade conflicts that could have negative political and economic consequences, potentially weakening shared interests and the credibility of the World Trade Organization. The US and EU have the largest two-way trade and investment relationship globally. The United States and European Union have a significant trade and investment relationship, with annual two-way flows exceeding $1.3 trillion in 2005. The EU is the second largest trading partner of the US, accounting for a large portion of US exports and imports. However, the US has been importing more goods from the EU than exporting since 1993, resulting in a trade deficit of $122 billion in 2005. The EU market, with a population of 457 million and a GDP of $13.4 trillion, is the largest in the world. The trade deficit with the US is offset by surpluses in services trade. The total stock of two-way direct investment between the EU and the US reached $1.9 trillion by the end of 2004. The EU and US have a total stock of two-way direct investment of $1.9 trillion, with U.S. and European companies being the largest investors in each other's markets. This investment leads to billions of dollars in sales, production, and research and development expenditures, as well as millions of jobs on both sides. Foreign direct investment also boosts international trade flows. The trade and employment linkages between the EU and US, driven by foreign direct investment, account for one-third of U.S. total trade with the EU. Strong interest groups lobby for friendly bilateral ties and oppose protectionist measures. The EU and US are key players in the world trading system, accounting for a significant portion of world merchandise trade and production. Cooperation between them has been crucial in efforts to liberalize world trade through organizations like GATT and WTO. Trade tensions and disputes have existed between the US and EU despite their cooperative relationship through organizations like GATT and WTO. Bilateral trade disputes have been ongoing, but historically managed without excessive political conflict. Policymakers emphasize that these disputes only affect a small fraction of overall trade. Currently, Washington and Brussels are still in disagreement over various issues. Despite their cooperative relationship through organizations like GATT and WTO, trade tensions and disputes have persisted between the US and EU. Washington and Brussels remain at odds over issues such as bio-engineered food products, aircraft, and agriculture in the Doha Round of trade negotiations. Efforts at dispute resolution have often led to escalation and retaliation, with policymakers on both sides sometimes prioritizing retaliation over compromise. Congress has played a significant role in these trade disputes, supporting US agricultural and industrial interests in gaining access to EU markets and pressuring the executive branch to take a tougher stance against the EU. The value of trade being disputed is increasing, adding complexity to the situation. The report examines trade conflicts between Brussels and Washington, questioning the difficulty of resolving disputes, the impact on business confidence and economic policy coordination, and the credibility of the WTO dispute settlement system. It also explores whether the disputes reflect differences in values and could lead to a re-evaluation of the bilateral relationship. The report categorizes and evaluates trade conflicts based on their causes and characteristics. The report categorizes and evaluates trade conflicts between Brussels and Washington based on their underlying causes and characteristics. Changes in government regulations that protect domestic interests are at the heart of most trade disputes. Various parties, including producers, workers, and interest groups, demand measures that result in protection for domestic parties. U.S.-EU trade conflicts vary depending on the nature of the demand for protection. Many U.S.-EU trade conflicts are classified based on the demand for protective action, with disagreements over the cause and nature of the controversy driving many disputes. The conflicts stem from demands for protectionist or other domestic aims, leading to disagreements over the dominant cause of any particular dispute. Trade conflicts between the U.S. and EU often arise from demands for protection or state aids for key industries like agriculture, aerospace, and steel. These disputes are fueled by policies that aim to open export markets while protecting domestic markets from imports. Agricultural trade tensions have historically been a significant issue in transatlantic relations, despite the sector's declining output and employment in both regions. In the U.S. and EU trade tensions, the agricultural sector plays a significant role. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is a major point of contention for the U.S., seen as a distortion of global agricultural trade. Complaints include EU restrictions on market access and export subsidies affecting U.S. sales and profits. The European market for farmers is impacted by EU export subsidies and domestic income support programs. Agricultural conflicts between the US and EU were intense in the 1980s, with disputes over exports and competition in third markets. Tensions have eased since the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture in 1994. The Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture in 1994 defined agricultural and trade policies, limited export quantities with subsidies, and established a \"peace clause\" for nine years. The US and EU have largely adhered to their commitments, but conflicts have arisen over non-traditional issues like beef hormones and bio-engineered food products. Negotiations in the Doha Round continue to divide the two economic superpowers. The Doha Round negotiations have caused division between the US and EU. The US proposed reducing domestic subsidies, expanding market access, and eliminating export subsidies. The EU wants the US to reduce trade-distorting support but is not willing to improve market access offers. Friction over government support for the aviation industry, particularly Airbus Industrie, has been a major issue in US-EU relations. The U.S. Trade Representative accuses Airbus member governments of providing massive subsidies since 1967 to aid in the development of Airbus aircraft. The EU is also accused of providing unfair advantages through various forms of support. The EU argues that it cannot cede the entire passenger market to the U.S. due to strategic and economic reasons. The Europeans claim that U.S. aircraft producers have benefitted from indirect governmental subsidies. The U.S. accuses European governments of providing illegal subsidies to Airbus, giving them an unfair advantage in the commercial jet aircraft market. The EU retaliates by claiming Boeing received illegal subsidies from the U.S. Two panels were established to handle the cases, with final rulings expected by October 31, 2007. The ongoing debate between Airbus and Boeing stems from Airbus's launch of the Airbus A380 in December 2000. The A380, the world's largest commercial passenger aircraft, has received 159 firm orders from 16 airlines by the end of 2005. The project cost about $13 billion, with funding coming from Airbus member firms, subcontractors, and state aid from European governments. Boeing dropped support for a competing large aircraft after the announcement of the A380 project. They focused on developing the 787, a 250-seat aircraft with new technology for increased fuel efficiency. The 787 program was launched in 2004 and received a significant number of orders by the end of 2005. Boeing's 787 project saw a significant increase in orders by the end of 2005, with plans to involve non-U.S. subcontractors and alternative funding sources. A Japanese group will contribute 35% of the funding, Alenia of Italy will provide $600 million for the rear fuselage, and other subcontractors are expected to have financial stakes in the project. Various forms of financial assistance from governments and tax incentives are also anticipated to support the development of the aircraft. The state of Washington provided $3.2 billion in non-traditional funding incentives for Boeing. These incentives are cited as illegal subsidies in a WTO complaint. The dispute between the United States and the EU over these subsidies has not been resolved yet. Analysts speculate that Boeing could use Airbus subsidies as leverage for securing a U.S. Air Force contract. Airbus' business struggles with delivery delays of its A380 plane may also be a reason why Boeing is not pushing for a settlement. The EU and U.S. have had ongoing trade conflicts in the steel industry for the past two decades. Despite EU industry consolidation, the U.S. has accused EU companies of benefiting from state subsidies and dumping steel products in foreign markets. U.S. steel companies have filed antidumping petitions against EU imports, leading to challenges in the WTO. President Bush initiated a Section 201 trade investigation on the steel industry in 2001. The U.S. imposed safeguard tariffs on the steel industry after a Section 201 trade investigation, leading to backlash from European leaders who responded with provisional tariffs on steel products. In early 2003, a WTO panel found that the U.S. failed to prove rising imports were harming its industry. The ITC recommended terminating the safeguards, allowing President Bush to end the steel measures in December 2003. Legal procedures sanctioned by the WTO offer temporary protection for domestic producers against both fair and unfair trade practices. The Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act (CDSOA), also known as the Byrd Amendment, was enacted by the U.S. Congress in October 2000. It required proceeds from antidumping and countervailing duty cases to be paid to U.S. companies instead of the U.S. Treasury. The EU and other parties challenged this provision in the WTO, arguing it was a double benefit for U.S. companies at the expense of their competitors. The WTO ruled the Byrd Amendment as impermissible in January 2003, giving the US until December 23, 2003, to comply. When the US did not comply, retaliatory measures were authorized. Canada, the EU, Mexico, and Japan imposed additional duties on selected US exports in retaliation. The Byrd Amendment was repealed in 2006, but CDSOA payments continued until October 2007, leading to sanctions on U.S. imports by the EU, Canada, and Mexico. The EU increased retaliation by $9 million and expanded the list of products facing punitive duties. U.S. officials and Congress members were disappointed that retaliation persisted despite the Byrd repeal. Conflicts between the United States and the European Union involve actions to protect political and economic interests, driven by different foreign policy goals. Economic stakes are important but not the sole cause of disputes. Examples include U.S. sanctions legislation and trade laws, and EU's preferential dealings with third countries. EU has concerns about U.S. laws driven by foreign policy priorities, particularly regarding extraterritorial provisions imposing sanctions on European firms. Key laws include the Helms-Burton Act and the Iran Libya Sanctions Act. The EU has concerns about U.S. extraterritorial laws, such as the Helms-Burton Act, which led to a strong protest in Europe. The Act imposed a secondary boycott on foreign nationals and companies dealing with Cuban-expropriated properties. The EU viewed this as a violation of WTO rules and passed countervailing legislation against its enforcement, leading to a WTO panel investigation. The U.S. claimed the WTO lacked competence to investigate the Helms-Burton Act due to national security concerns. An understanding was reached in April 1997 for greater protection of foreign investment, with the U.S. agreeing to protect EU companies from penalties under the Act. Legislative action by Congress is still needed for formal implementation. EU also has concerns about U.S. trade laws allowing for extraterritoriality. The EU has complaints about U.S. trade laws allowing for extraterritoriality, particularly regarding the unilateral imposition of trade sanctions. This includes challenges to provisions like Section 301 and laws dealing with government procurement barriers and intellectual property rights violations. The EU has also filed technical challenges in the WTO against various U.S. trade statutes. Some Americans see WTO challenges as part of a EU strategy to weaken U.S. trade laws for negotiating leverage in future transatlantic trade negotiations. Concerns have been raised about discriminatory preferential trade agreements the EU has with third countries, limiting MFN treatment to only eight countries. The EU's focus on internal issues may be hindering its commitment to global trade liberalization, causing concern among U.S. observers. The U.S. supports EU enlargement and deepening for political stability, but there are questions about the compatibility of U.S. political and trade goals. The EU is worried about potential discrimination from U.S. free trade agreements. The EU is concerned about potential discrimination against its exports due to U.S. free trade agreements with Asia and Latin America. This has prompted the EU to negotiate its own trade accords with Mexico and Mercosur countries. The U.S. is also worried about the Foreign Sales Corporation (FSC) provisions of its tax code, which benefited companies like General Electric and Boeing. The Foreign Sales Corporation (FSC) was enacted in 1984 to replace the DISC tax benefit for exporting. The EU challenged the FSC in 1997 under the WTO dispute settlement system, arguing it violated subsidy obligations and distorted competition. Despite limited support from European businesses, some European subsidiaries in the U.S. benefitted from the FSC. The EU challenged the FSC in 1997 under the WTO dispute settlement system, citing subsidy violations and competition distortion. The challenge was seen as retaliation for U.S. pressure over beef and bananas. The EU succeeded, leading to the replacement of the FSC with the ETI tax provision, which was also found inconsistent with WTO rules in 2002. The WTO authorized the EU to retaliate against the US with escalating duties on exports, starting at 5% in March 2004 and reaching 14% by December 2004. Sanctions were lifted in January 2005 after the repeal of FSC/ETI provisions. However, a WTO ruling in February 2006 found the subsidies illegal, leading to the EU's decision to reimpose sanctions. President Bush avoided the reimposition of tariffs on May 17. The EU and US faced conflicts over tariffs and subsidies, leading to sanctions and retaliatory measures. President Bush avoided tariff reimposition by signing a tax bill in 2006. Domestic policies promoting social, cultural, or environmental objectives often benefit local producers at the expense of foreign competitors. Disputes arise from efforts to strengthen food safety, environmental standards, and cultural values, reflecting complex new issues in the global economy. Disputes between the EU and US involve complex issues due to differences in regulatory approaches. The EU emphasizes regulation for all economic activities, while the US believes in minimal government intervention unless a problem arises. Trade conflicts often involve delicate considerations of motives, with parties like consumer or environmental groups initiating actions for domestic objectives. Food safety barriers are seen as more legitimate than economic protectionism barriers, as sacrificing food safety for free trade may lose public support. Disputes between the EU and US involve complex issues rooted in different regulatory approaches and public preferences. Key disputes include beef hormones and genetically engineered crops due to European societal preferences for high food safety standards, an audio-visual sector clash driven by cultural preservation concerns, and a dispute over airplane noise pollution. Other disputes, like data privacy, also reflect varying priorities. The EU and US have disputes over various issues such as data privacy, agriculture, environmental protection, and trade bans on products like meat treated with growth-promoting hormones. These disputes stem from different regulatory approaches and cultural differences between the two sides. The EU and US have disputes over trade bans on products like meat treated with growth-promoting hormones. The ban affected $100-$200 million in lost U.S. exports, but the WTO ruled it was inconsistent with international standards. The EU justified the ban for consumer safety, but the WTO panels found it lacked scientific justification. The EU ban on hormone-treated meat lacked scientific justification, leading to disputes with the US. The EU refused to lift the ban due to consumer opposition, offering compensation instead. The US imposed retaliatory tariffs on EU agricultural products, sparking protests among European farmers against Americanization and globalization. The EU changed its hormone ban legislation in response to U.S. concerns, making it provisional for five growth hormones used in beef production. The EU argued that this compliance should end punitive trade sanctions by the U.S. and Canada. The EU challenged U.S. and Canadian sanctions in the WTO over punitive tariffs on EU products. Dispute panel hearings were held in 2005 and 2006, but agreement on scientific experts was difficult to reach. Retaliatory tariffs from the U.S. are likely to continue as long as the EU maintains its ban on certain hormones. The United States and the EU have conflicts over genetically engineered crops and food products, impacting agricultural trade. Differences in views on GE products' health and environmental effects are at the core of the issue. U.S. farmers use GE crops to reduce costs and increase flexibility, while supporters believe in their potential to enhance productivity and nutrition globally. Consumer acceptance of GE foods is crucial for producers, processors, and exporters. EU consumers, environmentalists, and some scientists are concerned about the unknown long-term effects of genetically engineered (GE) foods on health and the environment. Europeans are more risk averse to these issues compared to U.S. citizens. In 1999, the EU implemented a moratorium on new GE product approvals, leading to a halt in U.S. corn shipments. EU policymakers also considered mandatory labeling for GE products. U.S. trade officials initially avoided challenging the moratorium in the WTO due to public opposition, but eventually did so in May 2003. In May 2003, the United States, Canada, and Argentina challenged the EU moratorium on genetically engineered crops in the WTO. The EU lifted the moratorium in May 2004 but faced complaints due to continued blockages by some member states. In February 2006, the WTO ruled that the EU violated rules with bans on approved biotech products and delays in approval procedures. The legal battle is ongoing and could impact transatlantic relations. The EU's Broadcast Directive from 1989 requires European content quotas in broadcast transmission, impacting transatlantic relations. Implementation varies among EU member states, with some countries like France and Italy imposing restrictions on U.S. programs and American music. This has led to challenges in strengthening European content quotas within the EU. The EU's Broadcast Directive requires European content quotas in broadcast transmission, impacting transatlantic relations. Efforts to tighten restrictions have faced opposition from Germany and Britain. Consumer demand for foreign movies and technological innovation have hindered increased protection. The dispute reflects European concerns about \"Americanization\" threatening national identities and cultures. There is a fundamental U.S.-EU divide over the role of cultural and social issues in trade disputes. The EU implemented regulations to address aircraft noise issues in European skies, focusing on limiting the operation of \"hushkitted\" aircraft. Hushkitting involves strategies to reduce noise but did not result in significant noise level reductions according to EU standards. The EU implemented regulations on aircraft noise levels, affecting mostly U.S. manufacturers and airlines. The U.S. filed a motion with ICAO, claiming the regulation discriminated against U.S. interests. A settlement was reached in 2002, leading to the repeal of the regulation. The U.S. withdrew its complaint regarding trade conflicts in different categories, influenced by factors such as bilateral agreements and economic trends. Agreements can reduce government and private sector demand for protection by providing clear obligations and dispute resolution mechanisms. The U.S. and EU have an ideological consensus against protectionism, making it challenging for producer interests to justify protectionist demands. Diverse economic and political trends can suppress demand for protection, such as declining support for industrial policy initiatives in the U.S. and EU. High priority political commitments, like the EU's enlargement policy, incentivize reform and liberalization over protection. Cooperative arrangements have increased to manage transatlantic trade disputes, including regulatory co-operation and bilateral consultation forums. These efforts aim to prevent disputes by incorporating a wider range of domestic interest groups. The assessment suggests that traditional trade conflicts may become less disruptive in the future, but foreign policy induced friction may not diminish. Domestic-policy related trade disputes are expected to see a reduction in friction for some cases, but not all, due to routine commercial questions governed by bilateral or multilateral agreements. The WTO provides multilateral rules on tariffs and trade practices, with a mechanism for dispute resolution. Retaliation can be authorized for non-compliance. The Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture reduced trade conflicts in areas like EU market protection. Steel trade conflicts involve anti-dumping laws used by the US and EU. The steel trade battle in 2002 was heated due to perceived violations of safeguards agreements. Trade conflicts often revolve around free trade versus protectionism. Requests for protection will be scrutinized in transparent debates. Both the US and EU favor competition and open markets, making it challenging for petitioners to justify exceptions. Economic and political trends may reduce future disputes over producer protection. The decline of support for industrial policy in Brussels and Washington, budgetary pressures in the EU, and a rise in foreign direct investment and corporate mergers have lessened pressures for protectionism. Industrial policy initiatives, once popular in the late 1980s and early 1990s, are now viewed skeptically, reducing the need for targeted state aids to boost competitiveness. Subsidies and state aids are closely tied to the industrial policy debate. The trend towards a deregulated and competitive single market in Europe has led to increased scrutiny and reduction of subsidies and state aids to individual companies. Budgetary constraints in the European Monetary Union are driving this trend, which is also being reinforced by a rise in foreign direct investment and corporate mergers. This shift is expected to globalize many industries and blur the lines of national identity in the face of increasing transatlantic merger and acquisition activities. The question of 'who is us?' is becoming blurred as American suppliers are estimated to provide a significant amount of parts for a new Airbus plane. This could moderate demands for protection, although various factors could lead to a different outcome. Industries have historically justified protection based on unique arguments, especially in agriculture where public support is strong. Efforts to reform the CAP in Brussels must address this challenge amidst rapidly changing economic conditions. Efforts to reform the CAP in Brussels must address the challenge of rapidly changing economic conditions. Trade conflicts driven by foreign policy objectives lack institutional arrangements and are not easily categorized as free trade or protectionism. Lobbying by big businesses may help moderate some conflicts, but a transatlantic agreement is needed for consistent treatment of these issues. The absence of a transatlantic agreement hinders resolving U.S.-EU sanctions conflicts over foreign policy differences. Trade measures in a foreign policy context are often exempt from WTO disciplines, with little guidance on regional agreements. The national security provision of GATT allows countries wide latitude for sanctions. The WTO established a Committee on Regional Trade Agreements in 1995 to address issues with Article 24 provisions allowing regional agreements to deviate from WTO principles. Challenges in measuring trade diversion have hindered efforts to challenge preferential deals, leading to increased mistrust and a rise in preferential trade agreements. The U.S. and EU are pursuing more aggressive trade agreements, potentially leading to increased conflict. The EU's refusal to implement WTO panel findings on bananas and beef hormones adds to the challenges in this area. The EU's refusal to implement WTO panel findings on bananas and beef hormones could lead U.S. policymakers to reconsider limits on unilateralism in the Uruguay Round bargain. The dispute over the U.S. export tax benefit program raises questions about the proper forum for such disputes. Pressures to apply sanctions, cut trade deals, and use the WTO for foreign policy goals are likely to persist. Efforts to achieve foreign policy objectives may face challenges from business lobbies. A pledge or non-aggression pact between the US and EU could help resolve disagreements and promote shared goals. US-EU trade disputes now focus more on regulatory differences than traditional barriers like tariffs. Regulatory requirements aim at consumer and environmental protection without favoring domestic interests directly. Transatlantic regulatory disputes can be more bitter and difficult to resolve than traditional trade disputes, as both sides feel justified by democratically derived decisions. The US and EU tend to rely on bilateral cooperation and negotiation to resolve regulatory disputes, rather than the WTO dispute resolution system. Progress has been made in mitigating divergent standards and certification systems through bilateral efforts. Bilateral efforts to promote regulatory cooperation have been a top priority in both the US and EU since the late 1995 signing of the \"New Transatlantic Agenda\" and \"Action Plan.\" The Transatlantic Business Dialogue (TABD) spearheaded initiatives to address issues with divergent standards and certification systems, including negotiating mutual recognition agreements (MRAs) in key sectors like pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and telecommunications equipment. In June 1997, agreement was reached on a package of MRAs affecting six sectors. In June 1997, agreement was reached on MRAs in sectors like electrical equipment, pharmaceutical products, and telecommunications. The agreements covered $50 billion in U.S.-EU trade, allowing companies to sell products in each other's markets after meeting health and safety standards. Negotiating and implementing these agreements has been challenging due to differing industry interests and regulatory approaches. German Chancellor Angela Merkel proposed the creation of a Transatlantic Free Trade Area (TAFTA) in January 2007 to harmonize regulations across the Atlantic and reduce non-tariff barriers. Challenges in applying modern biotechnology to food production are addressed by the Uruguay Round Sanitary and Phytosanitary Standards (SPS) Agreement, which requires decisions based on sound scientific evidence. However, ambiguities in the SPS agreement complicate matters, especially for European consumers. European consumers' strong beliefs against biotechnology may lead to challenges in trade agreements. Officials are considering imposing trade restrictions based on precautionary measures or renegotiating the SPS agreement. Concerns arise that European agricultural policies may prioritize safety over necessity, potentially leading to discriminatory trade barriers. Mistrust grows regarding government authorities' efforts in maintaining consumer confidence in the food system. One analyst believes that trade disputes arising from differences in consumer views are unlikely to be resolved, only contained. While U.S. consumers are generally accepting of GMOs, a 2000 recall of taco shells containing unapproved genetically engineered corn showed discontent. The European Union's active role in consumer protection, especially in areas like corporate mergers and Internet privacy, is gaining support. The European Union is actively seeking to protect consumers by establishing a pan-EU food agency and providing more information on GM foods. However, technological progress, such as cable and satellite television, poses challenges to enforcing regulations. Mark Twain once remarked that Wagner's music \"is not as bad as it sounds.\" Despite rising trade tensions between the U.S. and EU, the relationship between the two economic powers is not constantly on the brink of a trade war. The conflicts do not signify a fundamental rift between the United States and Europe, nor are they merely sensationalized distractions. These disputes represent a small percentage of transatlantic trade. Trade conflicts between the U.S. and EU, while not leading to a trade war, have real economic and political consequences. These disputes test the World Trade Organization and hinder efforts to promote a more open global economy. The impacts are challenging to quantify, but measures are in place to contain costs, such as retaliatory tariffs on European exports and EU tariffs on U.S. exports. The EU imposed over $2 billion in tariffs on U.S. exports due to trade disputes like the FSC and Byrd Amendment. Retaliatory tariffs aim to raise costs for targeted products, impacting foreign producers. However, retaliation also harms importers, consumers, and firms reliant on these imports. Lobbying efforts by affected entities limit the scope of trade officials on both sides of the Atlantic. The limitations imposed by lobbying efforts on trade officials from both the EU and the US result in retaliation lists dominated by luxury or high value-added agricultural items. Finding a balance in retaliation lists that match the relatively small sum of a few billion dollars is challenging. Any attempt to retaliate with a larger trade value could spark political opposition, given the significant investments and intertwined markets between the two economic superpowers. This interconnectedness creates strong incentives to contain disputes in globally traded sectors. In globally traded sectors, companies source inputs, research, design, and marketing strategies worldwide, complicating the definition of domestic production. Trade disputes impact public opinion and connect to other transatlantic problems, fueling anti-Americanism in Europe. U.S. retaliation, such as against Europe for not accepting hormone-enhanced beef, may worsen these feelings. Hormone-enhanced beef may fuel anti-American sentiments in Europe, leading to heightened reactions from European policymakers. The U.S. proposal for carousel retaliation is criticized as outdated diplomacy by French President Chirac. The impact of these trade tensions on cooperation between the U.S. and Europe remains uncertain. Trade disputes between the United States and the EU may impact their ability to lead the world economy and pursue common interests. Cooperation and adherence to WTO rules are crucial to maintaining the credibility of the system. The EU's actions regarding beef and banana imports are scrutinized by U.S. policymakers and interest groups. The EU and U.S. have had disputes over compliance with WTO decisions, with both sides being criticized for non-compliance. This behavior weakens the authority of the WTO and undermines the value of negotiating new trade agreements. Domestic political interests may have influenced some complaints brought to the WTO by both parties. The EU and U.S. have faced criticism for non-compliance with WTO decisions, potentially driven by domestic political interests. This behavior weakens the WTO's authority and hinders the negotiation of new trade agreements. The dispute settlement process may be used for leverage rather than addressing serious trade issues, potentially weakening the institution. Sovereignty issues may arise in complex disputes like GMOs, leading to public backlash. Under these circumstances, WTO panels may need to clarify vague rules with little U.S.-EU consensus, or trade officials could negotiate diplomatic solutions to difficult disagreements."
