    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Continuing Care for Recovering Families Act\" and extends COBRA coverage for certain individuals. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 is amended to allow eligible individuals affected by terrorist attacks to elect continuation coverage under COBRA for 120 days from the date of enactment of the Continuing Care for Recovering Families Act or the date of loss of coverage. The 120-day election period for continuation coverage under COBRA starts at the terrorism-related loss of coverage and ends on the first day of the election period. The period before the 120-day election period is disregarded for determining certain timeframes. The term 'eligible individual' is defined as a child or spouse of a victim of the September 11th attacks who has experienced a terrorism-related loss of coverage and is not otherwise entitled to benefits. The term 'terrorism-related loss of coverage' refers to the loss of health benefits due to the death, injury, or loss of employment of an eligible individual as defined in the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund. This amendment extends the COBRA election and coverage period for victims of terrorist attacks under the Public Health Service Act. Victims of Terrorist Attacks can elect continuation coverage under the Continuing Care for Recovering Families Act for 120 days after experiencing a terrorism-related loss of coverage. The coverage starts at the beginning of the election period and does not include any prior period.
