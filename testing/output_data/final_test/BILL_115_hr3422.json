    "content": "The \"Interstate Teaching Mobility Act\" is a program for interstate teaching applications under Title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. It establishes a program for interstate teaching applications. The Secretary, with an eligible entity, may establish a program for interstate teaching applications, allowing teachers to be licensed in multiple states without additional requirements. Teachers can apply for teaching positions in schools in other participating states under certain conditions. The Secretary, in consultation with an eligible entity, will create an application for teachers licensed in participating states to teach in other states without needing additional certification. Participating states must maintain eligibility requirements and receive technical assistance. The program established under subsection (a) will provide technical assistance to participating States and offer an electronic application process for teachers to apply. Participating teachers must submit an application with proof of an active teaching license, assessment results, and other required information. The eligible entity will collect and review teacher applications for the program. States must require assessments for content knowledge, pedagogical skills, and performance for teachers to participate. The eligible entity will collect and review teacher applications for the program, including performance assessments completed as part of a teacher preparation program. The assessments required by the State must be identified as sufficiently rigorous by an organization like the Council of Chief State School Officers. The Secretary may issue regulations to carry out this section. The term 'eligible entity' refers to an organization that supports States and teachers in teacher certification and licensure, approved by the Secretary. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section for a Program for interstate teaching applications under Part D - Interstate Teaching Applications."
