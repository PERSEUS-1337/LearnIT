    "content": "The Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999 (P.L. 105-277, H.R. 4328) signed into law on October 21, 1998, included $55.9 billion in regular FY1999 appropriations for the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and an additional $5.9 billion in emergency supplemental spending for farm economic and disaster assistance. This was after the President vetoed the conference agreement on FY1999 funding for USDA due to the lack of an increase in loan rates for farmers. The emergency assistance provided in P.L. 105-277 was $1.7 billion above the amount in the vetoed bill. The USDA, with approximately 30 internal agencies and 100,000 employees, had net outlays of $52.5 billion in FY1997. The largest portion of this, $35.9 billion (67%), was allocated to food and nutrition programs, including the food stamp program. Another $8.9 billion (17%) was spent on farm and foreign agricultural services, funded through the Commodity Credit Corporation. In FY1997, USDA had net outlays of $52.5 billion. $35.9 billion (67%) was allocated to food and nutrition programs, while $8.9 billion (17%) was spent on farm and foreign agricultural services. Another $4.2 billion (8%) was spent on natural resource and environment programs, with the majority going to the Forest Service. The remaining funds were allocated to research, education, rural development, marketing, regulatory activities, meat and poultry inspection, and departmental activities. Approximately three-fourths of USDA spending is classified as mandatory. The USDA has control over annual appropriations, with eligibility for mandatory programs written into authorizing law. The majority of USDA mandatory spending goes towards food stamp programs, child nutrition programs, farm commodity support, crop insurance, and conservation programs. Mandatory spending for food and nutrition programs is funded separately. The USDA's food and nutrition programs have mandatory status and are funded by annual appropriations based on projected spending needs. Supplemental appropriations are made if estimates fall short. The Commodity Credit Corporation is reimbursed for losses incurred in financing support programs. The 1996 farm bill fixed direct payments to crop producers, reducing unpredictability in USDA spending. Discretionary programs make up 25% of the USDA budget and are determined by annual funding. Discretionary programs within USDA, funded by annual appropriations acts, include rural development, research, agricultural credit, WIC, international food aid, meat inspection, and food marketing. FY1998 funding levels were provided by specific legislative acts. The Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration Appropriations Act for FY1999 was included in the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Appropriations Act,1999 (P.L. 105-277, H.R. 4328) after being vetoed by the President. The bill was approved by the House and Senate and signed into law on October 21, 1998, providing $55.9 billion in regular appropriations for USDA and related agencies, along with $5.9 billion in emergency funding for farmers. The President vetoed the FY1999 USDA appropriations bill due to lack of Senate Democratic-supported increase in loan rates for farmers. The bill was later approved with $55.9 billion in regular appropriations and $5.9 billion in emergency funding for farmers. The $55.9 billion in regular FY1999 appropriations for USDA and related agencies in P.L. 105-277 is about equal to the House-passed level of H.R. 4101, $1.3 billion below the Senate-passed level (S. 2159), and nearly $3 billion below the Administration request. $42.25 billion is for mandatory programs and $13.69 billion for discretionary spending. The funding provided in P.L. 105-277 is similar to the vetoed conference agreement on H.R. 4101, with some differences including more funding for the President's Food Safety Initiative and rural development programs within USDA. The total non-emergency budget authority in P.L. 105-277 for USDA and related agencies is significantly higher than the $49.55 billion appropriated in FY1998. The House and Senate bills, H.R. 4101 and S. 2159, differ in the amount provided for food stamps, with the House basing its projections on lower participation and benefits. The funding in P.L. 105-277 is similar to the vetoed conference agreement on H.R. 4101, with some differences including more funding for the President's Food Safety Initiative and rural development programs within USDA. P.L. 105-277 provides $5.893 billion in supplemental assistance for regions experiencing low farm commodity prices and natural disasters. No budgetary offsets are required for this expenditure, as it is declared a budget emergency. The amount allocated for farm assistance is similar to a proposal announced by House Republican leadership. P.L. 105-277 provides $5.9 billion in emergency farm assistance, including $3.057 billion in \"market loss\" payments for grain, cotton, and dairy farmers. The distribution of the $2.857 billion for grain and cotton farmers is expected to be in specific proportions. The emergency farm assistance package includes payments for cotton, rice, and other feed grains totaling $786 million. Additionally, there will be $200 million in dairy payments, $1.5 billion in disaster payments for crop losses in 1998, $875 million in direct disaster payments for multiple years of losses, and $200 million in cost-share assistance for livestock growers affected by natural disasters. Farmers will receive disaster payments regardless of crop insurance coverage. The emergency farm assistance package includes disaster payments for various crops and livestock, with a mandatory requirement for farmers to obtain crop insurance in certain situations. The government will pay the entire premium for basic insurance coverage, costing an additional $66 million. Other provisions include assistance for Alaska fishermen, funding for the Farm Service Agency, and discretionary eligibility conditions set by the Secretary of Agriculture. The emergency farm assistance package includes disaster payments for crops and livestock, with mandatory crop insurance. The government will cover insurance premiums, costing $66 million. Additional funding includes support for the Farm Service Agency and dairy disaster assistance. Senate Democrats pushed for a temporary increase in loan rates for certain farm commodities, but the provision was not included in the final agreement. The President vetoed the agreement due to the lack of loan rate increases. The emergency farm assistance package includes disaster payments for crops and livestock, with mandatory crop insurance. Additional funding supports the Farm Service Agency and dairy disaster assistance. Senate Democrats pushed for a temporary increase in loan rates for certain farm commodities, but the provision was not included in the final agreement. The President vetoed the agreement due to the lack of loan rate increases. The proposed one-year increase in loan rates was opposed by Republican leadership due to cost and potential policy changes from the 1996 farm law. Farm commodity programs, export programs, and conservation programs are funded through USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation, supporting various commodities. The Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 replaced direct payments to farmers with declining market transition payments over 7 years, leading to more predictable CCC outlays. The estimated CCC outlays for FY1999 were $9.0 billion, with $5.5 billion for market transition payments. The estimated CCC outlays for FY1999 were $9.0 billion, with $5.8 billion in market transition payments funded through the CCC. The CCC borrows funds from the Treasury to operate, with a limit of $30 billion in outstanding borrowing. The $8.439 billion requested for FY1999 reimbursement to the CCC in P.L. 105-277 is a significant increase from previous years. The FY1999 reimbursement to the CCC increased significantly by $7.7 billion from the previous year. The change in methodology for determining net realized losses led to the higher request. The $783.5 million requested in FY1998 was low due to the transition to the new methodology. Farm commodity programs do not require annual appropriations, but opponents have tried to make changes through amendments in the past. Amendments affecting peanut and sugar price support programs and crop insurance for tobacco farmers were offered and defeated during the debate on H.R. 4101 in June. A Senate amendment requiring tobacco growers to be assessed for USDA costs was deleted in conference. P.L. 105-277 includes provisions on waiving the statute of limitations for discrimination allegations against USDA from 1981 to 1996. The conference agreement on P.L. 105-277 modified civil rights provisions to include housing loan programs and extend the statute of limitations back to 1981. The Secretary of Agriculture must investigate, issue a determination, and propose a resolution within 180 days. Additionally, P.L. 105-277 requires USDA to issue a final rule for federal milk marketing order reform by April 4, 1999, with implementation extended to October 1, 1999. The deadline for implementing federal milk marketing order reforms has been extended from April 4, 1999, to October 1, 1999. This extension is supported by Northeast and Southeast dairy producer groups who are concerned about potential reforms that could reduce minimum farm milk prices. Opponents, mainly Upper Midwest milk producers, argue that the extension pressures USDA to maintain the current pricing system. The USDA's final rule on milk pricing reforms must be released between February 1 and April 4, 1999, to allow Congress to react. An amendment to extend the deadline to October 1, 1999, was passed, affecting the Northeast Dairy Compact. Another amendment to keep the compact's sunset date at April 4, 1999, was not considered. The Chairman of the Rules Committee raised a point of order against an amendment on the House floor, citing a rule that prohibited amendments to H.R. 4101 that change existing law. The federal crop insurance program, administered by USDA's Risk Management Agency, offers catastrophic insurance to producers with the option to purchase additional coverage at a subsidized rate. USDA absorbs a large percentage of program losses and compensates reinsured companies. The USDA absorbs program losses, compensates reinsured companies, subsidizes premiums for producers, and funds expenses through the Federal Crop Insurance Fund. Legislation addressed funding controversy, authorizing all reimbursements to be funded through the crop insurance fund. P.L. 105-185 authorizes reimbursement to be funded through the crop insurance fund as mandatory spending, avoiding the need for annual appropriations. To offset the $1 billion expenditure over 5 years, changes were made to the federal crop insurance program, resulting in $530 million in savings. This includes increased fees for catastrophic coverage and a reduction in reimbursement rates to private insurance companies. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations act (P.L. 105-277) resulted in savings of $188 million by reducing the fee charged to farmers for catastrophic coverage. The Federal Crop Insurance Fund was estimated to need $1.504 billion for FY1999, with $66 million requested for the RMA's expenses, frozen at the FY1998 level of $64 million. The USDA serves as a lender of last resort for family farmers, providing direct farm loans and guarantees for qualified loans from commercial lenders. The cost of making a loan is related to interest rate subsidies and projected loan losses. The Administration requested $105.7 million in funding. The Administration requested $105.7 million for farm loans in FY1999. H.R. 4101 recommended $91.4 million, while S. 2159 recommended $96.5 million. P.L. 105-277 provided $89.7 million for direct and guaranteed loans, with an additional $31.4 million for operating loans. This supplemental funding aimed to address a backlog of loan applications due to a shortage of funds in FY1998. The Senate bill modifies farmer eligibility for future FSA farm loans by allowing up to three debt forgivenesses. Borrowers with one debt forgiveness before April 4, 1996, remain eligible for emergency disaster loans. The Secretary has discretion in determining eligibility for emergency disaster loans, not automatically disqualifying applicants lacking collateral. Additionally, individual loan limits for FSA farm loans have been changed under P.L. 105-277. The omnibus FY1999 appropriations act (P.L. 105-277) changes individual loan limits for FSA farm loans, allowing for an annual increase based on the consumer price index. It also reduces the cash flow requirement on restructured delinquent farm loans. Additionally, the act provides $5.8 billion for USDA's international activities, including export credit guarantees, subsidies, market promotion programs, and foreign food aid. The omnibus FY1999 appropriations act (P.L. 105-277) provides $5.8 billion for USDA's international activities, including export credit guarantees and foreign food aid. The FY1999 appropriation for agricultural export and food aid programs is close to the Administration's budget request of $5.7 billion. The decrease in funding from FY1998 is mainly due to reductions in CCC export credit guarantees and concessional food aid. Additionally, P.L. 105-277 allows Pakistan to regain access to USDA's agricultural export credit guarantees. The Administration's budget request for FY1999 reflects the actual level of sales expected under CCC export credit guarantees, amounting to $4.6 billion. Actual guarantees have been lower than authorized amounts in previous years, with guarantees of $2.876 billion in FY1997 and $4.4 billion in FY1998. The actual level of guarantees in FY1999 may differ from the budget request. In FY1999, the budget request of $4.6 billion for CCC export credit guarantees may vary based on demand, market conditions, and USDA decisions. $4.3 billion is allocated to GSM-102 for short-term credit guarantees, $100 million to GSM-103 for intermediate-term credit guarantees, $150 million to supplier credit guarantee, and $50 million to facilities financing guarantee. CCC guarantees payments for financing under supplier credit guarantee and financing of exported goods under facilities financing guarantee. The financing of manufactured goods and services exported from the United States to improve agricultural facilities in emerging markets led to concerns about agricultural sales to Pakistan and India following nuclear weapons tests. Efforts were made to allow Pakistan to regain access to USDA's agricultural export credit guarantees, especially for wheat purchases. Congress approved separate legislation to facilitate Pakistan's purchase of a large quantity of wheat in July 1998. Congress approved legislation in July 1998 to exempt USDA credits, guarantees, and financial assistance from nonproliferation sanctions, allowing the sale of over 600,000 metric tons of white wheat to Pakistan. There was debate on exempting food, fertilizer, medicine, and medical equipment from U.S. unilateral sanctions, but the language was dropped during Senate consideration of FY1999 agriculture appropriations. The FY1999 agricultural appropriations act exempts food, fertilizer, medicine, and medical equipment from U.S. unilateral sanctions, except for countries supporting terrorism or using food and medicine for coercion. Country of Origin Labeling for Agricultural Products and Market Access Program funding remain unchanged. The Market Access Program (MAP) is a popular program in the agricultural community, funded through the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), and not requiring annual appropriations. Despite opposition from some groups, attempts to eliminate MAP funding in FY1999 were unsuccessful. P.L. 105-277 calls for a study on the economic costs and benefits of the program. Export Subsidies under P.L. 105-277 do not include changes to the EEP program and have no limits on FAIR Act authorized levels. The EEP program under P.L. 105-277 has no limits on FAIR Act authorized levels, with $550 million available for FY1999. EEP bonuses aim to make U.S. agricultural commodities price competitive in targeted markets. In FY1998, bonuses were announced for poultry meat and barley. The President's proposal to set EEP spending at $1.2 billion was not acted upon. No action was taken on the President's proposal to set EEP spending at $1.2 billion over FY1999 through FY2003 with an allocation of up to $320 million as a first installment of a \"flexible, multi-year program authorization for EEP.\" Savings from the proposed multi-year EEP program were estimated at approximately $1.4 billion. For DEIP, the President's budget anticipated a lower level of program activity in FY1999 due to a tighter domestic market for dairy products, with a proposed $82 million budget, $17 million less than the estimated $99 million. The FY1999 appropriations act maintains spending for P.L. 480 at approximately $1.1 billion. P.L. 480 is the primary means of providing food assistance to foreign countries, funding long-term concessional sales of U.S. agricultural products and humanitarian food donations. Title III provides grant food aid for development projects in low-income countries. USDA administers Title I, while AID administers Titles II and III. The Administration proposed a total budget authority of $967 million for P.L. 480 in FY1999, a reduction of $96 million from FY1998. This would provide 2.8 million metric tons of commodities, down from 3.2 million metric tons in the previous year. Efforts to cut Title I spending and reduce Title III have been rejected in the past due to opposition from commodity groups and supporters in Congress. Food for Progress (FFP) program is also mentioned. The Food for Progress (FFP) program provides commodities to developing countries committed to free enterprise in their agricultural economies. It can use Title I funds for procurement and transportation costs, as well as CCC funds when Section 416(b) commodities are unavailable. The annual programming is limited to 500,000 metric tons and $30 million for non-commodity costs. The Administration budget allocates $109 million of CCC funds for FFP in FY1999. The Food for Progress (FFP) program provides commodities to developing countries for free enterprise in their agricultural economies. P.L. 105-277 provides an emergency appropriation of $25 million for FFP. The Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) administers agricultural export and food aid programs, market development, export promotion efforts, and international cooperation programs. The FY1999 budget requested $141 million for FAS, but P.L. 105-277 provides $136.2 million, including funds for international cooperative administrative support. Around $60 million is allocated for market development, including support for the Foreign Market Development Program. P.L. 105-277 provides $793.1 million for conservation programs in FY1999, administered by USDA's NRCS and FSA. The requested amount was $826.3 million, with the Senate proposing $792 million and the House $784.4 million. Funding for conservation programs is mandatory and funded through the CCC, totaling just under $2 billion in FY1999. P.L. 105-277 allocates nearly $2 billion for conservation programs in FY1999, with $641 million designated for the core Conservation Operations program within NRCS. The Administration's request of $742 million was reduced by $99 million, with additional funding for initiatives like Clean Water and Watershed Restoration. The House and Senate rejected requests for increased funding for conservation efforts, with the House recommending $641 million and the Senate recommending $638.6 million for the Conservation Operations program. Both chambers included recommendations for specific projects and policy changes in the legislation. The House report expressed concerns about accountability for fund spending and limitations on where the funds can be used without prior approval. The Act, P.L. 105-277, made changes to the Administration's proposals for various programs, including limiting Technical Assistance funding under the Watershed and Flood Prevention Program to $47 million. There were disagreements between the House and Senate on funding levels for NRCS programs, with the Senate providing level funding for two programs while the House proposed decreases and increases for others. The House decreased funding for Watershed Surveys and Planning by $1.6 million and increased funding for the Resource Conservation and Development Program by less than $1 million. Changes were made to three mandatory conservation programs, resulting in budget savings of nearly $100 million. The Environmental Quality Incentives Program was limited to $174 million, the Wetland Reserve Program enrollment was limited to 120,000 acres, and greater flexibility for enrolling land into the WRP was supported. The House supported greater flexibility for enrolling land into the WRP. It agreed to prohibit funding for the Conservation Farm Option (CFO) for savings of $25 million. P.L. 105-277 rejected the House-passed prohibition on funding the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program (WHIP). The Administration proposed changes to various conservation programs, including a reduction in the WRP funding by $95 million. The changes in conservation programs include approaching enrollment caps for various programs and allocation of funds. The Senate bill limited WRP enrollment to 120,000 acres and made changes to enrollment criteria. The House bill limited WRP enrollment to 130,000 acres and made funding restrictions for various programs. The Farm Service Agency operates the Conservation Reserve Program, allowing landowners to retire environmentally sensitive lands in return for payments and technical assistance. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is a mandatory program funded through the CCC to retire environmentally sensitive lands from production in exchange for payments and technical assistance. Estimated funds for the CRP are decreasing, with no funds requested for the Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) and the Flood Risk Reduction Program. The Forest Service, with requested outlays of $3.378 billion in FY1999, also has natural resource protection responsibilities. The Forest Service, under USDA, has natural resource protection responsibilities. Funding issues are addressed in the Interior appropriations bill. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations act allocated $1.930 billion for USDA's research, education, and economics agencies. The House-passed version of H.R. 4101 had $1.838 billion, while the Senate bill contained $1.843 billion. The vetoed conference agreement on H.R. 4101 would have provided $1.923 billion. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations act allocated $1.923 billion for USDA's research, education, and economics agencies, with provisions similar to P.L. 105-277. The funding level is higher than the Administration's request and FY1998 funding level. USDA's REE function is carried out by four agencies, including the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and the National Agricultural Library. The Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service (CSREES) and the Economic Research Service (ERS) are part of the USDA's research, education, and economics agencies. The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) received $842 million in funding for FY1999, with $786 million allocated to research programs and $56.4 million for building and facility construction and repair. This funding level is higher than the Senate and House-passed versions. The final appropriation for ARS buildings and facilities in FY1999 was $56.4 million, exceeding the Senate-passed level by $24.5 million. The funding for the President's Food Safety Initiative increased by $66 million, with $9 million designated for ARS food safety research. The offset for this increase no longer comes from ARS's construction funds. The final appropriation for ARS buildings and facilities in FY1999 was $56.4 million, exceeding the Senate-passed level by $24.5 million. P.L. 105-277 also provides funds for ARS for specific research under different titles, including anti-drug research and drug crop eradication technologies. Additionally, $919.2 million is allocated for cooperative research, education, and extension programs in the states, surpassing the House-passed and Administration levels. The final appropriation for ARS buildings and facilities in FY1999 was $56.4 million, exceeding the Senate-passed level by $24.5 million. P.L. 105-277 also provides funds for specific research under different titles, including anti-drug research and drug crop eradication technologies. Additionally, $919.2 million is allocated for cooperative research, education, and extension programs in the states, surpassing the House-passed and Administration levels. The funding for CSREES in P.L. 105-277 includes increases in formula funds for extension programs, forestry research, and Hatch Act funds. P.L. 105-277 allocates funds for various research programs, including a 3% increase for forestry research and a 7% increase for historically black land grant colleges. The National Research Initiative receives $119.3 million, with food safety receiving an $8 million increase. Additionally, $4.1 million is provided for other research programs under CSREES. P.L. 105-277 provides a $12.1 million increase in funding for cooperative food safety research, with a 23% increase over the FY1998 level. Extension special projects receive an additional $633,000 in funding. No new funds were allocated for constructing research facilities at land grant Colleges of Agriculture after FY1997. In FY1999, no funds were requested or allocated for facilities construction. However, funding may resume once a 10-year strategic plan for agricultural research facilities is completed. CSREES administers a grants program under the Fund for Rural America, authorized in the 1996 farm act. In FY1998, $36.1 million was available for research projects related to rural needs. The Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act extended the Fund for Rural America through FY2003 and allocated an additional $100 million in mandatory funds over 5 years. In FY1999, no funds were allocated for facilities construction. The Fund for Rural America received an additional $100 million in mandatory funds over 5 years. P.L.105-277 prohibits the use of funds for salaries and expenses for the program until FY2000. The Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems, authorized by P.L. 105-185, would provide $600 million over 5 years for research on food crops, livestock genetics, food safety, and human nutrition. The funding for the genetics of food crops and livestock, food safety, human nutrition, and alternative uses for agricultural commodities is put on hold until FY2000. The Economic Research Service (ERS) receives $65.8 million in funding, slightly below the House-passed level. The responsibility for USDA research and analysis of food programs remains with ERS, as stipulated by P.L. 105-277. $12.2 million will be used for studies and evaluations. The Senate proposed P.L. 105-277, allocating $12.2 million for studies and evaluations of food stamp, child nutrition, and WIC programs. $2 million of the $12.2 million will be transferred to the Food Program Administration account for program evaluations. Additionally, $453,000 will be spent on studies to estimate the benefits of food safety. The conferees directed $104 million for NASS and reiterated ERS not to reduce the frequency of its commodity situation and outlook reports. The FY1999 funding for the 1997 Census of Agriculture was $105.1 million, with $23.6 million allocated for NASS's work on the census. The Administration aimed to streamline the census application process by reducing redundant questions. Secretary Glickman prioritized improved food safety as one of USDA's goals, leading to the establishment of the Office of the Under Secretary for Food Safety in 1995. The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is responsible for inspecting meat, poultry, and egg products to ensure safety and proper labeling. They are implementing a new system called hazard analysis critical control point (HACCP) to reduce pathogens in products. However, there are concerns about FSIS's ability to enforce these new procedures while meeting traditional inspection obligations due to budget constraints. The Administration has proposed increasing user fees for meat packing industry to cover federal meat, poultry, and egg inspection costs, but Congress rejected the proposal. The FY1999 appropriation for FSIS is $617.0 million, with user fees for overtime inspection services remaining at about $86 million. This brings the total program level to $704 million, a 4% increase from FY1998. The FY1999 appropriation for FSIS is $675 million, with an $8 million increase allocated to Food Safety Initiative activities. Congress provided separate funding for the Office of the Under Secretary for Food Safety. They also directed the Secretary to report on lifting the ban on interstate shipment of state inspected meat by March 1, 1999. Additionally, a Senate provision for country-of-origin labeling on beef and lamb imports was rejected, but a study on its potential effects was required. The explanatory statement attached to P.L. 105-277 directs FSIS to redo a report on the potential merits of a mandatory inspection program for ratite meat. USDA's marketing and regulatory programs aim to facilitate domestic and international marketing of agricultural products while ensuring animal and plant health. The USDA's marketing and regulatory programs benefit consumers and American agriculture. P.L. 105-277 allocates $521.3 million for these agencies' programs, with an additional $195.3 million from user fees. The total program level in FY1998 was $708.6 million, with $195 million from user fees. The Administration's FY1999 budget proposed a program level of $712.7 million, with $207 million from user fees. P.L. 105-277 provides $61.0 million in appropriations to AMS, authorizing the collection of $64.7 million in user fees for a total FY1999 program level of $124.7 million. The Senate measure, S. 2159, would have provided $57.8 million in budget authority to AMS and authorized the collection of $63.5 million in user fees. The House-passed bill allocated virtually level funding for FY1999 and adopted the Administration's request to allow $64.7 million to be collected in user fees. P.L. 105-277 adopts a Senate provision that makes it illegal to grade and repack eggs in USDA-stamped cartons if they have already been in commerce without going through the USDA voluntary egg grading program. The language requires USDA and FDA to report to Congress on efforts to improve egg safety. P.L. 105-277 provides $425.8 million for APHIS programs in FY1999. Conferees directed USDA to publish rules on compensating Arizona wheat producers for losses due to karnal bunt disease. The budget request for FY1999 included a decrease in funding for APHIS programs and proposed new user fees to cover costs for various programs. A floor amendment to reduce funding for APHIS's livestock predator control operations was adopted but later voted down. Members were concerned about the potential impact on Wildlife Services spending. The amendment to reduce Wildlife Services spending by $21 million was defeated, maintaining funding at $28.7 million for operations and $10.3 million for research. P.L. 105-277 allocated $28.8 million for predator control operations and $10.4 million for research, with additional funds for specific purposes such as preventing brown treesnakes in Hawaii and trap testing. P.L.105-277 provides $26.8 million for Grain Inspection, Packers, and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA), with a total program level of $69.3 million including user fees. The House-passed measure allocated $27.5 million for GIPSA, slightly higher than the current appropriation. The budget request included additional user fees for grain inspection activities and Packers and Stockyards Act administration. A provision in P.L.105-277 mandates a 12-month pilot investigation for large buyers, sellers, or marketers of cattle and sheep to report prices to the Secretary of Agriculture. USDA rural development programs aim to enhance rural life by providing housing, job opportunities, and improved access to essential services. Funds and technical assistance are provided by USDA rural development services such as Rural Housing Service, Rural Business-Cooperative Service, and Rural Utilities Service. These funds benefit states, local governments, rural businesses, cooperatives, and nonprofit organizations. The amount appropriated for rural development activities totals $2.175 billion for assistance to various entities. This includes $657 million in grants and $1.5 billion in loan subsidies, salaries, and expenses. The President's FY1999 budget proposed $2.220 billion for rural development programs, supporting $5.797 billion in loan authority. The Rural Community Advancement Program (RCAP) was authorized in 1996 to provide rural development assistance through three funding streams for community facilities, utilities, and business development. State development officers can transfer up to 25% of the program's budget authority among the three accounts, with a limit of 10% nationally. The FY1999 appropriations act allocated $722.7 million for RCAP activities, $22.5 million less than recommended by the House. The FY1999 appropriations act allocated $722.7 million for loan and grant activities, with a significant portion going towards water and waste disposal projects to support the President's Water 2000 Initiative. Additionally, the act includes provisions for transferring funds to the Lower Mississippi Delta Region for development activities. The Department allocated $26 million for projects in the Lower Mississippi Delta region, with specific consideration given to various locations.
