    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Foreign Adopted Children Equality Act\" or the \"FACE Act.\" It provides citizenship for children adopted from outside the United States. The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to allow children adopted from outside the United States by a U.S. citizen parent to automatically become citizens if certain conditions are met, including the child being under 18 years of age and the adopting parent being eligible and suitable. Prior to adoption, the child must be an unmarried individual under 18 years of age whose biological parents or legal custodian have given written consent for termination of their legal relationship, emigration, and adoption without inducement of payment. The child must be under 18 years old and have consent from biological parents or legal custodian for adoption without payment inducement. The adoptive parents must be unable to provide proper care, have relinquished the child voluntarily, or the child has been abandoned as determined by the competent authority. The child must be under 18 years old and have consent from biological parents or legal custodian for adoption without payment inducement. The child must have been abandoned, deserted, orphaned, or have parents who have died or disappeared. The Secretary of State must ensure proper care will be provided and that the adoption is to form a genuine parent-child relationship. The child must have a bona fide parent-child relationship, and the biological parents' rights must be terminated. The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, may consider pending immigrant status petitions for the biological parents. No inducements should have been offered to obtain the child. An individual can become a citizen of the United States without consent before birth if deemed not a security risk. They will be considered a citizen from birth and issued a Consular Report of Birth. Adoptees over 18 can also be granted citizenship under certain conditions. An individual over 18, born outside the US and adopted by a US citizen before turning 18, can become a US citizen by filing an application within the US or at a US Embassy. An individual who becomes a US citizen through adoption may not be liable for taxes owed to the US before becoming a citizen. The heading of section 320 of the Immigration and Nationality Act is amended. Section 301 of the Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to include a new provision (i) regarding citizenship acquired at birth through section 320(b). The table of contents is updated to reflect this change. SEC. 3. Nonimmigrant status for children brought to the United States to be adopted. Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to include a new category (W) for individuals brought to the US as children to be adopted by a US citizen. \n\nSEC. 4. Appeal of notice of intent to deny an adoption. The Secretary of State must provide a notice of intent to deny adoption and an opportunity to appeal for a covered individual who does not meet adoption conditions. Covered individuals are under 18, born in a foreign country, and seeking adoption by a US citizen. Conditions for Adoption are met if the biological parents or legal custodian have given written consent to terminate the legal relationship, emigrate, and adopt the individual. If they are unable to provide proper care, as determined by the competent authority in the individual's country of residence. The covered individual can be adopted if they have been abandoned, orphaned, or voluntarily relinquished by their biological parents or legal guardian in their country of residence. SEC. 5. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION. This Act and any amendments made by it shall not affect the citizenship rights of adoptees or their birth history. SEC. 6. SENSE OF CONGRESS. Foreign countries should provide documentation of adopted children's original birth history to adoptive families."
