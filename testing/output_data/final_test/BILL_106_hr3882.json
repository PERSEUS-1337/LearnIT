The Secretary of the Army will conduct studies and implement ecosystem restoration and protective measures in Puget Sound, Washington, and adjacent waters, including specific areas like watersheds, Admiralty Inlet, Hood Canal, Rosario Strait, and the eastern portion of the Strait of Juan de Fuca using available funds. The Secretary will develop criteria and procedures for reviewing and approving analyses related to ecosystem restoration in Puget Sound, Washington, based on studies and plans conducted by non-Federal interests. The Secretary will also identify project needs and priorities in consultation with relevant authorities. The Secretary will prioritize projects for implementation in Puget Sound watersheds by consulting with public and private entities. Public participation in developing and implementing protective measures will be ensured through advance notice of meetings and opportunities for input and comment. In developing protective measures, the Secretary ensures public input, maintains records, and complies with applicable laws like the National Environmental Policy Act. Cost sharing for feasibility studies involves non-Federal interests sharing project costs. The non-Federal share of protective measures cost is 35%, but can be 25% if eligible under a specific act. In-kind contributions can cover up to 80% of the non-Federal share. The Federal share for a single protective measure is capped at $5,000,000. Authorization of Appropriations: Up to $125,000,000 is authorized for the Federal share of carrying out protective measures, with waivers for tribal cost-sharing up to $200,000. Operation and maintenance of protective measures are the responsibility of non-Federal entities."
