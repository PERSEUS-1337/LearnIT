    "content": "The Census Bureau released the first figures from the 2010 Census on December 21, 2010, resulting in a shift of 12 seats among 18 states for the 113th Congress. States like Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania lost seats, while states like Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, South Carolina, Utah, and Washington gained seats. The reapportionment of House seats in 2010 was based on an apportionment population that included foreign-based, overseas military, and federal employees and their dependents. The 2010 Census included foreign-based military and federal employees in the count, resulting in a shift of 12 seats among 18 states for the 113th Congress. The apportionment process for the House involves a \"priority list\" to assign seats to states based on population. The list determines the allocation of the 435 seats in the House. The apportionment process for the House involves assigning seats based on population, with the 435-seat limit set in 1929. States that lost seats in the 113th Congress had limited options to retain them, such as urging Congress to increase the House size. Changing the apportionment formula or components may only impact a few states if the House remains at 435 seats. Altering the House size would require a new law as per Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution. The Constitution establishes a minimum and maximum House size. In 2013, a House size of 468 would be needed to prevent states from losing seats. Apportionment figures include total resident population, military and overseas federal employees, and the apportionment population. California's delegation size would increase to 56 seats at a House size of 468. The Census Bureau provides small-area population totals to states for redistricting purposes, known as the P.L. 94-171 program data from the 2010 Census. This data includes limited information like age, race, and Hispanic origin, but not income or employment status. The P.L. 94-171 program provides Census data for redistricting purposes, including information on age, race, and Hispanic origin. States can request data for small geographic areas with populations as low as 20,000 people, allowing for analysis of voting behavior when redrawing congressional and state legislative districts. This data is used by state legislatures, with the governor's approval, to redraw congressional districts in most states. In seven states, a non-partisan or bi-partisan commission is responsible for drawing and approving congressional districting plans. While many states have standards for redistricting, federal law ultimately controls the process with no explicit federal statutory standards. The Supreme Court decisions play a significant role in redistricting. The Supreme Court decisions mandate one person, one vote and the Voting Rights Act applies to redistricting. The Court's rulings require population deviations among districts to be justified, with deviations allowed if districts are made more compact, respect municipal boundaries, preserve prior district cores, or avoid incumbent contests. The Voting Rights Act prohibits discriminatory voting practices nationwide. The Voting Rights Act prohibits discriminatory voting practices, including the denial of voting rights based on race or color. The Supreme Court has established principles for redistricting, allowing race to be considered to address past discrimination but requiring a compelling state interest to create majority-minority districts. Strict scrutiny is applied to determine if such plans are narrowly tailored to achieve the state interest."
