    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2007\" and treats the District of Columbia as a congressional district. The District of Columbia is considered a Congressional district for representation in the House of Representatives, with limitations on the number of Members it can receive under reapportionment. The District of Columbia is limited in the number of Members it can receive under reapportionment, with clarification on the determination of presidential electors based on the 23rd amendment. SEC. 3. INCREASE IN MEMBERSHIP OF HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. The House of Representatives will have 437 members starting from the One Hundred Tenth Congress. The reapportionment of members resulting from this increase will be based on the new number of representatives established for the One Hundred Tenth Congress. The President must transmit a revised statement of apportionment to Congress within 30 days of the enactment of the Act. The Clerk must report on the revised statement within 15 days of receiving it. During the One Hundred Tenth Congress, the One Hundred Eleventh Congress, and the One Hundred Twelfth Congress, the Clerk of the House of Representatives will send a certificate to each State with the number of Representatives entitled to them. Additionally, a report will be submitted to the Speaker of the House identifying the State entitled to an additional Representative. In the Act for the relief of Doctor Ricardo Vallejo Samala and congressional redistricting, an additional Representative for a State will be elected at large, while other Representatives will be elected based on Congressional districts. SEC. 4 of the Act states that if any provision of the Act is declared invalid, the remaining provisions will also be deemed invalid. SEC. 5 adjusts estimated tax payment safe harbor for individual taxpayers with adjusted gross income over $5 million. SEC. 5 amends section 6654(d)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code for individuals with adjusted gross income over $5 million, adjusting the safe harbor for estimated tax payments. The amendments made by this section will apply to taxable years starting after the enactment of this Act, with a substitution of $2,500,000 for $5,000,000 in clause (ii). The House of Representatives passed the bill on April 19, 2007."
