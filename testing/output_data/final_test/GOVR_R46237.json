It is used for House apportionment and redistricting, as well as determining federal funding allocations. The U.S. decennial census is crucial for determining federal funding allocations and House apportionment. The Census Bureau collects data used by various entities, including businesses and governments. Census activities began in January 2020, with in-person visits to nonrespondents starting in May. Official numbers for House apportionment must be provided to the President by December 31, 2020. The Census Bureau is required by law to provide the final population counts to the President by December 31, 2020. States requesting data for various areas must receive it by March 31, 2021. The data will include information on voting age, race, ethnicity, occupancy status, and group quarters. Census products will continue to be rolled out until 2023. Research has been conducted to engage hard-to-count populations for the 2020 Census. The Census Bureau conducted a survey in 2018 with 50,000 households to gather information on census participation. Approximately 17,500 people responded, and the data was weighted to be representative of all U.S. householders aged 18 and older. The survey focused on differences in responses across various demographics. Qualitative information from 42 focus groups supplemented the survey results, helping to understand the attitudes of hard-to-reach groups. The main barrier to 2020 census participation identified was a lack of understanding. The survey and focus groups found that a lack of understanding of the census purpose and process led to negative attitudes, including apathy and distrust of government. Certain demographics, such as low education levels and minority groups, showed low intent to respond to the 2020 census. However, common motivators for participation included funding for public services like hospitals and schools. Respondents in focus groups may better understand the importance of the census. The Census Bureau used information from focus groups to inform its $500 million communications strategy, developed with VMLY&R, a multicultural advertising agency. The strategy includes an advertising campaign in 13 languages and online questionnaires in the same languages. Paid advertising is scheduled to begin in January 2020. The Census Bureau's paid advertising campaign, starting in January 2020, will run across various platforms like print, digital, TV, radio, billboards, transit stations, grocery stores, and movie theaters. The campaign budget allocates 39.0% for television and 29.1% for digital media, aiming to reach 99% of households, especially multicultural and hard-to-count populations. The Community Partnership Engagement Program involves tribal, state, and local governments, community-based organizations, faith-based organizations, schools, media, businesses, social services, and ethnic organizations. The National Partnership Program and community partnership efforts aim to maximize census participation by forming Complete Count Committees (CCCs) in various regions. CCCs consist of government and community leaders from different sectors to raise census awareness and encourage cooperation based on local knowledge. The Census Bureau is forming Complete Count Committees (CCCs) to identify budget resources and establish local work plans for implementation in 2020. They have provided a guide for forming CCCs and a list of existing committees. The Statistics in Schools program promotes statistical literacy for students and emphasizes the importance of counting all children in households, including babies and children under age five. The Census Bureau has developed the Response Outreach Area Mapper (ROAM) to identify hard-to-count areas and provide demographic profiles. ROAM helps create tailored communication campaigns and hiring practices for the census. In March 2020, 95% of U.S. households will receive invitations to respond online. The Census Bureau will send invitations to households to respond online. Some households will receive reminders and paper questionnaires. Census workers will deliver invitations to certain households, and some will be enumerated in person, especially in remote areas. The census form asks for basic information about the number of people in the household and the housing situation. The Census Bureau collects information such as household ownership status, contact details, names and relationships of household members, demographics like age, sex, ethnicity, and race. They do not ask for sensitive information like Social Security numbers or financial details. A MENA category was not included in the 2018 census form. The inclusion of a MENA category in the 2015 National Content Test helped MENA respondents report their identities accurately. Feedback from the MENA population suggested that MENA should be treated as an ethnicity, not a race. The Census Bureau's current standards designate people of MENA background as \"White.\" The 2020 census will not include detailed questions on race and ethnicity. The 2020 census will only collect basic data on citizenship status, with a question asking if the person is a citizen of the United States. The form includes checkboxes for different citizenship statuses, such as born in the US, born abroad to US citizen parents, naturalized citizen, or not a US citizen. The Department of Justice argued that the census is not a survey. The Department of Justice argued that the census, not a survey like the ACS, is the best way to collect citizenship data critical for enforcing voting rights laws. Opponents feared the citizenship question could deter immigrants from participating in the census or lead to false information. Census Bureau fieldworkers noted concerns about data confidentiality and reluctance to answer citizenship questions among foreign-born respondents. Multiple lawsuits were filed against the late introduction of the citizenship question for the 2020 census. Multiple lawsuits were filed to block the citizenship question from being added to the 2020 census. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that while the question did not violate certain laws, Secretary Ross's decision to add it was found to violate the Administrative Procedure Act. The ruling made it impossible to include a citizenship question on the 2020 census. An executive order directed all departments to assist in determining the number of citizens and non-citizens. A lawsuit was filed to block implementation of the order, with the outcome pending. The American Community Survey (ACS) is often confused with the decennial census. In the past, the census included a short form for all residents and a long form for a representative sample, which was discontinued in 2000. The ACS, launched in 2005, collects data monthly from a small sample of the population. The American Community Survey (ACS) collects data monthly from a sample of the population, producing one-year and five-year estimates. In 2020, the census can be completed online, but it is not mandatory. The online option is emphasized for its convenience and cost-effectiveness. The 2020 census can be completed online to control costs, but paper questionnaires and telephone responses are also available. The questionnaire will be in 12 non-English languages, with assistance provided in those languages as well. Field materials will be in Spanish, with bilingual options and language guides in 59 non-English languages. The 2020 census offers language guides in 59 non-English languages, including video and print formats. It is illegal to refuse or neglect to answer census questions as specified in Title 13, U.S. Code, Section 141. The penalties for providing false information in the census are outlined in Title 18, U.S. Code. Individuals who provide false answers can be fined up to $500, while those who refuse to disclose religious beliefs or membership in a religious body are protected. The possible penalties for refusing to answer the census or providing false information are fines of up to $5,000 each. The Census Bureau conducted limited tests in 2018 and 2019 as preparation for the 2020 census, including address canvassing in specific areas. The Census Bureau conducted tests in 2018 and 2019 to prepare for the 2020 census, including a citizenship question test in Providence County, Rhode Island. The bureau selected a sample of 480,000 housing unit addresses for the test. Respondents' cooperation was helpful, but participation in the test does not replace the obligation to answer the 2020 census questions for an accurate population count. The Census Bureau prepares for the 2020 census by updating the Master Address File with accurate living quarters data. New software helps identify changes in housing developments since 2010, improving the bureau's ability to contact the public and conduct a successful census. The Census Bureau used satellite imagery to verify addresses for the 2020 census, recruiting 32,000 temporary workers to cover 1.1 million census blocks. The field operation began in August 2019 and ended in October 2019, with plans to hire up to 500,000 temporary workers for the nonresponse follow-up operation starting in May 2020. The Census Bureau is recruiting temporary workers for the 2020 census, especially in remote areas where visits from census-takers may be necessary. Recent high school graduates, veterans, retirees, military spouses, seasonal workers, and bilingual individuals are encouraged to apply. Applicants must be at least 18 years old, U.S. citizens, proficient in English, have a valid email address, and provide their Social Security number. Paid training will occur in March and April for positions in the spring of 2020. Applicants for census jobs must complete an application with their Social Security number and assessment answers. Background questionnaires may be required for some positions. Fingerprinting is mandatory, with pay rates ranging from $13.50 to $30.00 per hour. Workers will receive paid training, weekly pay, and flexible hours. Veterans may receive preference in hiring, and there is no age limit for census employment. Field workers must have an ID badge with a photo, expiration date, and Department of Commerce watermark for verification. The Census Bureau ensures data confidentiality and cybersecurity, with legal protections in place. Respondents must provide data as per Title 13, U.S. Code, with measures to maintain confidentiality. Contact regional census centers for verification of identification with a Department of Commerce watermark. The Census Bureau protects data confidentiality and cybersecurity with legal safeguards. Information provided under specific titles must only be used for statistical purposes and not disclosed in a way that identifies individuals or establishments. Census reports retained by individuals or establishments are immune from legal proceedings without consent. Title 13, Section 214 prohibits the wrongful disclosure of information obtained by Census Bureau employees, with penalties of up to $5,000 in fines or 5 years imprisonment. This is in line with the Bureau's commitment to data confidentiality and cybersecurity, ensuring that information provided for statistical purposes remains protected. The Census Bureau's operational plan includes cybersecurity measures to protect IT systems from data breaches and attacks. Director Steven Dillingham highlighted these efforts at a congressional hearing for the 2020 census, emphasizing the importance of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. Penalties for disclosing prohibited information include fines up to $250,000 or imprisonment for less than five years. Director Steven Dillingham outlined the Census Bureau's robust cybersecurity measures for the 2020 census, including data encryption at all stages, secure enumeration devices, continuous monitoring, and immediate response to threats. Collaboration with government agencies and industry experts enhances threat intelligence sharing for proactive protection of data. The Census Bureau collaborates with government agencies and industry experts to protect data by identifying threats early and integrating security into systems design. Systems undergo independent cybersecurity assessments before deployment, with ongoing testing for vulnerabilities. Security staff monitor systems for vulnerabilities using industry-leading tools and quickly respond to any identified issues. The Government Accountability Office noted delays in the bureau's progress toward cybersecurity for 2020. The Census Bureau has established a risk management framework for cybersecurity for the 2020 Census. As of May 2019, there were over 330 corrective actions needed, with 217 considered high-risk. However, 104 corrective actions were delayed, with 74 delayed by 60 or more days due to technical challenges or resource constraints. The Government Accountability Office recommended that corrective actions for cybersecurity weaknesses be implemented within prescribed time frames. The Census Bureau received 42 recommendations from DHS to improve cybersecurity. GAO recommended implementing a formal process for tracking corrective actions. Commerce Department IG identified challenges in the bureau's cloud-based systems, with the bureau agreeing to all recommendations and taking actions to address them. The Census Bureau established a trust and safety team to combat misinformation and disinformation about the census, comprising communications and social media experts. The team coordinates efforts with external technology platforms and cybersecurity officials, monitoring all channels for false information. The Census Bureau has launched a \"Fighting 2020 Census Rumors\" page on its website and Facebook announced new rules to remove misleading posts about the census. Other tech giants like Google and Twitter have also collaborated with government officials on this issue. Google and Twitter, along with other tech giants, have worked with government officials to combat census disinformation. Google has banned ads and YouTube videos spreading misinformation about the 2020 count, while Twitter's rules prohibit misleading information about civic events, potentially including the census."
