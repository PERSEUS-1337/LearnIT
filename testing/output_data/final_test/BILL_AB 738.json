    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 102025 of the Public Utilities Code defines \"member entity\" as a city or county within the district boundaries. Section 102052.5 is repealed and replaced with a new definition in the Public Utilities Code. The boundaries of the district include the City of Sacramento, the City of Rancho Cordova, certain unincorporated areas of Sacramento County within the urban service area, cities or counties that have annexed to the district, and cities incorporated after January 1, 2016, that were previously part of the district. The boundaries of the district are not affected by the incorporation or annexation of territory within or outside the district, except as specified. When territory outside the district is annexed to a city within the district, it becomes part of the district. If a new city is incorporated after January 1, 2016, and is partly within and partly outside the district, the entire territory is deemed incorporated into the district. If territory within the district is annexed to a non-member city, it remains part of the district unless there is no transit service operated or planned by the district in that area within five years of annexation. In such cases, detachment may be considered if the annexing city would better serve the area, as determined by the Sacramento County Local Agency Formation Commission. Whenever territory is incorporated into the district, it will be subject to taxation based on property valuation for district purposes and any incurred debts. The district can operate within any city but cannot levy property tax in cities outside its boundaries. The district can operate within any city but cannot levy property tax in cities outside its boundaries. Any city or county listed in Section 102051 may be annexed to the district in the manner provided in this section. The legislative body of the city or county proposed for annexation must agree with the board of directors on terms such as special taxes, rates, and property transfers to the district. This agreement is outlined in Section 102056 of the Public Utilities Code. Section 102056 of the Public Utilities Code allows for the detachment of territory from a district with a supermajority vote of the board of directors and a majority vote of the governing body of the territory. The detached territory remains liable for existing bonded indebtedness and other financial obligations until resolved by mutual agreement. The detachment becomes effective upon giving notice as required by the Government Code.
