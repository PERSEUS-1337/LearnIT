    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Families and Communities Involved in Improving Our Schools Act\". It focuses on family and community engagement in school improvement grants. Section 1003(g) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include requirements for family and community engagement activities by local educational agencies receiving assistance under this subsection. This includes providing accessible notice to families and community members regarding school funding. The amended Section 1003(g) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 requires schools to implement intervention models and engage families and community members in the selection and implementation process. This includes partnering with families and providing them with notice of the selected intervention model. The amended Section 1003(g) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 mandates schools to implement intervention models and involve families and communities in the selection and implementation process. This includes partnering with families, involving them in the transition to the new model, and developing an engagement plan for ongoing school improvement efforts. The engagement plan involves evaluating the effectiveness of family and community engagement in improving student achievement, disseminating evaluation data to families and community members, and revising strategies that are not effective. Guidance on research-based family engagement is provided to properly engage families. The Secretary will issue regulations detailing research-based family and community engagement strategies for schools to use in school improvement efforts. Community engagement involves collaboration among families, community members, and school officials to improve student outcomes. The term 'family engagement' refers to the shared responsibility of families and schools for student success, involving schools and community organizations reaching out to engage families in ways that support their children's learning and development. This shared responsibility is continuous from birth. The shared responsibility for student success involves families, schools, and community organizations working together from birth through young adulthood to reinforce learning."
