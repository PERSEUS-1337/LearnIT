    "content": "Public safety agencies, including first responders and 911 call centers, rely on wireless technology for effective communication. Interoperability, the ability for different systems to connect, is a key concern for public safety officials. Interoperability is a key concern for public safety agencies, who often rely on vendors for technical expertise. Implementing a national plan that encourages resource-sharing and standardized interfaces, while promoting open source architecture, could help bypass vendor-driven limitations. Goals for interoperability could include interchangeability of equipment from any agency, state, or community to replace or supplement equipment as needed. Achieving interoperability has been a policy concern since the communication failures on September 11, 2001. Communications failures worsened by Hurricane Katrina highlighted the need for interoperability in public safety communications. Congress has yet to act on legislation addressing this issue. Rushed replacements for lost equipment lacked cross-communication capabilities. Interoperability is seen as a crucial solution, providing redundancy and backup capacity for a robust network. Some suggest the current definition of interoperability may be inadequate. Experts suggest that the current definition of interoperability may be too general, emphasizing the need for national planning to guide policy. This planning should aim to establish common interfaces and uniform standards for full interoperability, potentially transitioning public safety communications to open source platforms. Standardized interfaces could bridge existing non-standard systems, requiring federal mandates for interoperability. Federal mandates for interoperable standards from companies like M/A Com, Motorola, and Raytheon are necessary for open architecture standards to ensure full interoperability and equipment interchangeability. The federalization of emergency response may be inevitable without adequate state and community resources. Weaknesses in current disaster response plans were exposed after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, highlighting the need for improved planning and resources. Two critical infrastructure failures early on were electrical power and communications. A well-planned emergency communications system should be sustainable even after power loss, with resources like back-up generators, redundant systems, and proper equipment. Industry plans for disasters and carries them out as needed, but similar planning and capacity are needed for emergency communications. Since 9/11, Congress has passed legislation to improve emergency communications for public safety services. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 addresses issues in emergency preparedness and response, including technology for interoperability for first responders. Recommendations from the 9/11 Commission led to improvements in communications capacity. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-458) includes sections on improving communications capacity, with Congress assigning oversight tasks for emergency communications interoperability. Congress has recognized and supported programs for interoperability that benefit local communities, states, and tribes, but more progress is needed. Issues could be addressed by Congress, the Administration, the private sector, or others. The need for a long term strategy to coordinate public safety spectrum and interoperable communications, along with the importance of federal government participation in a national solution for interoperability, are key issues that could be addressed by Congress, the Administration, or the private sector. Recommendations from studies could inform policy for public safety, but achieving comprehensive solutions for interoperability outside of federal government communications remains challenging. Congress may consider extending its oversight role in this area. The need for federal participation in a national strategy for emergency communications and data networks is highlighted in proposed legislation, with higher standards for performance from agencies like the Department of Homeland Security. Congressional reports on disaster planning and response, including Hurricane Katrina, emphasize the gap between intentions and execution. FEMA's responsibilities for emergency communications planning were reduced after being absorbed by DHS. The leadership role for national strategy on communications interoperability was assigned to the Office of Interoperability and Compatibility within DHS, primarily with the SAFECOM program. SAFECOM became the lead agency for communications interoperability, strengthened by organizational changes and ratified by Congress. Authority for emergency communications shifted to a new Administrator within FEMA with the passage of the 21st Century Emergency Communications Act of 2006. The 9/11 Commission proposed using a signal corps solution to improve communications capacity for public safety. Experts suggest upgrading emergency communications equipment to resemble the capabilities of the Army Signal Corps for better coordination in disaster situations. Inadequate radio frequencies hindered communication among search and rescue teams in New Orleans, impacting relief efforts. The military's superior communications resources improved rescue efforts during disasters. There is a growing consideration of giving the military a greater role in emergency response within the United States due to their advanced technology. Inadequate technology, not people, was often the cause of failures in emergency communications during disasters. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 requires the FCC to allocate 24 MHz of spectrum at 700 MHz to public safety, urging Congress to release spectrum for interoperable networks. The Deficit Reduction Act plans for spectrum release by February 18, 2009, creating a fund from auction proceeds to reduce the budget deficit. The Deficit Reduction Act of 1997 allocates funds from spectrum auctions to reduce the budget deficit and establish a grant program for public safety agencies. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) administers the fund and disbursements, with a requirement for spectrum release by February 2009. States would benefit from completed plans for using 700 MHz spectrum. The NTIA can borrow funds for communications interoperability grants, with a projected $100 million for the grants program in FY2007. The Budget Office projects funding for the grants program to be $100 million in FY2007, $370 million in 2008, $310 million in 2009, and $220 million in 2010. Grants are for interoperability programs using 700 MHz communications systems. H.R. 5252 includes details on fund dispersal for interoperable communications and 911. The 109th Congress passed a bill requiring at least $1 billion for the grants program by September 30, 2007. The 9/11 Commission analyzed communication issues on September 11, 2001. The 9/11 Commission recommended that Congress support legislation for expedited assignment of radio spectrum for public safety, especially in high-risk urban areas like New York City and Washington, D.C. It also suggested establishing signal corps units to ensure communication connectivity between civilian authorities, first responders, and the National Guard, with federal funding being a priority. The Commission emphasized the importance of access to spectrum for effective communication technology. The fragmentation of spectrum assignments for public safety is a significant barrier to achieving needed capacity for the future. UHF and VHF frequencies cannot connect directly with each other, and older analog equipment below 512 MHz cannot connect with newer digital equipment at 800 MHz. This poses immediate barriers to interoperability in public safety communications. New frequencies at 4.9 GHz are in early development stages, suitable for short-range transmission. Spectrum at 700 MHz is seen as the optimal solution for broadband communications, overcoming compatibility issues. Congress set a deadline for releasing 700 MHz spectrum for public safety by February 2009. A study is being conducted on spectrum needs for public safety, including the potential increase of spectrum at 700 MHz. Public safety officials advocate for additional spectrum for high-speed data transmission. Currently, there are no specific allocations for federal use at 700 MHz. Many experts believe the 700 MHz range is too narrow for full broadband, leading to calls for additional spectrum allocation for federal users and newer wireless technologies. The Spectrum Coalition for Public Safety proposes allocating more spectrum at 700 MHz for state and local first responders, critical infrastructure industries, and federal public safety agencies. The FCC is considering making additional spectrum available for public safety, with overwhelming support from the public safety community. The FCC is considering allocating more spectrum at 700 MHz for public safety broadband services. They are looking into modifying the current band plan to accommodate broadband applications and have issued a request for comment on a new band plan for first responders within the 24 MHz designated for public safety. The FCC received over 1,000 responses by December 2006 regarding the possible adaptation of a wireless broadband standard for interoperability. One petition from Cyren Call Communications Corporation requested the reallocation of 30 MHz for a \"Public Safety Broadband Trust,\" which was denied by the FCC. Other proposals for joint operations were also submitted. Verizon Wireless proposed building a broadband network for public safety on half of the 24 MHz spectrum, with the other half used for mixed purposes. The FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to transfer management of the spectrum to a not-for-profit group for public safety support. The FCC is proposing a plan to allocate 12 MHz of spectrum from the 700 MHz band for a nationwide, interoperable broadband public safety network. This spectrum would be assigned to a single licensee for state and local public safety use, with priority access when needed. The licensee would also be able to operate commercially on the remaining 12 MHz of spectrum. The FCC proposes allocating 12 MHz of spectrum for a nationwide public safety broadband network. The licensee would provide public safety broadband access on a fee for service basis and allow commercial operators access. The FCC outlines performance requirements for interoperability, build-out, and system robustness. The licensee must be not-for-profit, experienced in public safety frequency coordination, and represent all public safety interests. Responsibilities include designing, implementing, and maintaining the national network. The FCC proposes allocating 12 MHz of spectrum for a nationwide public safety broadband network, allowing the licensee to charge fees for services to public safety and commercial users. The FCC also seeks comments on secondary operations by commercial users on the remaining spectrum assigned for public safety use. The proposal includes sharing spectrum and access to networks with commercial operations. The FCC is proposing to share spectrum by halving public safety's exclusive spectrum allotment from 24MHz to 12MHz in the 700 MHz band. Alternative solutions for spectrum sharing could involve relocation to other bands or designating other 700 MHz frequencies for shared use. Commissioner John F. Lehman highlighted the lack of connectivity for first responders and suggested that the Department of Defense should provide support, specifically mentioning the Army Signal Corps. The Signal Corps provides information systems and networks for command and control, offering specialized support to military operations globally. Their mission is to manage communications and information systems for combined arms forces, including network operations and electromagnetic spectrum management. Signal forces handle all aspects of designing, installing, and maintaining information networks for voice and data communications. The Army Signal Corps plans, installs, and maintains voice and data communication networks using various systems. They integrate tactical, strategic, and base communications into a global network supporting Army operations. The Corps provides a communication backbone with spectrum management and support for regional and local wireless interoperability. SAFECOM, responsible for coordinating federal networks and supporting interoperability, is an e-government initiative supported by the Administration and Congress. Programs focus on administrative issues and testing equipment standards but lack a standardized approach for state public safety networks. An Integrated Wireless Network (IWN) for law enforcement is being planned as a joint program by the Departments of Justice, the Treasury, and Homeland Security. IWN aims to integrate the nation's law enforcement wireless communication and data exchange capability through a secure network. Parameters of the program will be determined by the final choice of vendor or vendors and network solutions proposed, including equipment, technologies, standards, and spectrum use. Specific requirements include open standards like Project 25 and the use of VHF frequencies. The Integrated Wireless Network (IWN) for law enforcement aims to integrate wireless communication and data exchange capabilities through a secure network. General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin have been selected to advance to Phase II of the program, with the government expected to choose one as the systems integrator. The objectives for coverage include major metropolitan areas, highways, border areas, and ports of entry, with an estimated cost of $10 billion. Funding is provided jointly from budgeted sums. The reported estimated cost for IWN is $10 billion, funded jointly from budgeted sums for upgrading communications equipment. The network aims to serve law enforcement users within three departments but could potentially set a national interoperability template. IWN's deployment could be seen as either half empty or half full in achieving interoperability for first responders. Positive contributions include standardized network architecture, improved homeland security communication coordination, and significant enhancements in public safety communications. The proposed IWN project aims to improve interoperability among key components of homeland security and enhance communications technology. Questions arise regarding its impact on nationwide interoperability goals, such as potential delays in standards development and the extension of interfaces to other emergency response personnel. Additionally, there are considerations about linking federal networks with IWN to provide connectivity at the state and local levels. The IWN project aims to improve interoperability among homeland security components and enhance communication technology. Questions remain about its impact on nationwide interoperability goals and linking federal networks with state and local responders. Congress has raised the bar for performance and accountability in communication programs. The Department of Homeland Security and the FCC are tasked with developing a national approach for achieving interoperability, coordinating with other federal agencies, establishing minimum capabilities, accelerating standards development, encouraging open architecture, assisting with research and development, prioritizing programs, providing guidance for grant programs, offering technical assistance, disseminating best practices, and establishing performance measurements. These provisions were included in the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act for 2007. The provisions from S. 3595 and H.R. 5351 were incorporated into S.Amdt. 4560, which was agreed upon through compromise. The National Emergency Reform and Enhancement Act (H.R. 5351) was passed by the House on July 25, 2006, and signed into law as P.L. 109-295 on October 4, 2006. The sections on emergency communications in P.L. 109-295 add language to improve emergency communications in the Homeland Security Act, building on provisions from the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act (P.L. 108-458). The new Administrator appointed by the Secretary for Homeland Security is responsible for developing a national program and plan for emergency communications. The new Administrator, appointed by the Secretary for Homeland Security, is responsible for various tasks including conducting outreach programs, coordinating regional working groups, establishing non-proprietary standards for interoperability, and developing a National Communications Plan. The amendment specifies required elements of the National Emergency Communications Plan and evaluates the feasibility of developing a mobile communications capability modeled on the Army Signal Corps. The amendment specifies rules for emergency communication grants, establishes a Regional Emergency Communications Coordination Working Group, and mandates the creation of an Emergency Communications Preparedness Center. It also clarifies the responsibilities of the Office of Interoperability and Compatibility, requires a comprehensive research and development program, and addresses the viability of 911 networks. Grants from federal sources, including the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security, fund programs for interoperability. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act allows for multi-year commitments up to $150 million for interoperable communications. Annual sums are authorized for five years to improve interoperability in high-risk urban areas. The 2005 authorization for high-risk urban areas is $22,105,000, increasing to $24,879,000 by 2009. Congress created special funds to hold spectrum auction proceeds for special purposes, with the balance going towards reducing the budget deficit. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 establishes the Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Fund to disburse auction proceeds for various programs, including coupons for TV set top boxes and grants. The Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Fund includes grants for public safety agencies, payments for temporary digital transmission equipment in New York, assistance for low-power television stations to convert signals, funding for rural station upgrades, a national alert system, a tsunami warning program, contributions to a national 911 improvement program, and support for the Essential Air program. The Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Fund, established by the ENHANCE 911 Act of 2004, includes up to $30 million for the Essential Air Service Program. Administered by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, funds can be borrowed from the Treasury for digital television transition programs and public safety projects. The Advanced Telecommunications And Opportunity Reform Act designates $1 billion for interoperable communications, including 911 operations, with grant program authority transferred to the Department of Homeland Security. The ongoing debate surrounds public safety communications and federal policy. The ongoing debate surrounds public safety communications and federal policy, with a focus on key components such as coordinated spectrum assignment, development of technical standards, adaptation of new technologies, and long-term research support. President George W. Bush initiated a national Spectrum Policy Initiative in 2003 to support high-speed data, video, and image transmissions, encourage private investment in technology, ensure interoperability among first responders, and coordinate federal, state, and local agencies for effective communication. The national Spectrum Policy Initiative, led by the Secretary of the Department of Commerce, is implementing recommendations from the Federal Government Spectrum Task Force. The NTIA is guiding the planning process with seven projects focusing on various aspects of spectrum policy, including stakeholder participation, international barriers, federal spectrum management, public safety communications, spectrum engineering tools, efficient spectrum use, and long-term planning with market-based mechanisms. Project D specifically addresses public safety needs with two components. Project D, under the national Spectrum Policy Initiative, focuses on public safety needs. It involves conducting an inventory of spectrum requirements for public safety, analyzing spectrum efficiency, and exploring spectrum sharing among commercial, federal, and public safety entities. The FCC is seeking input on goals for a test-bed to designate shared radio frequencies. The lead federal program for interoperability is Project SAFECOM, administered by the Department of Homeland Security. The Department of Homeland Security oversees Project SAFECOM, which is part of the Interoperable Communications Program. Key federal agencies for spectrum management include the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). SAFECOM is part of the Office of Interoperability and Compatibility (OIC) within DHS. Additionally, DHS has announced initiatives such as the Regional Technology Integration Initiative and the National Incident Management System (NIMS) in response to a Presidential Directive. A NIMS Integration Center is planned by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to improve interoperable communications for federal, state, and local law enforcement and incident response entities. The NTIA's interoperability plan, developed with the Interdepartmental Radio Advisory Committee (IRAC), aims to enhance communication during emergencies and threats to public safety. The NTIA also established a public safety program in 1996 to coordinate federal government activities related to spectrum and telecommunications for public safety, now managed by the Public Safety Division of the Office of Spectrum Management. The Public Safety Division of the Office of Spectrum Management is involved in initiatives to improve public safety communications, including a Spectrum Efficiency Study and an Interoperable Communications Summary Guide. The NTIA has sponsored forums on public safety and spectrum use, and the FCC has initiated programs involving state, local, tribal, and private sector representatives to manage spectrum for public safety. The FCC established Regional Planning Committees (RPC) to develop plans for public safety, encouraging broad participation. RPCs have flexibility in meeting state and local needs, including spectrum use and technology. Technical standards, including interoperability, were recommended through the Public Safety National Coordination Committee (NCC). The NCC, active from 1999 to 2003, had a Steering Committee from government, public safety, and telecommunications. The FCC established a panel after Hurricane Katrina to make recommendations for improving public safety operations and network reliability. In response, the FCC created a Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau to promote reliable communications during emergencies. The bureau aims to enhance communications preparedness and response for homeland security. The FCC established the Media Security and Reliability Council (MSRC) and renewed the Network Reliability and Interoperability Council (NRIC) to support homeland security. MSRC evaluates the Emergency Alert System while NRIC focuses on developing best practices for optimal reliability, interoperability, and connectivity of networks, including E911, public safety, and cybersecurity. The FCC's strategic goal for spectrum is to encourage the highest and most efficient use. The FCC's strategic goal for spectrum is to encourage the highest and best use domestically and internationally for innovative communications technologies. The FCC plays a role in promoting interoperability for public safety systems but faces challenges due to disparate governmental interests. The National Response Plan outlines organization charts for authority in homeland security. The National Response Plan outlines authority and responsibility in Incidents of National Significance. The National Communications System (NCS) ensures federal communications and vital network integrity. NCS assists in recovery and restoration of services but not for first responders. The Federal Emergency Communications Coordinator coordinates communications according to the plan. The Office of Interoperability and Compatibility (OIC) within DHS aims to address interoperability issues by leveraging various programs across the Federal Government to reduce duplication and ensure consistency in research, standards, training, and grant funding. OIC will create portfolios to focus on critical issues like communications, equipment, and training, using a systems engineering approach to develop action plans collaboratively with stakeholders. Project SAFECOM, designated as the umbrella organization for federal support of interoperable communications, is part of the Science and Technology Directorate within DHS. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act affirmed DHS's authority to create an office for interoperability within the Science and Technology Directorate and manage SAFECOM. Stakeholder input is expected to produce a strategy and action plan for each portfolio, with no timeline provided yet. SAFECOM released a template for interoperability planning and a methodology to measure achievements. A study with voluntary participation surveyed fire and law enforcement agencies in all states to rate interoperability levels. SAFECOM absorbed the Public Safety Wireless Network Program. SAFECOM, created to improve public safety communications, advocates for spectrum management policies. It represents State and local stakeholders on spectrum issues within the Federal Government. SAFECOM, representing State and local stakeholders, advocates for spectrum management policies within the Federal Government. It was appointed to an interagency Spectrum Task Force and has a working relationship with the FCC. SAFECOM was chosen as a government-to-government initiative in 2001 and has transitioned between different government agencies, currently under the Directorate of Science and Technology at DHS. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has raised concerns about leadership delays at SAFECOM, emphasizing the need for more authority in funding decisions and interoperability efforts. Recommendations include establishing a long-term program with appropriate authority and funding to coordinate interoperability across the federal government. The GAO also noted issues with the fragmented federal grant structure for first responders. The fragmented federal grant structure for first responders hinders statewide interoperability planning. SAFECOM provides guidance but cannot enforce consistency in all grants. The federal government can lead and support the development of a national database of frequencies, common nomenclature, national architecture, and statewide communication plans over 10 to 20 years. SAFECOM aims to adopt a national strategy over 10 to 20 years for effective public safety communications, focusing on improving radio interoperability through equipment standardization and operating protocols. The emphasis is on creating an architectural framework, developing standards, and coordinating federal activities. The SAFECOM architectural framework aims to prioritize standards development for communication interoperability. Decision-making follows a pyramid model, with a focus on short-term milestones rather than long-term goals. The approach involves outside consultants for studies, deviating from the original strategic goals without explanation. SAFECOM Strategy in 2002 and 2003 focused on communication interoperability for public safety agencies at all levels of government. However, many goals have not been met or have been altered. The initiative aimed to address critical communication shortcomings and eliminate redundant infrastructures to improve coordination during emergency events. In 2002, SAFECOM focused on communication interoperability for public safety agencies, aiming to address critical communication shortcomings and eliminate redundant infrastructures. The initiative aimed to improve coordination during emergency events by defining communication requirements for bio-terrorism and natural disasters. This would result in saved lives and cost savings through consolidated, interoperable federal networks. SAFECOM focused on communication interoperability for public safety agencies in 2002, aiming to address critical communication shortcomings for bio-terrorism and natural disasters. The initiative aimed to improve coordination during emergency events by defining communication requirements and developing a long-term architecture. However, many goals have not been met, with emphasis on short-term goals. SAFECOM has made progress in developing communication requirements and a concept of operations for interoperability, with a gap analysis underway. A national architecture and integrated public safety response solution are promised for the future, building on existing infrastructure. SAFECOM is addressing the use of existing infrastructure for interoperable wireless solutions for public safety organizations, but there are challenges in meeting the definition of infrastructure. OMB's long-term goals include coordination of federal interoperability efforts and the elimination of redundant wireless communications infrastructures. The SAFECOM initiative aims to address critical shortcomings in communications interoperability by consolidating networks to save costs and creating a right-sized set of interoperable federal networks linked to state wireless networks. However, there is no information on plans for improving national or regional wireless communications networks. The focus appears to be on hardware solutions at the incident level, potentially excluding plans for network interoperability or establishing standards for new technologies like mesh networks. The SAFECOM initiative aims to address communications interoperability issues by consolidating networks and creating interoperable federal networks linked to state wireless networks. However, there is a lack of information on plans for improving national or regional wireless communications networks. The focus is on hardware solutions at the incident level, potentially excluding plans for network interoperability or establishing standards for new technologies like mesh networks. The build-from-the-bottom-up approach for interoperability advocated by SAFECOM may conflict with the e-government goal of achieving efficiencies at the communications network level. The goals of the IWN align more with the original goals of the e-government strategy, including the construction of a nationwide, end-to-end communications network. The SAFECOM initiative aims to address communications interoperability issues by consolidating networks and creating interoperable federal networks linked to state wireless networks. Its intentions include constructing a national network, identifying end-user functional requirements, and using open standards. SAFECOM's goals have evolved over time, possibly redefining its purpose. In 2004, a new initiative was introduced to facilitate the transition of innovative technologies to regional, state, and local authorities. The SAFECOM initiative aims to address communications interoperability issues by consolidating networks and creating interoperable federal networks linked to state wireless networks. Four urban areas, including Cincinnati, Ohio and Anaheim, California, will receive $10 million each to expand new systems for public safety communications. Anaheim has created a virtual operations center using network technology to connect emergency services. National Incident Management System (NIMS) also plans to address interoperability and communications issues. The DHS report on NIMS issued in 2004 does not mention spectrum policy. The objective is to develop a common communications plan and interoperable processes. NIMS aims for mandatory compliance with national interoperable communications standards. The Integrated Wireless Network (IWN) for law enforcement is a joint program by the Departments of Justice, Treasury, and Homeland Security, with limited interoperability at the state and local level. The Integrated Wireless Network (IWN) aims for network integration in law enforcement wireless communication and data exchange at the state and local level. The National Communications System, under DHS, is responsible for telecommunications and national security communications coordination. It consults with the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC) on related issues. The National Communications System (NCS) is closely linked to the White House through NSTAC and the National Security Council. Its primary functions include assuring critical telecommunications access for federal and state agencies, coordinating service restoration with the private sector, and establishing priorities in service restoration during emergencies. NCS operates the National Coordinating Center for Telecommunications and manages an Individual Mobilization Augmentee program for recovery efforts. SAFECOM has established the Federal Interoperability Coordination Council (FICC) to coordinate federal agencies with programs addressing telecommunications interoperability. The Federal Interoperability Coordination Council (FICC) consists of federal agencies addressing interoperability. SAFECOM previously met with representatives from 60 different federal programs to rationalize interoperability. The National Coordination Committee encourages the creation of Statewide Interoperability Executive Committees (SIEC) for coordination efforts. The National Public Safety Telecommunications Council (NPSTC) unites public safety associations to address communication issues. The AGILE Program, supported by the National Institute of Justice, addresses public safety communications issues by testing standards for wireless telecommunications. It has provided funding to Regional Planning Committees for start-up costs. AGILE has been replaced by CommTech, which does not play a primary role in coordinating interoperability policy. SIECs, NPSTC, and other organizations play key roles in advancing programs for public safety communications. In recent testimony, SAFECOM and the FCC focus on consultative functions for interoperability. NIMS emphasizes the need for a national network architecture and operations centers for communication support. The Regional Technology Integration Initiative acts as a catalyst between current and future technology for first responders. The Regional Technology Integration Initiative aims to support first responders with innovative technology at local, state, and regional levels, focusing on solutions applicable on a regional basis."
