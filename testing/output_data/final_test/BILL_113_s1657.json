    "content": "The Act titled \"Increasing the Safety of Prescription Drug Use Act of 2013\" establishes a Prescription Drug Monitoring Program. The Controlled Substance Monitoring Program under the Public Health Service Act is amended to ensure interoperability with other states' programs and federal agencies, electronic health records, and e-prescribing for real-time patient information. The Controlled Substance Monitoring Program is amended to require practitioners to use State database information for prescribing controlled substances and dispensers to enter patient data into the database, including methadone information. The State must ensure that patient information from the database is only used for official duties and not for criminal investigations related to methadone use. The text discusses amendments to the Public Health Service Act regarding the authorization of funds for fiscal years 2014 through 2018 and the confidentiality of records related to methadone. Health care practitioners and dispensers participating in Federal health care programs are also mentioned. Health care programs under various departments and agencies must utilize controlled substance monitoring databases if available to practitioners or dispensers. The pilot project outlined in Section 3 aims to implement controlled substance monitoring databases in health care programs. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will award grants to States for a pilot project to develop a standardized peer review process for prescription drug monitoring programs. Recipients of the grant will create a methodology to identify questionable prescribing patterns of controlled substances. (c) Requirements.--A State receiving a grant under this section shall make information on controlled substances available to State regulation and licensing boards. A quality improvement organization may serve as a subgrantee to develop peer review processes. SEC. 399V-6. PRESCRIPTION DRUG AND OTHER CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE ABUSE PREVENTION. This section amends the Public Health Service Act to address the prevention of prescription drug and controlled substance abuse. The Secretary will award 5-year grants to eligible entities for training healthcare providers in patient screening and brief interventions to prevent prescription drug and controlled substance abuse. Eligible entities include States and continuing education entities like health profession boards. Federal health care workers employed by various programs must screen patients for prescription drug abuse, provide brief interventions, and offer referrals. This includes those in the Indian Health Service, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Medicare, Medicaid, Children's Health Insurance Program, and Federally qualified health centers. The Secretary will award grants to States to evaluate expanding prescribing authorities of providers like advance practice nurses and physician's assistants to control abuse of prescription drugs and other controlled substances. SEC. 5. PRESCRIPTION DRUG ABUSE TRAINING AND SCREENING PROGRAMS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services awards grants to States for developing continuing education criteria for safe prescribing of opioids. Practitioners registering with the DEA must certify completion of continuing medical education on prescription drug abuse. Practitioners renewing registration must have medical understanding of drug use listed in Controlled Substances Act schedules. The Attorney General mandates patient screening for drug misuse before prescribing schedule II or III drugs. The FDA will review naloxone to potentially make it available as a behind-the-counter drug for increased access. The Health and Human Services Secretary will establish programs for safe disposal of prescription drugs and limit opioid dispensing in emergency departments. Additionally, a GAO report will be conducted. The Comptroller General of the United States will review prescription drug abuse programs and policies in Federal agencies and States, issuing a report to Congress within 18 months with recommendations to reduce prescription drug abuse."
