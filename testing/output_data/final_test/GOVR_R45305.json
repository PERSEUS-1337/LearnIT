The U.S. plays a significant role in international agricultural markets, subjecting its farm policy to scrutiny for compliance with WTO rules. Farm income and commodity support programs have been part of U.S. legislation since the 1930s, authorized as part of omnibus farm legislation. The current omnibus U.S. farm legislation, known as the farm bill, is renewed every five or six years with modifications to existing programs. The Agricultural Act of 2014 made significant changes to the previous farm safety net. The commodity programs of the 2014 farm bill are set to expire in 2018, and the future of the bill may involve replacement, extension, or lapse into \"permanent law\" provisions from the 1930s and 1940s. The WTO plays a crucial role in U.S. agricultural policy decisions due to commitments made as part of membership. The Agreement on Agriculture and the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures are key in governing domestic agricultural support and trade disputes among members. Violations of WTO rules can lead to challenges through the dispute settlement process. The WTO plays a crucial role in U.S. agricultural policy decisions due to commitments made as part of membership. Violations of WTO rules can lead to challenges through the dispute settlement process, potentially requiring Congress to amend programs to comply. Designing farm programs that adhere to WTO rules can help avoid trade disputes. This report provides an overview of relevant WTO commitments for U.S. domestic farm policy, with a focus on how new proposals may impact U.S. commitments. The WTO's Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) categorizes and restricts agricultural domestic support programs based on their potential to distort markets. Amber box subsidies, which have the greatest potential to distort markets, are subject to spending limits, while more benign subsidies are exempted from limits under green box, blue box, de minimis, or special categories. The WTO's Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) categorizes agricultural support programs into green box, blue box, and amber box programs. Green box programs are minimally trade-distorting and not subject to spending limits, while blue box programs are production-limiting and also exempt from payment limits. Amber box programs are the most market-distorting and have strict spending limits. The United States is subject to a spending limit of $19.1 billion in amber box outlays with de minimis exemptions limited by 5% of the value of production. Prohibited programs include certain types of export and import subsidies and nontariff trade barriers. Each WTO member country is expected to monitor and comply with WTO policy commitments. The WTO requires member countries to submit routine notification reports on policy commitments. The Committee on Agriculture reviews progress based on these notifications, which are also posted on the WTO website. The most recent U.S. notification to the WTO on domestic support outlays was for the 2015 crop year. U.S. farm programs are subject to rules under the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, which determine prohibited and actionable subsidies. The WTO evaluates domestic support programs for market distortion based on criteria like subsidy share of farmer returns, importance of subsidized commodity in world markets, and causal relationship with adverse effects. The SCM assesses measurable market effects on international trade and market prices. The WTO evaluates domestic support programs for market distortion based on criteria like subsidy share of farmer returns, importance of subsidized commodity in world markets, and causal relationship with adverse effects. The SCM assesses measurable market effects on international trade and market prices, including displacement of imports, exports, price suppression, undercutting, and increase in world market share. WTO dispute settlement panels review trade and market data to determine if challenged subsidies result in significant market distortion. Prohibited subsidies must be stopped according to WTO rules. The WTO requires prohibited subsidies to be stopped promptly as determined by dispute settlement panels. Actionable subsidies must be altered to minimize distortion, following WTO panel guidelines or negotiation between parties. The WTO DSU facilitates resolution of disputes among members through consultations and panel reviews, with Appellate Body oversight. Compliance with panel decisions is mandatory for defending members. The WTO oversees compliance with panel decisions on prohibited subsidies and trade-distorting support. The United States is heavily involved in WTO disputes, with complex procedures for determining support limits. Compliance with the AoA's $19.1 billion annual limit on trade-distorting support is crucial. The WTO oversees compliance with panel decisions on prohibited subsidies and trade-distorting support, with the United States heavily involved in disputes. The AoA's $19.1 billion annual limit on trade-distorting support is crucial. Questions are asked to determine if a policy falls under the \"green box,\" \"blue box,\" or \"amber box\" categories, with considerations for the 5% de minimis exemption.

The AoA's $19.1 billion annual limit on trade-distorting support is crucial. Questions are asked to determine if a policy falls under the \"green box,\" \"blue box,\" or \"amber box\" categories, with considerations for the 5% de minimis exemption. No limits are placed on green box spending, as it is considered minimally or non-trade distorting. To qualify for exemption in the green box, a program must meet specific criteria. The green-box-qualifying program must not involve transfers from consumers or provide price support to producers. It should benefit the agricultural or rural community through services like research, pest control, training, and infrastructure development. The green-box-qualifying program should benefit the agricultural or rural community through services like research, pest control, training, and infrastructure development. A nationally legislated food security program must include public acquisition and stockholding of products, transparent domestic food aid, and decoupled income support with defined eligibility criteria. The eligibility criteria for agricultural income safety net programs include defining eligibility as agricultural income loss exceeding 30% of average gross income in the preceding three-year period, with payments compensating for less than 70% of the income loss. Payments are based solely on income and cannot exceed 100% of a producer's total loss. Natural disaster relief payments are based on production loss exceeding 30% in the preceding three-year period and apply only to losses of income, livestock, land, or other production factors. Structural adjustment programs for producer retirement and resource retirement aim to facilitate producers' transition out of agricultural production by providing payments tied to clearly defined criteria. Payments are conditioned on specific requirements such as land retirement for at least three years and permanent disposal of livestock, without any obligation for alternative agricultural production. Structural adjustment programs provide investment aids based on clearly defined criteria for financial or physical restructuring of producers' operations. Payments are not tied to production type/quantity or prices, limited to the amount needed for investment realization, and cannot be contingent on designated product production. Environmental program payments are determined by government conservation programs and tied to specific conditions. They cover extra costs for compliance. Regional assistance is limited to disadvantaged producers in defined geographic areas based on objective criteria. The green box measures in agriculture must meet specific criteria to be exempt from AMS, while the blue box has no spending limits but includes safeguards to prevent production expansion. The blue box measures in agriculture have no spending limits but include safeguards to prevent production expansion. To qualify for exemption, a program must be a direct payment under a production-limiting program and meet specific conditions. If not exempt, it is considered an amber box policy, and the next step is to determine if spending is above or below the 5% de minimis rate. Developed country members do not have to count the value of small amber box programs when calculating their total AMS. The program is not commodity-specific and excludes potentially trade-distorting policies under de minimis exclusions. Product-specific domestic support must not exceed 5% of the total value of production of a basic agricultural product. Support from all measures specific to a product is tallied to determine if the 5% threshold is exceeded. For example, U.S. corn crop support was below the threshold, while sugar support easily exceeded it. The United States exceeded the 5% product-specific de minimis limit for sugar support, which was counted against the AMS limit. Non-product-specific domestic support is tallied to determine if it exceeds 5% of the total agricultural production value. The U.S. notified $8.2 billion for non-product-specific support in 2015, which was exempted from inclusion under the AMS limit. If any measure boosts total support above 5%, all support must be counted toward the U.S. total. The United States has never exceeded its $19.1 billion amber box spending limit according to WTO notifications. De minimis exemptions helped avoid exceeding the limit in 1999, 2000, and 2001 despite high total AMS outlays. The 2014 farm bill includes a safety trigger for USDA to adjust program outlays. The 2014 farm bill includes a safety trigger for USDA to adjust program outlays to avoid breaching the AMS limit, which is important for WTO compliance. If a U.S. farm program causes market distortion that affects other WTO members, it may be challenged under WTO dispute settlement procedures. Negotiations for further reform in agricultural trade under the WTO, known as the Doha Round, began in 2001. Despite an impasse in 2009, talks resumed in 2011 with a focus on achievable progress. Completion is not expected soon. As U.S. lawmakers consider agricultural policy options, other countries will assess their impact on WTO compliance and potential challenges. The U.S. aims for substantial reductions in trade-distorting support and stronger rules in WTO talks. Congress may seek farm policy measures compliant with WTO agreements."
