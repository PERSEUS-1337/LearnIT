SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. This section defines key terms such as Band, Tribe, Date of recognition, Indian tribe, and Secretary.

The Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians, Bay Mills Band of Chippewa Indians, Little Traverse Bay Band of Odawa Indians, and Little River Band of Ottawa Indians reside in the ancestral homeland in Michigan. The Band filed for tribal government reorganization in 1935 under the Indian Reorganization Act. The Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians sought reorganization under the Indian Reorganization Act but was denied due to lack of Federal appropriations. They maintained political and social existence through the Northern Michigan Ottawa Association, successfully pursuing a land claim. The Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians have had continuous dealings with government officials since 1836. They were included in the Michigan Indian Land Claims Settlement Act and needed to submit a petition by December 15, 2000, to qualify for land claim funds.
