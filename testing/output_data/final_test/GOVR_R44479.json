    "content": "Predicting how Supreme Court nominees may approach their work based on previous experience is uncertain. Justices like Felix Frankfurter and Harry Blackmun have surprised observers with their decisions on the Court. Justice Blackmun, initially known for interpreting the law, surprised many by authoring the Roe v. Wade decision, constitutionalizing the right to terminate a pregnancy. Despite lengthy judicial careers, predicting Supreme Court votes remains challenging due to judges being bound by precedent. Unlike the Supreme Court, federal appellate judges are required to hear many routine cases. Federal appellate judges tend to hear routine cases where legal rules are clear. Unanimous decisions are common, making it difficult to determine a judge's preferences. Joining opinions may not provide insight into a judge's views on specific legal issues. When a judge joins an opinion authored by another judge, it may not indicate full agreement with the opinion. Silent acquiescence could mean acceptance of the outcome without complete agreement. Interpreting a judge's vote without a written opinion is crucial, especially in procedural matters like granting extensions of time for filings. When a judge grants an extension of time for a filing, it does not necessarily indicate agreement with the party's legal position. Judge Garland's votes to reconsider cases en banc should be interpreted cautiously, as they may signal disagreement with the panel decision or simply a desire for the full court to correct any perceived errors. Most petitions and suggestions are not necessarily an endorsement or repudiation of a legal position. Judge Garland's limited statements on certain areas of law make it difficult to predict his rulings if elevated to the Supreme Court. The D.C. Circuit hears cases on administrative and environmental law matters, but rarely deals with social issues like abortion or the death penalty. Judge Garland's judicial record focuses on areas where he has written extensively, with limited information on other areas. Unlike Justice Scalia, who was known for his originalism and textualism, Judge Garland's views are less clear due to his limited statements on certain legal positions. Judge Garland emphasizes the limited role of judges under the Constitution, stating they should apply the law and not legislate or solve societal problems. He admires Chief Justice John Marshall and echoes these sentiments in his nomination to the Supreme Court. Judge Garland has not articulated a clear legal philosophy like Justice Scalia. He participates in conferences on specific issues and has used originalism in his judicial opinions, including a 2000 opinion based on the Constitution's text and structure. Judge Garland, in rejecting a lawsuit by DC voters seeking the right to elect representatives to Congress, has not relied solely on originalism or textualism in his judicial opinions. His approach to judging is seen as meticulous and cautious, ensuring the court does not overreach. The opinion in Trudeau v. FTC is illustrative of this approach and has been widely cited by other judges. Judge Garland's opinion in Trudeau v. FTC, affirming the dismissal of a complaint by Kevin Trudeau, clarified complex jurisdictional questions and avoided resolving a weighty administrative law issue. The case has been cited by other judges as illustrative of his meticulous and cautious approach to judging. Judge Garland's decision in Trudeau v. FTC was based on the grounds that Trudeau's complaint was legally insufficient, showcasing his ability to navigate complex legal issues while keeping his rulings focused. This reflects his cautious and minimalist approach to judging, as seen in his numerous concurring and dissenting opinions where he challenges unnecessary issues raised by majority opinions. This approach is evident throughout his judicial career and has been noted by the Supreme Court in evaluating his work. Judge Garland's opinions tend to avoid unnecessary controversy, with only nine opinions he joined being reviewed by the Supreme Court, five of which were affirmed. This high affirmance rate suggests a cautious nature in his jurisprudence. Judge Garland's opinions show a pragmatic concern for how rulings may impact the government branches. In Wagner v. FEC, he upheld a law banning federal contractors from contributing to campaigns, citing historical corruption involving contractors as justification. This reflects his cautious jurisprudence. In Valdes v. United States, Judge Garland dissented from a ruling that a police officer could not be prosecuted under the federal antigratuity statute for taking money from an undercover federal agent. He believed the majority opinion interpreted the statute too narrowly, denying the government an important tool. Judge Garland's dissent in Valdes v. United States criticized the majority for narrowly interpreting the antigratuity statute, which he believed hindered the government's ability to combat official corruption. His pragmatic approach to judging suggests a reluctance to interfere with political decisions, favoring flexibility in interpreting laws for practical consequences. This contrasts with Justice Scalia's formalism. Judge Garland's approach to judging emphasizes compromise, consensus-building, and collegiality in difficult cases. Contrasting with Justice Scalia's formalism, Garland's opinions are noted for their practical and less acerbic style. Judge Garland's approach to judging emphasizes compromise, consensus-building, and collegiality in difficult cases. In contrast, Justice Scalia's strict adherence to originalist philosophy often led to broad opinions that did not gain majority support. Judge Garland's nomination to the Supreme Court has been praised by colleagues and lawyers for being thoughtful, collegial, and considerate. Judge Garland's judicial approach emphasizes compromise, consensus-building, and collegiality. Anonymous evaluations in the Almanac of the Federal Judiciary praise his legal ability, describing him as having an \"excellent temperament\" and being \"courteous\" and \"cerebral.\" His tendency towards consensus-building is reflected in his infrequent dissents and majority opinions that garner few separate opinions, indicating a high value on reaching a consensus. Judge Garland's consensus-building approach is evident in his work on the D.C. Circuit, where he authored opinions that found agreement among colleagues with disparate views. For example, in 2003, he wrote a unanimous opinion rejecting a challenge to Congress's powers under the Commerce Clause. This suggests he may be able to find consensus on contentious cases if elevated to the Supreme Court. Judge Garland's ability to garner unanimous opinions in resolving legal issues that have sharply divided the High Court in recent years is evident in his work on the D.C. Circuit, where he found agreement among colleagues with disparate views. In 2003, he authored a unanimous opinion rejecting a challenge to Congress's powers under the Commerce Clause. This suggests his consensus-building approach may be beneficial if he is elevated to the Supreme Court. Judge Garland's approach to resolving legal issues demonstrates a willingness to prioritize collaboration over ideological rigidity. Unlike Justice Scalia, he does not have a specific philosophy of statutory interpretation but considers multiple factors like text, structure, context, and history in his opinions. For example, in a dissenting opinion, he relied on the \"plain text\" of the False Claims Act. Judge Garland rejected the majority's view on liability under the False Claims Act, emphasizing the lack of a requirement for presentment to the federal government. He cited the FCA's definition of \"claim\" and legislative history to support his interpretation, aligning with a mainstream approach to statutory construction. In Southeast Alabama Medical Center v. Sebelius and Public Citizen, Inc. v. HHS, Judge Garland interpreted statutory terms like \"wage and wage-related costs\" and \"final disposition\" based on how people would normally understand them. He emphasized that fringe benefits can be considered wages and that a vague form letter does not fulfill the obligation to disclose the final disposition of complaints. Judge Garland interprets statutory terms like \"final disposition\" based on how people would understand them, emphasizing that vague form letters do not disclose the substantive result of complaints. He rarely mentions \"original meaning\" like Justice Scalia, but his approach aligns with textualism. Judge Garland's approach to statutory interpretation resembles other judges' approaches by referring to commonly accepted \"canons\" of statutory interpretation, including principles such as construing similar language similarly, giving effect to every clause and word of a statute, and preferring specific terms over general ones. Judge Garland's approach to statutory interpretation involves using specific canons such as giving precedence to specific terms over general ones, avoiding implied repeals, and understanding that titles or headings offer limited interpretative aid. These canons are applied based on the specific statutory text in question rather than a desire for strict rules. Judge Garland's approach to statutory interpretation involves specific canons like giving precedence to specific terms over general ones, avoiding implied repeals, and understanding that titles or headings offer limited interpretative aid. He frequently finds statutory language ambiguous, leading to deference to agency interpretations. This is illustrated in his dissenting opinion in Financial Planning Association v. SEC regarding the Investment Advisers Act. The majority's interpretation of the statutory language in the Investment Advisers Act excludes broker-dealers who receive \"special compensation\" from being exempt from regulation. Judge Garland disagreed with this view, arguing that the SEC could still exempt broker-dealers who receive \"special compensation\" based on the language of the act. Judge Garland disagreed with the majority's interpretation of the Investment Advisers Act, finding the phrases \"such other persons\" and \"within the intent of this paragraph\" to be ambiguous. He noted the lack of language barring the SEC from exempting broker-dealers not covered by the first provision, emphasizing the importance of determining statutory text ambiguity for court deference to agency interpretation. Judge Garland's approach to statutory interpretation involves finding ambiguity in statutory texts and considering legislative history materials. This reflects his desire to avoid constraining the options of the political branches. Judge Garland's approach to statutory interpretation involves finding ambiguity in statutory texts and considering legislative history materials. In the Totten case, there was a disagreement among the panel regarding the use of legislative history. Judge Garland's opinion emphasized starting with the existing statutory text to discern congressional intent, while the majority also utilized legislative history materials. Judge Garland's approach to statutory interpretation involves finding ambiguity in statutory texts and considering legislative history materials. He treats legislative history as only one factor among many and recognizes the limitations of using it to interpret a statute. Unlike Justice Scalia, he does not base interpretations solely on congressional purpose derived from legislative history. Judge Garland's approach to statutory interpretation involves finding ambiguity in statutory texts and considering legislative history materials. He treats legislative history as only one factor among many and recognizes the limitations of using it to interpret a statute. If elevated to the Supreme Court, he would approach matters of statutory interpretation differently from Justice Scalia, potentially leading to changes in the Court's rulings on close cases. The D.C. Circuit handles many administrative law cases due to its exclusive jurisdiction granted by Congress. Judge Garland's opinions in administrative law cases focus on the jurisdiction to hear challenges to government actions, including standing to sue and whether agency actions comply with the law. His approach involves assessing the availability of judicial review based on constitutional, prudential, and statutory considerations. If confirmed to the Supreme Court, his perspective on administrative law cases could impact how these matters are approached. Judge Garland's opinions in administrative law cases focus on jurisdictional issues related to challenges against government actions, including standing, exhaustion of administrative remedies, ripeness, and mootness. His approach considers constitutional, prudential, and statutory factors affecting access to the courts. He tends to side with the majority on judicial access issues in the D.C. Circuit, showing a trend in his jurisprudence. Judge Garland's opinions in administrative law cases focus on jurisdictional issues related to challenges against government actions, including standing, exhaustion of administrative remedies, ripeness, and mootness. He tends to side with the majority on judicial access issues in the D.C. Circuit, showing a trend in his jurisprudence. The appropriateness of judicial review of agency action was contested, with Judge Garland often concluding that challenges were nonjusticiable due to lack of standing, ripeness, or mootness. He was more permissive on matters of judicial access in cases where the court split on the issue. Judge Garland tended to be more permissive on judicial access issues in the D.C. Circuit, allowing recourse to plaintiffs who may not have satisfied all requirements for review. This contrasts with Justice Scalia's approach, which restricted court access. Garland's confirmation to the Supreme Court could impact justiciability in closely divided cases. Judge Garland's confirmation to the High Court could impact justiciability requirements, particularly in challenges to federal agency action under the APA. Two key standards of review, statutory and arbitrary and capricious review, are crucial in evaluating agency actions for compliance with the law. Deference is granted to agency interpretations of statutes if Congress authorized the agency to do so. The Chevron framework requires courts to defer to agency interpretations of statutes if Congress has not directly addressed the issue at hand. This allows agencies to adapt their interpretations in response to changing circumstances. Judge Garland's approach towards reviewing agency interpretations of law under Chevron involves finding ambiguity in statutes, leading to a more deferential evaluation of agency regulations. In cases like Financial Planning Association v. SEC, he applies this approach to statutes like the Investment Advisers Act, analyzing exceptions and exemptions within the law. The SEC promulgated a rule exempting broker-dealers who receive \"special compensation.\" The panel majority ruled that the SEC lacked authority to exempt broker-dealers beyond the first exemption. Judge Garland dissented, arguing that the second exemption's terms were ambiguous and the agency interpretation was reasonable. Judge Garland believes that the Chevron deference canon, which states that the mention of one thing excludes another, is not applicable in administrative contexts where Congress has given agencies discretion to interpret their statutory authority. He argues that the canon is especially inappropriate when Congress delegates authority to agencies to create exceptions to statutes. In cases where Judge Garland has ruled against agency interpretations, he tends to favor outcomes that allow room for the agency to provide more formal interpretations in the future. Judge Garland tends to rule against agency interpretations, favoring outcomes that could allow for more formal interpretations in the future. He believes the Chevron deference doctrine may not apply in cases where agencies have not spoken with the force of law, leaving room for agencies to potentially reinterpret statutes in the future. Judge Garland tends to rule against agency interpretations, favoring outcomes that could allow for more formal interpretations in the future. He concurred with the court's judgment that the FDA had failed to provide an authoritative interpretation of the FFDCA regarding e-cigarettes, leaving room for potential future regulations. The Supreme Court requires agencies to provide a rational explanation for their actions, with a focus on relevant data and clear judgment. Judge Garland's application of the arbitrary and capricious standard varies in deference to agency decisions, especially in comparison to his approach in statutory review cases. Judge Garland tends to defer to agency decisions under the APA's Section 706(2)(A) standard, especially in technical matters like environmental law. In Americans for Safe Access v. DEA, he upheld the DEA's decision on marijuana reclassification, citing a reluctance to second-guess agency expertise mandated by Congress. Judge Garland tends to defer to agency decisions under the APA's Section 706(2)(A) standard, especially in technical matters like environmental law. In a case involving the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the Department of Energy (DOE) application for a license to store nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain in Nevada, Judge Garland dissented from the majority opinion, arguing that the NRC did not have sufficient funds to complete the project. He emphasized the importance of agency expertise in making such decisions. Judge Garland tends to defer to agency decisions under the APA's Section 706(2)(A) standard, especially in technical matters like environmental law. In a case involving the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the Department of Energy (DOE) application for a license to store nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain in Nevada, Judge Garland dissented from the majority opinion, arguing that the NRC did not have sufficient funds to complete the project. He emphasized the importance of agency expertise in making such decisions. In another case, Judge Garland voted to invalidate agency actions or remand cases for a more developed explanation of its policy choice. For example, in Alpharma, Inc. v. Leavitt, he remanded a matter to the FDA for a fuller explanation of its reasoning in approving a new animal drug application. Judge Garland's approach to administrative law shows a tendency to defer to agency decisions, especially in technical matters like environmental law. In a recent opinion, concerns were raised about the FDA's response to a remand order, with contradictory assertions hindering the court from finding the decision reasonable. Judge Garland's approach contrasts with Justice Scalia's textualist interpretation, potentially affording agencies more flexibility in interpreting ambiguous statutes. Judge Garland's confirmation to the Supreme Court could lead to significant changes in the Court's approach to administrative law, particularly in regards to Chevron deference. His views on capital punishment, although not directly addressed during his time on the D.C. Circuit, may be crucial as he would be replacing Justice Scalia, who supported the death penalty. Prior to his judgeship, Judge Garland worked as a prosecutor. Judge Garland, prior to his appointment to the D.C. Circuit, was a prosecutor who handled cases involving the death penalty, including the Timothy McVeigh case. He has expressed support for capital punishment as \"settled law.\" It is challenging to predict his stance on the death penalty based solely on these statements. If confirmed to the Supreme Court, Judge Garland could have a significant impact on federal law regarding civil defendants' exposure. Judge Garland, a former prosecutor who handled death penalty cases, could impact federal law on civil defendants' monetary liability limits. Justice Scalia's decisions restricted plaintiffs' ability to use procedural vehicles and state law in lawsuits against businesses. Commentators debate how Judge Garland might influence the Supreme Court's stance on corporate defendants. Judge Garland's potential impact on civil liability matters, particularly on business interests, is debated. Some believe his deference to executive agencies could lead to less interference with marketplace externalities, while others argue his record on labor law suggests he may be more hostile towards businesses. Predicting his rulings is challenging due to the D.C. Circuit's docket, which lacks explicit business cases. Judge Garland's rulings on civil liability matters have been mostly unanimous, indicating a reliance on precedent. He has vacated class action certifications in some cases, emphasizing the need for scrutiny in statistical models. Judge Garland's rulings on civil liability matters have been mostly unanimous, emphasizing the need for scrutiny in statistical models. Despite unsettled questions of law, a majority decision by Judge Ginsburg denied a petition to vacate a class certification order. In a notable dissent in Saleh v. Titan Corp, Garland addressed the displacement of state tort law by federal law in a case involving detainee abuse at Abu Ghraib. In Saleh v. Titan Corp, Iraqi nationals sued military contractors for assault, battery, wrongful death, and emotional distress at Abu Ghraib. Defendants argued that Federal Tort Claims Act preempted common law tort claims due to exemption of federal contractors. Defense based on Boyle v. United Technologies Corp. for potential liability defense. In Saleh v. Titan Corp, federal contractors faced liability under state tort law for a potential conflict with federal government contracts. Judge Garland and the majority disagreed on the existence of a \"significant conflict\" based on the FTCA's exception for combatant activities. The majority aimed to eliminate tort from the battlefield to free military commanders from civil liability uncertainties, while Judge Garland argued that the duties imposed by tort law and the contract were congruent in this case. Judge Garland disagreed with the majority in Saleh v. Titan Corp regarding the broad preemption under the majority's interpretation. He argued that state causes of action should be preserved unless there is a clear congressional purpose to displace state law. This case may demonstrate how Judge Garland approaches conflicts between federal and state law differently from Justice Scalia. Judge Garland's views on preemption suggest he would likely disfavor broad displacement of state claims when Congress legislates in areas traditionally occupied by states. He has expressed skepticism towards federal courts invalidating state laws under preemption principles, particularly in the context of federal antitrust law. Additionally, he tends to interpret federal laws imposing civil liability more expansively than some of his colleagues on the D.C. Circuit. Judge Garland's interpretation of punitive damages for sex discrimination claims under Title VII aligns with common law standards, requiring conduct to be \"egregious.\" He differs from the dissent in Kolstad, arguing that the statute's plain language should prevail. In his analysis of the False Claims Act, he tends to favor plaintiffs. Judge Garland tends to favor plaintiffs in his interpretation of the False Claims Act, as seen in his opinions in United States ex rel. Yesudian v. Howard University and United States ex rel. Totten v. Bombardier Corp. In the former case, he reversed the dismissal of claims regarding whistleblower retaliation, while in the latter case, he dissented from a majority opinion regarding liability for false claims. Judge Garland tends to favor plaintiffs in his interpretation of the False Claims Act, as seen in his opinions in United States ex rel. Yesudian v. Howard University and United States ex rel. Totten v. Bombardier Corp. In the former case, he reversed the dismissal of claims regarding whistleblower retaliation, while in the latter case, he dissented from a majority opinion regarding liability for false claims. The majority decision in the latter case could not hold defendants liable for false claims submitted to a private entity, despite being funded with federal money. Judge Garland argued that this decision leaves vast sums of federal money unprotected by the act, potentially immunizing those who defraud government-funded private organizations from liability. It is difficult to predict how Judge Garland would rule on civil liability issues if confirmed to the High Court, given the limited number of D.C. Circuit cases on such matters. Judge Garland's views on constitutional civil rights questions are generally unknown as he has not directly addressed them in cases before the D.C. Circuit. Most of his civil rights decisions have focused on statutory employment discrimination claims. One notable case is Kolstad v. American Dental Association. In Kolstad v. American Dental Association, Judge Garland joined a dissenting opinion arguing for the availability of punitive damages in intentional discrimination cases without requiring a certain level of egregiousness. This view was later adopted by the Supreme Court. In Kolstad v. American Dental Association, Judge Garland supported punitive damages in intentional discrimination cases without requiring a specific level of egregiousness under Title VII. His approach in civil rights cases tends to favor employees, but his stance on constitutional civil rights issues remains uncertain. Judge Garland's expertise in criminal law and procedure is highlighted, especially in cases involving criminal defendants' rights. His background as a federal prosecutor overseeing high-profile cases adds to his experience in this area. Judge Garland's background as a federal prosecutor in high-profile cases suggests he may lean towards government interests in criminal cases, as seen in his voting pattern on the D.C. Circuit. Examining his decisions in criminal law cases, especially those that divided the court, may offer a more nuanced prediction of his approach on the Supreme Court. Judge Garland's background as a federal prosecutor suggests he may lean towards government interests in criminal cases. In cases where he sided with the government, he tended to defer to law enforcement officers' actions to protect their safety. For example, in United States v. Brown, he ruled for the government in a case involving a police officer searching a car trunk based on safety concerns. Garland justified the officer's belief in the danger posed by the occupants during a search in a high crime area at night. Factors included an occupant exiting the car and appearing to watch the police, and another occupant moving to the front seat. Garland emphasized the need for an objective assessment of reasonable suspicion in Terry inquiries, based on a 1996 opinion by Justice Scalia. In another case, United States v. Christian, Garland held that a police officer's search of a defendant's car near the defendant at the time of his arrest was permissible as part of a weapons search. Judge Garland upheld a police officer's search of a defendant's car near the defendant at the time of his arrest as part of a weapons search under Terry. He emphasized the need for an objective assessment of reasonable suspicion and narrow rulings based on specific case facts. In another case, he supported a search incident to arrest as an exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement. In a recent case, Judge Garland supported a search incident to arrest as an exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement, emphasizing the need for a quick arrest following the search. This decision showcased his reluctance to broadly overturn established case law based on later-in-time precedent. In United States v. Askew, Judge Garland demonstrated a preference for narrow rulings on constitutional criminal matters. The D.C. Circuit was divided on whether police could unzip a suspect's jacket without a warrant during a Terry stop for identification purposes. Judge Garland joined a narrow section of the majority opinion that focused on the specific facts of the case, rather than the broader legal question. The defendant's \"generic blue sweatshirt\" worn underneath his jacket could determine his connection to the crime, showing Judge Garland's tendency for narrow rulings in constitutional criminal law matters. He often fills gaps in case law cautiously, as seen in his opinions on issues like the \"actual innocence\" standard in federal habeas corpus cases. In United States v. Andrews, Judge Garland addressed ex post facto issues regarding Federal Sentencing Guidelines recommendations issued after the offense date. He emphasized the importance of following clear legal norms under plain error review and declined to create a new rule for unobjected-to Booker errors when the original sentencing judge is unavailable. Judge Garland declined to create a new rule for unobjected-to Booker errors when the original sentencing judge is unavailable, emphasizing the importance of following clear legal norms under plain error review. He tends to read criminal statutes broadly to encompass the activities of charged defendants, and has sided with the government's position in cases concerning mens rea requirements. In United States v. Burwell, Judge Garland upheld the government's position that mens rea is not required to prove knowledge of a firearm's automatic firing capability in a federal felony case. Judges Rogers, Kavanaugh, and David Tatel dissented, arguing for a mens rea element in the statute. In United States v. Blalock, Judge Garland ruled that being high on PCP does not negate the mens rea element in the statute. Judge Garland has not consistently sided with the government on mens rea cases. In United States v. Project on Government Oversight, he authored the majority opinion requiring proof of intent to compensate federal employees for government services. In Valdes v. United States, he supported a broad reading of a federal criminal law in dissent. Judge Garland's dissent in Valdes v. United States argued that the federal antigratuity statute should encompass a police officer's actions in exchanging money for using police databases. He criticized the majority's narrow interpretation of \"official act,\" warning that it could hinder bribery prosecutions under another statute relying on the same definition. This suggests his inclination to broadly apply criminal statutes. Judge Garland's dissent in Valdes v. United States showed a tendency to broadly apply criminal statutes, diverging from Justice Scalia's lenient approach towards criminal defendants. It remains to be seen if this indicates a systematic favoring of the government in criminal law matters. Many aspects of criminal law influenced by Justice Scalia have not been addressed by Judge Garland. Judge Garland's approach to criminal law has not been fully revealed in his decisions, as most cases he has handled involved straightforward applications of precedent. Any assumptions about how he would approach criminal law without such constraints should be viewed skeptically. The D.C. Circuit hears many environmental law cases due to statutes requiring challenges to agency actions. Judge Garland has participated in numerous environmental cases in the D.C. Circuit, dealing with issues like standing to sue and judicial review. He is seen as more open to arguments emphasizing environmental values compared to Justice Scalia. Garland often supports agency interpretations of environmental statutes using Chevron deference. Judge Garland's environmental jurisprudence is characterized by his \"long-standing commitment to Chevron deference.\" In a 2002 case involving the EPA's Regional Haze Rule, he supported the agency's interpretation over industry petitioners, emphasizing collective assessments of groups of pollution sources. Judge Garland has a history of supporting agency interpretations, including upholding the EPA's Mercury and Air Toxics (MATS) rule. He tends to defer to agencies on environmental matters, applying the \"arbitrary and capricious\" standard for judicial review. In National Association of Home Builders v. EPA, Judge Garland upheld an EPA amendment removing an \"opt-out\" provision from a Toxic Substances Control Act regulation on lead paint hazards. However, in American Farm Bureau Federation v. EPA, he ruled against the EPA's 2006 CAA standard for fine particulate matter, remanding it for further consideration. Judge Garland has tended to uphold agencies' NEPA decisions unless they failed entirely to take a required step. In Sierra Club v. Van Antwerp, he required the Army Corps of Engineers to address the impacts of habitat fragmentation on the endangered eastern indigo snake when issuing a permit for construction. He has consistently required agencies to adhere to environmental regulations like NEPA and the Endangered Species Act. Judge Garland has required agencies to adhere to statutory procedural requirements in environmental cases, such as in Gerber v. Norton where he found the Fish and Wildlife Service violated ESA requirements. In other cases, he has shown flexibility towards environmental agencies, as seen in his dissent in In re Aiken County regarding the NRC's funding for the Yucca Mountain licensing process. Energy, and the majority in In re Aiken County stated that courts should not excuse agencies from statutory mandates even if it is impossible for them to complete the licensing. Judge Garland, on the other hand, emphasized the court's discretion not to order useless acts. Access to courts and standing requirements under Article III of the Constitution have been important in environmental cases, with Judge Garland being mindful of constitutional and prudential concerns, often rejecting standing for environmental or industry plaintiffs. Judge Garland has found standing in some cases, including those where other judges did not. Besides standing, plaintiffs in environmental cases must also meet requirements for ripeness, finality of agency actions, and exhaustion of administrative remedies. Garland has sometimes allowed causes of action to proceed when others disagreed, but he has also applied doctrines to block challenges to agency decisions. In the 2014 case UARG v. EPA, he wrote on exhaustion of administrative remedies. In UARG v. EPA, Judge Garland emphasized the importance of raising objections during the public comment period and not in a petition for reconsideration. He has also been cautious with constitutional arguments against environmental regulations and has found some NEPA claims to be premature. Additionally, he has not favored constitutional challenges to environmental regulations, as seen in American Trucking Associations v. EPA where a panel found a section of the CAA unconstitutionally delegated legislative power to the EPA. Judge Garland has shown a reluctance towards constitutional challenges to environmental regulations, as seen in cases like American Trucking Associations v. EPA and Rancho Viejo, LLC v. Norton. He emphasized the importance of objections during the public comment period in UARG v. EPA and has upheld agency determinations under the Commerce Clause. Judge Garland has shown a reluctance towards constitutional challenges to environmental regulations, upholding agency determinations under the Commerce Clause. Recently, he joined the opinion rejecting arguments that the EPA's designation of \"nonattainment\" areas exceeded federal authority under various clauses. If confirmed to replace Justice Scalia, agencies defending environmental rules could have more favorable odds in major environmental law challenges. Notably, challenges to the EPA's Clean Power Plan rule could be impacted by this potential shift. During his time on the D.C. Circuit, Judge Garland has addressed federalism and congressional power in a limited number of cases, including issues related to the Tenth Amendment, Spending Clause, Commerce Clause, and Eleventh Amendment immunity. It is uncertain how his conclusions in these cases may reflect his judicial approach. Judge Garland tends to side with the federal government in federalism cases with disagreement among circuit judges, narrowly construing limits on Congress's power. He has had limited opportunity to assess the anticommandeering doctrine, which prohibits Congress from \"commandeering\" states. In cases involving federalism, Judge Garland typically supports the federal government and interprets limits on Congress's power narrowly. He has had few chances to address the anticommandeering doctrine, which bars Congress from forcing states to enforce federal laws. In a specific case, Judge Garland rejected the argument that the Clean Air Act commandeers state officials, citing Supreme Court precedent on conditional preemption. Additionally, he has ruled on how the Tenth Amendment may restrict Congress's authority under the Spending Clause. The Mississippi Commission court dismissed an argument regarding the coercive use of Congress's spending powers under the Clean Air Act. The court examined the principle of federalism in relation to spending conditions and distinguished the CAA provision from the Affordable Care Act. The court examined federalism in relation to spending conditions under the Clean Air Act, distinguishing it from the Affordable Care Act. The court reasoned that the CAA provision did not withhold all federal transportation funding from states, unlike the ACA's Medicaid funding provision. The court also questioned whether a state could challenge spending conditions as \"unconstitutionally coercive\" if it had long accepted federal funding with conditions. Judge Garland interpreted the limitations on the spending power more narrowly in a different context. In Barbour v. WMATA, Judge Garland affirmed Congress's authority to condition federal transportation funding on a waiver of state sovereign immunity, ruling that the conditions must relate to the purpose of the funding. This decision was separate from the Supreme Court's consideration in NFIB and involved a Spending Clause argument regarding disability discrimination lawsuits. Judge Garland's majority opinion in Barbour affirmed Congress's authority to condition federal funding on a waiver of state sovereign immunity to prevent disability discrimination, giving deference to Congress's judgment. This suggests that Judge Garland believes spending conditions have limited restrictions on Congress's powers. Judge Garland's extensive writings focus on Congress's power under the Commerce Clause, which allows regulation of interstate commerce activities. The Supreme Court has granted Congress broad power in this regard, as seen in cases like United States v. Lopez and United States v. Morrison. Garland emphasizes evaluating potential interstate effects by focusing on the activity being regulated. In a recent opinion, Judge Garland upheld the EPA's authority to regulate architectural coatings under the Clean Air Act, stating that the provisions were distinguishable from those invalidated in previous cases like Lopez and Morrison. The court found that the CAA regulated economic activity with a jurisdictional element and express congressional findings. Judge Garland upheld the EPA's authority to regulate economic activity under the Clean Air Act, citing express congressional findings and a jurisdictional element. In another case, he ruled that the Endangered Species Act's provisions on \"takings\" were valid, even if the regulated activity was intrastate and noneconomic. In a case involving the Endangered Species Act, Judge Garland upheld the regulation of a planned commercial development, emphasizing its impact on interstate commerce. He rejected claims that the ESA encroached on traditional state land-use decisions, citing a previous court decision. This ruling was later referenced in a Commerce Clause challenge in a separate case. Judge Garland's opinion in Rancho Viejo upheld Congress's authority to regulate local nitrogen oxide emissions under the Commerce Clause, focusing on the activities that produce the emissions as the regulated activity. This decision faced criticism, with Judge Sentelle arguing that Congress cannot regulate any activity as long as it catches an entity engaged in interstate commerce. Judge Garland's Commerce Clause jurisprudence suggests that he has adopted a broad construction of the clause, providing the federal government with authority to regulate various forms of activity, diverging from contemporary Supreme Court Commerce Clause jurisprudence. Judge Garland has authored opinions on the Commerce Clause, providing the federal government with broad authority to regulate various activities. He has also written opinions on state sovereign immunity, with divergent results in cases such as Watters v. WMATA and Barbour. The Remedies Equalization Act of 1986 conditions a state agency's acceptance of federal funds on waiving Eleventh Amendment immunity. Judge Garland's opinion in Barbour held that a clear condition in a federal statute is enough to waive sovereign immunity, regardless of a state's beliefs when accepting funds. This approach limits an alternate route to maintain an immunity defense recognized by another federal court of appeals, showing skepticism about judicially imposed limits to protect state sovereign rights. However, due to the limited number of cases he ruled on, it is uncertain how Judge Garland would approach federal power vs. state rights if appointed to the Supreme Court. Judge Garland's stance on federalism-based arguments compared to Justice Scalia is uncertain. While he hasn't authored opinions on religious freedom laws, he has joined cases involving First Amendment and RFRA challenges. One notable case is Priests for Life v. HHS, where he upheld a contraceptive coverage requirement under the Affordable Care Act. Judge Garland's role in Priests for Life case did not provide much insight into his legal reasoning on religious freedom. However, if confirmed before the Court's potential rehearing of the contraceptive coverage cases, he may play a significant role in deciding them. Judge Garland has ruled in major free speech cases while serving on the D.C. Circuit, particularly in cases involving campaign finance regulations and rules governing political parties. In Wagner v. FEC, he upheld the prohibition on campaign contributions by certain federal government contractors, citing First Amendment and Equal Protection clause considerations. Judge Garland upheld the ban on campaign contributions by federal government contractors, citing the importance of preventing corruption and maintaining merit-based administration. His opinion deferred to Congress's judgment on campaign finance regulation, emphasizing the need for judicial deference in such matters. In a recent decision, Judge Garland upheld the ban on campaign contributions by federal government contractors, emphasizing the importance of preventing corruption. He deferred to Congress's judgment on campaign finance regulation, highlighting the need for judicial deference in such matters. Additionally, in another case, he supported the regulation of federal lobbyists in a unanimous opinion. During his time on the D.C. Circuit, Judge Garland supported the establishment of super PACs in a campaign finance ruling. He also joined a unanimous opinion in SpeechNow.org v. FEC, deeming limits on contributions to groups making independent expenditures as unconstitutional, citing the Citizens United ruling. Judge Garland supported the establishment of super PACs and deemed contribution limits to groups making independent expenditures as unconstitutional in SpeechNow.org v. FEC, citing the Citizens United ruling. His opinions on political parties' rights have produced mixed results, with a limited interpretation of the First Amendment in such disputes. In a case involving a Washington, DC law on write-in votes, Judge Garland found it did not severely burden associational rights. In another case, he supported a party's right to choose its nominees, rejecting a First Amendment challenge. He emphasized that parties may face consequences at the polls for unfair treatment of members, delegates, or candidates. Judge Garland has authored few opinions on the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. In a notable case, he ruled against a Postal Service regulation that prohibited solicitation of signatures outside postal buildings, stating it did not meet First Amendment standards. In a unanimous ruling, Judge Garland found that the Postal Service's prohibition on solicitation outside postal buildings did not meet First Amendment standards as it unnecessarily restricted speech. Judge Garland has ruled on commercial speech cases, affirming the FTC's authority to regulate misleading commercial speech and upholding a regulation mandating disclosure of country-of-origin information for meat products. These decisions show his support for protecting consumer interests through speech regulations. Judge Garland has shown a history of supporting consumer interests through speech regulations, particularly in commercial speech cases. He has also sided with public employees in First Amendment cases, even when it goes against government authority. In Mpoy v. Rhee, he acknowledged potential conflicts with Supreme Court precedent while ruling for the government on qualified immunity grounds. Judge Garland's rulings on commercial speech and public employee speech may indicate a departure from recent Supreme Court majorities. In Lee v. DOJ, he dissented on journalists' privilege to refuse to testify in civil suits. Judge Garland argued that the court's decision in the case should not be underestimated, emphasizing the importance of protecting journalists' confidential sources to prevent chilling effects on free speech. He also supported the dissenting opinion in Boehner v. McDermott, asserting that the government cannot punish the publication of lawfully obtained information. Judge Garland's stance on the First Amendment protects the publication of information lawfully obtained from a source who obtained it unlawfully, providing strong safeguards for public interest disclosures. His decisions show a broad view of free speech protections, especially for journalists. However, due to limited involvement in free speech cases, his overall views on the matter remain unclear. Judge Garland's stance on free speech issues remains unclear, unlike Justice Scalia who was critical of using foreign law to interpret the Constitution. Garland has not expressed a clear opinion on the matter, only stating that it is a debated topic among Supreme Court Justices. Judge Garland has decided cases involving conflicting federal statutes and international legal agreements, applying canons of construction like the \"last-in-time\" rule. He has not taken a clear stance on using foreign law to interpret the Constitution, unlike Justice Scalia. Judge Garland applies canons of construction like the \"last-in-time\" rule when deciding cases involving conflicting federal statutes and international legal agreements. He tends to interpret statutory provisions in a way that avoids abrogating earlier international agreements if possible, as seen in cases such as Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association, Inc. v. U.S. Department of Transportation. The FMCSA exempted commercial vehicle operators licensed by Mexico or Canada from medical certification requirements to uphold previous agreements. Judge Garland's approach in interpreting statutes aims to avoid abrogating international agreements, as seen in cases like Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association, Inc. v. U.S. Department of Transportation. Justice Scalia and Judge Garland have differing approaches to interpreting federal statutes in relation to international legal obligations. While Justice Scalia recognized that background presumptions may inform statutory interpretation, he supported aligning federal statutes with international legal obligations when possible. Judge Garland, on the other hand, has shown a commitment to avoiding abrogating international agreements in cases like Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association, Inc. v. U.S. Department of Transportation. The variation in their approaches adds uncertainty to how Congress's intent regarding international legal norms is interpreted. Justice Scalia and Judge Garland have differing approaches to interpreting federal statutes in relation to international legal obligations. Justice Scalia advocated aligning federal statutes with international legal norms in cases involving foreign sovereign jurisdiction, while Judge Garland showed a commitment to avoiding conflicts with international agreements. Their limited cases together make it hard to predict if they would consistently reach the same conclusions. Judge Garland's jurisprudence suggests he, like Justice Scalia, would interpret federal statutes in line with international legal obligations when necessary. During his time on the D.C. Circuit, Judge Garland has not directly addressed the Second Amendment or firearms regulations in his judicial opinions or writings outside the court. However, he has voted on cases related to these issues, with his notable dissent in Parker v. District of Columbia in 2007. Some commentators have debated the implications of his votes on his broader views in this area of law. Judge Garland's dissent in Parker v. District of Columbia in 2007 highlighted his stance on Second Amendment issues. He also voted against en banc review of cases challenging D.C. gun restrictions, which were eventually overturned in Heller. Earlier votes by Judge Garland touched on Second Amendment issues, showing his perspective on firearm regulations. In National Rifle Association of America, Inc. (NRA) v. Reno, Judge Garland upheld a DOJ rule allowing temporary retention of firearms background check information. The ruling did not evaluate the constitutionality of firearm laws. This case, along with others, may not provide a clear picture of Judge Garland's stance on the Second Amendment and firearms restrictions. Garland's approach to separation of powers is not clearly defined in his writings from the bench. Clues may be found in his opinions and decisions to join or refuse to join fellow judges' opinions. For example, in a case challenging the Affordable Care Act, Garland did not join Judge Kavanaugh's dissent, which took a formalist approach. Judge Garland's approach to separation of powers is not clearly defined in his writings from the bench. In a case involving the interpretation of the Origination Clause, Judge Garland declined to sign a statement endorsing a specific test, leaving his views ambiguous. It is unclear why he chose not to participate in this particular decision, but his silence could indicate support for the original panel opinion or a preference for leaving the matter to Congress. Judge Garland's lack of significant participation in the Zivotofsky cases at the D.C. Circuit suggests a possible preference for applying the political question doctrine. This decision was subsequently reversed by the Supreme Court, emphasizing the judiciary's duty to resolve separation of powers questions regarding Congress's authority in matters involving the executive power to recognize foreign sovereigns. Judge Garland's dissent in In re Aiken County raised questions about the Executive's authority to disregard federal statutes, leading to a grant of mandamus for compliance with a statutory mandate. In a dissenting opinion, Judge Garland argued against granting a petition for mandamus to force compliance with federal statutes by the NRC, citing the agency's lack of funds as a reasonable justification. He believed that forcing the NRC to spend remaining funds on a project with no real chance of progress would not uphold the separation of powers. Judge Garland's pragmatic approach leans towards the functionalist school of separation of powers thought, with a hesitancy to interfere with the executive branch. In a case involving the interpretation of \"agency records\" under FOIA, he cited separation of powers concerns in protecting White House access records from disclosure, to safeguard the President's ability to conduct confidential meetings. In the decade and a half since September 11, 2001, the D.C. Circuit has dealt with separation of powers issues regarding the wartime role of the judicial branch in cases involving detainees at Guantanamo Bay. Judge Garland joined a decision in Al Odah v. United States that denied jurisdiction to examine the lawfulness of executive detention of foreign nationals at Guantanamo, a decision later reversed by the Supreme Court in Rasul v. Bush. Judge Garland voted with a unanimous panel to uphold a less rigorous evidentiary standard for detainee cases and affirmed the denial of the writ. He also found habeas jurisdiction available to challenge detention conditions at Guantanamo but ultimately deferred to the government's security rationale in Parhat v. Gates. In Parhat v. Gates, Judge Garland and a unanimous panel refused to validate a Combatant Status Review Tribunal decision due to insufficient evidence of the petitioner's affiliation with an \"associated force\" fighting alongside Al Qaeda or the Taliban. This decision showed a limit to judicial deference to executive discretion in military matters, as mandated by Congress. The Parhat court found that reliance on intelligence documents was unsupported in CSRT challenges. Judge Garland's opinion in Parhat continues to be cited in detainee habeas cases for the requirement that government evidence must be assessable for reliability. The D.C. Circuit has scrutinized the executive branch more closely in detainee cases following prodding from the Supreme Court. Judge Garland's participation in detainee habeas cases at Guantanamo indicates his alignment with the mainstream D.C. Circuit judicial thought on evaluating executive branch detention. The D.C. Circuit declined to defer to Congress's assertion on the charge of material support for terrorism under the Military Commission Act of 2006, stating it is not their role to rewrite the statute. Prevailing in court for Guantanamo detainees remains challenging despite closer scrutiny of the executive branch by the court. The court vacated the accused's conviction for material support of terrorism and solicitation on ex post facto grounds but sent his conspiracy conviction back for further consideration of constitutional challenges. Judge Garland's vote with the majority may be seen as asserting the judiciary's primacy in interpreting the law. On remand, the panel reversed the remaining conspiracy charge. On remand, the panel reversed the remaining charge for conspiracy, holding that Congress had encroached upon Article III judicial power by authorizing military commissions to try the purely domestic crime of inchoate conspiracy. The full court vacated this decision and ordered rehearing en banc, possibly setting up another opportunity to consider Judge Garland's approach to separation of powers clashes. Because the docket of the D.C. Circuit tends to focus less on social issues than the dockets of the regional circuit courts of appeals do, Judge Garland has had few opportunities to express his views on the scope of the substantive component of the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, the source for various unenumerated rights that have been recognized by the Supreme Court over the years, including the right to privacy, the right to an abortion, and the right to marry. Judge Garland has limited experience with cases involving abortion regulations. His votes suggest a moderate view on substantive due process issues. For example, he voted against terminally ill patients accessing experimental drugs. He also opposes the idea that Due Process Clauses protect economic liberties. Judge Garland, in a majority opinion, upheld the constitutionality of the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992, citing a rational legislative purpose to address a health care funding crisis in the coal industry. Unlike Justice Scalia, Garland did not wholly reject the concept of substantive due process, as seen in his decisions. Judge Garland has shown a willingness to recognize affirmative duties on state officials in certain circumstances under the Due Process Clauses, as seen in cases like Butera v. District of Columbia. He also did not fully agree with Judge Silberman's opinion in Hutchins v. District of Columbia regarding the juvenile curfew law. Judge Silberman argued that judicial examinations of due process rights should start with a careful description of the asserted right, emphasizing a narrow view of due process rights. He concluded that juveniles do not have a fundamental right to be out at night without adult supervision. Judge Garland, along with Judge Patricia Wald, concurred with the result but argued that the curfew law passed intermediate constitutional scrutiny, impacting the constitutional rights of children and parents. While Judge Garland's approach to substantive due process rights is not well-known, he has shown a willingness to recognize affirmative duties on state officials in certain cases. Judge Garland has a broader view of substantive due process rights compared to Judge Silberman. While Judge Silberman emphasized a narrow view of due process rights, Judge Garland has shown a willingness to recognize affirmative duties on state officials in certain cases. He has said little about private property rights and takings issues, as the D.C. Circuit does not hear many takings claims. The CFC has exclusive jurisdiction over takings claims, with appeals going to the Federal Circuit. Judge Garland's views on the Takings Clause are uncertain due to lack of cases against the District of Columbia during his time on the court."
