    "content": "The Act titled \"Wind Energy Research and Development Act of 2016\" establishes a program for wind energy research and development. The Wind Energy Research and Development Act of 2016 mandates the Secretary of Energy to conduct research to enhance wind energy generation efficiency, reliability, and capacity, optimize design for various atmospheric conditions, and reduce costs. The program focuses on improving wind power plant performance, exploring new materials and designs for innovative wind energy systems. The Wind Energy Research and Development Act of 2016 mandates research on new materials and designs for innovative wind turbine rotor and drivetrain concepts, including higher tip speed, low noise, cost-effective designs, advanced drivetrain, and generator concepts, as well as offshore wind-specific projects such as fixed and floating substructures, hurricane wind flow impacts, innovative operations and maintenance strategies, and offshore meteorological analysis. The Wind Energy Research and Development Act of 2016 mandates research on new materials and designs for innovative wind turbine rotor and drivetrain concepts, including higher tip speed, low noise, cost-effective designs, advanced drivetrain, and generator concepts, as well as offshore wind-specific projects such as fixed and floating substructures, hurricane wind flow impacts, innovative operations and maintenance strategies, offshore meteorological and oceanographic data collection, infrastructure monitoring, wind power forecasting, distributed wind energy sector, transformational technologies for harnessing wind energy, and other research areas determined by the Secretary. The Wind Energy Technology Validation and Market Transformation Program is established under SEC. 3. It focuses on research and development of new materials and designs for innovative wind turbine rotor and drivetrain concepts, including offshore wind-specific projects. The Secretary of Energy conducts a wind energy technology validation and market transformation program to demonstrate and validate new cost-competitive wind energy technologies. Projects are done in collaboration with industry and academic institutions, with a focus on measuring wind energy system performance in various wind conditions across the United States. The curr_chunk states compliance with sections 988(a)-(d) and 989 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The curr_chunk focuses on the Wind Energy Expansion Program. The Wind Energy Expansion Program aims to reduce barriers to widespread adoption of wind power, including grid integration challenges and permitting issues related to wildlife, radar systems, and airspace impacts. It also supports the development of wildlife impact mitigation technologies for species like eagles and bats, and includes education and outreach activities. The Wind Energy Expansion Program aims to reduce barriers to wind power adoption, including grid integration and permitting issues. It also supports education and outreach activities for promoting public understanding of wind technologies. The Wind Energy Incubator Fund will support innovative technologies not currently in the Department of Energy's wind energy research portfolio. The Secretary of Energy will coordinate activities with other relevant programs, and $200,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2017 to 2021."
