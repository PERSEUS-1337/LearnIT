The \"Transit Benefits Modernization Act\" is aimed at addressing safety concerns in the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), which serves millions of commuters and visitors in the National Capital Region. Approximately 40 percent of peak-hour WMATA commuters are Federal employees. WMATA's SafeTrack plan aims to address deferred maintenance issues identified by the Federal Transit Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board. SafeTrack is a plan by WMATA to address deferred maintenance issues with 15 \"Safety Surges\" impacting rush hour commutes. FTA found defects in the plan's execution, and SafeTrack is scheduled to conclude in March 2017. WMATA encourages customers to use ride-sharing services during this time. Following SafeTrack, WMATA has indicated that service disruptions will continue for routine maintenance. The Federal Government is interested in assisting employees with alternate commuting options to address the negative impact on their ability to commute to and from work. The Act provides a fringe transit benefit for Federal employees using transportation network companies, treating it as a qualified transportation fringe. Additionally, it offers transit benefits for Federal employees using digital transportation companies. During the specified period, agencies must provide transit benefits to employees using digital transportation companies in the Washington Metropolitan Area. Employees must agree not to accept other transit or parking benefits to be eligible for these benefits. Employees in the Washington Metropolitan Area can receive transit benefits from agencies if they use digital transportation companies. The amount of the benefit cannot exceed the employee's previous 6-month average. The benefits should be provided similarly to mass transportation services. The transit benefit program allows federal employees in the Washington Metropolitan Area to receive transit benefits through digital transportation companies. Procedures are established with agencies to provide and substantiate the use of these benefits each month. The term \"Washington Metropolitan Area\" includes specific counties and cities in Maryland and Virginia. A \"digital transportation company\" refers to a transportation network company or car-sharing service. A \"car-sharing service\" is designed for shorter trips where individuals are charged per mile or per hour. A \"transportation network company\" is any entity providing transportation services. A digital transportation company connects riders to drivers for transportation services."
