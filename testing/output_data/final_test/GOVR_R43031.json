    "content": "In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in District of Columbia v. Heller that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to possess a firearm for self-defense. The Court later affirmed in McDonald v. City of Chicago that this right also applies to the states. The decisions did not invalidate all gun regulations, acknowledging the validity of laws restricting firearms for felons and in sensitive places like schools. Since the Heller and McDonald cases, federal and state firearms laws have been challenged under the Second Amendment. Lower courts have established a standard of review for determining if a law violates the Second Amendment. Categories of laws challenged include restrictions based on age and criminal history, state concealed carry laws, and assault weapons bans. This analysis may offer insight into how future firearms legislation could be assessed. In the 113th Congress, various gun control proposals have been introduced. In the 113th Congress, gun control proposals have been introduced, including measures to ban assault weapons and require background checks on private transfers of firearms. The question of the standard of scrutiny for laws regulating firearms remains open, with three levels of scrutiny: strict scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, and rational basis standard. The Court in Heller rejected the rational basis test and Justice Breyer's \"interest-balancing\" inquiry, not establishing a clear judicial standard. Lower courts have applied an approach of analogizing challenged firearms provisions to those deemed \"presumptively lawful\" in Heller, finding them constitutional without extensive analysis or a specific standard of scrutiny. Courts have upheld bans on possession by felons, substance abusers, illegal aliens, and those convicted of domestic violence, even if not \"longstanding.\" The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit established a framework for evaluating firearms laws not deemed \"presumptively lawful\" in Heller, such as the federal ban on possession of firearms under 18 U.S.C. Section 922(k). In Marzzarella, the Third Circuit interpreted 18 U.S.C. Section 922(k), the federal ban on unmarked firearms possession. They considered two possibilities for how \"presumptively lawful\" categories should be treated, favoring the view that regulations outside the scope of the Second Amendment do not require heightened scrutiny. This interpretation aligns with the Heller decision's two-step approach to evaluating firearms laws. The Third Circuit in Marzzarella interpreted the federal ban on unmarked firearms possession under 18 U.S.C. Section 922(k). They considered the scope of the Second Amendment's guarantee and the types of regulations that might burden conduct protected by it. The court rejected the argument that firearms without serial numbers should be protected under the Second Amendment, as it found the characteristic of serial numbers to be unrelated to the core right of law-abiding citizens to possess non-dangerous weapons for self-defense in the home. The Third Circuit in Marzzarella analyzed the federal ban on unmarked firearms possession under 18 U.S.C. Section 922(k), questioning the relevance of serial numbers to the Second Amendment. Despite uncertainty, the court assumed the ban burdened Second Amendment rights and applied intermediate scrutiny, similar to content-neutral regulations. The Third Circuit analyzed Section 922(k) regarding firearms possession, applying intermediate scrutiny to determine that the statute reasonably fits the government's interest in preserving serial numbers for tracing purposes. Many courts use the Third Circuit's two-part inquiry to assess if firearms laws violate the Second Amendment. The Gun Control Act of 1968 aims to prevent certain individuals from possessing firearms due to age, criminal history, or incompetency. This Act regulates the manufacture, sale, transfer, and possession of firearms and ammunition. For example, it prohibits licensed dealers from selling handguns to minors. Under federal law, firearms licensees are prohibited from selling handguns to individuals under 21 and long guns to those under 18. Licensed dealers must follow requirements to prevent firearms from being transferred to disqualified individuals, including those convicted of certain crimes, fugitives, and individuals with mental health issues or drug addiction. Additionally, aliens illegally in the US and those admitted on nonimmigrant visas are also prohibited from possessing firearms. The federal law prohibits firearms licensees from selling handguns to individuals under 21 and long guns to those under 18. Certain individuals are disqualified from possessing firearms, including those convicted of crimes, fugitives, individuals with mental health issues or drug addiction, aliens illegally in the US, and those admitted on nonimmigrant visas. Judicial decisions have evaluated the constitutionality of these restrictions, including the federal age requirement and prohibition on misdemeanants of domestic violence from possessing firearms. The federal law prohibits selling handguns to individuals under 21 and long guns to those under 18. The constitutionality of this law was challenged for violating the Second Amendment rights of 18-to-20-year-old adults. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit adopted a historical analysis approach to determine if the law aligns with Second Amendment traditions. The court concluded that the ban is consistent with historical gun restrictions. The Fifth Circuit upheld the federal law banning handgun sales to under 21 and long guns to under 18, stating it aligns with historical gun restrictions and does not burden Second Amendment rights. The court applied intermediate scrutiny due to similarities with other lawful bans and concluded the government met its burden. The Seventh Circuit vacated and remanded a conviction under 18 U.S.C. Section 922(g)(9), noting the limiting language in Heller and cautioning against upholding gun laws without further analysis. The court favored an analytical framework similar to Marzzarella, evaluating the prohibition under means-end scrutiny. It applied intermediate scrutiny because the challenged provision is removed from the core constitutional right identified in Heller. The Seventh Circuit in Skoien I vacated charges against the defendant due to the government's failure to establish a reasonable fit between reducing domestic gun violence and Section 922(g)(9). The Seventh Circuit vacated the defendant's charges in Skoien I, giving the government time to make its case. The en banc Seventh Circuit rejected the Second Amendment challenge to Section 922(g)(9), stating that the government demonstrated a substantial relation between the law and an important governmental objective. In United States v. Chester, the Fourth Circuit provided guidance on deciding Second Amendment challenges, following a two-step approach outlined in Marzzarella. The Fourth Circuit in United States v. Chester outlined a two-step approach from Marzzarella for Second Amendment challenges. The court emphasized historical inquiry to determine if the regulation burdens conduct historically understood within the Second Amendment's scope. The court noted that Section 922(g)(9) should be evaluated based on whether a person, rather than conduct, is unprotected by the Second Amendment, and historical data is inconclusive on felons' Second Amendment rights. The Fourth Circuit assumed the defendant had some Second Amendment protection for self-defense in his home, but not the core right identified in Heller due to his criminal history as a domestic violence misdemeanant. The government had to meet intermediate scrutiny, presenting evidence that the ban on misdemeanants of domestic violence helps decrease firearm use in such incidents. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia upheld this decision. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia upheld the statute banning misdemeanants of domestic violence from owning firearms, stating that there may be variation in how courts apply the two-step inquiry to assess Second Amendment protection. The Fifth Circuit did not analyze the federal age requirement under the second prong of the two-step analysis, while the Fourth Circuit in Chester assumed domestic violence misdemeanants are entitled to Second Amendment protection. When facing a Second Amendment challenge to a prohibition on a category of persons without historical basis, a reviewing court may apply heightened means-end scrutiny. States regulate concealed carrying of firearms as \"shall-issue\" or \"may-issue\" jurisdictions, with some issuing permits only to residents and others to both residents and non-residents. In \"shall-issue\" states, permits must be granted if statutory requirements are met. In \"may-issue\" jurisdictions, the issuing authority has discretion to grant or deny a concealed carry permit (CCP) based on statutory factors. States decide which out-of-state permits to recognize, and challenged laws often require showing good cause for eligibility. Heller and McDonald emphasized that the right to bear arms is not unlimited, and mere regulation does not infringe on the Second Amendment right. The Second Amendment right extends beyond the home, but measures forbidding carrying firearms in sensitive places are considered lawful. Courts are evaluating whether concealed carry laws burden the right of self-defense. Courts evaluate the constitutionality of concealed carry laws, considering the burden on the Second Amendment right of self-defense. In Peruta v. County of San Diego, the court upheld California's law requiring residents to demonstrate \"good cause\" for a concealed carry permit, finding it did not violate the Second Amendment. The court also questioned if the right to carry a loaded handgun in public is protected under the Second Amendment, but did not make a definitive ruling. The court upheld California's concealed carry law, finding it similar to past cases upholding state prohibitions on carrying concealed weapons. California's open carry provisions allow for the open carry of a loaded firearm under certain circumstances for immediate self-defense. The court also determined that California's concealed carry measure passes intermediate scrutiny. In Williams v. Maryland, the court upheld the state provision prohibiting carrying a handgun openly or concealed without a permit. The court upheld California's concealed carry law, citing past cases supporting state prohibitions on carrying concealed weapons. The court found that the general ban on carrying a firearm includes an exception for home possession without a permit, aligning with Heller's recognition of handguns for home protection. In contrast, the Tenth Circuit ruled that concealed carry is not protected by the Second Amendment, analyzing Colorado's concealed carry provision in Peterson v. Martinez. The Tenth Circuit upheld Colorado's concealed carry law, stating that restrictions on concealed carry are long-standing and align with the Second Amendment. The court did not conduct a means-end analysis as the challenger's claim failed at the first step. Other courts have reached different conclusions on similar regulations, applying intermediate scrutiny. The U.S. District Court in Woollard v. Sheridan analyzed Maryland's requirement for a \"good and substantial reason\" to obtain a CCP. Despite the Fourth Circuit's reversal, the district court's decision may influence other courts. The court considered the Second Amendment's scope outside the home, concluding that Heller suggests it applies beyond the home. The U.S. District Court in Woollard v. Sheridan analyzed Maryland's requirement for a \"good and substantial reason\" to obtain a CCP. The court concluded that the Second Amendment applies beyond the home, as suggested by Heller, and protects lawful purposes such as hunting and militia training. The district court found that the \"good and substantial reason\" requirement infringes upon the Second Amendment as it is not reasonably adapted to a substantial government interest. The U.S. District Court found Maryland's \"good and substantial reason\" requirement for a concealed carry permit overly broad and not advancing public safety interests. In contrast, the Second Circuit upheld New York's law requiring \"proper cause\" for a concealed handgun license, applying intermediate scrutiny due to substantial limits on self-defense in public. The Second Circuit upheld New York's law requiring \"proper cause\" for a concealed handgun license, stating that only individuals with a bona fide reason should be allowed to carry handguns in public. Unlike other laws scrutinized by courts, the Supreme Court in Heller briefly addressed the types of weapons protected by the Second Amendment. The Supreme Court in Heller limited the Second Amendment to protect weapons typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes. This limitation is based on the historical tradition of prohibiting \"dangerous and unusual weapons\" and protecting weapons \"in common use at the time.\" Courts have upheld state assault weapons bans under the Second Amendment, relying on the \"common use\" language from Heller. The California Court of Appeals in People v. James upheld the state's ban on assault weapons, stating that possession of such weapons is not protected by the Second Amendment. The court relied on Heller's discussion that the Second Amendment does not protect military weapons, declaring that the banned weapons are not typically possessed for lawful purposes like sport hunting. The California Court of Appeals upheld the state's ban on assault weapons, stating that these are not weapons typically possessed for lawful purposes like sport hunting or self-defense, but rather weapons of war. The District of Columbia also enacted similar firearms regulations after the Heller decision, including an assault weapons ban. In Heller II, the D.C. Circuit upheld the ban on certain semiautomatic rifles and large capacity ammunition feeding devices. The court analyzed the ban on semi-automatic rifles and high-capacity magazines under the Second Amendment, finding that they are not commonly used for self-defense or hunting. The regulations were reviewed under intermediate scrutiny, with the government needing to show a substantial relationship between the ban and public safety. The D.C. Circuit upheld the ban on semiautomatic assault rifles and LCAFDs, stating it promotes crime control in urban areas. In a similar case in Illinois, the court evaluated the constitutionality of a similar assault weapons ban, finding it did not violate the Second Amendment. The court remanded the Second Amendment claim regarding assault weapons ban for further proceedings, citing the need for evidence to justify the ordinance's nexus with governmental interest. This decision aligns with previous cases evaluating assault weapons bans, referencing the Heller decision and lower court frameworks for Second Amendment claims. The lower courts have developed a framework for analyzing Second Amendment claims, focusing on whether prohibited weapons are in \"common use\" for lawful purposes or \"dangerous and unusual.\" It is uncertain if a weapon must be in \"common use\" for self-defense or hunting to be protected under the Second Amendment. If prohibited weapons do not meet these criteria, they may not be protected by the Second Amendment. A reviewing court could evaluate such measures under a two-step inquiry. The court may apply heightened scrutiny to restrictions on certain firearms and accessories if they burden Second Amendment rights. The connection between the \"common use\" and \"dangerous and unusual\" criteria in the two-step approach is unclear. Differences in interpreting Heller and applying the two-step inquiry impact the government's burden of proof in upholding firearms laws. Courts have differing interpretations on presumptively lawful restrictions under the Second Amendment. The court in Woollard believed these measures are deeply rooted in the Second Amendment, while the Third Circuit in Marzzarella viewed them as historical limitations. Both applied intermediate scrutiny, but the latter interpretation could lead to exceptions to the Second Amendment. The interpretation of presumptively lawful restrictions under the Second Amendment can impact the likelihood of upholding firearms regulations. This could favor the government if regulations align with Heller provisions, but require \"meaningful evidence\" if not. Different interpretations affect how lower courts define Second Amendment rights and the level of scrutiny applied. Judge Kavanaugh proposed a different approach to evaluating challenges under the Second Amendment, emphasizing assessment based on text, history, and tradition rather than a balancing test like strict or intermediate scrutiny. However, the Second Circuit in Kachalsky seemed to reject this approach, stating that history shows states often disagreed on the right to bear arms. Some parties challenging firearms laws advocate a different approach to evaluate gun measures, suggesting applying First Amendment prior restraint doctrine. This argument has been rejected so far, with no court importing substantive First Amendment principles into Second Amendment jurisprudence. Firearms laws, both existing and new, will continue to be challenged. The Supreme Court's Heller decision has provided limited guidance on analyzing firearms regulations under the Second Amendment. Lower courts have primarily used a two-step inquiry to evaluate if regulations burden the Second Amendment right and if they pass means-end scrutiny. It remains unclear if there is a better understanding of the Second Amendment's scope beyond the \"core\" right identified in Heller, as courts have varied in their evaluations. Challenges to firearms provisions post-Heller are ongoing in lower courts, with potential for different analytical frameworks to be used. The Supreme Court's Heller decision has provided limited guidance on analyzing firearms regulations under the Second Amendment. Lower courts have used a two-step inquiry to evaluate if regulations burden the Second Amendment right and pass means-end scrutiny. Challenges to firearms provisions post-Heller are ongoing in lower courts, with potential for different analytical frameworks to be used, such as the \"history, text, and tradition\" test or prior restraints analysis."
