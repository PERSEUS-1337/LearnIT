    "content": "The \"Broadband Internet Fairness Act\" may be cited as the short title of this Act. Congress recognizes the importance of increased broadband deployment for economic recovery and growth. They emphasize that volume usage charges for broadband must be based on cost to be considered fair, and charges substantially above cost in a non-competitive market are deemed unfair and anti-competitive. The market for video delivery is controlled by companies offering cable and broadband services, leading to potential price increases for high-volume Internet use. The Federal Trade Commission can investigate and address unfair pricing practices by Internet service providers, as they are not subject to common carrier regulations. SEC. 3. UNJUST, UNREASONABLE, OR UNREASONABLY DISCRIMINATORY VOLUME USAGE SERVICE PLANS. SEC. 3 prohibits major broadband Internet service providers from offering unjust, unreasonable, or unreasonably discriminatory volume usage service plans. Providers must file a service plan analysis with the Federal Trade Commission for any proposed plans, detailing service tiers, rates, and economic justifications. The proposed volume usage service plans must justify capital and operating costs, assess impact on residential consumers' access to Internet services, and specify the basis for rate revisions. The charges under the service plan will be revised over the next 3 years, taking into account inflation factors or other variables. The Federal Trade Commission will enforce the regulations. The Federal Trade Commission will enforce the regulations regarding volume usage service plans, treating violations as unfair or deceptive acts. The Commission will review and address any elements of non-compliance in submitted service plan analyses. The Commission will notify providers of any violations in their service plans and provide steps to correct them. Factors considered include proper assignment of operating costs and justification of rates based on deployment or operation costs. The Commission will assess whether the volume usage service plan imposes unjust charges on residential consumers, deters access to Internet applications, hinders economic growth, and unfairly penalizes high bandwidth users. The Commission will review volume usage service plans to determine if they have anti-competitive effects on video delivery or Internet markets, impose anti-consumer rates, or fail to comply with regulations. Hearings will be conducted as part of the review process. The Commission will conduct public hearings and collect public comments on volume usage service plans to address any violations identified. Major broadband Internet service providers who violate section 3(a) may be subject to civil penalties. The Act allows for injunctive relief against broadband Internet service providers who violate section 3(a), with potential fines up to $1,000,000 for ongoing compliance. Within 180 days of enactment, the Commission must establish procedures for reviewing service plans and conducting public hearings. The Act does not limit the Commission's enforcement authority under other laws. The Act defines key terms related to broadband internet service providers, including the Commission, broadband internet service, broadband internet service provider, and major broadband internet service provider. The Act defines terms related to broadband internet service providers, including volume usage service plans for residential consumers. The Act defines terms related to broadband internet service providers for residential consumers, with common terminology referencing the Communications Act of 1934."
