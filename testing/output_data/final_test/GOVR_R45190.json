    "content": "When legislation is enacted under the U.S. Constitution, it is classified as public or private law based on its audience. Public laws apply to society at large, while private laws benefit specific individuals or entities. Each new law is assigned a number in order of enactment within a Congress, starting from the 85th Congress in 1957. Researchers seeking a copy of a new law can obtain it through this system. The \"slip law\" is the first official publication of a public or private law, prepared by the Office of the Federal Register (OFR) and published by the Government Publishing Office (GPO). It can be obtained online from GPO or through Federal Depository Libraries. Public and private laws can also be found on Congress.gov. Congress.gov is the official website for U.S. federal legislative information, providing access to public and private laws from the 93rd Congress (1973-1974) onwards. Commercial sources like Lexis Advance, ProQuest Congressional, and Westlaw also offer access to slip laws and public laws from various legislative sessions. Public laws from 1973 to present are reprinted in the United States Code Congressional and Administrative News (USCCAN) by Thomson Reuters. The laws are compiled chronologically in slip law format, along with Senate, House, and conference reports, presidential signing statements, and executive orders. USCCAN is available in both bound volume and electronic format through a Westlaw subscription. Every two years, slip laws are accumulated and published in the United States Statutes at Large, which also includes concurrent resolutions, reorganization plans, proposed amendments to the Constitution, and presidential proclamations. Treaties and international agreements approved by the Senate were published in the Statutes at Large until 1948. The Statutes at Large contains laws approved by the Senate and is considered legal evidence in US courts. Access to the publication is available electronically from 1951-2011 through GPO and earlier volumes can be found in the Law Library of Congress's Digitized Collection. Commercial sources also provide access to the Statutes at Large, with Hein Online offering volumes from 1789 to present. Hein Online, Lexis Advance, ProQuest Congressional, and Westlaw provide access to the Statutes at Large from 1789 to present. The United States Code (U.S.C.) is the official codification of all general and permanent laws, originating from the Revised Statutes of 1874. The United States Code (U.S.C.) is the official codification of all general and permanent laws, originating from the Revised Statutes of 1874. The U.S. Code has been published every six years since 1926, with the current edition printed in 2012 and updated annually. Statutes are grouped by subject matter into 54 titles and five appendices, organized into chapters and sections for citation purposes. The U.S. Code is an official compilation of laws, with provisions cited by section numbers. Source credits and historical notes provide additional information. The Office of the Law Revision Counsel maintains and publishes the U.S. Code, organizing statutes by subject matter. The U.S. Code is organized by subject matter and maintained by the Office of the Law Revision Counsel. Provisions not intended to be permanent or with limited relevance may not be included in the U.S. Code but still hold significance as acts of Congress. The language in the U.S. Code may not be an exact replica of the original law. The U.S. Code is organized by subject matter and maintained by the Office of the Law Revision Counsel. A slip law may be divided among titles in the U.S. Code, with changes reflecting subsequent laws. The U.S. Code includes amended language and may introduce new provisions or revise existing statutes. For example, in 1952, Congress passed the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). In 1952, Congress passed the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) which consolidated federal law on aliens in the U.S. In 1986, the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) added \u00a7274A to the INA. This amendment is reflected in 8 U.S.C. \u00a71324a. In 1996, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) further amended \u00a7274A of the INA. Section 412 of IIRIRA amended \u00a7274A of the INA by adding new language and inserting additional subparagraphs. It is more effective to consult the U.S. Code for the current language of a statute rather than the slip law or the Statutes at Large. Resources are available to find amended public laws with up-to-date language. Congressional committees and federal agencies issue compilations of amended public laws, including significant statutes. Commercial publishers track changes to existing laws by new legislation. Congress began enacting whole titles of the U.S. Code into law in 1947, repealing underlying statutes. The authoritative legal language shifts from slip laws to the U.S. Code when titles are enacted into law. The process of \"positive law codification\" involves enacting whole titles of the U.S. Code into law to improve the organization, consistency, and accuracy of laws. This shift from slip laws to the U.S. Code enhances the Code's usefulness for legal research and verification. Positive law titles are more authoritative in federal and state courts compared to non-positive law titles. Positive law titles in the U.S. Code are more authoritative in courts compared to non-positive law titles. Currently, there are 27 positive law titles, which can be identified with an asterisk on the OLRC's U.S. Code \"Search & Browse\" page. The process of positive law codification is meticulous and time-consuming, with not all titles having undergone this process. Non-positive law titles are considered prima facie evidence of the Statutes at Large but may be refuted by the underlying statute if there is a disparity between the two statutes. The history of enacting laws differs between positive and non-positive law titles, with the first act listed in the history source credits being the \"base law\" in non-positive law titles. The Act of June 4, 1914 established the method for electing United States Senators. This law is the basis for 2 U.S.C. \u00a71, which outlines the election process. Positive law titles in the U.S. Code hold more authority in courts. The Act of June 25, 1948 codified Title 3 of the United States Code, including Section 7 on the election of President and Vice President by electors. This Act did not create the language of Section 7 but enacted it into positive law. A researcher seeking information on the history or intent of the language in positive law titles of the U.S. Code should examine the \"Front Matter\" at the beginning of the title, which includes a table showing the disposition of all sections of the former title and the original source credits. The OLRC conducts editorial reclassification projects to improve the organization of existing titles without altering statutory text. For example, Title IV, Part C of the Higher Education Act of 1965 was transferred from the Public Health and Welfare Title to the Education Title. Portions of Title 20 are being reordered to conform to a transfer. Researchers may use unofficial resources like U.S.C.A. and U.S.C.S. for additional annotations and references, but these should be cross-referenced with official publications like the U.S. Code. The U.S. Code incorporates statutes for easier retrieval and access, with resources like the General Index and Popular Names Table available in print and electronically. The Popular Names Table provides details on enacting laws, amending laws, and where enacted laws appear in the U.S. Code. Classification Tables indicate amendments, repeals, omissions, and transfers of sections in the U.S. Code. Table I shows incorporation of positive law sections into revised titles, while Table II classifies sections from the Revised Statutes of 1878 into the U.S. Code. Table III provides the corresponding U.S. Code section for Statutes at Large citations. Tables IV and V show where executive orders and presidential proclamations are codified in the U.S. Code. Table VI lists the status of reorganization plans since 1939, which are proposals by the President to restructure federal agencies for efficiency.
