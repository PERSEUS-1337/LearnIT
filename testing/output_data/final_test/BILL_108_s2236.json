The Electric Reliability Act of 2004 defines key terms related to the bulk-power system, including the Electric Reliability Organization and reliability standards. The Electric Reliability Act of 2004 defines key terms related to the bulk-power system, including reliability standards approved by the Commission for reliable operation of the system. Reliable operation means operating within system limits to prevent failures. The Electric Reliability Act of 2004 defines key terms related to the bulk-power system, including reliability standards approved by the Commission for reliable operation of the system. The term 'Interconnection' refers to a geographic area where bulk-power system components are synchronized to prevent cascading failures. The term 'transmission organization' includes Regional Transmission Organizations, Independent System Operators, and other approved entities for operating transmission facilities. The term 'regional entity' refers to an entity with specific responsibilities within the system. The Electric Reliability Act of 2004 defines key terms related to the bulk-power system, including reliability standards approved by the Commission for reliable operation. The Commission has jurisdiction over the ERO, regional entities, and all users, owners, and operators of the bulk-power system for enforcing compliance with reliability standards. Compliance is mandatory for all entities involved. The Commission must issue a final rule within 180 days to implement the requirements of this section. Following the enactment of this section, any person can apply to the Commission for certification as the Electric Reliability Organization. The Commission may certify an ERO if it can develop and enforce reliability standards ensuring the bulk-power system's reliability and independence from users and operators while maintaining fair stakeholder representation. The Electric Reliability Organization must allocate dues, fees, and charges equitably, enforce reliability standards fairly, provide public notice and comment opportunities, and maintain balance of interests in its duties. The Electric Reliability Organization must file proposed reliability standards with the Commission for approval, ensuring they are just, reasonable, non-discriminatory, and in the public interest. The Commission considers technical expertise in evaluating these standards. The Electric Reliability Organization must file proposed reliability standards with the Commission for approval, ensuring they are just, reasonable, non-discriminatory, and in the public interest. The Commission considers technical expertise in evaluating these standards, and any proposed standard or modification takes effect upon approval by the Commission. The Electric Reliability Organization presumes proposals from regional entities for Interconnection-wide reliability standards to be just, reasonable, and in the public interest. The Commission can remand disapproved standards back to the Electric Reliability Organization for further consideration. The Commission can order the Electric Reliability Organization to submit proposed reliability standards or modifications if deemed necessary. The final rule must include fair processes for resolving conflicts with existing Commission-approved agreements. The Commission can order changes to reliability standards if conflicts arise, and the Electric Reliability Organization must develop modified standards. The ERO has the authority to impose penalties on violators of approved reliability standards after a hearing process. The Electric Reliability Organization can impose penalties on violators of approved reliability standards after a hearing process. Penalties must be filed with the Commission and can take effect after 31 days, subject to review by the Commission. Application for review does not automatically stay the penalty unless ordered by the Commission. The Commission can review penalties imposed on users, owners, or operators of the bulk-power system. They can affirm, set aside, reinstate, or modify the penalty after a hearing process. The Commission may also order compliance with reliability standards and impose penalties if necessary. expedited procedures are in place for such hearings. The Commission can review penalties imposed on users, owners, or operators of the bulk-power system and may order compliance with reliability standards. Regulations authorize the ERO to delegate authority to a regional entity for proposing and enforcing reliability standards if certain conditions are met. The Commission can delegate authority to regional entities for effective administration of bulk-power system reliability. The Commission has the power to ensure compliance with reliability standards and may impose penalties that are proportionate to the violation. The Electric Reliability Organization must seek approval from the Commission for any rule changes, ensuring they are just, reasonable, and in the public interest. The ERO is responsible for assessing the reliability of the bulk-power system in North America. The ERO is urged to negotiate international agreements with Canada and Mexico for compliance with reliability standards. The ERO has authority over reliability standards for the bulk-power system only, not for additional generation or transmission capacity. States retain authority for safety and adequacy measures. The Commission has the authority to determine if a State's action is inconsistent with reliability standards and may stay the effectiveness of any State action. Regional advisory bodies can be established by the Commission upon petition from at least two-thirds of the States within a region. A regional advisory body, composed of members appointed by participating States' Governors, may provide advice on governance, standards, fees, and other responsibilities to the Electric Reliability Organization, regional entities, or the Commission. The Commission may consider this advice in its decision-making process. The Commission may defer to advice from regional advisory bodies organized on an Interconnection-wide basis. Alaska and Hawaii are exempt from the provisions of this section. The Electric Reliability Organization and regional entities are not part of the U.S. Government."
