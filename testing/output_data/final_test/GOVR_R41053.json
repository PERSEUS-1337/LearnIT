    "content": "The Obama Administration and Congress are addressing high unemployment rates with proposals for job growth, including incentives for small businesses, infrastructure spending, and clean energy initiatives. President Obama supports extending assistance provisions like Unemployment Compensation benefits and health insurance subsidies. The House passed the Jobs for Main Street Act, allocating $154 billion for infrastructure, public service jobs, and emergency relief. The House passed the Jobs for Main Street Act, allocating $154 billion for infrastructure, public service jobs, and emergency relief. This includes investments in highways, public transit, clean water, energy innovation, school renovation, and housing. Public service jobs funding aims to stabilize jobs for teachers, law enforcement officers, firefighters, and provide training for youth and college students. The House passed the Jobs for Main Street Act, allocating $154 billion for infrastructure, public service jobs, and emergency relief. This includes investments in highways, public transit, clean water, energy innovation, school renovation, and housing. The bill also aims to provide training for youth, help college students stay in school through work-study jobs, and extend UC and COBRA subsidies. Additionally, it would extend enhanced Medicaid matching provisions, expand the child tax credit, freeze federal poverty guidelines at 2009 levels, and extend surface transportation authorizations through FY2010. The Senate passed an amendment to provide tax credits for hiring and retaining unemployed workers, extend a tax provision for small businesses, and reauthorize certain transportation authorities. The House passed the Jobs for Main Street Act, allocating $154 billion for infrastructure, public service jobs, and emergency relief. This includes investments in highways, public transit, clean water, energy innovation, school renovation, and housing. The bill also aims to provide training for youth, help college students stay in school through work-study jobs, and extend UC and COBRA subsidies. Additionally, it would extend enhanced Medicaid matching provisions, expand the child tax credit, freeze federal poverty guidelines at 2009 levels, and extend surface transportation authorizations through FY2010. The Senate version of H.R. 2847 contains none of the education, training, or direct assistance provisions of the House-passed bill, except for provisions for school construction bonds. The House also passed the Temporary Extension Act of 2010 (H.R. 4691) to provide a shorter extension of some direct assistance provisions. The House-passed Jobs for Main Street Act includes provisions for an Education Jobs Fund, additional funding for Federal Work-Study programs, and modifications to Qualified Zone Academy Bonds and Qualified School Construction Bonds. The bill allocates $23 billion to offset potential job loss due to state budget shortfalls. The Education Jobs Fund is proposed to offset job loss from state budget shortfalls in the current economic climate. It is based on the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund created by ARRA, providing grants for education at various levels and public safety. Issues regarding federal funds supplanting state funds are discussed, along with estimates of state grants under the Education Jobs Fund. The Education Jobs Fund, funded at $53.6 billion in supplemental FY2009 appropriations, provides grants for education at different levels and public safety. States receive funds based on population measures, with $48.6 billion available for grants. State Fiscal Stabilization Funds are awarded in two phases, with about $11.5 billion to be awarded in the second phase. States had to apply for funds by January 11, 2010. The State Fiscal Stabilization Fund requires the state's governor to allocate 81.8% of the funds for education and 18.2% for public safety and government services, including assistance for education and facility improvements. The State Fiscal Stabilization Fund allows funds to be used by local educational agencies and institutions of higher education for various purposes, including activities authorized under education acts, modernization of school facilities, and education-related expenditures for public institutions of higher education. The State Fiscal Stabilization Fund grants funds for education purposes, including modernization of school facilities and support for struggling schools. States must provide information and assurances to the Secretary when applying for Phase 1 and Phase 2 grants. States receiving funds under the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund must submit a detailed report to the Secretary, including information on fund usage, job creation, tax increases averted, progress on assurances, tuition changes, enrollment shifts, and project funding. Federal aid to education should supplement, not replace, state and local funding. Federal funds for education should add to, not substitute for, state and local education funding. The fiscal accountability requirements ensure that federal funds increase resources for specific educational services, rather than replacing state or local funds. Maintenance of effort (MOE) is a key requirement for recipient LEAs to demonstrate continued state and local funding support. Maintenance of effort (MOE) requires LEAs to maintain a certain level of funding from state and local sources, while the supplement, not supplant (SNS) provision ensures that federal funds are used to enhance, not replace, existing state and local funding for education. The State Fiscal Stabilization Fund program under ARRA allows states or LEAs to use grants for education as \"non-federal funds\" to meet MOE requirements for any ED program in FY2009-FY2011, with approval from the Secretary of Education. The MOE requirement for this program can be waived or modified by the Secretary if certain conditions are met. The State Fiscal Stabilization Fund program allows states to use grants as \"non-federal funds\" to meet MOE requirements for any ED program in FY2009-FY2011. Approval is needed from the Secretary of Education. If a state reduces the proportion of total state revenues spent on education, the Secretary will consider the reasons for the reduction. However, approved states can reduce spending for K-12 education without losing eligibility for funding for IDEA and ESEA programs in FY2009-FY2011. The House-passed version of H.R. 2847 includes provisions for an Education Jobs Fund created by modifying statutory provisions for the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund. This would allow states to distribute funds differently and deviate from current authorized uses, impacting eligibility for IDEA and ESEA programs. The Education Jobs Fund, created by modifying the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund, would receive $23 billion in appropriations, half of the amount allocated for the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund. Funds could only be allotted to states and outlying areas based on established terms, with no reservations for administration or competitive grant programs. The Education Jobs Fund, unlike the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund, allows states to reserve up to 5% of grants for administrative costs and creating positions in education agencies. The Education Jobs Fund allows states to reserve up to 5% of grants for administrative costs and creating positions in education agencies. Funds for administration cannot exceed 1% of the state's total allocation. States must use the remaining funds to support elementary, secondary, and postsecondary education based on proportional reductions in state funding. The Education Jobs Fund provides funding for elementary, secondary, and postsecondary education based on proportional reductions in state funding. LEAs and IHEs can use the funds for various purposes, including compensation, benefits, support services, and facility modernization, renovation, or repair. The Education Jobs Fund provides funding for educational services, including wage subsidies for on-the-job training, hiring new employees for educational services, and facility modernization. It is unclear if funds can be used for support staff or only instructional staff. The Education Jobs Fund allows for wage subsidies for on-the-job training and hiring new employees in educational services. Funds can also be used for facility modernization and repair in public schools and higher education institutions. The duration of on-the-job training programs must be agreed upon by the local Workforce Investment Board and the employer. The Education Jobs Fund streamlines the application process for governors to receive funds, removing previous assurances and baseline data requirements. States must still outline how they plan to use funds to meet MOE requirements under ESEA and IDEA. Failure to submit an application by the deadline will result in the Secretary taking action. The Education Jobs Fund requires states to meet reporting requirements similar to the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund. If a state fails to submit an application by the deadline, the Secretary can distribute funds to another entity. Reporting on fund usage and job creation is mandatory. The Education Jobs Fund requires states to report to various committees on fund usage and compliance with MOE requirements. Recipients are prohibited from using funds for student financial assistance. The fund retains definitions from the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund and includes new provisions for fiscal accountability. The first provision in H.R. 2847 focuses on supplement, not supplant requirements for state rainy-day funds and state grants for debt reduction. States are prohibited from using funds for rainy-day funds or state debt reduction, except for complying with state budget rules. The term \"rainy-day fund\" is not defined in the bill, making it challenging to predict how the prohibition would be applied. The bill lacks a clear definition, making it hard to predict how the prohibition on using Education Jobs Funds for rainy-day funds or debt reduction would be applied across states. The exception allowing states to meet balanced budget requirements with fund balances is also unclear, as balanced budget rules vary by state. This lack of specificity and the variety of budget rules would make it difficult to track how states use the authority granted to them through the exception. The State Fiscal Stabilization Fund grants raised concerns about the fungibility of state revenue. Some states redirected education funding to meet requirements, potentially not resulting in a net gain in education funding. One state governor wanted to use the funds for debt reduction, which was deemed illegal by the Department of Education. The Education Jobs Fund may clarify congressional intent on fund use. Under Section 442 of GEPA, LEAs must provide assurances on fund administration, fiscal control, reporting, program planning, and equipment acquisition. If LEAs submitted assurances for the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund, they do not need to reapply for the Education Jobs Fund. Previous assurances apply to the Education Jobs Fund as well. States were required to provide assurances under the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund. The Education Jobs Fund does not have the same MOE requirements as the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund. Governors must assure that the state will meet MOE requirements for FY2010 and FY2011. Unlike the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund, the MOE for the Education Jobs Fund is based on aggregate support for elementary, secondary, and public higher education. The state must maintain support for elementary, secondary, and public higher education at a certain level for FY2010 and FY2011 to meet MOE requirements. The Education Jobs Fund would require the state to maintain support for education at FY2009 levels or a percentage of total revenues equal to FY2010 levels. The Secretary could waive requirements related to fiscal effort if needed. The Education Jobs Fund grants waivers for maintaining support for education at certain levels, allowing states and LEAs to use the funds for various education programs. Table 1 shows estimated state grant amounts available under the fund. The Education Jobs Fund provides grants to states based on population shares, ranging from $39 million to $2.8 billion. The Federal Work-Study program offers need-based aid to students for paid employment related to their field of study or community service. Federal Work-Study (FWS) program funding is allocated to institutions based on factors like student financial need and program availability. Funds are awarded through a two-stage process, with a portion based on prior funding and a portion on a need-based formula. Students receive compensation from federal and matching employer funds, with a maximum federal share of 75%. In FY2009, $980.5 million was allocated, with an additional $200 million from ARRA. The FWS program received level funding for FY2010, with a proposed additional $300 million in the House-passed version of H.R. 2847. Tax credit bonds like QZABs and QSCBs allow investors to claim a federal tax credit based on the bond's par value for a limited time, delivering a larger federal subsidy to issuers compared to traditional bonds. Tax credit bonds like QZABs and QSCBs provide a larger federal subsidy to issuers compared to traditional bonds by delivering the full taxable interest rate as a subsidy. The government entity issuing the bond is only obligated to repay the principal, with the federal government effectively making \"payments\" to investors through tax credits. The House-passed version of H.R. 2847 includes a provision for QZAB and QSCB issuers to receive a direct payment from the Treasury instead of a tax credit. Tax credit bonds like QZABs and QSCBs provide a larger federal subsidy to issuers compared to traditional bonds by delivering the full taxable interest rate as a subsidy. The House-passed version of H.R. 2847 includes a provision for QZAB and QSCB issuers to receive a direct payment from the Treasury instead of a tax credit. The BAB tax credit rate is set at 35% of the interest cost, not 100% like QZABs and QSCBs. H.R. 2847 would remove the restriction that the bonds be issued before January 1, 2011. The Senate amendment to H.R. 2847 would expand the direct payment option for QZABs and QSCBs, although at a reduced credit rate. The Senate version of H.R. 2847 proposes a 45% direct payment credit rate for tax credit bonds, with a higher rate of 65% for small issuers. This option would result in higher interest costs compared to the House-passed legislation but still lower than traditional tax-exempt bonds. States can issue $2.8 billion of QZABs and $22 billion of QSCBs, with allocations available until 2010. The Congressional Budget Office estimates a 6.11% credit rate for QZABs and QSCBs with a 17-year term. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the proposal for QZABs and QSCBs in the House-passed version of H.R. 2847 would cost $9.028 billion over the FY2010-FY2019 budget window, while the Senate version would cost $2.257 billion over the same timeframe. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 provides job training and related services to unemployed and underemployed individuals through the Department of Labor. In FY2010, the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) programs are funded at $5.5 billion, including $3.0 billion for state formula grants for Adult, Youth, and Dislocated Worker Activities. The House-passed Jobs for Main Street Act would provide $1.25 billion for existing workforce development programs administered by DOLETA. H.R. 2847 would provide $500 million for Youth Activities for summer employment programs and $750 million for worker training in high growth industries under WIA. The funding for Youth Activities would be solely for summer employment programs for low-income youth ages 14-21, with grants allocated to states and local entities. The total allocation for grants under this section would remain the same as if the total allocation were less than $1 billion. Under H.R. 2847, $500 million would be allocated for summer employment programs for low-income youth ages 14-21. The only performance measure would be attainment of basic skills and work readiness. Funding from ARRA was available for all activities authorized under grants for Youth Activities, including summer employment. ARRA also increased the age of \"eligible youth\" in these programs from 21 to 24 years of age. H.R. 2847 would allocate $750 million for worker training and placement in high-growth industries through competitive grants. $275 million would be for job training in energy efficiency and renewable energy sectors, including energy-efficient building, renewable electric power, biofuels, and sustainable product manufacturing. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) allocated funds for worker training in high-growth industries, with a focus on energy efficiency, renewable energy, and health care sectors. $225 million was reserved for Pathways Out of Poverty projects, $475 million for health care sector training, and $750 million for competitive grants in emerging sectors. Local workforce boards could award training contracts to higher education institutions. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act allocated funds for worker training in high-growth industries like energy efficiency, renewable energy, and health care. Local workforce boards could award training contracts to higher education institutions to facilitate training in high-demand occupations. Unemployment Compensation (UC) program provides benefits for up to 26 weeks, with possible extensions based on state laws or temporary federal measures like the Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC08) benefit. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the UC provisions of H.R. 2847 would cost $41 billion over the FY2010-FY2019 budget window. The House-passed version of H.R. 2847 includes UC provisions, while the Senate-passed version does not. Additionally, the House passed the Temporary Extension Act of 2010 (H.R. 4691) to extend temporary UC provisions through April 5. The EUC08 program, created in July 2008, provides up to 53 weeks of additional unemployment benefits through four tiers. H.R. 2847 aims to extend the program through June 2010, with existing beneficiaries \"grandfathered\" for their remaining weeks of eligibility. No new entrants will be accepted after February 28, 2010. The EUC08 program, created in July 2008, provides up to 53 weeks of additional unemployment benefits through four tiers. H.R. 2847 aims to extend the program through June 2010, with existing beneficiaries \"grandfathered\" for their remaining weeks of eligibility. No new entrants will be accepted after February 28, 2010. The bill would also extend the availability of EUC08 benefits for four additional months, with final payments ending by November 30, 2010. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act created a $25 weekly benefit for individuals receiving various types of unemployment benefits. The Federal Additional Compensation (FAC) program provides a $25 per week supplemental benefit for individuals receiving unemployment insurance. The program is temporary and set to end on February 28, 2010. Those already receiving unemployment benefits as of February 28, 2010, will continue to receive the supplemental benefit until the end of their current benefit period. No new entrants will be accepted after August 31, 2010. H.R. 2847 aims to extend FAC benefits for four additional months, through the end of June. The Federal Additional Compensation (FAC) program will be extended for four more months until June 2010, with final payments ending by November 30, 2010. The 100% federal financing of the Extended Benefits (EB) program will end before July 31, 2010. States without a waiting period for unemployment benefits will pay 100% of the first week of EB. H.R. 2847 extends 100% federal financing of EB benefits through June 2010 and suspends the one-week waiting period provision until December 2010. COBRA provides continued health insurance coverage for qualified employees and their families, but unemployed workers may be charged the full premium cost plus a 2% administrative fee. The COBRA premium may be prohibitive for the unemployed, especially compared to unemployment compensation. In 2009, average monthly COBRA premiums were $410 for individual coverage and $1,137 for family coverage. This could consume a large share of monthly unemployment benefits, especially for those purchasing family coverage. Legislation has been introduced to help make these premiums more affordable. The ARRA of 2009 included a 65% subsidy for COBRA continuation coverage for individuals involuntarily terminated between September 1, 2008, and December 31, 2009. The subsidy was available for nine months but was extended through February 28, 2010, for unemployed workers under the FY2010 Defense Appropriations Act. The COBRA subsidy was extended for an additional two months, and the maximum period for receiving the subsidy was extended for an additional six months. Provisions were made retroactive for individuals whose subsidy expired on October 31, 2009. The House-passed Jobs for Main Street Act would further extend the COBRA subsidy for those involuntarily terminated through June 30, 2010, at an estimated cost of $12.3 billion. The Senate-passed version of the bill does not include COBRA provisions. The House-passed Jobs for Main Street Act extends the COBRA subsidy for those involuntarily terminated through June 30, 2010. Additionally, the act includes provisions to make the child tax credit refundable for up to 15% of a taxpayer's earned income for tax year 2010 without an income threshold. The child tax credit was made refundable for taxpayers with less than three children and up to 10% of income above a $10,000 threshold. The refund percentage was increased to 15% in 2004. The income threshold was lowered to $3,000 for tax years 2009 and 2010. The changes will expire after 2010, making the credit refundable only for taxpayers with three or more children. The federal poverty guidelines are used to determine income eligibility for various programs. The guidelines are adjusted annually based on the Consumer Price Index. In 2009, the economic recession caused price deflation, potentially leading to lower poverty income guidelines for 2010. This could result in some individuals losing eligibility or having their benefits reduced under programs that use these guidelines. The FY2010 Defense Appropriations Act prohibits the publication of updated poverty guidelines for 2010 before March 1, 2010. The House passed a bill to extend this prohibition until March 31, 2010. The Congressional Budget Office estimates a cost of $305 million for this provision. The FY2010 Defense Appropriations Act prohibits updating poverty guidelines for 2010 until March 1, 2010. The House bill extends this prohibition to March 31, 2010, with an estimated cost of $305 million. CRS estimates that poverty guidelines for 2010 would be lower under current law, with Section 3305 of the Jobs for Main Street Act maintaining 2010 guidelines at 2009 levels. Section 3306 of the Act would disregard tax refunds as income for certain means-tested programs. The House-passed Jobs for Main Street Act would provide appropriations for infrastructure investments to save or create jobs. Section 1402 of H.R. 2847 directs the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture to use various conservation corps in administering these funds. The Jobs for Main Street Act includes provisions for partnerships with various organizations to serve young adults, underserved populations, veterans, and special needs individuals. It also maintains restrictions on fund usage and requires transparency and oversight similar to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Inspectors General and the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board would oversee activities funded under the act. Section 4002 of H.R. 2847 mandates that funds provided under the Jobs for Main Street Act must adhere to \"Buy American\" provisions from ARRA."
