    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Education Childcare Partnership Act\". The Congress finds that millions of children are in child care daily, with a high percentage of mothers in the workforce. Child care is crucial for working parents' self-sufficiency, but only a small fraction of eligible families receive it. Child care assistance is crucial for working parents' self-sufficiency. Only 1 out of 10 eligible families receive Federal funds for child care. Full-day child care costs between $4,000 and $9,000 per year. Investing an additional 10 percent can significantly improve the quality of child care services. Poor quality child care can lead to delayed language and reading skills, and increased aggressive behavior in children. School-based child care can utilize existing resources to provide quality programs. Local education agencies running qualified school-based child care programs should aim for accreditation and hiring credentialed professionals. Grants to states for school-based child care are proposed in an amendment to the Social Security Act. A State seeking a grant for school-based child care programs must submit an application to the Secretary, ensuring funds are used for this purpose and compliance with regulations. The application should also demonstrate support from parents, schools, employers, and government agencies. Child care agencies collaborate in preparing the application, which must meet specific requirements and be designed for a 2-year period. The Secretary approves applications that meet these criteria. The Secretary approves State applications for a 2-year period, entitling them to receive a grant determined under subsection (c). The grant amount is allotted among States with approved applications, with redistribution rules applying. The Secretary reserves funds for Indian Tribes. The Secretary reserves 1-2% of funds for Indian tribes. States must use grant funds for school-based child care programs and training. The grant funds provided under this section are to be used for school-based child care programs, including constructing, expanding, or rehabilitating facilities. States must coordinate the use of these funds with programs established under the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 and ensure that the funds supplement existing efforts. The grant funds provided under this section are to be used for school-based child care programs, including constructing, expanding, or rehabilitating facilities. States must coordinate the use of these funds with programs established under the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 and ensure that the funds supplement existing efforts. The grant funds shall be used to supplement other Federal, State, and local funds for programs serving children's health and developmental needs. Amounts provided to a State under this section shall be available for use without fiscal year limitation. $250,000,000 is appropriated for grants under this section for each fiscal year from 1999 to 2002. Definitions for terms like 'local education agency' and 'qualified school-based child care program' are provided in this section. A qualified school-based child care program provides all-day care for children under 7 years old, located in a school structure or on school grounds, meeting state and local laws and regulations, and offering costs determined on a sliding fee scale. The term 'State' in the context refers to each of the 50 States and the District of Columbia."
