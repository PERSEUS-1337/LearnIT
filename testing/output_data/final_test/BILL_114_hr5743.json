Section 1205 of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 is amended to include regulations based on standards developed by another Federal agency for public safety officer death or disability claims. The Bureau is required to give substantial weight to evidence and findings presented by State, local, or Federal agencies when determining eligibility for benefits under section 1201. The Bureau is mandated to provide information on pending death, disability, and educational assistance claims on its public website within 30 days of enactment. Updated information on these claims must be posted weekly, including submission dates and claimant's state of residence. The Bureau is required to report on pending death, disability, and educational assistance claims to Congress every 180 days, including the total number of claims processed and the time taken for each claim. The report must include details on the time taken to process claims, the total number of pending claims, and a description of the basis for any delays. The report must include the total number of pending claims related to exposure from the September 11, 2001, attacks, details on delays for each claim, and the total number of claims with final determinations made in the previous 180 days along with average awards. The report should include details on the number of pending claims related to the September 11, 2001, attacks, delays for each claim, final determinations made in the last 180 days, average awards, results of claims, appeals, and processing efficiency of the Bureau. The report should include information on the average length of time taken by public agencies to submit required information to the Bureau, details of subpoenas issued to public agencies for claims, and the Bureau's compliance with offsetting award amounts. The report must detail the obligation to offset award amounts under section 1201(f)(3), including the number of claims eligible for compensation under both this part and the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund of 2001, the amount of compensation paid under the VCF for each claim, the number of claims for which the Bureau has made a final determination, and the number of claims for which the Bureau has not made a final determination. The Comptroller General of the United States is required to conduct a study every 5 years on the Bureau's compliance with offsetting award amounts under section 1201(f)(3) and submit a report to Congress. The term 'nature of the claim' refers to whether the claim is for benefits under this subpart related to the death of a public safety officer. The curr_chunk states that benefits are provided under this subpart for the disability of a public safety officer or education assistance under subpart 2. SEC. 3. AGE LIMITATION FOR CHILDREN. Section 1212(c) of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 is amended to include a provision for delayed approvals of educational assistance applications, extending the age limitation for children in certain cases. The age limitation for children seeking educational assistance under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 may be extended in cases where the application is approved more than 1 year after it was filed. The age limitation for children seeking educational assistance under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 may be extended in cases where the claim for benefits is approved. SEC. 4. DUE DILIGENCE IN PAYING BENEFIT CLAIMS. An amendment to the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 requires due diligence in paying benefit claims. SEC. 1206 requires the Bureau to diligently obtain information for benefit claims. If information is lacking from a third party, the Bureau must use investigative tools before abandoning the claim. SEC. 5 presumes officers acted properly. SEC. 5 amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to presume that officers acted properly when determining benefit claims. The amendments made by this Act will take effect on the date of enactment and apply to benefit claims under part L of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 pending or received by the Bureau of Justice Assistance."
