    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Chesapeake Bay Ballast Water Management Act of 1995\" and references amendments to the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990. Section 1101 is amended to include the Aquatic Nuisance Species Control Program. The Secretary will issue guidelines under the Ballast Water Management Act of 1995 to prevent the introduction of aquatic nuisance species into US waters from ballast water discharge. The guidelines aim to prevent the discharge of ballast water containing aquatic nuisance species and consider ecological variations. The Ballast Water Management Act of 1995 aims to prevent the introduction of aquatic nuisance species into US waters from ballast water discharge by considering ecological variations and vessel operating conditions. Safety of vessels, crews, and passengers must not be jeopardized, reporting on ballast water practices is required, and guidelines must be based on the best scientific information available. The Ballast Water Management Act of 1995 aims to prevent the introduction of aquatic nuisance species into US waters from ballast water discharge. Amendments include the Secretary periodically promulgating revised regulations to prevent the spread of aquatic nuisance species into the Hudson River. Civil penalties are also addressed in the subsection. The amendments to the Ballast Water Management Act of 1995 include changes to civil and criminal penalties, consultation with Canada, and the authority of the Secretary. This involves rewording certain subsections and updating language related to the Great Lakes. The amendments to the Ballast Water Management Act of 1995 include revisions to regulations for preventing the introduction and spread of aquatic nuisance species into the Great Lakes. The Secretary is required to periodically update regulations to ensure compliance with the law. The amendments to the Ballast Water Management Act of 1995 include revisions to regulations for preventing the introduction and spread of aquatic nuisance species into the Great Lakes. The Secretary is required to periodically update regulations to ensure compliance with the law. Additionally, new subsections are added for education and technical assistance programs to promote compliance with the guidelines issued under the Act. The Secretary will utilize expertise from established agencies and organizations for programs under this subsection. A report to Congress on the effectiveness of voluntary guidelines and the need for a mandatory program to prevent the spread of aquatic nuisance species through ballast water exchange will be submitted within 3 years. Additionally, amendments include ballast water control studies under section 1102. Section 1102 includes ballast water control studies. Section 1102 includes ballast water control studies, with additional studies required to determine trends in ballast water releases in susceptible areas like the Chesapeake Bay. The Secretary will conduct an initial study before issuing guidelines, followed by a follow-up study within 2 years. The Secretary will conduct a follow-up study on ballast water releases to assess compliance with guidelines and their effectiveness in reducing aquatic nuisance species introductions. The Task Force will also conduct an initial study on invasive species resulting from ballast water releases in the Chesapeake Bay and other US waters. The Task Force will determine highly susceptible waters in the US for aquatic nuisance species invasion and conduct a follow-up study on the effectiveness of guidelines in reducing their spread. Additionally, a new Naval Ballast Water Program section will be added to assess compliance with guidelines. The Naval Ballast Water Program will be added to assess compliance with guidelines for preventing aquatic nuisance species invasion in highly susceptible waters in the US. The Chief of Naval Operations, in consultation with relevant parties, will implement a ballast water management program for the Navy fleet to prevent invasion by nonindigenous species. Authorization of appropriations is also amended to support the implementation of these measures. The Task Force will receive $2,000,000 for a study from 1996 to 2000, and the Coast Guard department will receive $1,250,000 annually for guideline development and regulation enforcement."
