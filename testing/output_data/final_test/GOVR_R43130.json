    "content": "On April 27, 2014, South Africa celebrated Freedom Day, marking the 20th anniversary of the first non-racial democratic elections in 1994. The governing African National Congress (ANC) is expected to maintain an electoral majority in the upcoming national election on May 7, despite facing increasing criticism. An early 2014 opinion poll showed ANC's support at 53%, while recent polls indicated around 66% support, in line with its previous parliamentary vote share in 2009. In late June 2013, President Obama visited South Africa to highlight U.S.-African cooperation in trade, investment, development, democracy, and peace. He announced plans for a U.S.-Africa summit in 2014 and the Power Africa initiative to increase access to electrical power in sub-Saharan Africa. During his visit, he met with President Jacob Zuma to discuss bilateral relations. During his visit to South Africa in late June 2013, President Obama emphasized the strong U.S.-South African bilateral relations. He engaged in various activities, including a town hall meeting for the Young African Leaders Initiative, meeting with the African Union Commission chair, and visiting the Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation Youth Center to showcase community-based healthcare solutions. The State Department views South Africa as a strategic partner, and President Obama's trip underscored the close ties between the two countries since 1994. Since 1994, U.S.-South African bilateral ties have remained close, with a focus on socioeconomic development and trade. South Africa is a major recipient of U.S. aid, particularly for HIV/AIDS programs. Trade between the two countries has doubled over the past decade, reaching a peak of $16.7 billion in 2011. Security cooperation is also a key area of engagement, with a Strategic Dialogue established in 2010 covering various sectors such as health, education, and trade. In recent years, U.S. relations with South Africa have focused on cooperation in health, education, food security, law enforcement, trade, investment, energy, and nonproliferation. High-level visits have taken place, and Congress has been actively involved, particularly in areas like foreign aid oversight and healthcare programs. Efforts to enhance trade relations have also been a priority. Efforts to bolster trade and investment ties with South Africa are gaining congressional attention. South Africa, with the largest and most industrialized economy in Africa, plays a significant role regionally and within the African Union. Despite economic growth and improved access to education, racial inequality persists in wealth, income distribution, and job opportunities. Racial inequality in South Africa is evident in wealth, income distribution, job access, and education disparities. Most black South Africans live in poverty, with significantly lower incomes compared to the white minority. Unemployment rates are higher among blacks, and access to education is limited, although improving. The country also faces challenges related to poverty and public service provision, with informal housing settlements surrounding most cities. In South Africa, social tensions arise from inadequate housing, water, electricity, and social services in townships, leading to protests. Labor unrest, especially in the mining sector, has been increasing. Public corruption and high rates of violent crime, including rape, are major challenges. Vigilante and mob violence occur periodically, with heavy-handed police tactics causing human rights violations. The country also faces a high and rising rate of adult HIV prevalence. The ANC has held a majority in the National Assembly since 1994, controlling the executive branch and electing the country's president. Jacob Zuma was elected as national president in 2009 and secured his reelection as head of the ANC in 2012, likely ensuring a second term as South Africa's president. The ANC, a dominant party in South Africa, is likely to secure a second term for its president. The party, rooted in leftist ideology, aims to address social inequalities from apartheid through a developmental state with a mixed economy. It supports social democratic-leaning policies and emphasizes equal access to resources. The ANC in South Africa implements centrist, market-based policies despite its leftist roots. It governs in alliance with COSATU and SACP, who influence ANC policies. The Democratic Alliance (DA) challenges ANC dominance and has gained electoral strength, with support from white and coloured voters. The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) led by Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi has faced challenges in attracting broad black support, losing parliamentary seats since 1994. The rise of Zuma, with his Zulu background, has drawn support from many Zulus. The Congress of the People (COPE) was formed in 2008 by dissident ANC members after Zuma ousted Mbeki in 2007, causing rifts between their supporters. In 2007, ANC rifts led to the formation of COPE, which won 30 seats in 2009 but performed poorly in 2011 elections. In 2013, Julius Malema launched the EFF, challenging the ANC with a more radical agenda appealing to disenfranchised groups. The EFF, led by Julius Malema, supports radical nationalist economic policies and may win seats in the National Assembly. Malema faces legal issues and broke with the ANC to become a vocal critic of former President Zuma. His leadership style includes calls to nationalize mines and redistribute white-owned farmland. Julius Malema, leader of the EFF, supports radical economic policies like nationalizing mines and redistributing farmland. Mamphela Ramphele formed the Agang party to challenge ANC rule, but its prospects are judged as poor. Ramphele later formed an alliance with the DA, but faced internal opposition within Agang. Mamphela Ramphele terminated the alliance with the DA due to internal Agang opposition, raising doubts about her political acuity. Voters will cast separate ballots to elect members of the National Assembly and provincial legislatures through a direct vote closed-list proportional representation system. Seats are allocated based on party share of the vote, with one seat for every 0.25% of the vote received. Twenty-nine parties are contesting the national elections, with key policy challenges including high unemployment, education quality, corruption, crime, and alleged anti-democratic actions by the ANC. Public discontent over poor public services provision is also a major issue. Public discontent over poor public services provision persists despite increased access to resources under the ANC. President Zuma faces criticism for a non-transparent $23 million government upgrade of his personal homestead, making him a potential electoral liability for the ANC. Despite negative press coverage, the party continues to support him, and many long-standing ANC supporters are likely to vote for the party despite their discontent over Zuma's record. The ANC's electoral dominance is being contested as it faces dissent within its traditional support base and the possibility of forming a coalition due to potential dip in votes. High-profile figures, including Desmond Tutu, have criticized the party's governance record, leading to predictions of a labor party establishment. The ANC's electoral dominance is being challenged by dissent within its traditional support base and the potential for forming a coalition. High-profile figures, like Desmond Tutu, have criticized the party's governance record, leading to predictions of a gradual loss of ANC dominance in future elections. Despite challenges, the ANC is expected to maintain a parliamentary majority, with Zuma likely to be re-elected as national president. Polling in 2014 has shown varying levels of support for the ANC. Polling data from 2013 and 2014 shows support for the ANC, DA, and EFF, with the ANC projected to have a low 60th percentile share. Other smaller parties like Agang, Cope, and the IFP were allocated between 2% and 6% support. Campaigning has been contentious, with allegations of state bias against the DA and EFF. The rejection of ads by political parties for rallies and the controversy surrounding the chair of the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) in South Africa have raised concerns about the credibility of the upcoming election. Opposition parties have sued to have the chair removed, but proceedings have been postponed until June, allowing the chair to oversee the polls. South Africa has made significant socioeconomic progress since apartheid ended, with improved access to schools, housing, and utilities for the black population. However, challenges such as high unemployment, poor education quality, and societal divisions persist, as outlined in a national development plan. South Africa remains a divided society, with sharp rural-urban divides and poor infrastructure. Scaled-up investment in transport, communication, and electricity systems is needed for inclusive development. The economy is unsustainable and faces challenges from climate change. Public health systems struggle to meet demand and compete with the private sector for trained workers. The public services in South Africa struggle to meet demand and maintain quality due to political management, lack of accountability, and high levels of corruption. The National Development Plan (NDP) aims to address these issues and aligns with government economic development plans and the ANC's agendas. Multiple assessments have been conducted to track political and economic progress since 1994. Since 1994, commemorative coins have been issued in South Africa for the post-apartheid 20th anniversary, reflecting challenges like unemployment, lack of access to education and healthcare, poor public service delivery, crime, and corruption. Mass labor strikes and violent protests over inadequate township services have increased, with ineffective police responses. Protests in South Africa have been on the rise due to ineffective police responses and failures in the criminal justice system. Some protests escalate into acts of vigilante justice, such as lynchings and mob beatings. Corruption by economic elites, including senior ANC members, has fueled resentment, along with politicized management of public goods. These practices reflect the lack of economic opportunities for blacks, leading to local political violence. Local government posts gained through party ties may offer a way out of poverty for blacks with limited education and job prospects, but this can lead to increased antipathy. Local protests involving ANC members have become harder to manage, with violence and attacks on ANC councilors becoming more common. Criticism of the ANC, including President Zuma and his cabinet, for corruption and criminal acts has been documented. Critics allege that corruption has increased during Zuma's tenure, with South Africa's ranking on Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index dropping from 55th to 69th. Zuma has faced public controversies related to corruption, with accusations that he supports using politics for personal gain. The ANC denies these allegations. The ANC maintains that they are business-friendly, despite concerns about corruption and selective prosecutions under Zuma's tenure. Incidents of corruption, including a textbook scandal and irregular mining deal linked to Zuma relatives, have raised criticisms of the government. The Guptas, a business family, were involved in allegedly questionable dealings with top ANC officials, including Zuma. There have been scandals related to \"tenderpreneurship\" where politically connected individuals secure government tenders. Various forms of police corruption, including bribery and irregular dealings, have been reported. South Africa has high rates of violent crime, but murder rates have decreased over the years. South Africa has high rates of violent crime, with perpetrators often committing robbery along with violent assaults, rape, or murder. The culture of violence among criminals is attributed to factors like apartheid legacies, socioeconomic disparities, gender inequality, and norms of violence. Rape of women and children is prevalent, with South Africa having one of the highest reported rape rates globally. South Africa has a high reported rape rate of 127.5 per 100,000 persons in 2011/2012, with a low 12% rape conviction rate. Women's rights activists criticize the weak public and state responses to sexual violence. In 2012 and early 2013, brutal crimes against women and children sparked public outrage, leading to calls for a National Commission of Enquiry into rape and gender-based violence. President Zuma launched an anti-rape education campaign, and incidents like the Oscar Pistorius case highlighted issues of gender violence and police misconduct in the country. Police misconduct in South Africa, including serious human rights abuses and corruption, is a trend with multiple roots such as management challenges, training deficits, a code of silence, and the lingering effects of apartheid-era practices. The hardnosed policing culture is a reaction to the high levels of violent crime officers face daily. Despite these issues, the South African Police Service (SAPS) reportedly has a core of dedicated personnel. The SAPS in South Africa faces challenges of misconduct but has well-trained officers and specialized units. The ANC government also faces challenges from the \"born free\" generation, comprising 38% of the population, who will be eligible to vote in upcoming elections. The \"born-free\" generation in South Africa, making up 48% of the population, faces high unemployment rates, corruption, and lack of services. They are not as loyal to the ANC as older generations and have been involved in generational rifts within the ANC Youth League. Political parties are trying to address youth demands with state youth wage and jobs schemes and skills training programs. The Zuma government in South Africa has faced criticism for limiting access to public information, using state media to promote ANC views, and intimidating critics with defamation suits. The controversial Protection of State Information Bill, also known as the Secrecy Bill, has been amended after concerns that it could be used to suppress politically damaging information and prosecute whistleblowers. The Protection of State Information Bill, also known as the Secrecy Bill, has been amended to address concerns about suppressing information and prosecuting whistleblowers. Questions remain about conflicts with the Promotion of Access to Information Act and the potential for unwarranted classification leading to the imprisonment of whistleblowers and journalists reporting on corruption. Labor strikes in the mining sector and other industries have continued, reflecting growing discontent with governance and the ANC's political support base. The strikes in the platinum sector, led by the independent Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU), have raised doubts about Zuma's support for workers. Miners are turning to AMCU due to perceived neglect by the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), affiliated with COSATU and the ANC. This shift in labor support could weaken COSATU, NUM, and the ANC. A wildcat strike at Lonmin's Marikana mine in August 2012 led to clashes between strikers, NUM officials, police, and mine security guards. The violence resulted in 44 deaths and widespread public outrage. The Marikana mine massacre in August 2012 resulted in the deaths of miners, leading to legal responsibility under apartheid-era law. The charges were later dropped by the Zuma government amidst criticism. Investigations revealed protesters were shot in the back, sparking ongoing strikes and clashes with police. A 22% salary increase was eventually granted to the strikers, fueling further nationwide strikes and labor unrest in various industries. South Africa's economy is diverse, with key industries including platinum, chromium, gold, diamond, and coal production. Industrial sectors like automobile assembly, chemicals, textiles, and iron and steel also play a significant role. Services contribute the largest share of GDP at 69%, while agriculture only contributes less than 3% despite being a famed wine producer and exporter of agricultural products. South Africa's economy is diverse, with key industries including platinum, chromium, gold, diamond, and coal production. Services contribute the largest share of GDP at 69%. The country has well-developed sectors in tourism, banking, energy, legal, communications, and transport. South African firms often rely on foreign sources for credit due to low local savings rates. Government deficits have increased in recent years, with government net debt as a percent of GDP also rising. South Africa's economy has faced challenges with government deficits increasing, leading to a rise in government net debt as a percent of GDP. Total external debt stocks have also grown steadily. The country's real per capita GDP growth has lagged behind national GDP growth rates due to an inadequately educated workforce. High unemployment, limited access to social services, and diverse public infrastructure investment needs are seen as barriers to economic growth. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) highlights distortions in the labor market as contributing to inequality and high unemployment in South Africa. Despite efforts to increase electricity generation capacity, lack of power is a serious problem in South Africa, hindering its international competitiveness. The export sector plays a significant role in generating wealth and value added in the economy. External factors such as the 2008-2009 global financial crisis and the European economic crisis have posed economic challenges, leading to fluctuations in South Africa's real GDP growth. The European economic crisis has led to a drop in European demand for South African products, but exports to China and Africa have increased. South African firms are expanding investments in banking, mining, and telecommunications in Africa. Foreign direct investment in South Africa has been variable, peaking in 2008 at over $9 billion but dropping in recent years. In 2012, FDI inflows decreased by 24% to $4.57 billion. In 2012, FDI inflows in South Africa decreased by 24% to $4.57 billion, while FDI outflows increased to $4.37 billion. The country's ranking in the World Bank's Doing Business survey declined under the Zuma Administration, hindrances to FDI growth included violent crime, corruption, and political volatility in neighboring countries. The Promotion and Protection of Investment Bill of 2013 in South Africa has raised concerns for foreign investors, as it would replace bilateral investment treaties with a new legal framework. This may lead to disputes being resolved by the South African legal system, raising questions about expropriation, compensation, and dispute settlement. U.S. investors would not be significantly affected as there is no U.S.-South African BIT in force. South Africa has played a significant role in global economic and sporting events, such as hosting the 2010 soccer World Cup and participating in multilateral policy events. It is a member of the G20 and joined the BRIC group at China's invitation in 2010. South Africa is a key trading partner of China in Africa and has seen increased economic cooperation. The Zuma government has pursued a free-market economic model with state investments to boost economic growth and job creation. China became South Africa's largest trading partner in 2009. The Zuma Administration in South Africa launched the New Growth Path in late 2010, focusing on industrial policy to create 5 million new jobs and reduce unemployment. The strategy includes large public infrastructure investments in energy, transport, communication, water, and housing, as well as funding for the green economy, agriculture, manufacturing, tourism, and mining. It also calls for the creation of a state mining firm for value-added processing and enhanced resource exploitation. The New Growth Path in South Africa focuses on industrial policy to create jobs and reduce unemployment. It includes public infrastructure investments in various sectors and proposes the creation of a state mining firm for value-added processing and resource exploitation. The strategy also emphasizes fiscal discipline, private sector involvement, and increasing public expenditures, with a forecasted budget of $97 billion over three years and $600 billion over a decade. The government may expand the role of state development finance institutions in funding its agenda. The New Growth Path in South Africa focuses on industrial policy to create jobs and reduce unemployment, with public infrastructure investments in various sectors. Private industry is uncertain about its role in the government's plans, leading to calls for infrastructure-focused public-private partnerships. Critics question the capability of state agencies and parastatals to handle the job due to project delays, cost overruns, and failures to utilize allocated funds. Labor unrest and corruption could hinder state efforts to access financing for public investments, potentially making public investment financing more expensive. Country economic risk rating downgrades or warnings in late 2012 may prompt the government to seek alternative financing options. Public investment financing in South Africa may become more expensive, leading the government to seek funding from international financial institutions or non-Western lenders like China. U.S. businesses, supported by the U.S. Export-Import Bank, have capitalized on market opportunities in South Africa through various large deals, including financing for a coal-fired power plant expansion and clean energy production projects. Since 1994, South African governments have implemented Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) and land reform policies to promote racial economic equality. BEE aims to increase job opportunities and ownership for blacks in various sectors, while land reform seeks to increase black land ownership. Initial BEE efforts focused on transferring business ownership to blacks and providing preferential access to leadership positions. Current BEE policies focus on advancing racial employment equity and providing job training to black beneficiaries. Implementation is mandatory for public entities, with BEE scorecards used to assess businesses' progress towards goals. The government collaborates with industries to establish sector-specific transformation charters and codes to promote private sector investment in BEE goals. The South African government's Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) policies focus on promoting economic transformation through partnership deals, tax preferences, and public company listings. Compliance for larger firms is complex and legalistic, with strict reporting requirements. A BEE amendment bill introduced in 2013 aims to enhance monitoring and introduce penalties for misrepresentation. Land distribution issues, stemming from apartheid-era disparities, remain contentious. The South African government has implemented land reform programs to address challenges stemming from apartheid-era disparities. These programs aim to compensate those dispossessed of land, achieve more racially equitable land distribution, and provide support for land transfer recipients to make their holdings economically viable. Transferred land is often purchased by the state. The South African government has implemented land reform programs to address apartheid-era disparities by compensating those dispossessed of land and achieving racially equitable distribution. Land transfers have been burdened by legal complexities and slow processes, leading to calls for more active state redistribution, potentially including forced sales or uncompensated seizures. The South African government has implemented land reform programs to address apartheid-era disparities. The ANC resolved to pursue a new \"radical\" land reform program in 2012, which includes larger financial resources for land reform efforts, reopening land restitution claims, and expediting the enactment of an Expropriation Act to facilitate compulsory state purchases of land. These reforms could affect the pace of future land transfers. The ANC is pursuing land reform through various legislative measures, including the Restitution of Land Rights Amendment bill passed in 2014. This bill allows for new land restitution claims related to apartheid-era land seizures until 2019. The Promotion and Protection of Investment Bill also addresses land expropriation by the state. Funding for the projected 379,000 new land claims is a concern, as the current annual budget is insufficient. The Promotion and Protection of Investment Bill in South Africa could result in landowners receiving less than market value for expropriated land and losing the right to sue for damages. The law has broader implications for foreign investments in the country, which is a significant trade partner with the U.S. in Africa. In recent years, South Africa has been a significant trade partner with the U.S., being a top destination for U.S. exports and a major source of U.S. imports. Key U.S. exports to South Africa include machinery, vehicles, electrical machinery, precious metals, and aircraft. On the other hand, top U.S. imports from South Africa include precious metals, vehicles, iron and steel, ores, and machinery. U.S. foreign direct investment (FDI) in South Africa has been increasing, with a focus on manufacturing, wholesale trade, professional services, and non-bank holding firms. This trade and investment relationship has garnered attention from U.S. policymakers and business leaders. Increased U.S. interest in African markets, driven by positive economic growth and governance trends, has led to a focus on trade and investment as tools of foreign policy. Concern over Chinese engagement in Africa has also prompted heightened attention from U.S. policymakers and business leaders, as seen in the launch of the U.S.-South Africa Business Council in 2013. The Doing Business in Africa campaign, led by the Obama Administration, aims to promote trade and investment in Africa. The campaign includes efforts to double U.S. exports by 2015. Commerce Secretary Blank visited sub-Saharan Africa, and a trade mission to South Africa in August 2012 focused on expanding trade and investment through public-private partnerships. Clinton emphasized the importance of these partnerships in her remarks during the mission. Partnerships are crucial for expanding trade and investment, with South Africa's infrastructure projects creating opportunities for American businesses. Initiatives like the Export-Import Bank project and the U.S.-South Africa Aviation Partnership support private sector involvement. Clinton highlighted the significant role of small and medium enterprises in South Africa's economy, leading to the establishment of a $150 million USAID SME loan program. The United States has established a $150 million USAID SME loan program and a $65 million OPIC new private equity investment fund for South African SMEs. Concerns have been raised about the proposed overhaul of South Africa's investment framework, the Promotion and Protection of Investment Bill of 2013, which would replace bilateral investment treaties with a new legal framework. This may impact investment disputes and raise questions about expropriation, compensation, and dispute settlement. South Africa has played a significant role in global economic and sporting events, such as hosting the 2010 soccer World Cup and participating in multilateral policy events. It is a member of the G20 and joined the BRIC group at China's invitation. China is South Africa's largest trading partner, while the United States has mutual trade agreements with South Africa. The U.S. has trade agreements with South Africa, including the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) signed in 1999 and amended in 2012, the U.S.-Southern Africa Customs Union (SACU) Trade, Investment, and Development Cooperation Agreement (TIDCA) signed in 2008, and a double taxation agreement signed in 1997. South Africa is also eligible for trade benefits under the U.S. African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). South Africa benefits from U.S. duty-free imports under AGOA, with exports peaking at $2.5 billion in 2011. Automobiles make up 80% of exports, followed by iron and steel, citrus, chemicals, and alcoholic beverages. U.S.-South Africa relations are generally close, with shared goals and occasional differences over foreign policy. South Africa and the United States have close relations with occasional differences over foreign policy. South Africa often supports developing countries' positions that may conflict with U.S. interests and advocates caution in U.S.-backed interventions. However, they generally agree on African political and military crises, climate change, and nonproliferation. The two countries cooperate in development, defense, trade, and investment, and have an ongoing Strategic Dialogue on various issues. Congressional engagement with South Africa has focused on foreign aid programs in recent years. Engagement with South Africa in recent years has mainly focused on foreign aid program oversight, particularly in healthcare efforts. Trade and investment ties with South Africa and Africa may also attract congressional attention. U.S. aid to South Africa has gradually declined, totaling over $542 million in FY2012 and expected to fall to about $438 million by FY2015. The U.S. aid to South Africa has decreased to about $438 million, with a significant portion directed towards global health programs, particularly to combat HIV/AIDS under PEPFAR. Between FY2004 and FY2011, the U.S. provided $3.23 billion in assistance to South Africa for this purpose. The State Department's FY2015 Congressional Budget Request aims to achieve major health improvements, including ending preventable child and maternal deaths and creating an AIDS-free generation. The U.S. aid to South Africa focuses on ending preventable child and maternal deaths, creating an AIDS-free generation, and protecting communities from infectious diseases, particularly HIV/AIDS programming. Other areas of support include education and democracy and governance programs. The U.S. aid to South Africa focuses on accountable governance, public services improvement, gender-based violence justice, economic growth, climate change initiatives, and food security advancements in Africa. The U.S. aid to South Africa includes assistance in establishing a new South African Development Partnership Agency (SADPA) to foster development in Africa, focusing on key U.S. foreign policy priorities such as climate change, democracy, and food security. This aid also includes peace and security assistance, including International Military Education and Training (IMET) programs to enhance the readiness of the South African National Defense Forces (SANDF) for regional conflict and peacekeeping operations. Despite recent criticisms, the U.S. Department of Defense views the SANDF as operationally capable. In CAR, a South African intervention led to SANDF deaths and withdrawal. IMET focuses on health, C-130 aircraft training. FMF aid supports SANDF's C-130s. INCLE programs aid NLEA embassy post and law enforcement training. NADR funds improve border control and WMD nonproliferation. The FY2015 CBJ outlines programs for weapons of mass destruction (WMD) nonproliferation and border security in South Africa. These programs focus on detection, identification, inspection, interdiction, and prosecution of illicit transfers of WMD and related items. South African officers receive training under the DOD Combating Terrorism Fellowship Program. Additionally, South Africa receives peacekeeping training under the U.S. Africa Contingency Operations Training and Assistance program (ACOTA) and participates in cooperative military training exercises with U.S. forces. South Africa and the New York National Guard participate in annual military training exercises focusing on maritime and border security, peacekeeping, and humanitarian/civic action. The U.S.-South Africa Defense Committee (DEFCOM) coordinates security cooperation. Potential instability due to dissatisfaction among miners, unemployed youth, and others concerned with government performance, crime, and corruption could lead to localized unrest. Potential instability in South Africa due to dissatisfaction among miners, unemployed youth, and concerns about government performance, crime, and corruption could lead to unrest. This discontent may weaken political support for the ANC and create opportunities for opposition parties. The 2014 elections will test the ANC's dominance and public support for its policy agenda. Despite challenges, South Africa's economy is large and diversified, with the capacity for moderate expansion. The IMF projects growth of 2.8% in 2013 and 4.1% in 2014, with potential benefits from trade with the US and infrastructure investments. South Africa is investing in large-scale public infrastructure projects to boost economic growth, but this could strain the state's finances. The country may become a more significant investment and export destination for the U.S. due to demand and regional growth. U.S.-South African ties are strengthening through increased high-level exchanges. Policymakers will need to consider the implications of high levels of U.S. aid in the future. The discussion among policymakers is focused on the potential changes needed in U.S. aid to the healthcare sector in South Africa, particularly for HIV/AIDS programs, as both countries plan for South Africa to fund most of its own programs in the future."
