    "content": "The SCRA, enacted in 2003, provides civil protections and rights to servicemembers and has been amended over time. Congress recognizes the need for legislation to protect servicemembers' legal interests due to their service commitments. Amendments have extended benefits to servicemembers' spouses. During the Civil War, laws were enacted to address legal actions for individuals resisting the laws of the United States. In World War I, the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1918 directed trial courts to apply equity principles in cases involving servicemembers. In World War II, the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940 was amended in 1942 to reflect changes in the legal and economic landscape. Amendments to the SSCRA have been made during subsequent conflicts. The SCRA, enacted by Congress, aims to protect servicemembers during military service by suspending certain legal proceedings and transactions that may harm their rights. It does not forgive all debts or grant immunity from civil lawsuits but provides for the suspension of claims and protection from default judgments. The SCRA provides for the suspension of claims and protection from default judgments against servicemembers, balancing their interests with creditors. Courts are to interpret the SCRA liberally in favor of servicemembers, with provisions beneficial for Reservists and career military personnel. One key measure is capping interest at 6% on pre-service debts, while other provisions protect military families from eviction, insurance cancellation, taxation issues, and property foreclosure for tax payment. The SCRA provides protection for servicemembers from various financial challenges, including taxation, property foreclosure for tax payment, and loss of rights to public land. It defines \"Servicemember\" as individuals in the uniformed services and \"Military Service\" as active duty and National Guard service authorized by the President or Secretary of Defense. The SCRA provides protection for servicemembers from financial challenges, including taxation and property foreclosure. \"Active duty\" for armed services is defined as full-time duty in the active military service of the United States. The SCRA provides protection for servicemembers from financial challenges, including taxation and property foreclosure. It covers persons on active duty attending a service school but may not cover those attending training before active duty, like officer candidates. It does not protect AWOL servicemembers, those in delayed entry status, or on the TDRL. It also does not cover civilian contractor employees deployed with the Armed Forces. The SCRA provides protection for servicemembers from financial challenges, including taxation and property foreclosure. It does not cover civilian contractor employees deployed with the Armed Forces. 'Period of military service' begins when a servicemember enters military service and ends upon release or death. 'Dependent' is defined as a spouse, child, or individual financially supported by the servicemember. 'Court' includes federal and state courts, and 'State' includes commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States and the District of Columbia. The SCRA provides protection for servicemembers from financial challenges, including taxation and property foreclosure. It applies everywhere in the United States, including the District of Columbia, and in any territory \"subject to the jurisdiction of\" the United States. 'Secretary Concerned' refers to the relevant secretary for different branches of the Armed Forces. 'Motor Vehicle' is defined as a vehicle primarily for use on public streets. 'Judgment' includes any final or temporary ruling. The SCRA extends protection to persons who share a debt with covered servicemembers or have secondary liability. Courts can grant a stay or suspension of proceedings if SCRA provisions are invoked for the servicemember. Relief granted is influenced by factors like the servicemember's ability to appear in court and the necessity of their presence for defense. The SCRA provides protection for individuals with shared debts or secondary liability. Courts may grant a stay of proceedings based on factors like the servicemember's necessity for defense. The act also includes provisions for bail bondsmen unable to secure the appearance of a servicemember during active duty. The SCRA allows courts to consider the military service of the accused when deciding on bail bond issues. Sureties may need to show efforts to secure the appearance of the principal in court. Waivers of rights under the SCRA must be separate from the obligation document and are invalidated if the individual enters active military service. The SCRA protects citizens serving in the Armed Forces of allies during war or military actions. Military authorities must provide servicemembers with information on their rights and benefits under the SCRA during orientation. Additionally, information may be provided to adult dependents on rights and protections available. The SCRA provides benefits to servicemembers from the time they receive their orders until they report for duty, with coverage ending if orders are revoked. Servicemembers can waive some benefits by modifying contracts during or after their service. This section extends protections to reservists ordered into duty. The SCRA, amended in 2004, includes requirements for a waiver to be effective, such as being executed separately and in 12-point type. It protects servicemembers from penalties for invoking their rights, preventing lenders from revoking credit or foreclosing due to rate cap requests. No civil obligation can be the sole basis for adverse actions against servicemembers. The SCRA prohibits adverse actions against servicemembers based solely on their military service, including denial of credit, changes in credit terms, refusal of insurance coverage, and annotations on credit reports. However, creditors can take action if servicemembers fail to comply with adjusted obligations. The SCRA protects servicemembers from adverse actions based on their military service. Legal representatives can assert benefits on their behalf. Sections 201-208 provide relief in court actions, suspending civil liabilities and preserving causes of action. The act prevents default judgments in civil lawsuits when servicemembers are unable to appear due to military service. The SCRA protects servicemembers from adverse actions in civil lawsuits when they cannot appear in court due to military service. An amendment in 2008 clarified that civil lawsuits include child custody proceedings. Before a default judgment can be granted, a plaintiff must file an affidavit confirming the defendant's military status. A false affidavit can result in imprisonment or a fine. The court must appoint an attorney to represent the servicemember to protect their legal rights. If the attorney cannot locate the servicemember, their actions do not waive any defenses. The SCRA protects servicemembers in civil lawsuits by allowing them to challenge default judgments if military service affected their ability to appear in court. Courts may set aside judgments if servicemembers demonstrate prejudice from military service and have valid defenses. This provision does not apply if the servicemember appeared in court. Some courts consider communication about military status and SCRA applicability as sufficient to challenge a lawsuit. The SCRA protects servicemembers in civil lawsuits by allowing them to challenge default judgments if military service affected their ability to appear in court. An appearance by defendant's counsel may waive protection, and a letter from a legal assistance attorney could be considered an appearance. Subsection (h) protects the rights of a bona fide purchaser by stating that reversing a judgment under the SCRA will not affect their rights. The SCRA allows servicemembers to challenge default judgments if military service affected their ability to appear in court. A court may stay civil litigation, including child custody proceedings, for servicemembers in military service or within 90 days after termination. The court must grant a stay of at least 90 days upon receipt of a qualifying application. The servicemember must set forth facts on how current military duty affects their ability to participate in the litigation. The SCRA allows servicemembers to challenge default judgments if military service affected their ability to appear in court. A court may grant a stay of at least 90 days for servicemembers in military service or within 90 days after termination, upon receipt of a qualifying application. The servicemember must provide details on how current military duty impacts their ability to participate in the proceedings. Additionally, a letter from their commanding officer certifying that leave is not authorized is required. A stay is not meant to shield wrongdoing or lack of diligence, or to indefinitely postpone relief, especially in cases where the interests or safety of the general public are at stake. Courts may deny a stay in cases involving purely legal issues or where the servicemember is not the true party in interest. A request for a stay does not constitute an appearance for jurisdictional purposes. A servicemember can apply for relief under the SCRA without waiving jurisdictional rights or substantive defenses. Additional stays may be granted based on military duty impact. If denied, the court must appoint counsel. Unsuccessful stays preclude seeking protections against default judgments. Penalties cannot be imposed during a stay period. During a stay period under the SCRA, penalties cannot be imposed on a servicemember. Courts have the discretion to reduce or waive fines for failure to fulfill contract terms if military service impairs their ability. The court may stay execution of judgments or orders and vacate attachments or garnishments if the servicemember is materially affected by military service. This provision covers penalties like early termination fees or late payment fines. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) allows for stays on actions against servicemembers before, during, or within 90 days after military service. Courts can grant stays for the duration of military service plus 90 days. However, courts generally expect servicemembers to participate in proceedings within a reasonable time, especially during peacetime. Suits against co-defendants not in military service may proceed with court approval. This section does not apply to certain other sections with their own rules for stays. The SCRA allows for stays on actions against servicemembers for the duration of military service plus 90 days. The time period for bringing any action is tolled for the servicemember's period of military service, with no discretion for the court to deny tolling. This applies to actions in courts, federal or state boards, commissions, or agencies, and can be exercised by heirs, executors, administrators, or assigns. Military service does not need to adversely affect the servicemember's ability to meet obligations. The SCRA allows for stays on actions against servicemembers for the duration of military service plus 90 days, with the time period for bringing any action tolled. Military service does not need to adversely affect the servicemember's ability to meet obligations. The section caps interest on debts incurred by a servicemember at 6% annually if active-duty status materially affects their ability to pay. Interest above the cap is forgiven by the creditor and does not accrue after the debtor's release from active duty. Monthly payments are reduced by the excess interest, but the original terms of the obligation remain the same. The servicemember must provide written notice to the creditor with military orders to qualify for the 6% cap. A court may grant a creditor relief from the SCRA's 6% interest rate cap if the servicemember's ability to pay is not materially affected by military service. Servicemembers can seek relief through the FCRA provisions if they face adverse credit actions after invoking the interest cap. Historically, federally guaranteed student loans were not eligible for the 6% interest rate cap. In 2001, the Higher Education Opportunity Act amended Section 428(d) to allow the SCRA interest rate cap to apply to federally guaranteed student loans. Loans disbursed before this amendment are not covered by the 6% interest rate limitation. Servicemembers on active duty who received student loans before entering service cannot claim the 6% cap but may defer repayment or seek benefits under other laws. In 2008, the Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act added penalties for violating the SCRA's maximum interest prohibition. Violators may face fines or imprisonment for up to one year, and individuals can also seek consequential or punitive damages. Loans made after entering military service are not subject to the 6% cap. Section 208, added in 2014, provides additional protections for servicemembers in child custody proceedings related to deployment. The SCRA prohibits courts from making custody changes based solely on a servicemember's deployment, and does not allow removal of custody disputes to federal court. Servicemembers must be informed of child custody protections annually and before deployment. The SCRA protects servicemembers from eviction and loss of benefits due to payment failures. Dependents can also assert these rights. Landlords cannot evict if rent is $2,400 or less, and property cannot be distressed without a court order. Rent ceiling is adjusted annually for inflation, with the 2018 amount at $3,716.73. Courts must stay eviction proceedings for servicemembers. The SCRA protects servicemembers and their dependents from eviction. Courts must stay eviction proceedings for up to three months upon request. Landlords can be punished for violating eviction laws. Courts can grant equitable relief to landlords in cases where a stay is granted. The SCRA protects servicemembers from eviction, allowing courts to stay proceedings for up to three months. If a court orders payment to the landlord, the Secretary concerned can make an allotment from the servicemember's military pay. Violating the SCRA can result in imprisonment, fines, or both. Courts may order cancellation of installment sales or other remedies for breaches by servicemembers entering active-duty military service. The SCRA protects servicemembers from eviction and allows courts to stay proceedings. It prohibits the sale, foreclosure, or seizure of property during a servicemember's military service period and one year after, unless under a court order or agreement. The prohibition on foreclosure also includes fees associated with a notice of foreclosure. The SCRA protects servicemembers from foreclosure fees and allows courts to adjust obligations or stay proceedings if military service affects compliance. Unauthorized foreclosure actions against servicemembers are punishable by imprisonment or fines. Courts can appoint appraisers to determine property value in foreclosure cases involving servicemembers. The SCRA protects servicemembers from foreclosure fees and allows courts to adjust obligations or stay proceedings if military service affects compliance. Courts can appoint appraisers to determine property value in foreclosure cases involving servicemembers, and consider undue hardship to dependents. Military persons in rental property can terminate leases early under certain circumstances. The SCRA protects servicemembers from foreclosure fees and allows courts to adjust obligations or stay proceedings if military service affects compliance. Servicemembers can terminate leases early under certain circumstances, such as PCS orders or deployment with a military unit for a specified period. This right was expanded in 2004 to include joint leases and in 2018 to include the spouse of a servicemember who dies while in military service. The SCRA allows servicemembers to terminate property leases early under certain circumstances. The spouse of a servicemember who dies while in military service can also exercise this right within one year of the death. The cancellation of a lease takes effect either 30 days after the next rent due date for monthly leases or at the end of the following month for other leases. Any unpaid rent must be paid on a prorated basis. The SCRA allows servicemembers to terminate property leases early without early termination fees. The servicemember is entitled to a refund of prepaid rent for time after the lease is canceled within 30 days. The lessor cannot charge an early termination fee, but the servicemember is responsible for taxes and other obligations as per the lease terms. A court can make adjustments if the landlord petitions for an \"equitable offset\" before the lease is effectively canceled. To terminate a motor vehicle lease early, the servicemember must return the vehicle within 15 days of written notice, with the cancellation effective upon return. The SCRA allows servicemembers to terminate property leases early without fees. Servicemembers are responsible for taxes, summonses, title and registration fees, and other lease obligations. Anyone interfering with the return of property after lawful lease cancellation may face punishment. The section was replaced by the Veterans' Benefits Act of 2010. Under the Veterans' Benefits Act of 2010, servicemembers can terminate contracts for telephone exchange, cellular phone, cable, and internet services under certain circumstances. This includes relocating for at least 90 days to an area not covered by the contract. The service provider must cancel the contract without fees and allow the servicemember to retain their phone number. Dependents can also terminate their cellular service if accompanying the servicemember to an unsupported area. If a servicemember relocates to an area not covered by their service contract, they can terminate the contract without fees. Upon returning, they can re-subscribe within 90 days without a reinstatement fee. Servicemembers must return provider-owned equipment within ten days of service termination. Life insurance policies used as collateral are protected from foreclosure unless a court order is obtained, except when the assignee is the insurance company itself. The court can deny the order if military service materially affects the servicemember's ability to repay. During military service, the insured is protected from creditors making claims against the life insurance policy, except in specific cases. Violating this rule can result in imprisonment or fines. Servicemembers with property subject to liens are shielded from foreclosure during military service plus three months, unless a court determines they can meet the obligation. Servicemembers with property subject to liens are protected from foreclosure during military service plus three months, unless a court finds their ability to meet the obligation is unaffected. Violating these provisions can result in imprisonment or fines. Dependents of active-duty personnel can also benefit from the rules under the SCRA, but must petition a court for permission. Title IV of the SCRA provides relief from insurance premiums for servicemembers, ensuring continued coverage under certain commercial life insurance policies. Servicemembers can defer payments without losing coverage, and there is no need to show that military service affects their ability to pay. Definitions for 'Policy' include various types of life insurance contracts. 'Policy' includes various types of life insurance contracts that do not limit coverage based on military service, require higher premiums for servicemembers, or restrict coverage for military activities. 'Premium' is the amount needed to keep the policy in force. 'Insured' refers to the individual covered by the policy. The insured servicemember must apply for protection of a covered policy under the act by submitting a written application to the insurer. The total amount of policies covered is limited to $250,000 or the maximum limit of $400,000 for Servicemember's Group Life Insurance (SGLI). The insured servicemember, legal representative, or beneficiary must submit a written application identifying the policy and insurer for protection under the SCRA. The insurer reports the action to the Department of Veterans Affairs, and any necessary modifications to the policy are accepted. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs determines policy eligibility and notifies the parties accordingly. Once a policy is deemed qualified for protection under the SCRA, it cannot lapse or be terminated for nonpayment of premiums during military service and two years after. Approval from the Secretary of Veterans Affairs is required for certain withdrawals and payments. Insured individuals cannot take out loans or cash in the policy without approval. The insured can modify beneficiary designations, and if the policy matures due to death, the insurance company deducts unpaid premiums. Interest rates are specified for policy loans, and deductions must be reported to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. If premiums are not paid when the guarantee period ends and the cash surrender value is insufficient, the policy may be terminated, with the US paying the difference to the insurer. The insured's unpaid premiums become a debt owed to the United States, not dischargeable in bankruptcy. Funds collected are used for guaranteed premiums under the SCRA. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs regulates Title IV, with review by the Board of Veterans' Appeals and U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans' Claims. Judicial review is limited by Title 38, U.S. Code. The SCRA provides rights regarding public lands, exempts servicemembers from certain taxes, and protects their personal and real property from being sold to collect unpaid taxes without a court order. Military service can affect a servicemember's ability to pay taxes, and the court may stay the sale of their property for tax collection purposes. Servicemembers have the right to redeem their property for up to six months after leaving military service if it is sold to satisfy tax liabilities. Interest at 6% accrues on unpaid taxes, but no other penalties are allowed. Properties jointly owned with dependents are covered, but those owned through separate business entities are not. Servicemembers retain rights to public lands use even during military service. Servicemembers entering military service can suspend permits for grazing livestock on public lands for the duration of their service plus six months. Claims to desert lands prior to military service are protected from contestation or cancellation for failing to meet improvement requirements during service or hospitalization. Protection lasts during and for six months after leaving military service or being released from hospitalization. An honorably discharged servicemember with line-of-duty disability can apply for a land patent if unable to reclaim land or pay. Requirements for maintaining a mining claim are suspended during military service and hospitalization. The mining claim cannot be forfeited for nonperformance during this period. During military service, a person holding a permit or lease under federal mineral leasing laws can suspend operations for the duration of service plus six months. The period of service does not count towards the permit or lease term, and no rentals or royalties are required during this time. The servicemember must notify the Bureau of Land Management within six months of entering military service to qualify for these privileges. Military personnel are allowed to take actions to assert, perfect, or protect their rights covered by the law or regulations of the Department of the Interior. Affidavits or notarized documents can be submitted as evidence to assert these rights. The Secretary of the Interior provides military authorities with information on Title V benefits for distribution among servicemembers. Land rights protection is extended to servicemembers under 21, and residency requirements are suspended for six months after military service. The Secretary can issue regulations for Title V, excluding tax sections. Servicemembers are exempt from federal, state, and local income taxes during and after service. During military service, a servicemember's FICA taxes can be deferred if their ability to pay is affected. No interest or penalties can be imposed on the deferred debt. The statute of limitations for paying the debt is extended. Servicemembers do not change domicile for tax purposes when serving outside their home state. Conducting business while in service may result in taxation on the income. In tax jurisdiction, military compensation is not taxed for nonresident servicemembers. Spouses of servicemembers maintain residency if they have the same domicile. A spouse can elect to use the same residence for tax purposes in the year of marriage. Income earned in a duty-station tax jurisdiction is subject to taxation. Spouses of servicemembers can avoid taxation in a duty-station tax jurisdiction if they relocate solely to be with the servicemember. Personal property of servicemembers and spouses is not taxed in a jurisdiction other than their domicile while stationed outside their home state. Business property is not exempt from taxation. Indian servicemembers residing on a federal Indian reservation are only taxed under reservation laws, not state laws. Title VI of the SCRA allows courts to deny remedies to servicemembers if the purpose of the act is abused. It also outlines how a servicemember's military and financial status can be established in court. A court may deny protections of the act if a transfer is made with the intent to exploit the provisions of the act. A certificate signed by the Secretary concerned serves as prima facie evidence. A certificate signed by the Secretary concerned serves as prima facie evidence in an action under the SCRA, providing key details about the individual's military service. The SCRA allows courts to revoke, modify, or extend interlocutory orders and provides a means for servicemembers to petition for relief without waiting for creditor enforcement actions. It also offers relief from liability insurance premiums for servicemembers needing to maintain such policies. Courts may grant relief to servicemembers by staying enforcement of obligations, such as mortgage payments, for the duration of military service. Dependents do not have independent protection under this section. The court can stay enforcement of obligations for servicemembers during military service, allowing them to pay in installments over an extended period. No fines or penalties can be imposed during the stay if terms are met. This provision helps servicemembers facing financial challenges due to military service to renegotiate contracts and pay off debts gradually. During military service, servicemembers can have their obligations stayed by the court, allowing them to pay in installments without fines or penalties. A valid power of attorney for a missing servicemember is automatically extended for the entire missing period, limited to designated family members. Servicemembers on active duty can suspend payment of professional liability insurance premiums without losing coverage. The section defines \"profession\" and \"active duty\" and applies to those called to active duty under specific U.S. Code sections. Servicemembers on active duty can suspend professional liability insurance coverage under specific U.S. Code sections. Coverage is suspended from the time a request is made until the insured requests reinstatement in writing. In the case of a joint insurance policy, coverage is not suspended for policyholders not called to active duty. Premiums for suspended coverage must be refunded or applied to future premiums. The insurer is not liable for claims during a suspension period. The section clarifies that a professional person must ensure patients receive care in her absence during active duty. Failure to do so may result in the insurer being liable for claims. If a claim arises while the patient is receiving alternate care arranged by the servicemember, the insurer is not liable. In the event of a malpractice suit during a coverage suspension, litigation will be stayed if the malpractice occurred before the suspension began. Litigation stayed under this rule is deemed to be filed on the date the suspended insurance is reinstated. The period of any stay granted under this provision is not counted when computing the relevant statute of limitations. If a professional person dies during a suspension, any stay of litigation is lifted, and the insurer remains liable under the policy. Reinstatement of coverage requires a written request within 30 days after suspension. The insurer must notify the policyholder of the due date for payment of any premium required for reinstatement of the policy, which must be paid within 30 days. The premium for reinstated coverage cannot exceed the rate that would have applied if the servicemember had not been deployed. Insurers cannot recoup missing premiums by charging higher rates for reinstated coverage, except if rates were raised for all policyholders with similar coverage. Servicemembers called to military service have the right to reinstate their health insurance policy upon termination or release from service. They must apply within 120 days and insurers cannot impose new exclusions or waiting periods for pre-existing conditions. This does not apply to employer-sponsored health insurance plans. In 2006, Congress added language to Section 704 of USERRA to limit insurers from charging servicemembers premium increases on health insurance policies covered by the act. Premiums cannot be increased upon reinstatement above the pre-termination amount, but increased premiums for similarly covered individuals can be assessed to the servicemember. Military personnel and their spouses are not considered to have changed their residence for voting purposes. The SCRA protects servicemembers' assets from being attached to satisfy business debts, allows for modification of relief when warranted, and authorizes the Attorney General to bring civil actions against violators. Servicemembers can join these actions or initiate their own civil suits. The U.S. Attorney General can bring civil actions in U.S. district court for SCRA violations, with penalties up to $55,000 for first violations and $110,000 for subsequent violations. Individuals can intervene in these cases or initiate their own civil actions for SCRA violations. Individuals under the SCRA can file civil actions for relief, including monetary damages, attorney fees, and costs. Other remedies like consequential or punitive damages are not limited by Sections 801 and 802."
