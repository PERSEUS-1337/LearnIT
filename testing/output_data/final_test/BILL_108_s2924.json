    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Clinical Research Act of 2004\". The Congress recognizes the importance of strong academic health centers for clinical research, as breakthroughs in biomedical sciences provide valuable information for improving human health. Translating this information into clinical practice requires robust clinical research institutions. Without proper infrastructure, the data from basic science will not benefit the public. The clinical research environment faces challenges like facility decay and incompatible databases. The clinical research environment is hindered by facility decay, incompatible databases, shortage of qualified investigators, rising costs, inadequate funding, and regulatory burdens such as human subject research protections and record-keeping requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\nDirector - Director of the National Institutes of Health.\nEligible academic health center - Academic institution receiving at least $20,000,000 in grant funds for biomedical or behavioral research.\nSecretary - Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n\nSEC. 4. CLINICAL RESEARCH SUPPORT GRANTS. The Director will award clinical research support grants to eligible academic health centers for specific purposes, including covering costs related to human research subject protection and finding innovative ways to meet requirements efficiently. The Director will allocate appropriated funds among eligible academic health centers based on their investment in clinical research. To apply for a grant, centers must submit an application with required information. $40,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2005 to 2009 for this purpose. SEC. 5. CLINICAL RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE GRANTS. The Director may award clinical research infrastructure grants to eligible academic health centers for infrastructure necessary for translating new disease understandings into diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive methodologies, testing on human subjects, and overcoming obstacles like outdated IT systems and incompatible databases. To be eligible for a grant under this section, an academic health center must submit an application to the Director with required information. $125,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2005 through 2009 for this purpose. The Secretary may award grants to 5 academic health centers for partnerships in clinical research, with a maximum grant amount of $5,000,000 each. $25,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2005 through 2009."
