    "content": "The Act titled \"Federal Response to Energy Emergencies Act of 2005\" addresses unconscionable pricing of gasoline, oil, natural gas, and petroleum distillates during emergencies. During energy emergencies, it is illegal to sell crude oil, gasoline, natural gas, or petroleum distillates at excessively high prices or to take unfair advantage by unreasonably increasing prices. Factors considered include the price disparity between the product sold and the market price. During energy emergencies, selling crude oil, gasoline, natural gas, or petroleum distillates at excessively high prices is prohibited. Factors considered include price disparities and additional costs incurred by the seller. During energy emergencies, selling crude oil, gasoline, natural gas, or petroleum distillates at excessively high prices is prohibited. False reporting of pricing information related to these products to the Federal Trade Commission is also unlawful, especially if the data is known to be false or misleading and intended to affect market data. Market manipulation in connection with the purchase or sale of these products is also prohibited. The Federal Trade Commission prohibits the sale of crude oil, gasoline, natural gas, or petroleum distillates at wholesale using deceptive practices. Within 180 days of the Act's enactment, the FTC must create rules to enforce this regulation. SEC. 3. DECLARATION OF ENERGY EMERGENCY. If the President determines a shortage of crude oil, gasoline, natural gas, or petroleum distillates poses a risk to the US citizens' well-being, a Federal energy emergency can be declared, applying to the Nation, a region, or specific States. The President can declare a Federal energy emergency for a geographical region or one or more States for up to 45 days, with the option to extend the declaration multiple times. SEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT BY THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION. Enforcement of section 2 of the Act by the FTC includes treating violations as unfair or deceptive acts, with enforcement actions prioritizing companies with significant sales of oil products. Civil penalties for violations of the Act are specified separately from those under the FTC Act. The Act imposes penalties for violations, including price gouging and false information, with fines of up to 3 times the profits gained or $3,000,000 for violations. Civil penalties of up to $1,000,000 apply for violations of specific sections. Penalties are assessed similarly to civil penalties under the Federal Trade Commission Act. The Federal Trade Commission Act imposes penalties for violations, with fines of up to 3 times the profits gained or $3,000,000 for violations. Each day of a continuing violation is considered a separate violation, and the seriousness of the violation and efforts to remedy the harm caused are taken into consideration. SEC. 5 imposes criminal penalties for violating section 2, with fines up to $100,000,000 for corporations and $1,000,000 for individuals, along with possible imprisonment for up to 10 years. SEC. 6 allows state attorneys general to enforce the rules at the retail level. A State can bring a civil action in federal court to enforce the provisions of the Act or impose civil penalties if the attorney general believes residents' interests are threatened by a violation. The State must notify the Federal Trade Commission before initiating the action, providing a copy of the complaint if feasible. Upon receiving notice from a State attorney general, the Federal Trade Commission can intervene in a civil action, be heard on all matters, and file petitions for appeal. State attorneys general can still conduct investigations and compel evidence in civil actions. The venue for such actions will be in a judicial district. In civil actions under this Act, venue is determined by where the defendant operates, was authorized to do business, or is found. Process serving is not limited by district or state boundaries. Individuals involved in the violation can be joined in the action regardless of their residence. State actions are limited if the Federal Trade Commission has initiated a civil or administrative action. State officials can enforce civil or criminal statutes in State court. They can also bring actions against defendants named in complaints by the Federal Trade Commission for violations of this Act. The Consumer Relief Trust Fund will receive fines and penalties from this Act to assist low-income households with energy expenses. The Act does not limit the Federal Trade Commission's authority, and it does not preempt State laws. Market transparency for crude oil, gasoline, and petroleum distillates is also addressed. The Federal Trade Commission will promote price transparency in wholesale markets for crude oil and essential petroleum products, ensuring fair competition and consumer protection. Information on availability and prices of these products will be disseminated to various stakeholders, including the public, to prevent anticompetitive activities. The Federal Trade Commission aims to protect consumers and competitive markets by preventing collusion and anticompetitive behaviors through timely information disclosure. Information that could harm market operations or system security will be withheld from public disclosure. The Commission can gather information from any market participant to fulfill its objectives. The Federal Trade Commission can obtain information from market participants and rely on external entities to disclose information, ensuring price transparency. If necessary, the Commission may establish an electronic information system to enhance market transparency. The Federal Trade Commission may not affect existing electronic information filing requirements but can exempt entities with minimal market presence from reporting. Within 180 days of the Act's enactment, the Commission must establish a memorandum of understanding with other agencies for information sharing, including provisions for jurisdictional information requests. Within 180 days of the Act's enactment, the Federal Trade Commission will initiate a rulemaking proceeding to establish necessary rules for information sharing and coordination with other agencies. This does not limit the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's exclusive jurisdiction under the Commodity Exchange Act. SEC. 10. REPORT ON UNITED STATES ENERGY EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS.\n\nWithin 30 days of enactment, the Federal Trade Commission will submit a confidential report to Congress detailing the potential impact on domestic oil prices from disruptions in production and supplies. The report will also include projections of economic impacts and recommendations for remedies. SEC. 11. The Secretary of Energy and the Energy Information Administration will review activities of companies with significant sales of oil and petroleum products to protect the energy supply system and ensure stable prices. A report will be sent to Congress within 180 days, including assessments of companies' preparations for increased hurricane activity. SEC. 12 authorizes appropriations. SEC. 12 authorizes appropriations for carrying out the provisions of this Act."
