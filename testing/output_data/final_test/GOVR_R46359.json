Private health insurance cost sharing includes deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments.

Coverage and cost sharing depend on whether the service is provided by an in-network or out-of-network provider.

Private health insurance coverage for COVID-19 testing and treatment may vary by plan, with some plans required to cover testing without cost sharing. While federal laws do not mandate coverage for treatment services, certain plans must cover a core set of essential health benefits. States determine benefit coverage requirements within these categories, allowing for variation among plans. Current regulation allows each state to select an EHB-benchmark plan, leading to variation in EHB coverage. CMS issued guidance on March 5 and 12, 2020, stating that all 51 EHB-benchmark plans cover COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment. Specific benefits within EHB categories may vary by state and plan. The March 12 document confirms that coverage of medically necessary hospitalizations includes isolation and quarantine during the hospital admission, with variations by state and plan. Quarantine at home is not a medical benefit, but home health care or telemedicine may be covered as EHB.

Individual and fully insured small-group plans are subject to Essential Health Benefit (EHB) requirements, while large-group plans, self-insured plans, grandfathered plans, and short-term limited duration insurance (STLDI) are not. State benefit coverage requirements may impact COVID-19 treatment, and plans may choose to cover additional benefits voluntarily. Federal requirements on consumer cost sharing for COVID-19 treatment services apply if covered by the plan and defined as EHB by the state.

In 2020, out-of-pocket limits for in-network Essential Health Benefits (EHB) coverage cannot exceed $8,150 for self-only and $16,300 for other coverage. Once this amount is reached, the plan covers 100% of remaining costs for the year. This maximum applies to individual health insurance and small- and large-group plans, whether fully insured or self-insured, but not to grandfathered plans.
