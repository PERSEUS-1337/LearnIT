    "content": "The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) under the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) aims to improve the nation's health safety net by providing access to healthcare services for the uninsured, isolated, and medically vulnerable. HRSA's Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) focuses on promoting health, preventing risks, and reducing severe maternal morbidity (SMM) and maternal mortality in the U.S. according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Severe maternal morbidity includes conditions like eclampsia and heart failure that impact maternal health during labor and delivery. The CDC reports an increase in severe maternal morbidity (SMM) and maternal mortality in the U.S. The SMM rate rose by 190.9% from 1993 to 2014, while the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) increased by 32.8% from 2004 to 2018. Efforts are being made to address these issues in the FY2019 appropriations report for the Department of Health and Human Services. The FY2019 appropriations report allocated $109.6 million to the Special Projects of Regional and National Significance (SPRANS) for maternal health programs, including $26 million for HRSA. This funding supported the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health (AIM) program and the AIM-Community Care Initiative. In FY2019, HRSA allocated $23 million for the State Maternal Health Innovation program and established the Rural Maternity and Obstetrics Management Strategies program. The FY2020 appropriations report provided $5 million for AIM programs and $23 million for the State MHI program, with an overall increase in SPRANS funding to $119.1 million. For FY2020, HRSA allocated $2 million to the RMOMS program, $5 million for AIM programs, and $23 million for the State MHI program. In FY2021, HRSA is requesting $12 million for RMOMS, $15 million for AIM programs, and $53 million for the State MHI program. HRSA funds these programs through cooperative agreements with substantial involvement anticipated between HRSA and the recipient. The report provides an overview of five maternal health programs administered by HRSA under the Improving Maternal Health in America initiative. It includes details on the AIM program aimed at improving maternal health outcomes by reducing preventable SMMs and maternal deaths. Funding allocations and program criteria are also discussed. The AIM program, funded by HRSA, aims to improve maternal health outcomes by reducing preventable SMMs and maternal deaths. ACOG has been the sole grantee of the program since 2014, responsible for engaging stakeholders, promoting safety bundles, and providing provider education on interconception health. The hospital-focused maternal safety bundles, funded by HRSA, aim to improve patient outcomes and reduce maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity (SMM). These bundles consist of evidence-based practices grouped into four administrative activities: readiness, recognition and prevention, response, and reporting/systems learning. There are currently eight hospital-focused maternal safety bundles being adopted by states for inpatient use, including the Maternal Mental Health: Depression and Anxiety bundle. The AIM program, funded by HRSA, involves 1,300 hospitals in 27 states aiming to reduce maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity. Core activities include multidisciplinary collaborations, national implementation of safety bundles, and data analysis. Objectives include maintaining existing state-based teams, accepting new teams, developing new safety bundles, and improving maternity care practices. The AIM program, funded by HRSA, aims to reduce maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity by preventing 100,000 cases of SMM and 1,000 maternal deaths. Eligible entities can apply for the program and must provide annual progress reports to HRSA. Performance reports focus on measures like sustainability, depression screening, well-woman visits, and health equity in maternal health outcomes. The Project Officer will provide additional information about the final report narrative. The AIM program, funded by HRSA, aims to reduce maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity. HRSA may allocate up to $2 million annually to the AIM-Community Care Initiative recipient. The initiative supports continuity of care for pregnant and postpartum women outside of birthing facilities. On August 1, 2018, HRSA awarded $2 million to ACOG for maternal safety bundles implementation. The AIM-Community Care Initiative aims to expand maternal safety bundles to all 50 U.S. states, focusing on nonhospital maternal safety bundles for outpatient settings and community-based organizations. It addresses preventable severe maternal morbidity and maternal deaths among pregnant and postpartum women receiving care outside of birthing facilities and hospitals. The AIM-Community Care Initiative is developing two maternal safety bundles for postpartum care outside of hospitals. The recipient will advance these bundles by developing data metrics, testing effectiveness in outpatient settings, and collaborating with key stakeholders to address preventable severe maternal morbidity and maternal deaths. The AIM-Community Care Initiative recipient collaborates with the Supporting Maternal Health Innovation Program to develop resource materials for nonhospital-focused maternal safety bundles. The recipient will also disseminate these materials and evidence-informed strategies to communities experiencing disparities in U.S. maternal morbidity and mortality over a five-year period. Core activities include establishing a maternal safety workgroup and facilitating national implementation. The AIM-Community Care Initiative recipient collaborates with the Supporting Maternal Health Innovation Program to develop resource materials for nonhospital-focused maternal safety bundles. Core activities include convening a maternal safety workgroup, facilitating national implementation, and collecting data to achieve program outcomes. HRSA aims to increase knowledge and awareness of nonhospital-focused maternal safety bundles, increase implementation capacity, develop new bundles addressing emerging topics, and raise awareness among staff and providers in community-based organizations and outpatient clinical settings. The AIM-Community Care Initiative recipient is tasked with establishing a maternal safety workgroup and facilitating the national implementation of nonhospital maternal safety bundles at test sites in outpatient clinical settings and nonclinical organizations. The AIM-Community Care Initiative recipient will collaborate with key stakeholders to disseminate nonhospital maternal safety bundles to outpatient clinical settings and community-based organizations serving pregnant and postpartum women. They will also support the development and maintenance of a public website containing materials on non-hospital focused maternal safety bundles. The AIM-Community Care Initiative recipient will collaborate with stakeholders to disseminate maternal safety bundles to outpatient settings and collect data on implementation. Eligible entities include tribes, community-based, and faith-based organizations. Awardees must provide progress and performance reports to HRSA. The final performance report for the AIM-Community Care Initiative must include project abstract, expenditure data, and performance scores. HRSA may allocate approximately $1,830,000 annually to the recipient, depending on program progress and government interest. No cost-sharing or matching requirements are needed for the funds. The RMOMS program has no cost-sharing requirements and funds can be used for various costs. Recipients must allocate 40-50% of the award for subrecipients' test sites and travel/meeting compensation. In FY2019, HRSA awarded $1.8 million to one recipient for the RMOMS program, which aims to improve maternal health care in rural communities. Recipients are chosen based on factors like ethnicity/race disparities and access to maternal health care. The program has four goals to improve maternal health. The RMOMS program aims to improve maternal and neonatal health care outcomes in rural communities. It has a four-year performance period from September 1, 2019, to August 31, 2023, with two phases. Phase one involves developing baseline data, models, and work plans, as well as building network capacity and infrastructure. Collaboration with HRSA is essential to assess the program's impact using specific measures and data elements. The RMOMS program aims to improve maternal and neonatal health care outcomes in rural communities by assessing impact through specific measures and data elements, including access, workforce proficiency, cost-effectiveness, clinical outcomes, quality of care, and healthy behaviors. Models address RMOMS focus areas, payment options, workforce skills, and women's access to maternal health care services, including telehealth. Congress allocated $1 million for telehealth implementation out of the $23 million provided to SPRANS for new maternal health grants in FY2019. In FY2019, Congress allocated $1 million for telehealth implementation to support rural obstetric care coordination. RMOMS program award recipients develop three-year work plans with baseline data and strategic implementation plans. Phase two involves implementing models, providing case management and care coordination services to mothers and infants, and collaborating with HRSA to monitor data elements. Recipients create strategies for RMOMS focus areas: rural hospital obstetric service aggregation, network approach to care coordination, and leveraging telehealth. The RMOMS program focuses on coordinating a continuum of care, leveraging telehealth and specialty care, and ensuring financial sustainability. Eligible entities include public or private, nonprofit or for-profit organizations, tribes, tribal organizations, community-based organizations, and faith-based organizations. Applicant organizations must have the necessary staff and infrastructure to manage program activities and serve populations in HRSA-designated rural areas. The RMOMS program requires applicant organizations to be part of a network that includes rural hospitals, health centers, state Home Visiting and Healthy Start Programs, and the state Medicaid agency. The network must consist of at least two rural hospitals or critical access hospitals, one health center under section 330 of the Public Health Service Act, and other specified entities. The RMOMS program requires applicant organizations to be part of a formal network that includes rural hospitals, health centers, Healthy Start Programs, and the state Medicaid agency. The network must have signed bylaws, a governing body, and separate Employer Identification Numbers (EINs) for each entity. Recipients must provide annual progress reports and performance measure reports to HRSA. Recipients of the RMOMS program must submit annual progress reports, performance measure reports, sustainability reports, and final closeout reports. These reports detail progress towards program goals, including leveraging telehealth and specialty care. HRSA provides guidance on reporting performance measures and completing the sustainability report. Final closeout reports are due within 90 days of the end of the performance period. The RMOMS program award recipients must submit a final closeout report to MCHB within 90 days after the performance period ends. The report should include barriers faced, core performance data, and project impact. HRSA administers and funds the program using two authorities, providing up to $150,000 annually for telehealth activities and up to $450,000 for activities in each of the four focus areas. The RMOMS program award recipients can receive up to $1.8 million per year for activities in four focus areas. Funding is subject to availability of funds and recipient performance. Recipients can use funds for direct and indirect costs, staff travel expenses, and technical workshops. No cost-sharing or matching requirements are needed. In FY2019, HRSA awarded $9 million to the State Maternal Health Innovation (MHI) program, which funds state-focused projects to improve maternal health outcomes. Recommendations from HRSA's Maternal Mortality Summit include providing team-based support and improving maternity health care services. Recipients collaborate to implement actionable items in their states. The State MHI program recipients collaborate with other HRSA program awardees to improve maternal health outcomes. The program has a five-year performance period and focuses on establishing a Maternal Health Task Force, improving maternal health data, and promoting innovation in service delivery. Each State MHI award recipient is responsible for establishing a state-focused Maternal Health Task Force comprising multidisciplinary stakeholders. The Maternal Health Task Force, consisting of stakeholders from state and federal programs, is tasked with identifying maternal health gaps and creating a strategic plan to improve maternal health outcomes. The plan must align with the State Title V Needs Assessment and avoid duplicating existing activities. The Maternal Health Task Force, made up of stakeholders from state and federal programs, must develop strategic plans to improve maternal health outcomes without duplicating existing activities. State MHI award recipients are required to participate in peer-to-peer learning sessions to enhance their program implementation. Recipients should focus on improving state-level data on maternal health through a state-focused demonstration project. A state-focused demonstration project aims to address the need for maternal health data and surveillance by coordinating with other initiatives, such as collecting and analyzing maternal morbidity and mortality data and working with a multidisciplinary maternal mortality review committee. The project also focuses on analyzing valid data to determine preventable maternal deaths and establish recommendations for improvement. The goal of the analysis is to determine the preventability of maternal deaths and establish best practices for prevention. State-focused demonstration projects aim to promote innovation in maternal health service delivery by addressing critical gaps in access to care, workforce needs, and postpartum interventions. The curr_chunk discusses interconception care interventions, including implementing AIM maternal safety bundles, addressing access to maternal health care, workforce needs, and disseminating patient educational information. HRSA encourages the use of telehealth in demonstration projects. The Supporting MHI program recipient hosts a web-based platform for State MHI program recipients to consolidate their work and facilitates annual in-person meetings. The State MHI Program hosts annual in-person meetings for award recipients, including public and private entities, tribes, and community-based organizations. Recipients must submit annual progress reports and data on maternal deaths by September 29, 2020. HRSA requires performance data on health insurance coverage and women's healthcare by the same date. The Supporting MHI award recipient must assist State MHI award recipients in achieving performance milestones related to women's health, including coverage, prenatal care, well-woman visits, and reducing pregnancy-related deaths and disparities. Performance reports evaluate quality improvement and state capacity in maternal and child health. The State MHI program provides funding for up to nine cooperative agreements annually, ranging from $1.9 million to $2.1 million in FY2019. Recipients must submit a final performance report including expenditure data and performance scores. Funds can be used to address state and local priorities with no cost-sharing requirements. The State MHI program aims to reduce U.S. cases of SMM and maternal mortality, improve maternal health outcomes, and support HRSA recipients in implementing evidence-informed strategies. Recipients include state health agencies, community-based organizations, pregnant and postpartum women, and HRSA award recipients. The program objectives include improving recipients' ability to implement strategies, supporting peer-to-peer learning opportunities, and resources for improving maternal health outcomes by 2024. The State MHI program aims to reduce U.S. cases of severe maternal morbidity and mortality, improve maternal health outcomes, and support HRSA recipients in implementing evidence-informed strategies. The FY2019 Supporting MHI program has a five-year performance period, providing capacity-building assistance and establishing a national resource center. This includes increasing dissemination of resource materials and evidence-informed strategies to address disparities in maternal morbidity and mortality. The Supporting MHI program grantee provides technical assistance, training, and information dissemination to the State MHI program and RMOMS program recipients. They offer support in programmatic, scientific, and mentoring aspects, as well as training on curriculum development and delivery. The goal is to disseminate evidence-informed strategies to communities facing maternal health disparities in the U.S. The recipient is tasked with providing capacity-building assistance on 10 topic areas and convening a community of learners for peer-to-peer learning and problem-solving sessions. The Supporting MHI program recipient facilitates problem-solving sessions for State MHI program recipients, assesses progress, and organizes annual meetings. They establish a national resource center for reducing maternal mortality, offering guidance, training, and technical assistance on various topics. This includes support for Healthy Start and MIECHV program grantees. The Supporting MHI program recipient collaborates with stakeholders serving underserved populations to encourage partnership building. They offer policy analysis assistance to stakeholders and HRSA award recipients, including help in determining evidence-informed maternal safety bundles. The resource center also assists in developing partnerships with national maternal health organizations. The Supporting MHI program focuses on reducing U.S. cases of maternal morbidity and mortality through education, training, and national guidance. Key stakeholders can access resources and training materials through a web-based clearinghouse. The program also collaborates with stakeholders serving underserved populations and provides policy analysis assistance. The Supporting MHI Program provides technical assistance to key stakeholders in maternal health services for populations facing disparities in U.S. maternal morbidity and mortality. Eligible entities include public and private organizations, tribes, tribal organizations, community-based organizations, and faith-based organizations. Awardees must submit annual progress reports and performance reports to HRSA, with a final report due in 2024. The program aims to achieve three objectives related to maternal health innovation and health equity. The Supporting MHI Program provides technical assistance for maternal health outcomes, state capacity, perinatal care, depression screening, and insurance coverage. A final report with expenditure data and performance scores must be submitted within 90 days. Approximately $2.6 million may be awarded annually, with funds used for administrative costs.
