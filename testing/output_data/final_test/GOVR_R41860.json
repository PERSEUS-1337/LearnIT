    "content": "The report focuses on the CWS and PSSF programs, which provide formula grants for child welfare services. PSSF funds support various activities including grants for court improvement, partnerships for children affected by substance abuse, caseworker visits for foster children, and program-related research. Additional programs under Title IV-B are also discussed. The report focuses on Title IV-B programs such as Family Connection grants, Child Welfare Training, Research and Demonstration projects, the National Random Sample Study of Child Welfare, and the Mentoring Children of Prisoners program. These programs are administered by the Children's Bureau within the Administration on Children Youth and Families at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Funding for these programs was extended through FY2016 by the Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act. The report outlines the federal-state framework for child welfare, detailing the activities public child welfare agencies are expected to perform and the children and families served by CWS and PSSF programs. States have the primary obligation to ensure child welfare, but the federal government provides funding to strengthen services and supports, setting certain standards. Public child welfare agencies at the state level work with various professionals to carry out child welfare duties and ensure children's safety, permanency, and well-being. They aim to strengthen families so children can rely on their parents for support and protection. Public child welfare agencies are responsible for identifying and providing services to families at risk of abuse or neglect, as well as children who have been abused or neglected. They work to establish permanent living arrangements for children in foster care as quickly as possible. Child welfare agencies aim to reunite children in foster care with their parents whenever possible. If reunification is not feasible, agencies work to find a permanent home through adoption, guardianship, or placement with relatives. Ensuring safety, permanence, education, and healthcare are top priorities for children in foster care. Agencies also provide ongoing support for stability after children leave foster care. Child welfare agencies provide services to ensure stability and safety of the family home. They support youth transitioning out of foster care to adulthood. Title IV-B funds can be used to serve children and families related to child welfare. Most children come into contact with agencies following allegations of abuse or neglect. In FY2012, 6.3 million children were referred to child welfare agencies for investigations. In FY2012, child welfare agencies conducted investigations related to allegations of child abuse or neglect involving up to 3.8 million children. Over a million of these children received child welfare services after the investigation. Most services are provided in the child's home, with some children placed in foster care for safety. Federal funds support investigations and services to strengthen families. Less than half of children in foster care are eligible for federal assistance. Under the CWS program, federal law mandates that all children in foster care receive the same protections for case planning and review, regardless of Title IV-E eligibility. State child welfare agencies must ensure a child's safe return to family or find a new permanent home quickly. CWS funds cover case planning and review services for all children in foster care, while both CWS and PSSF funds can be used for additional services like parenting skills training or substance abuse treatment. The CWS and PSSF programs provide services for children in foster care, including case planning, reunification, adoption, and guardianship. These programs have overlapping purposes but distinct requirements and funding methods. They aim to support children leaving foster care by strengthening families or providing assistance to youth without a permanent home. The CWS program under Title IV-B, Subpart 1 of the Social Security Act provides funds to states, territories, and tribes to promote state flexibility in developing services for children and families. It aims to protect children, prevent abuse, support foster care and adoption, and ensure a qualified child welfare workforce. The Child Welfare Services (CWS) program, authorized in 1935, provides funding for states to support child welfare services. The program was last amended in 2011 and is set to expire in FY2016. Congress allocated $269 million for the program in FY2014, allowing states to use funds for various services like child abuse investigations, counseling, and foster care visits. States allocate Child Welfare Services (CWS) funds for various services including case planning, case review, adoption support, and emergency assistance. CWS funds cannot be used for regular education or medical care costs. The largest share of FY2013 CWS funds (41%) was planned for child protective services, such as abuse investigations and caseworker activities for children in foster care or living at home. Over 38% of funds were allocated for family services. In FY2013, states planned to allocate more than 38% of their Child Welfare Services (CWS) funds on family support, family preservation, time-limited family reunification, and adoption promotion and support. The distribution of planned spending by category is shown in Figure 4, with the \"All Other\" category encompassing additional services and activities. Table 2 provides descriptions of the supported activities in selected service categories, based on statutory definitions and guidance. In FY2013, states planned to allocate over 38% of their Child Welfare Services (CWS) funds on family support, preservation, reunification, and adoption promotion. HHS guidance prohibits CWS funds from being used for education or medical expenses. States must show prior spending on foster care, adoption, and child care to continue using CWS funds for these purposes. In FY2013, states planned to allocate federal CWS funds for foster care maintenance payments, adoption assistance payments, and other child welfare services. Six states intended to use more than 50% of their federal CWS funding for foster care maintenance payments. Additionally, five states planned to use some federal CWS dollars for adoption assistance payments. States are restricted from using federal CWS funds for education or medical expenses. In FY2013, states planned to allocate federal CWS funds for foster care maintenance payments, adoption assistance payments, and other child welfare services. States are prohibited from spending more than 10% of their CWS funds for program administration. For FY2013, half of all states reported plans to spend the maximum 10% of their federal CWS for program administration. Federal law requires states to meet specific plan requirements to receive Child Welfare Services (CWS) funds, focusing on protections and services for children in foster care. Administration costs for the CWS program do not include salaries for caseworkers or case managers, travel expenses, or program oversight. States must also have a statewide information system in place as part of their CWS plan. States receiving Child Welfare Services (CWS) funds must have a statewide information system to track children in foster care, ensure they have written case plans, and provide services for reunification or permanent placement. Standards for caseworker visits and diligent recruitment of diverse foster and adoptive homes are also required. The Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act of 2011 requires states to recruit diverse foster and adoptive homes, ensure continuity of services during disasters, and develop a health oversight plan for children in foster care. States must also address emotional trauma and monitor psychotropic medications for children in foster care. The Health and Human Services (HHS) emphasizes the importance of trauma screening and ongoing assessment for children in foster care to develop appropriate treatment plans. HHS cautions about the use of psychotropic medications, stating they should be prescribed carefully with documented clinical evidence due to potential side effects. The law reauthorizing the CWS program requires states to work on shortening the time children under five spend in foster care and ensure their developmental needs are met. States must track the number of young children in care and provide services based on their developmental needs. The CWS plan must include descriptions for various child populations, such as those at risk of foster care placement and abandoned infants. States must have procedures for legal representation and collect data on children adopted from other countries. States are required to report on child maltreatment-related fatalities using various data sources as mandated by the Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act. If vital information sources are not included in the report, states must explain why and how they will be incorporated. This requirement was to be fulfilled in the Annual Progress and Services Report. States must describe their efforts to provide child welfare services, expand services, and improve child outcomes in their CWS plans. They must collaborate with state courts and remain in compliance with the Indian Child Welfare Act. Staff development, training programs, and reports to HHS are also required. The CWS state plan requirements mandate compliance with the Indian Child Welfare Act and coordination with various state programs. Federal funding for the CWS program has been stagnant or decreasing for nearly two decades, with an annual authorization of $325 million through FY2016. The CWS program has seen funding levels fluctuate over the years, with an appropriation of $269 million in FY2014. Funding peaked at $295 million in FY1994 and has since declined. Each state and territory receives a base allotment of $70,000, with additional funds allocated based on the number of individuals under 21 and the state's average per capita income. In FY2014, states and territories received $262.4 million in CWS funding, with $6.3 million distributed to tribes. The median CWS allotment to a state child welfare agency was $3.7 million, with California receiving the largest allotment of $30.8 million and Alaska the smallest at $194,000. In FY2014, states received CWS funding based on compliance with program rules. States failing to meet caseworker visit goals faced reduced federal funding. 12 states saw their funding lowered for not meeting targets, but all states met the target for visits to children in their place of residence. Tribes and tribal organizations must submit a plan to HHS for approval to receive CWS funding directly from the federal government. HHS determines the amount of funds provided to tribes based on their share of a state's under-age-21 population. For FY2014, 189 tribal entities received CWS tribal funding, with amounts ranging from a little over $12,200 to close to $906,400. Nationally, this funding represented 2.4% of overall federal CWS support for tribal children. The allocation of funds to tribal child welfare agencies varies based on the proportion of tribal children in a state. The allocation of Child Welfare Services (CWS) funds to tribal entities varies significantly among states, with some states directing only 3% or less of funding to tribal children, while others allocate up to 70% (e.g., Alaska). The Promoting Safe and Stable Families (PSSF) program provides funds for family support services, family preservation, reunification, and adoption support to states, territories, and tribes. The Promoting Safe and Stable Families program, enacted in 1993, provides support services to at-risk families, ensures children's safety, and supports family reunification and adoption. Congress renamed the grants in 1997 and required states to use funds for family reunification and adoption promotion. The Promoting Safe and Stable Families program underwent changes through various legislative acts, with total funding authorized at $545 million annually. $345 million is mandatory for states, and $200 million is discretionary. Funding expired in FY2016, with appropriations peaking at $434 million in FY2006 and FY2007. In FY2013, all funding was subject to sequestration, totaling $387 million. Overall, funding for the Promoting Safe and Stable Families program has fluctuated over the years. In FY2014, the program funding decreased to $380 million, with $305 million allocated to states, territories, and tribes for child welfare services. Additional funds were distributed for other program activities, such as grants to state and tribal highest courts. The Promoting Safe and Stable Families program funding includes support for highest courts, research, evaluation, training, and technical assistance. Additional funds are allocated for targeted purposes like improving outcomes for children affected by parental substance abuse and enhancing caseworker visits with children in foster care. Congress has added set-asides to the program since its inception. For FY2014, states, territories, and tribes received $305 million in federal funds for PSSF child and family services, including family support, preservation, and reunification services. The PSSF program provides services for parent-child reunification within the first 15-17 months of foster care placement. Adoption promotion and support services aim to increase adoptions from foster care and provide pre- and post-adoptive services. States must allocate a significant portion of funding to these services, with about 20% for each category. In FY2013, states planned to spend half of the federal PSSF funding on family support. In FY2013, states planned to spend roughly half of federal PSSF funding on family support (26%) and family preservation (25%) services. Adoption promotion and support, as well as time-limited family reunification services, were also allocated funding. States planned to spend the remaining funds on program administration and other service-related costs. This spending plan closely mirrored states' actual spending in FY2010. States reported planning to spend less than 20% in a category in FY2013 or actually spent less in FY2010. Most states cited using money from another source for the given purpose. The PSSF program allows for spending on a limited set of child welfare purposes compared to the CWS program. PSSF plan requirements are less focused on children in foster care. However, three out of four service categories for federal PSSF funds target services for children in foster care and their families. Only \"family support\" services do not explicitly target children in foster care. The PSSF program requires states to prioritize child safety and provide child and family services. States must target services, set goals, coordinate services, and report on progress. Additional requirements focus on fiscal and program administration. States must describe how they will support children at greatest risk. The PSSF program mandates states to prioritize child safety and provide services. States must identify children at greatest risk for maltreatment, set goals, and assess progress annually. A five-year plan must be established with measures to evaluate achievements. States must develop a final report at the end of the period and consult with agencies to set new goals for the next plan. States are required to develop a new set of goals for a new five-year plan and provide updates to HHS. They must describe child and family services they plan to provide and report on expenditures under Title IV-B programs. States must participate in evaluations and furnish required reports. HHS implemented regulations in 1996 for the Child and Family Services Plan and Annual Progress and Services Review. HHS implemented regulations in 1996 for the Child and Family Services Plan (CFSP) and the Annual Progress and Services Review (APSR). The five-year CFSP and its annual update (the APSR) are to incorporate required information and assurances for states seeking funds under various child welfare programs. HHS issues guidance annually to states on complying with planning and reporting requirements. States must coordinate PSSF-funded services with other federal programs where feasible. The PSSF program must be administered by the same state agency as the CWS program. States must ensure that no more than 10% of program funds are spent on administration. Administrative costs for the PSSF program do not include planning, delivery of services, consultation, training, quality assurance, data collection, evaluation, and supervision. States must include specific services in their PSSF plan. The PSSF program requires states to include specific services in their plan and ensure funds are not used to replace existing services. States must also provide necessary methods for program administration. In FY2014, $295 million in PSSF funds were available for grants to states and territories for child and family services. Each state is allocated funds based on its share. In FY2014, states and territories received PSSF funds based on their share of children receiving SNAP benefits. States must match federal funds with $1 for every $3 provided and limit program administration spending to 10%. The median PSSF allotment to state child welfare agencies was $4.0 million, with Texas receiving the largest allotment of $31.3 million and Wyoming the smallest at $239,000. Tribal child and family services funding is reserved from the overall PSSF program. Funding for tribal child and family services is reserved from the overall PSSF appropriation before allocation to states and territories. 3% of mandatory PSSF funding is reserved for tribal grants, with an additional 3% from discretionary funds. Tribes seeking PSSF funding must submit a plan to HHS for approval, meeting similar requirements as states. Tribes may be exempted from spending requirements based on their resources and needs. For FY2014, HHS allotted PSSF funds to 138 tribal entities serving children in 29 states. The median tribal PSSF allotment was just above $30,000 while the largest such allotment exceeded $1.4 million (to Navajo Nation) and the smallest was just above the minimum tribal allotment amount of $10,000 (to the Chitimacha). Support for child and family services provided by states, tribes, and territories is crucial. The primary purpose of PSSF funds is to support child and family services provided by states, tribes, and territories. However, certain funds are also reserved for additional programs such as grants for court improvement, improving outcomes for children affected by parental substance abuse, supporting caseworker visits for children in foster care, and research and evaluation related to PSSF programs. The Court Improvement Program provides formula grant funding to state highest courts to enhance their handling of child welfare-related proceedings. The Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act provides grant funding for court improvement purposes, with $1 million reserved for tribal courts. States' highest courts can apply for CIP funds for specific purposes, while tribal grantees receive a single sum of funds for various court improvement activities. The Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act provides grant funding for court improvement purposes, including grants for assessing and improving handling of child abuse and neglect proceedings, training judges and legal personnel in child welfare cases, and improving court decisions regarding children's safety and well-being through data collection and analysis. Grants can also support activities that increase family engagement in court proceedings related to child welfare. Eligibility for grants requires the highest court in a state to operate a Title IV-E foster care program and have rules ensuring foster parents' involvement in court proceedings. The Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act provides grant funding for court improvement purposes, including grants for assessing and improving handling of child abuse and neglect proceedings. The highest courts in each state must ensure that foster parents, pre-adoptive parents, and relative caregivers are notified of any proceedings regarding the child in foster care. State highest courts are now required to submit a single application for grants related to adoption and foster care. State highest courts must submit a single application indicating whether they are applying for all three purposes of CIP funding. They are expected to receive funding for each year through FY2016 based on successful progress towards identified outcomes. This includes updated strategic plans, year-end assessment reports, and participation in review calls hosted by HHS. State highest courts applying for CIP funds must demonstrate collaboration with child welfare agencies and Indian tribes, outline funding goals, establish data sharing protocols, allocate training funds for joint initiatives, and provide additional information as requested by HHS. HHS requires state highest courts to establish a multidisciplinary taskforce for CIP efforts, including a letter of support from the state child welfare agency. Courts must implement continuous quality improvement procedures to ensure due process in child abuse and neglect proceedings. The court's child abuse and neglect proceedings focus on due process, timely hearings, quality legal representation, and family engagement. State highest courts must collect data on timeliness measures since FY2013, including time to first permanency hearing, subsequent hearings, legal permanency, termination of parental rights petition, and overall case resolution. State highest courts with approved CIP applications receive a minimum grant of $85,000 and additional funds based on the state's population under 21 years of age. They must provide $1 in program funding for every $3 in federal funding received under the CIP. The Children's Improvement Program (CIP) was established in FY1995 with funds from the Program for State Courts to assess child welfare proceedings. Funding for the CIP started at $5 million in FY1995, increased to $10 million for FY1996-FY2001, and reached over $13 million in FY2005 with additional discretionary funding. The Deficit Reduction Act expanded the CIP's purposes and allocated an extra $20 million annually. The Children's Improvement Program (CIP) was established in FY1995 with funds from the Program for State Courts to assess child welfare proceedings. Funding for the CIP started at $5 million in FY1995, increased to $10 million for FY1996-FY2001, and reached over $13 million in FY2005 with additional discretionary funding. The Deficit Reduction Act expanded the CIP's purposes and allocated an extra $20 million annually for the CIP, with funding now provided through a reservation of funds appropriated for the PSSF program. HHS awarded grants for tribal court improvement in September 2012, with awards up to $150,000 per year for three years to seven tribal entities. Each grantee received their third year of funding in late FY2014. HHS plans to fund a second round of Tribal Court Improvement grants starting in FY2015. Up to 10 grants may be awarded, with $40 million in mandatory PSSF program funds reserved for specific purposes. This targeting of funds was first included in the Child and Family Services Improvement Act of 2006. The 2011 Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act extended provisions targeting PSSF funds for children in foster care due to parental substance abuse. In FY2013, 28% of children entered foster care due to drug abuse by parents, and 6% due to alcohol abuse. The percentage of children remaining in care due to substance abuse issues is believed to be higher. In 2006, Congress authorized grants for services to improve the safety of children in out-of-home placement due to parental substance abuse. HHS awarded grants to regional partnerships for this purpose. In 2006, Congress authorized grants for regional partnerships to address methamphetamine abuse through various services and activities. The law required HHS to establish performance indicators for grantees and provide annual reports to Congress. In 2011, Congress extended funding for these grants for an additional five years and made limited changes to the program. The regional partnership grants program was initially funded with $145 million over five years, with an extension of $100 million for five more years in 2011. By FY2014, 64 partnerships in 32 states had received funding. The regional partnership grants program provides federal funding to grantees in 32 states, including tribal areas, for five-year projects. Grantees must match 15-25% of the federal funding. HHS submitted three annual reports on the initial round of grantees' work through the fourth year of the grant period. The most recent report, submitted in March 2014, discusses performance indicators across sites for the initial grantees. HHS plans to issue a final report on the work of the first 53 grantees, covering the full five-year grant period. A cross-site evaluation of the second round of grantees is also contracted, with an evaluation report expected in December 2017. Over the four years of the grant period, 12,238 families, including close to 14,462 adults and 20,276 children, were served through the initial 53 regional partnership grants, with most targeting families at risk of entering or already in foster care. Grantees focused on serving families at-risk of entering or already in foster care. The average number of families served ranged from 24 to 1,305, with an average of 231. Those discharged from the program had an average service length of 215 days. Strategies included court-based drug treatment programs and improving access to treatment services for families affected by parental substance abuse. HHS reported that by year four of the grant program, regional partnerships had refined their service models to better meet the needs of families with substance abuse concerns. This included adding or expanding services to address trauma effects, improving children's service needs, integrating services for adults and children, and strengthening recovery services through peer/parent mentors. The 2006 law authorized regional partnership grants to focus on recovery services, including peer/parent mentors and recovery coaches, as well as key supportive services like housing and medical care. HHS established 23 performance indicators to assess grantees' work in safety, permanency, recovery, well-being, and systems collaboration, using a web-based program for data reporting. When Congress established regional partnerships as the only entities eligible to receive grant funding, it signaled strong interest in a collaborative approach to addressing child welfare needs of children affected by parental substance abuse. By year four of the program, all grantees had child welfare services and substance abuse treatment agencies involved, with 74% also including courts or court-related organizations in their partnerships. By year four of the program, most regional partnerships included 10 or more partners, with key constituencies being courts, mental health agencies, community-based providers, criminal justice partners, education groups, adult health services, employment agencies, and housing providers. Grantees emphasize the importance of collaboration in identifying and responding to families' needs, but acknowledge that it requires ongoing effort and planning. Grantees stress the importance of collaboration in project implementation, highlighting the need for ongoing effort and planning. Key components of successful collaboration include cross-system training, clearly defined roles, regular communication, and shared supervision. Regional partnerships are focusing on family-centered responses and co-locating workers to facilitate shared treatment planning. Providing supportive services to families is critical for the success of regional partnerships. Federal funding is essential for the development of partnerships, with grantees reporting that it funded a significant portion of their collaboration work. Many partnerships are likely to continue their projects beyond the end of federal funding, while others may scale down or have uncertain sustainability. Ongoing review of services is important to address changing needs of families served. The sustainability of regional partnerships is uncertain, with some projects facing challenges due to the difficult fiscal climate. Integration into larger community or state systems is crucial for ongoing work, including establishing third-party billing. Changes in child welfare policy and practice have also impacted the partnerships, with more agencies providing in-home services to reduce the number of children entering foster care. In the mid-2000s, federal reviews showed that frequent caseworker visits were linked to positive outcomes for children in care. However, there were no federal standards for visit frequency or content. Most states required at least one visit a month for children in foster care, but only a few could track visit frequency. The Child and Family Services Improvement Act of 2006 and the Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act of 2011 allocated funding to ensure frequent, quality caseworker visits with children in foster care. States were required to ensure that each child in foster care is visited at least once a month, focusing on safety, permanency, and well-being. The Child and Family Services Improvement Acts of 2006 and 2011 allocated funding for quality caseworker visits with children in foster care, focusing on safety, permanency, and well-being. States must report data on visit frequency to HHS, with requirements for in-home visits. Non-compliant states must provide additional funds for full federal funding. Grant funding is to improve visit quality and support caseworker retention, recruitment, and training. States reported spending monthly caseworker dollars on training, overtime pay, travel expenses, data systems, equipment, and recognition items to support quality caseworker visits for children in foster care. States must describe standards for visit frequency in their CWS plan, ensuring children are visited monthly. (For allotment amounts by state, see Appendix C.) The standards for monthly caseworker visits in foster care ensure visits are well-planned and focused on the child's safety, permanence, and well-being. States must report data to HHS to determine visit percentages and locations. Failure to meet visit percentage requirements results in reduced federal financial participation in the CWS program. The calculation method for monthly caseworker visit percentage in foster care was changed in FY2012 under the 2011 reauthorization of CWS and PSSF (P.L. 112-34). The revised method now compares the number of monthly caseworker visits to children in foster care to the total number of expected visits if every child had been visited monthly. The calculation method for monthly caseworker visits in foster care changed in FY2012 under the 2011 reauthorization of CWS and PSSF. The new method allows states to receive credit for completing visits, leading to an increase in the average monthly caseworker visit percentage across all states from less than 42% in FY2007 to 74% in FY2011. This change resulted in more states meeting the 90% target for children receiving monthly caseworker visits. Under the new monthly caseworker visit standard, 39 states were able to achieve a 90% monthly caseworker visit percentage in FY2012. All 52 states reported meeting the 50% target for caseworker visits in the child's home in FY2013. The average state percentage of in-home monthly caseworker visits was 69%. States that do not meet the national target percentages for monthly caseworker visits and visits in the foster child's home face reduced federal financial participation in the CWS program, requiring more non-federal funding. The additional non-federal spending needed varies based on the degree of target percentage missed, with states needing to provide 26-28% of the overall CWS funding if they miss the targets by certain percentages. States that do not meet national target percentages for monthly caseworker visits and visits in the foster child's home must provide a certain percentage of CWS program funding. In FY2013, 13 states failed to meet the 90% national target for monthly caseworker visit percentage, while all states exceeded the 50% required in-home visits. Puerto Rico was the only jurisdiction that failed to meet the standard in FY2012. (For state performance information, see Appendix G) States are encouraged to have caseworkers make impromptu visits to children in care, focusing on safety, well-being, case planning, and achieving permanency goals. States also address educational, physical, emotional, and behavioral health needs during visits. Some states require additional content for youth emancipating from care, such as transition plans and permanent connections to adults. The majority of states raised concerns about documentation of caseworker visits. States have worked to improve documentation of caseworker visits in foster care by making changes to their information management systems, providing remote connectivity, expanding data fields, and offering training to staff. Some states have established working groups to address barriers to adequate visits, including retention incentives for caseworkers and training on visitation. Some states have implemented various strategies to improve caseworker visitation in foster care, such as retention incentives, training on visitation policies and data collection enhancements, alternative work schedules, and enhanced supervisory training. Additionally, a one family/one worker policy has been implemented to enhance continuity of service and trust between caseworkers and families. HHS is required to reserve PSSF funds for evaluation of family support, preservation, reunification, and adoption services. HHS is instructed to support evaluation, research, and technical assistance related to improving caseworker visits with children in foster care and outcomes for children affected by substance abuse. Additionally, HHS must provide technical assistance to help states and tribes better identify at-risk families and develop treatment models for families with substance abuse issues. The PSSF program aims to improve services for families by ensuring treatment models match services delivered and meet post-adoption needs. $6 million in mandatory funds plus a percentage of discretionary funds are allocated for this purpose. Research and evaluation funding is awarded competitively for national child welfare resource centers to provide technical assistance to state and tribal agencies. During the same five years, PSSF funds supported national child welfare resource centers focused on various areas. This included the Child Welfare Information Gateway and the National Center on Substance Abuse and Child Welfare. HHS also awarded grants to improve services for youth in the child welfare system. Additionally, HHS announced a re-organization of its training and technical assistance network. Beginning in FY2015, a re-organization of the training and technical assistance network for child welfare includes consolidating multiple national resource centers and regional implementation centers into a single National Capacity Building Center. The Child Welfare Information Gateway and certain national resource centers will continue to be supported through separate contracts. PSSF funding now supports the National Capacity Building Center for Public Child Welfare Agencies. The Capacity Building Center for Public Child Welfare Agencies, funded by PSSF, supports various programs including the National Child Welfare Resource Center on Legal and Judicial Issues. HHS is required to report to Congress every two years on the effectiveness of the PSSF programs. The most recent report was submitted in April 2012. Title IV-B Funding includes services and activities that may be supported, with funding history and reservations for the Promoting Safe and Stable Families Program and Court Improvement Program. Regional Partnership Grants serve children and adults, with most children served living at home with a parent or caretaker. A significant portion of children served had a history of child maltreatment. The average age of children served was 5.7 years, with a diverse racial breakdown. The majority of adults served in the program were women (73%), biological parents of a child served (71% mothers; 20% fathers), the child's primary caregiver (81%), and never married (55%) or currently separated/divorced (19%). Many had less than 12 years of education (40%), with the majority having 12 to 15 years of schooling (56%). Close to half were unemployed (47%), while 29% were not in the labor force, and 24% had full or part-time employment. A sizeable minority noted public assistance as their primary source of income (37%), with equal shares citing no primary source of income or wages/salaries (27%). The race/ethnicity breakdown of adults served was 62% white, 15% Hispanic, 12% black, and 9% Alaska Native/American. The majority of adults served in the program were women (73%), biological parents of a child served (71% mothers; 20% fathers), the child's primary caregiver (81%), and never married (55%) or currently separated/divorced (19%). Many had less than 12 years of education (40%), with the majority having 12 to 15 years of schooling (56%).

A sizeable minority noted public assistance as their primary source of income (37%), with equal shares citing no primary source of income or wages/salaries (27%). The race/ethnicity breakdown of adults served was 62% white, 15% Hispanic, 12% black, 9% Alaska Native/American, a little more than 1% Asian, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, and a little less than 1% two or more races. Most served adults (71%) received substance abuse services, with primary substance problems being methamphetamine (32%), marijuana (21%), alcohol (19%), heroin/opiates (16%), cocaine/crack (10%), and \"other\" (3%). Most children were in their own homes when they entered program services, and of those children the large majority (93%) continued to live at home. Across the full four years of the project, 4.3% of children served experienced a recurrence of maltreatment within 6 months. Efforts to improve child safety in the regional partnership program have shown progress, with a decrease in maltreatment recurrence within six months from 6.5% to 3.4% over four years. A significant portion of children served were in foster care, with a median stay of nine months that decreased over the grant period. The main reason for leaving foster care was reunification with parents, accounting for 70% of cases. Among children leaving foster care, 12% found new permanent homes through adoption or legal guardianship, with most placements occurring within 24 months. The re-entry rate for children discharged from foster care decreased from 9.8% in year one to 3.5% in year four. Adults accessing substance abuse treatment services did so quickly, within an average of 11 days. Adults accessing substance abuse treatment services through a regional partnership grant program were able to access services quickly, within an average of 11 days. The completion rate for treatment was 36.6%, with 35.1% dropping out before completion. However, between 72% and 82% reported reduced substance use, with 66% showing reduced criminal behavior and an increase in employment from 30.2% to 42.5%. Key supportive services were provided to the majority of adults, including transportation (88%), continuing care (88%), parenting training and education (86%), mental health services (83%), and primary medical care services (79%). Well-Being measurement is less standardized than other measures discussed. Grantees found that children entering the program had significant challenges and received various supportive services. At entry, 27.0% of children served were given a \"strength\". At program entry, 27.0% of children had a \"strength\" rating for overall well-being, increasing to 57% upon program completion. Adults showed high levels of stress and depression symptoms initially, with improvements in parental stress, unemployment, substance abuse, legal issues, and family conflict by discharge. Families demonstrated nurturing attachment but needed more support to cope with stress. Improvements in overall family interactions, environment, and safety were observed between entry and discharge. The majority of families received coordinated case management, with strong collaboration and service capacity. Grantees mostly met their goals for serving children and families, with some providing substance abuse education for caregivers. Appendix G. Monthly Caseworker Visits: Performance by State. Each state must achieve a monthly caseworker visit percentage of 90% (95% as of FY2015). Children in foster care placed in another state must be included in the calculation. States must ensure that at least 50% of visits are conducted where the child lives. Failure to meet national target percentages requires additional non-federal funding. States missing targets by fewer than 10% must provide 26% of CWS funding, by 10-20% must provide 28%, and by 20% or more must provide 30%."
