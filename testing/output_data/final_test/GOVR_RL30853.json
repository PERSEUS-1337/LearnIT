    "content": "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) derives its authorities and responsibilities from major environmental statutes, including the Clean Air Act. This report provides a concise summary of the Clean Air Act, its history, key provisions, and references for more detailed information. It highlights that the report is incomplete and does not delve into implementation details or missed statutory deadlines. The Clean Air Act, codified as 42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq., aims to protect human health and the environment from air pollution. It requires the EPA to set national air quality standards and mandates states to ensure compliance. Implementation issues may arise due to delays, lawsuits, or challenges from interested parties. Additional CRS reports cover implementation concerns and current issues related to the Act. For a more detailed historical review, readers can refer to CRS Report 83-34. The Clean Air Act establishes federal standards for air pollution control measures, hazardous air pollutants, and a cap-and-trade program for acid rain emissions. It also implements a permit system for major pollution sources and addresses prevention in clean air areas and protection of the ozone layer. Federal efforts to control air pollution have evolved from information collection to enforcement since the first legislation in 1955. Legislation addressing air pollution was first passed in 1955, with the federal role strengthened in subsequent amendments, notably the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970, 1977, and 1990. The 1970 amendments established national standards for ambient air quality, required emissions reduction from new automobiles, and strengthened federal enforcement authority. The 1977 amendments adjusted auto emission standards and added the Prevention of Significant Deterioration program. Changes in 1990 included provisions for nonattainment areas. The 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act included provisions to classify nonattainment areas based on their pollution levels, tighten emission standards for vehicles, require reformulated fuels in polluted areas, establish technology-based air toxics standards, implement an acid rain control program, phase out ozone-depleting chemicals, and update enforcement provisions. The Clean Air Act of 1990 authorized appropriations for clean air programs through FY1998, but has not been reauthorized since then. While authorization of appropriations has expired, programs have continued and been funded. The act's legal authorities to issue and enforce regulations are permanent. The act requires EPA to establish National Ambient Air Quality Standards for pollutants that endanger public health or welfare. The Clean Air Act of 1990 authorized appropriations for clean air programs through FY1998, but has not been reauthorized since then. The act requires EPA to establish National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for pollutants that endanger public health or welfare. The NAAQS must protect public health with a margin of safety and public welfare from adverse effects. EPA has promulgated NAAQS for sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, ozone, and lead. EPA is required to review and revise the standards every five years. The Clean Air Act of 1990 established National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) to protect public health and welfare from pollutants. Deadlines for achieving NAAQS have been extended multiple times, with special compliance schedules for areas not in attainment. States are responsible for developing State Implementation Plans (SIPs) to meet the standards, based on emission inventories and computer models. EPA sets NAAQS while states implement procedures to maintain air quality. The Clean Air Act of 1990 established National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) to protect public health and welfare from pollutants. States must develop State Implementation Plans (SIPs) based on emission inventories and computer models to ensure compliance with standards. Sanctions are imposed on areas failing to submit or implement SIPs, including emissions offsets for new sources and restrictions on federal highway grants. The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments impose bans on federal highway grants and air quality grants, with the possibility of a Federal Implementation Plan if a state fails to submit an adequate SIP. Nonattainment areas must demonstrate conformity to SIPs for federal permits and funding. The amendments classify nonattainment areas based on NAAQS compliance levels. The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments classified nonattainment areas based on NAAQS compliance levels, grouping them into classifications with specific pollution controls and attainment dates. Nonattainment areas are classified based on a \"design value\" derived from pollutant concentrations recorded by air quality monitoring devices. The act created five classes of ozone nonattainment, with Los Angeles initially falling into the \"extreme\" class. The classification system and design values have been adapted twice as the ozone standard has been revised. Under the 2008 standard, there are 41 nonattainment areas classified as \"marginal\" or \"moderate\" for ozone. The classification system for carbon monoxide and particulate matter has more stringent control requirements for serious nonattainment areas. Statutory attainment deadlines for ozone nonattainment areas range from 1993 to 2010, but under the current standard, they are extended to 2015 to 2032. Carbon monoxide nonattainment areas have been eliminated since 2010. The deadline for particulate matter nonattainment areas varies based on severity, with more stringent control requirements in areas with worse pollution. Ozone control requirements include inventory emissions sources, offsets, and RACT for major sources emitting over 100. Impose RACT on major sources emitting over 100 tons per year in nine industrial categories. Require a 15% reduction in VOC emissions in six years, basic vehicle inspection, and maintenance program. Implement vapor recovery at gas stations selling over 10,000 gallons per month. Serious areas must reduce VOC emissions by 3% annually for years 7 to 9 after a 15% reduction by year 6. Reduce VOC emissions by 3% annually for years 7 to 9 after a 15% reduction by year 6. Improve monitoring for more comprehensive data on ozone pollution. Implement enhanced vehicle inspection and maintenance programs. Fleet vehicles must use clean alternative fuels. Adopt transportation control measures for areas with higher than expected vehicle miles traveled. Require offsets and contingency measures for areas not meeting VOC reduction requirements. Major sources of VOCs defined as emissions of 25 tons per year for RACT. Implement specified transportation control measures and reformulated gasoline program. Impose penalties on major sources if required reductions are not met. Extreme Areas: Requirements for severe areas include reducing the definition of major VOC sources to 10 tons per year for RACT, mandating clean fuels or advanced control technology for boilers emitting over 25 tons per year of NOx, and requiring 1.5 to 1 offsets. Carbon monoxide nonattainment areas have specific control requirements, with Serious nonattainment areas facing stricter measures. Moderate Areas: Conduct emissions source inventory, forecast total vehicle miles traveled, adopt enhanced vehicle inspection and maintenance program, and show annual improvements to meet standards. Serious Areas: Implement specified transportation control measures, oxygenated fuels program for all vehicles, and reduce major source definition. Implement an oxygenated fuels program for all vehicles in the area. Reduce major source definitions for CO emissions from 100 to 50 tons per year if stationary sources contribute significantly to the problem. Areas failing to meet standards had to revise their SIP and show 5% reductions per year until compliance. All areas have now met the standard. PM 10 nonattainment areas have specific control requirements based on severity levels. EPA introduced new PM 2.5 standards in July 1997, with implementation delayed due to court challenges. Implementation of PM 2.5 standards was delayed by court challenges and lack of monitoring network. Nonattainment areas designated in 2005, with states given three years to submit plans. Revisions in 2006 and 2013 strengthened standards, leading to new nonattainment designations. Meeting clean air standards is complex due to transported pollutants. States and EPA work on compliance strategies for ozone and PM 2.5 NAAQS. SIPs must prevent significant contributions to downwind nonattainment. The 1990 Clean Air Act amendments provided EPA and states with tools to address regional pollution problems through the \"good neighbor\" provision. If a state's SIP is inadequate to achieve NAAQS, EPA can require a revised SIP to bring the state into compliance, known as a \"SIP Call.\" Section 176A allows EPA to establish a transport region to address regional pollution problems, with a commission making recommendations for mitigation strategies. EPA is then required to notify based on the commission's findings and recommendations. The 1990 Clean Air Act amendments provided tools for addressing regional pollution issues through the \"good neighbor\" provision. EPA can require states to revise their SIPs if inadequate, known as a \"SIP Call.\" The amendments also established an Ozone Transport Region in the Northeast, with additional controls and the creation of the Ozone Transport Commission. Downwind states can address transport issues through a Section 126 petition. The 1990 Clean Air Act amendments introduced the \"good neighbor\" provision, allowing EPA to address regional pollution issues. Section 126 allows states to petition EPA if sources in another state significantly contribute to nonattainment of air quality standards. Title II of the Act mandates emission standards for automobiles, with significant tightening in 1990. The 1990 Clean Air Act introduced emission standards for automobiles, with further reductions phased in over the years. Tier 2 standards, requiring significant emission reductions from cars and light trucks, were promulgated in February 2000. EPA concluded that technology was available and cost-effective for achieving these reductions. The 1990 Clean Air Act introduced emission standards for automobiles, with Tier 2 standards phased in from 2004-2009. Tier 3 standards, implemented between 2017-2025, require further emissions reductions and have already reduced sulfur in gasoline by two-thirds. Oxygenated and reformulated gasoline were mandated in specific nonattainment areas to reduce emissions. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 modified the fuels provisions for the Reformulated Gasoline (RFG) program, removing the oxygenate requirement and instead mandating the use of increasing amounts of renewable fuel, such as ethanol, in motor fuels starting in 2006. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 further strengthened the renewable fuel requirements and promoted the use of alternative fuels and cleaner engines through the Clean-Fuel Fleet Program in heavily polluted areas. Starting in 1999, centrally fueled fleets of 10 or more passenger cars and light-duty trucks had to purchase a percentage of clean-fuel vehicles, increasing to 70% by 2001. Heavy-duty fleets had to buy at least 50% clean-fuel vehicles annually. Clean fuel vehicles meet Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) standards and operate on various alternative fuels. California's Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) program also promotes alternative fuels and vehicles. EPA Administrator can grant California authority to develop its own vehicle emissions standards. California has the authority to set vehicle emissions standards stricter than federal standards, requiring auto manufacturers to sell ZEVs. Other states can adopt California's standards, with 13 states and the District of Columbia already doing so. The 1990 amendments imposed tighter emissions requirements on vehicles, including refueling, low temperature CO emissions, in-use performance, warranties for emission control components, and certification. Regulations were extended to nonroad fuels and engines, with strengthened standards for trucks and buses using diesel engines. Urban buses were required to reduce diesel particulate emissions by 92% by 1996, and other heavy-duty diesel engines by 83% by the same year. The 1990 amendments imposed tighter emissions requirements on vehicles, including refueling, low temperature CO emissions, in-use performance, warranties for emission control components, and certification. Regulations were extended to nonroad fuels and engines, with strengthened standards for trucks and buses using diesel engines. Urban buses were required to reduce diesel particulate emissions by 92% by 1996, and other heavy-duty diesel engines by 83% by the same year. NO x emissions must also be reduced, 33% by 1998. New emission standards in January 2001 required a further 90%-95% reduction in emissions phased in over the 2007-2010 model years, and a reduction of 97% in the allowable amount of sulfur in highway diesel fuel. Similar requirements for nonroad diesel equipment were phased in between 2007 and 2015. EPA Administrator was required to prescribe standards applicable to the emission of any air pollutant from new motor vehicles or engines causing air pollution endangering public health or welfare. Beginning in 2010, the Clean Air Act authorized standards for greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks. EPA has implemented GHG standards for light duty vehicles (2012-2025) and medium- and heavy-duty trucks (2014-2027). Section 112 of the act, revised in 1990, includes provisions for protecting public health from toxic air pollutants, such as MACT requirements, health-based standards, and GACT standards for area sources. The Clean Air Act includes provisions for regulating toxic air pollutants through technology-based emission standards for sources of 187 pollutants. EPA is required to establish MACT standards and revise them every eight years, with a presumption in favor of regulation for designated chemicals unless proven otherwise. EPA can add or remove substances from the lists based on data on health and environmental effects. The EPA is mandated to set MACT standards for sources of listed pollutants to achieve maximum emission reduction, considering cost and other factors. New source standards must be as stringent as the best controlled similar source, while existing source standards must meet emission limitations of the best performing sources in the category. Existing sources have three years to comply with standards, with a possible one-year extension. The EPA is required to set health-based standards to address residual risks after MACT installation, consulting with the Surgeon General and recommending legislation to Congress if necessary. EPA must issue standards for hazardous air pollutant sources if Congress does not act on recommendations. The EPA is mandated to establish health-based standards for residual risks post-MACT installation, with a focus on cancer-causing pollutants. Residual risk standards must be implemented within eight years of MACT promulgation for affected sources, with a 90-day compliance period for existing sources. Area sources are generally exempt from residual risk standards. The EPA collaborated with the National Academy of Sciences for a risk assessment methodology study, leading to the publication of the report \"Science and Judgment in Risk Assessment\" in 1994. In 1994, the National Academy of Sciences published a report on risk assessment. The EPA is required to establish standards for stationary \"area sources\" of hazardous air pollution. Section 112 addresses prevention of sudden releases of air toxics by establishing a Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board. The Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board investigates accidents involving hazardous substances and prepares reports on toxic material handling. EPA issues requirements for catastrophic air toxics releases and sets standards for new industrial facilities to control pollution. The NSPS establish emission levels for new major stationary sources like power plants and steel mills, based on the best system of emission reduction. EPA must review and update these standards every eight years to prevent new pollution problems and promote the use of new control technology. The standards also apply to modifications of existing facilities through New Source Review. The EPA's interpretation of Section 111 has led to litigation regarding modifications of facilities subject to NSR. Section 111(d) allows EPA to require states to submit plans for existing sources to meet NSPS standards, rarely used but the basis for the Clean Power Plan. The 1990 amendments established federal regulations for solid waste incinerators, requiring emissions of 10 pollutants to be regulated at new and existing incinerators. The amendments also included emissions monitoring and operator training requirements. Additionally, Sections 160-169 of the act established requirements for the prevention of significant deterioration of air quality (PSD), aiming to protect areas with better air quality from new pollution. The Clean Air Act of 1990 established federal regulations for solid waste incinerators, requiring emissions of 10 pollutants to be regulated. It also included provisions for emissions monitoring and operator training. The act also established requirements for the prevention of significant deterioration of air quality (PSD) to protect areas with better air quality from new pollution. The act classifies areas into three classes based on pollution levels and specifies allowable increments of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and particulate pollution in each class. The Clean Air Act of 1990 established federal regulations for solid waste incinerators and required emissions monitoring and operator training. It also set requirements for the prevention of significant deterioration of air quality (PSD) to protect areas with better air quality from new pollution. The act addresses criteria pollutants, including NO2, and mandates the installation of best available control technology (BACT) for newly constructed polluting sources in PSD areas. Additionally, the act aims to prevent impairment of visibility in national parks and wilderness areas. The Clean Air Act of 1990 mandated the establishment of a Grand Canyon Visibility Transport Commission to ensure progress towards visibility goals by implementing emission limits and Best Available Retrofit Technology on existing sources. EPA is required to promulgate regulations within 18 months of receiving recommendations from the commission. The Clean Air Act of 1990 added a regional haze program and an acid deposition control program, setting goals for reducing SO2 and NOx emissions by 2000. Phase 1 required high-emitting facilities to meet emission limits by 1995, reducing SO2 emissions by 3.5 million tons. Phase 2 included larger facilities with a deadline of 2000, achieving 100% compliance. The act also created a permit system for flexibility in emission reductions. The Clean Air Act of 1990 established a permit and emissions allowance system for SO2 emissions. Allowances were allocated to Phase 1 and Phase 2 units based on baseline emissions estimates. New units after November 15, 1990, had to obtain allowances from existing holders. Allowances could be traded nationally, sold to utility systems, or banked for future use. The act aimed to improve liquidity and ensure availability of allowances for utilities and independent power producers. The Clean Air Act of 1990 established a permit and emissions allowance system for SO2 emissions. Allowances were allocated to Phase 1 and Phase 2 units based on baseline emissions estimates. A special reserve fund was set aside for sale, with allowances sold at a fixed price. An annual auction also sold allowances with no minimum price, capping emissions at existing and future plants through a tonnage limitation and allowance system. Independent power producers had guaranteed rights to certain allowances. The Clean Air Act of 1990 established an emissions allowance system for SO2 emissions, with allowances allocated based on baseline levels. New plants had to offset emissions with reductions at existing facilities. Excess emissions incurred a penalty and required additional reductions the following year. The act also required EPA to inventory industrial SO2 emissions every five years. The Clean Air Act of 1990 established emissions allowance system for SO2 emissions, with penalties for excess emissions and required reductions. EPA set specific NOx emission rate limitations for boilers and proposed new standards for fossil fuel steam generating units. EPA also lowered caps on SO2 and NOx emissions in the eastern half of the country in 2005, 2011, and 2016. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 introduced Title V, requiring states to implement a comprehensive permit program for sources emitting air pollutants. Permit requirements apply to major sources emitting 100 tons per year of regulated pollutants, as well as lesser amounts of hazardous air pollutants in nonattainment areas. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 introduced Title V, requiring states to implement a comprehensive permit program for sources emitting air pollutants. Permit requirements apply to major sources emitting 100 tons per year of regulated pollutants, as well as lesser amounts of hazardous air pollutants in nonattainment areas. In addition to major sources, permit requirements also apply to sources emitting as little as 50, 25, or 10 tons per year of VOCs, depending on the severity of the region's ozone nonattainment status. States were required to develop permit programs and submit them for EPA approval by November 15, 1993. After the effective date of a state plan, sources had 12 months to submit a permit application. States are to collect annual fees from sources to cover the costs of administering the permit program, with a minimum fee of $25 per ton of regulated pollutants. Permitting authorities have discretion not to collect fees on emissions exceeding 4,000 tons per year. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 introduced Title V, requiring states to implement a comprehensive permit program for sources emitting air pollutants. Permits specify the amount of pollutants a source can emit, require a compliance plan, and must be renewed every five years. EPA can veto major permit changes, but may not review permits for small sources. Holding a permit shields a source from enforcement actions if complying with requirements. EPA must be notified of permit applications affecting contiguous states. The Clean Air Act, strengthened by the 1990 amendments, allows for federal enforcement through agency and court orders, penalties for violations, and requirements for reports, emissions monitoring, and compliance certification. States and local governments primarily enforce the Act by issuing permits, monitoring compliance, and conducting inspections, with the federal government serving as a backstop with authority to review state actions and file enforcement actions independently. The 1990 Clean Air Act amendments allow for federal enforcement through agency and court orders, penalties for violations, and citizen suits against violators. The amendments also increased penalties for violations, removed the ability to avoid penalties by ceasing violations, and authorized administrative penalties and rewards for information leading to convictions. Title VI of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments implements U.S. responsibilities under the Montreal Protocol on Ozone Layer Depletion. The Environmental Protection Agency adjusts phase-out schedules for ozone-depleting substances according to changes in the Montreal Protocol. Industrial countries, including the United States, have phased out Class 1 substances like CFCs and halons since the passage of Title VI. The production of hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) was banned starting January 1, 2015, with exemptions allowed as per the Montreal Protocol. HCFC production is to be phased out by January 1, 2030. The EPA is required to add substances with an ozone depletion potential (ODP) of 0.2 or greater to the list of banned substances and set a phase-out schedule of no more than seven years. For example, methyl bromide was added to the list in December 1993, with a phase-out deadline of January 1, 2001. The EPA is required to phase out ozone-depleting chemicals, including refrigerants and motor vehicle air conditioners, by specific deadlines set in Title VI of the Montreal Protocol. Various strategies are implemented to minimize releases of these chemicals into the atmosphere, such as banning venting, requiring recycling, and safe disposal. Additionally, the sale of small containers of certain substances is banned within two years of enactment. The Clean Air Act Handbook provides information on class 1 and 2 substances banned within two years of enactment, as well as nonessential products. EPA's Air Trends report is compiled annually and available online. Key historical court decisions shaping EPA's program under the Clean Air Act are outlined in CRS reports."
