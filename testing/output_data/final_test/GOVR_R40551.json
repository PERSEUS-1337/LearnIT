    "content": "The U.S. Constitution mandates a population census every 10 years for apportioning House of Representatives seats and distributing federal funds. Congress delegates this responsibility to the Secretary of Commerce and the Census Bureau. The Census Bureau Director and Secretary are appointed by the President with Senate approval. The Bureau's task is to count each U.S. resident once at their usual residence, despite the complexity and cost. Nonresponse to the census can result in a fine of up to $5,000. The report discusses innovations and challenges faced during the 2010 census. The 23rd census for the 2010 census began with field operations, including mail distribution and door-to-door visits. Efforts were made to ensure an equitable census, with 74% of households returning their forms by mail. Census takers contacted households that did not respond, and census products were released through 2013. The Bureau released the official state population figures for House apportionment and the total U.S. resident population count of 308,745,538 as of Census Day. The census questionnaire has evolved over the years, with sampling done in conjunction with censuses from 1950 to 2000. In 2000, a short form was sent to most housing units, while a long form with additional questions was sent to a sample of units for socioeconomic and housing data collection. The 2010 census questionnaire was a short form asking for age, sex, race, ethnicity, and tenure of each household member. The long form was replaced by the American Community Survey, which gathers similar data from about 295,000 households monthly. The American Community Survey (ACS) provides annual data for areas with populations of at least 65,000 people, including the total United States, all states, congressional districts, counties, and metropolitan areas. The Bureau released three-year estimates in 2008 and five-year estimates in 2010 for different population areas. In 2010, the Bureau automated census field operations for address canvassing and nonresponse follow-up. The pre-census address canvassing aimed to verify and correct census addresses and maps, essential for directing census forms accurately. Nonresponse follow-up required enumerators to visit or call individuals who hadn't completed their questionnaires. Only address canvassing was automated, not the follow-up process. The Bureau contracted with Harris Corporation for Field Data Collection Automation (FDCA) as part of its 2010 census preparations. The Harris Corporation was contracted for Field Data Collection Automation (FDCA) for the 2010 census. However, significant flaws were found in the handheld computers developed, leading to the Bureau abandoning their use for nonresponse follow-up. The Bureau had to resort to a traditional paper-based approach for NRFU, resulting in increased expenses. The total life-cycle cost of the 2010 census was re-estimated at $13.7 billion by the Government Accountability Office. The Bureau re-estimated the total life-cycle cost of the 2010 census to be between $13.7 billion and $14.5 billion, higher than the previous estimate of $11.5 billion. The Commerce Department's Office of Inspector General identified challenges in preparing for the census, including the failure of handheld devices developed in-house. The Office of Inspector General found serious problems with the handheld devices developed for the 2010 census, leading to delays and uncertainty about meeting operational needs and quality goals. Immediate, significant changes are needed to rescue the program, with unpredictable final costs. The OIG report highlighted significant risks for the 2010 census due to IT problems and management vulnerabilities. The Government Accountability Office also emphasized the need for urgent attention to address these issues. The 2010 census faced IT problems and high costs, leading to it being designated as \"high risk\" by the GAO. The Dress Rehearsal was meant to test key operations, but testing was limited due to issues with handheld devices. Only 23 out of 44 key operations were tested, with examples including address canvassing and group quarters validation. The largest field operation, nonresponse, was not tested. The Bureau conducted a limited field test for address canvassing in December 2008 to assess software functionality in an operational environment. Users were generally satisfied with the performance of the handheld computers, but the test only included a limited subset of functionality for the 2009 address canvassing operations. The paper-based nonresponse follow-up in 2010 would rely on newly developed systems that had not been fully tested in a census-like environment, introducing the risk of system failure. Testing all systems after changes are made is critical to ensure proper functionality. Testing all systems after changes have been made is critical for the success of the 2010 census, as noted by the GAO. The Commerce Department's OIG identified serious issues facing the Bureau, particularly with the Paper-Based Operations Control System (PBOCS) experiencing performance problems. PBOCS is essential for efficiently managing assignments to enumerators and tracking enumeration forms. The Census Bureau faces challenges with its IT systems, particularly the Decennial Applicant, Personnel, and Payroll System (DAPPS) and the Paper-Based Operations Control System (PBOCS). GAO expressed concerns about the systems' performance and their ability to handle the workload of the upcoming census. Despite efforts to improve DAPPS, it still faces capacity limitations and slow response times, impacting the payment of temporary employees. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) expressed concerns about the Paper-Based Operations Control System (PBOCS) in early releases due to defects and incomplete testing for managing NRFU. The reliability of the Bureau's automated systems, including IT systems for field operations, was questioned in congressional testimony. The Bureau took steps to mitigate risks posed by unreliable IT systems. The Bureau has upgraded hardware and software to mitigate risks posed by unreliable IT systems, but issues with PBOCS persisted, leading to system outages and delays in progress reports. These problems caused a backlog of census questionnaires and hindered the Bureau's ability to monitor NRFU workers' productivity. In July 18, 2012, GAO provided a positive assessment of the Bureau's 2010 census operations despite initial setbacks. The idealized expectation of a perfect count in the decennial census is challenging, with concerns raised about late-date alterations affecting the success of the census. The 2010 census faced challenges in achieving complete and accurate population coverage due to the large, mobile, and diverse U.S. population. Enumeration difficulties arose from various factors such as racial and ethnic minorities, multiple families, low-income individuals, inner-city residents, and international migrants with language barriers or legal status issues. Recurrent undercounts of minorities and overcounts of certain groups were noted, impacting the accuracy of the census data. The 2010 census faced challenges in achieving complete and accurate population coverage due to various factors like racial and ethnic minorities, multiple families, low-income individuals, inner-city residents, and international migrants with language barriers or legal status issues. Differential undercounts, especially among minorities and less affluent members of society, can lead to a perception of inequitable counting in the decennial census. Post-1940 census, the Census Bureau and researchers developed Demographic Analysis (DA) to evaluate coverage accuracy. Demographic Analysis (DA) is a statistical technique used to evaluate coverage and estimate net undercounts in census data. It utilizes administrative records and estimates of international migration to determine population size at a given census date. The process involves analyzing various demographic data independent of the census, such as birth and death records, international migration, and Medicare enrollments. This method was developed post-1940 census to address challenges in achieving accurate population coverage, especially among minorities and low-income individuals. Demographic Analysis (DA) is used to estimate census net undercounts by comparing benchmarks and census counts. It has limitations such as producing estimates only at the national level and uncertainty in estimating components of net international migration. Revised DA estimates for 1990 and 2000 lowered net undercount rates. Table 2 displays net undercount estimates for censuses from 1940 to 2000, showing a decrease in undercount rates for most years except 1990. The Bureau issued DA estimates in 2010, with a middle estimate of 308,475,178. The Bureau issued DA estimates in 2010, with a middle estimate of 308,475,178, which closely approximated the official census resident population count of 308,745,538. The Bureau changed its approach by not using demographic analysis to produce net undercount or overcount estimates due to uncertainties. Evaluations of coverage in past enumerations involved post-census surveys to estimate omissions and erroneous enumerations. The 1990 census Post Enumeration Survey estimated a net percentage undercount of 1.61% for the total population, with varying percentages for different racial and ethnic groups. The 2000 census Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation indicated a net percentage overcount of 0.49% for the total population, with different percentages for specific racial and ethnic groups. The Census Bureau's Census Coverage Measurement (CCM) program in 2010 aimed to evaluate the accuracy of the census, with varying undercount percentages for different racial and ethnic groups. The program involved separate address lists for housing units and coverage measurement sample areas, collecting data through independent operations. Operations for the 2010 Census and CCM began in January 2010 and continued through July. The Census Bureau's Census Coverage Measurement (CCM) program evaluates census accuracy through independent operations. CCM collects data from housing units and coverage measurement samples separately. Special measures are taken to maintain CCM's separation from the census to prevent bias in coverage estimates. Changes in CCM in 2009 included higher reinterview rates for field work and additional training for workers dealing with special situations. The Census Bureau implemented special measures in the CCM program in 2009, including increased training for workers dealing with unique economic conditions. To offset costs, the Bureau reduced the CCM sample size by almost 45%, which may impact estimate precision but improve data reliability. The report critiqued aspects of the CCM program, noting the importance of data quality improvements without decreasing sample size. The Census Bureau had not linked CCM data to improvements for the 2020 Census design. It was advised to determine the optimal time to start person interviewing to avoid errors like 'contamination bias' and 'recall bias' in coverage evaluation data, which could impact the accuracy of the census. The Census Bureau released the results of the CCM program in May 2012, showing a net percentage overcount of 0.01% for the total population. Different racial categories were either overcounted or undercounted in the 2010 census compared to the 2000 census. The CCM program in 2012 showed a net percentage overcount of 0.01% for the total population. Different racial groups and Hispanics were undercounted in the 2010 census compared to 2000, with American Indians on reservations showing a significant difference in census coverage. GAO testified that the 2010 Census accurately counted the total population. The Supreme Court ruled in 1999 that adjusting the apportionment numbers based on survey results would be illegal under Title 13 U.S.C., Section 195. The issue of adjusting census counts has been contentious for decades, with supporters arguing it is necessary to correct undercounts and opponents warning of political manipulation risks. In 2009, during a census oversight hearing, the Bureau confirmed plans for a census coverage evaluation survey in 2010 to provide data on error components like duplicates and omissions. Despite assurances that sampling for adjustment would not be used, some Members of Congress sought further clarification. Obama Administration nominations of Gary Locke as Commerce Secretary and Robert M. Groves as Census Bureau Director raised concerns about potential adjustment through sampling in the 2010 census. During his confirmation hearing in 2009, Gary Locke stated that statistical sampling would not be used for apportionment purposes. The Senate confirmed Locke's nomination on March 24, 2009, and approved Robert M. Groves as Census Bureau Director on July 13, 2009. Groves, who previously headed the University of Michigan's Survey Research Center, had experience at the Census Bureau from 1990 to 1992. Gary Locke stated in 2009 that statistical sampling would not be used for apportionment. Robert M. Groves, confirmed as Census Bureau Director in July 2009, agreed with this decision and confirmed that statistical adjustment would not be used for redistricting. There were discussions about the possibility of using sampling for redistricting and federal fund allocation. Gary Locke confirmed in 2009 that statistical sampling would not be used for apportionment, and Robert M. Groves, the Census Bureau Director, reiterated this decision for redistricting and federal fund allocation. The 2010 Census Coverage Measurement program was not intended for adjusting the 2010 Census but to improve future censuses. The 2010 census aimed to publicize and encourage participation in completing questionnaires. The Bureau awarded the communications contract to Draftfcb of New York City, who partnered with firms specializing in reaching minority groups. The integrated strategy focused on motivating the public to respond to the census. The 2010 census integrated communications strategy focused on partnership programs, paid advertising, and collaboration with local governments, businesses, and community organizations to inform the public and encourage participation. The Bureau's website provided partnership information and suggested activities for partners, including distributing promotional materials and sponsoring events. Complete Count Committees were formed to reach undercounted groups. The Bureau formed Complete Count Committees to reach undercounted groups by mailing guides to elected officials and recruiting over 3.7 million applicants for census-related positions. Local-government partners were invited to participate in the Local Update of Census Addresses campaign. LUCA, established by P.L. 103-430, allowed local, state, and tribal governments to review and correct the Master Address File for the 2010 census. Participants could appeal changes and the Census in Schools initiative aimed to educate K-12 students about the importance of census participation through materials produced by Scholastic, Inc. The 2010 census operations included distributing printed materials to schools nationwide and mailing out questionnaires to 120 million U.S. households. Special efforts were made to reach hard-to-count populations, such as mailing out bilingual census forms and providing forms in multiple languages at public locations. Telephone assistance and resources for the hearing impaired were also available. The Bureau undertook enumeration of diverse dwellings, including migrant-worker housing, boats, college dormitories, nursing homes, and prisons. Service-based enumeration counted the homeless at places like soup kitchens and mobile food vans. Address listers identified inhabitable housing units in hurricane-damaged areas. Field workers hand-delivered census forms to these units. Field workers hand-delivered approximately 1.2 million census forms to housing units, some not on the Bureau's address list. They updated addresses and maps, especially in areas with inaccurate addresses or no regular mail delivery. A total of 12 million questionnaires were hand-delivered, including 1.2 million in Gulf Coast areas. The Census Bureau is primarily staffed by federal career civilians trained in statistics, demographics, and IT. Title 13 U.S.C. outlines penalties for Bureau officers or employees who commit offenses, adjusted according to the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984. Penalties for neglecting duties under Title 13, Section 212 can result in fines up to $5,000. Bureau officers or employees can face fines up to $250,000 or imprisonment for up to five years for making false statements or disclosures under Title 13, Sections 213 and 214. These penalties are in accordance with the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984. In 2010, census workers faced penalties of up to $250,000 or five years in prison for false statements. They also underwent FBI background checks costing $450 million for fingerprinting. Errors in fingerprinting were reduced through improved training and digital scanners, aiming to decrease unclassifiable prints from 22% to 10-12%. The fingerprint check during address canvassing revealed a criminal record that made an employee unsuitable for employment. Address-canvassing hires with unclassifiable prints were allowed to continue working if their name background check was acceptable. Congress could review the problems encountered in the fingerprinting operation, implications for public safety, delayed decision to use digital scanners, and final cost. The Bureau Director is a presidential appointee, and news articles suggested the Director might report to the White House. The Director potentially reporting to the White House instead of the Commerce Secretary raised concerns about political manipulation during the 2010 census. Assurances from the Administration did not fully alleviate these concerns. Gary Locke emphasized the census would be run by the Department of Commerce, and Robert M. Groves highlighted the importance of government statistical agencies being independent. The Bureau Director emphasized the need for an independent Census Bureau free from partisan influence. Oversight of the Bureau's activities is conducted by various congressional committees in different sessions. Oversight of the Census Bureau in the 113th Congress is conducted by the Federal Workforce, U.S. Postal Service, and the Census Subcommittee of this committee, as well as the full Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees also review the Bureau's operations and funding requests. The Government Accountability Office and the MITRE Corporation provided evaluations and advice on the 2010 census, while the National Academy of Sciences' Committee on National Statistics (CNSTAT) was involved in the process. The National Academy of Sciences' Committee on National Statistics evaluated the 2010 census research program and its relation to 2020 census planning. The bipartisan Census Monitoring Board scrutinized the objectivity of the 2000 census, with members appointed by various government officials to observe and monitor census preparation and implementation. The bipartisan Census Monitoring Board oversaw the implementation of the 2000 decennial census, with co-chairmen and designated staff having access to census data. Reports were prepared for Congress, focusing on accuracy, enumeration process, and political bias. $4 million in appropriations were authorized for the board from FY1998 to FY2001. The bipartisan Census Monitoring Board oversaw the 2000 decennial census with $4 million in appropriations from FY1998 to FY2001. The board ceased to exist in 2001, and the 2010 census faced challenges due to issues with handheld computers for data collection. Despite a 74% national participation rate for the mail-out, mail-back part of the census, there were concerns about under-enumerated population groups. The 2010 census showed a net overcount of the total population and non-Hispanic whites, similar to the 2000 census. Racial minorities and Hispanics were still undercounted. Concerns about bias in the enumeration and who the census includes or excludes are likely to continue due to the census's importance for national, state, and local purposes."
