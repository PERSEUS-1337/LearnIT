    "content": "The \"Preventing Antibiotic Resistance Act of 2015\" aims to ensure the safety and effectiveness of medically important antimicrobials used in animal disease prevention to reduce the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The Preventing Antibiotic Resistance Act of 2015 aims to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act regarding the demonstration of New Animal Drug Applications for antimicrobials labeled for disease prevention or control. The Preventing Antibiotic Resistance Act of 2015 seeks to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act by ensuring judicious use of medically important antimicrobials in animals. This includes applying regulations to antimicrobials approved for use in food-producing animals and those marketed for human use. The Preventing Antibiotic Resistance Act of 2015 aims to regulate the use of medically important antimicrobials in animals, including those approved for food-producing animals and human use. This involves aligning product use conditions with FDA guidelines for growth promotion, feed efficiency, disease control, and prevention. The Preventing Antibiotic Resistance Act of 2015 aims to regulate the use of medically important antimicrobials in animals, including those approved for food-producing animals and human use. The Act requires sponsors of antimicrobial drugs to submit evidence of effectiveness in controlling specific bacterial pathogens by a specified deadline. The Preventing Antibiotic Resistance Act of 2015 requires sponsors of antimicrobial drugs to provide evidence of effectiveness in controlling bacterial diseases, ensuring approved uses are consistent with veterinary practice, linked to specific pathogens, targeted to at-risk animals, have defined therapy duration, and pose no harm to human health. The Preventing Antibiotic Resistance Act of 2015 mandates sponsors of antimicrobial drugs to demonstrate effectiveness in controlling bacterial diseases, aligning approved uses with veterinary practice, targeting specific pathogens, at-risk animals, defining therapy duration, and ensuring no harm to human health. If evidence is sufficient, the Secretary will issue a revised label approval by December 31, 2018. The Secretary will withdraw approval of indication claims if evidence is insufficient by December 31, 2018. The sponsor can request to remove label claims by January 1, 2018. The sponsor can request to withdraw indication claims for a drug that is a medically important antimicrobial. The withdrawal will be effective 2 years after the Secretary grants an exemption, unless an extension is provided within 2 years. An important antimicrobial drug for food-producing animals includes specific classes of antibiotics listed by the World Health Organization as highly important, critically important, or important. The Senate expresses the importance of veterinary oversight in the use of medically important antimicrobials. The Senate emphasizes the need for a valid veterinarian-client-patient relationship for the appropriate use of medically important antimicrobials in food-producing animals. This relationship involves the veterinarian taking responsibility for medical decisions and having sufficient knowledge of the patient. The veterinarian must have a valid relationship with the patient, including timely examinations or visits, availability for follow-up care, oversight of treatment, and maintenance of patient records."
