    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Transportation Infrastructure for Job Creation Act\". Congress acknowledges the importance of infrastructure investments in creating jobs and meeting critical needs in communities across the United States. Data from the Brookings Institution shows that infrastructure jobs employed nearly 14.5 million workers in 2013, with competitive wages that are up to 30 percent higher for low-income workers compared to national averages. The American Society of Civil Engineers rated the U.S. infrastructure as a \"D+\" in 2017, highlighting the need for a $4.59 trillion investment by 2025 to improve its condition. The American Society of Civil Engineers assigned grades to the Nation's infrastructure, estimating a $2.04 trillion investment needed by 2025 for surface transportation. The TIGER grant program funds projects to improve transportation infrastructure and create jobs. TIGER funds projects with significant impact on the Nation, ensuring equitable distribution of funds and addressing urban and rural needs. It received appropriations of $600 million in 2014, $500 million in 2015 and 2016, which are insufficient to meet the transportation infrastructure investment needs in the US. Appropriating $7.5 billion in fiscal year 2017 for TIGER will expand transportation infrastructure investments in the US, while restricting appropriations through budget caps undermines economic recovery and leaves critical needs unmet. An emergency supplemental appropriation of $7.5 billion for TIGER in fiscal year 2017 will create jobs and improve transportation infrastructure in the United States without reducing funding for other domestic priorities. The funds will be available for 6 years, allowing for new competitions for TIGER grants and efficient use of funds. An additional $7.5 billion is appropriated for the National Infrastructure Investments under the Department of Transportation for fiscal year 2017. The funds are designated as an emergency requirement and will be available until September 30, 2022, subject to presidential approval. The appropriation in section 3 for National Infrastructure Investments under the Department of Transportation is exempt from sequestration under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985."
