    "content": "The amount withheld for federal taxes in 2011 has increased for some individuals, surprising many due to the extension of tax rate reductions. Congressional offices are receiving inquiries about the higher withholding amounts. This report aims to help Members of Congress understand the changes in withholding, starting with an overview of the current system and analyzing the impact of economic stimulus measures. The effects of federal economic stimulus measures on withholding amounts, including the Making Work Pay tax credit in 2009 and 2010 and the Social Security tax reduction in 2011. These measures account for changes in withholding for individual taxpayers since 2011, with a focus on benefits by income level and cost-effectiveness. Criticisms include the replacement of the credit with the Social Security tax cut as a tax hike on the working poor. The report will be updated with new developments. Section 3401 of the Internal Revenue Code requires employers to withhold federal taxes from employee wage payments. Employers are required to withhold employment taxes from gross wage payments to employees, including all forms of compensation. This includes salaries, bonuses, commissions, fringe benefits, pensions, and retirement pay. Withholding is mandatory for every payroll period, regardless of the circumstances of employment. Employers subject to withholding can be businesses, tax-exempt organizations, or government agencies. Withholding is also required for taxable payments from employer-sponsored pension plans. For taxable payments from employer-sponsored pension plans, withholding is mandatory unless the recipient opts out. This rule also applies to IRAs, annuities, and life insurance contracts. Withholding for periodic payments is similar to wage payments, while non-periodic distributions are typically withheld at a 10% rate. Recipients can choose to have no federal taxes withheld by submitting Form W-4P to their plan's administrator. The Form W-4P remains in effect until revoked. Recipients without a submitted form are treated as married individuals claiming three exemptions for withholding. Not all income payments are subject to withholding, especially for those in certain professions like physicians, dentists, and contractors. Employers are not required to withhold taxes on payments to independent contractors. Withholding for supplemental unemployment compensation applies only to the portion included in gross income. Employers have various options for determining federal income tax withholding. The two main methods for federal income tax withholding are the wage-bracket method and the percentage method, based on information provided in Form W-4. The wage-bracket method uses tables to determine how much to withhold based on marital status, allowances claimed, and wages. It can accommodate different payroll systems and has separate tables for different payroll periods. If wages exceed the table amount, the percentage method is used. Employers can use the percentage method for federal income tax withholding, which involves multiplying the amount of one withholding exemption by the number of exemptions claimed on an employee's Form W-4. This amount is then subtracted from the employee's wages for the period, and the adjusted wages are matched with a percentage-rate table to determine the tax to withhold. Each withholding exemption is equivalent to a single personal exemption, prorated by the number of payroll periods in a year. For example, if the personal exemption is $3,650 and the payroll period is one month, the amount of one withholding exemption would be $304. Total withholding for income tax and employee's share of Social Security and Medicare taxes can be determined using combined withholding tables for different payroll periods. In 2011, the maximum amount subject to Social Security tax is $106,800, with the employee's share at 4.2% of annual wages. There is no wage limit for Medicare tax, which is 1.45% of annual wages. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 included the Making Work Pay Tax Credit for low- and middle-income households. The Making Work Pay Tax Credit (MWPTC) in 2009 and 2010 was equal to 6.2% of earned income or $400 for single filers and $800 for married couples. Eligibility required earned income, a Social Security number, not being claimed as a dependent, and not being a non-resident alien. The credit was reduced by economic recovery payments received under ARRA. In 2009 and 2010, adults eligible for federal benefits and government retirees could claim a $250 refundable tax credit. Failure to reduce the MWPTC by any such payment is considered an error, allowing the IRS to assess additional tax. The MWPTC was also reduced by 2% of a recipient's MAGI exceeding $75,000 for single filers. MAGI includes AGI plus certain excluded income. The Making Work Pay Tax Credit (MWPTC) phased out at $95,000 for single filers and $190,000 for joint filers. Unlike the 2008 Economic Stimulus Act, the MWPTC was disbursed gradually through reduced income tax withholding, reflecting behavioral economics principles. Obama Administration officials believed this approach would encourage recipients to spend the credit. The Making Work Pay Tax Credit (MWPTC) was designed to encourage recipients to spend the credit on goods and services. Unlike the 2008 tax rebates, the MWPTC was distributed through reduced employer withholding to boost consumer spending sooner. Lower-income individuals had to wait until filing their tax returns to claim the credit. The Making Work Pay Tax Credit (MWPTC) was implemented in March 2009, reducing withholding starting on April 1. Single filers received $400 credit at $6,452 annual income, while married joint filers received $800 at $12,903 income. The credit increased take-home pay by $15 for singles and $19 for married joint filers. The Making Work Pay Tax Credit (MWPTC) in 2010 resulted in reduced withholding from biweekly paychecks for single and married wage earners in various tax brackets. This also affected pension payments, leading to less federal income tax being withheld unless adjustments were made. In May 2009, the IRS provided an optional procedure for additional withholding on payments by plan administrators to offset reduced withholding from the MWPTC. Retirees could also increase withholding from their pension payments by filing a revised Form W-4P. Retirees without wage income had more disposable income in 2009 and 2010 but faced larger tax liabilities due to not being eligible for the MWPTC. Social Security and Medicare taxes are deducted from employees' wages, with a rate of 7.65% in 2010. The OASDI rate applies to wages up to $106,800, while there is no cap on wages subject to the Medicare tax. Self-employed individuals pay double the rate, with a tax of 15.3% in 2010. The MWPTC expired in 2010, replaced by a temporary payroll tax cut for employees and self-employed individuals in 2011. The Social Security tax for employees was reduced from 6.2% to 4.2%, and for self-employed individuals from 12.4% to 10.4%. The employer's portion of the payroll tax and the Medicare tax rate remained unchanged. The deduction for self-employment income in calculating net earnings from self-employment in the 2011 tax year remains at 7.65% of self-employment income. Federal, state, and local government employees ineligible for Social Security benefits do not benefit from the payroll tax holiday. Money from the U.S. Treasury's general fund is transferred to the OASDI fund to offset revenue loss. Employers had until January 31 to implement reduced payroll tax withholding tables due to TRUCJCA enactment in late December 2010. Excess OASDI tax withholding before the lower tax rate was implemented must be corrected by March 31. The temporary Social Security tax reduction aims to boost spending by low-to-middle-income households. The payroll tax holiday benefits workers at the bottom of the wage scale immediately, as the first dollar of annual wages is subject to the payroll tax but exempt from income tax. Unlike the MWPTC, the payroll tax holiday raises take-home pay for workers whose income is too high to benefit from the MWPTC. The reduction in payroll tax liability in 2011 starts at a wage income of $20,000, with incremental gains continuing as income increases. The Social Security tax reduction benefits lower-income taxpayers more, while the payroll tax holiday benefits a wider range of taxpayers. An analysis by the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center shows that 77.8% of all tax units will benefit from the payroll tax holiday in 2011, compared to 75.5% if the MWPTC was available instead. The payroll tax holiday benefits a wide range of taxpayers, with an average benefit of $934 per tax unit. Tax units with incomes below $30,000 would benefit more from a tax credit, while those with higher incomes would benefit more from the Social Security tax cut. Critics argue that the tax cut may be a burden on the working poor. The Tax Policy Center analysis in 2011 shows that more tax units would benefit from the payroll tax cut than the tax credit. Most beneficiaries of the tax credit have lower incomes, while those benefiting from the payroll tax cut have higher incomes. Over 51 million tax units are paying more in federal taxes due to TRUCJCA, with a majority having lower incomes. Lawmakers should compare the cost-effectiveness of the tax credit and the payroll tax holiday to promote economic growth. The cost-effectiveness of temporary tax cuts in stimulating the economy depends on the fraction of additional household income used for purchasing goods and services. Lower-income households tend to spend more compared to higher-income households who are more inclined to save. Congress should consider this difference when evaluating future stimulus legislation. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report in January 2010 assessed the cost-effectiveness of various policy options for economic stimulus. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report in January 2010 evaluated the cost-effectiveness of policy options for fiscal stimulus, measuring the impact on GDP and employment between 2010 and 2015. Each option was temporary, with low and high estimates provided for uncertainty. The CBO report in January 2010 analyzed options for fiscal stimulus, including a reduction in employees' payroll taxes and an additional tax credit for lower- and middle-income households. These options were estimated to boost output and employment between 2010 and 2015. The MWPTC and current payroll tax cut are equally cost-effective for economic recovery. Changes in federal tax withholding due to ARRA and TRUCJCA impact taxpayers' paychecks. Work status and income type determine the amount withheld, as shown in Table 1 for federal income and payroll taxes at different wage levels. The amount withheld for federal income and payroll taxes at different biweekly wage levels in 2010 and 2011 for employees claiming no withholding allowances shows a net loss of tax benefits for lower-wage workers in 2011 compared to 2010. However, at higher wage levels, the amounts withheld are lower in 2011, reflecting a net gain in tax benefits. Table 2 examines the change in withholding for retired persons receiving monthly pension payments in 2010 and 2011. The amount withheld for federal taxes is larger in 2011 compared to 2010 for individuals who did not benefit from the MWPTC or the 2011 payroll tax holiday. The increase in withholding is primarily due to the expiration of the tax credit, as individual income tax rates remained unchanged."
