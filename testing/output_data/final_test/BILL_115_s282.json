    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Public Land Renewable Energy Development Act\" and includes definitions for various terms. The Act titled \"Public Land Renewable Energy Development Act\" defines terms such as covered land, exclusion area, and Federal land. Covered land refers to public land not excluded from renewable energy development, exclusion area is land unsuitable for renewable energy projects, and Federal land includes National Forest System land. The \"Public Land Renewable Energy Development Act\" defines terms like Fund, priority area, public land, and renewable energy project. The Fund is the Renewable Energy Resource Conservation Fund, priority area is preferred land for renewable energy projects, public land is defined by the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, and renewable energy project uses wind, solar, or geothermal energy on covered land. The \"Public Land Renewable Energy Development Act\" defines terms like Secretary, variance area, exclusion area, and priority area. The Secretary refers to the Secretary of the Interior, while the variance area is covered land that is neither an exclusion area nor a priority area. Extension of funding for implementation of Geothermal Steam Act of 1970. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to extend funding for the implementation of the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 through fiscal year 2022. Amounts deposited under the Act shall be available for expenditure without further appropriation or fiscal year limitation starting from fiscal year 2017. SEC. 4. Land use planning and supplements to programmatic environmental impact statements. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, will establish priority areas on covered land for geothermal, solar, and wind energy projects. Deadlines are set for each energy type: geothermal energy priority areas within 5 years, solar energy zones from the 2012 western solar plan, and wind energy priority areas to be established promptly. The Secretary will establish priority areas for geothermal, solar, and wind energy projects within 3 years of the Act's enactment. Variance areas will be considered for renewable energy development, and land allocations will be reviewed and modified every 10 years to encourage new opportunities. The Secretary will establish priority, variance, and exclusion areas for geothermal, solar, and wind energy projects. Compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act will be achieved by supplementing programmatic environmental impact statements for each energy type. This requirement will not affect the processing of applications. The Secretary will coordinate with various entities to develop a supplement for a programmatic environmental impact statement for renewable energy projects. Priority areas must be economically viable, avoid conflicts with habitat, and align with federal land policy. The Secretary will coordinate with various entities to develop a supplement for a programmatic environmental impact statement for renewable energy projects. Priority areas must be economically viable, avoid conflicts with habitat, and align with federal land policy. If the Secretary determines an area previously suited for development should be removed from priority or variance classification, a report must be submitted to Congress within 90 days. The Secretary will not require additional environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 for a renewable energy project if it has been sufficiently analyzed in a programmatic environmental impact statement. If additional review is needed, the analysis from the programmatic statement will be used to the maximum extent possible. This section does not override any other legal requirements. SEC. 6. PROGRAM TO IMPROVE RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECT PERMIT COORDINATION. The Secretary will establish a program to improve Federal permit coordination for renewable energy projects on covered land. Within 180 days, a memorandum of understanding will be entered into with the Secretary of Agriculture and the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works to expedite environmental analysis. State participation may be requested, and qualified staff will be designated. Within 30 days of the memorandum of understanding, Federal signatories must designate qualified staff for each Bureau of Land Management Renewable Energy Coordination Office with expertise in regulatory issues such as consultation on biological opinions, permits under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, and regulatory matters under the Clean Air Act. Each employee assigned must address issues related to their home office's jurisdiction and participate in team activities. The Secretary may assign additional personnel for the Bureau of Land Management Renewable Energy Coordination Offices to ensure effective implementation of programs, including inspection and enforcement for renewable energy projects on covered land. The Secretary may also establish additional coordination offices for renewable energy projects. The Secretary may assign qualified staff to expedite permitting for renewable energy projects in State offices. A report to Congress on progress must be submitted annually. The report to Congress must include projections for renewable energy production and capacity installations, as well as a description of any problems related to leasing, permitting, siting, or production. SEC. 7. DISPOSITION OF REVENUES. Beginning January 1, 2017, revenues from wind or solar energy development on covered land will be distributed as follows: 25% to the State, 25% to counties based on land percentage, and the remainder deposited in the Treasury. Revenues from wind or solar energy development on covered land will be distributed as follows: 25% to the State, 25% to counties based on land percentage, and the remainder deposited in the Treasury. Additional funds will be allocated to the Secretary for the program established by section 6, prioritizing the expedited issuance of permits for renewable energy projects in the States where the revenues are derived. Revenues from wind or solar energy development on covered land will be distributed as follows: 25% to the State, 25% to counties based on land percentage, and the remainder deposited in the Treasury. Amounts paid to States and counties under subsection (a) shall be used consistent with section 35 of the Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 191). The Mineral Leasing Act requires payments to counties in addition to payments in lieu of taxes. The Renewable Energy Resource Conservation Fund is established to support renewable energy projects on Federal land by restoring and protecting fish and wildlife habitat. The Secretary may enter into cooperative agreements with State and tribal agencies, nonprofit organizations, and private landowners to preserve and improve fish and wildlife habitat, corridors, and water resources affected by energy development. Additionally, partnerships can be formed to enhance public access to Federal land and water through easements or right-of-ways from willing landowners. The Secretary can enter agreements with State, tribal agencies, and nonprofits to carry out activities. Funds deposited will earn interest determined by the Treasury Secretary. Congress intends for Fund revenues to supplement annual appropriations. The Secretary can enter agreements with State, tribal agencies, and nonprofits to carry out activities. Fund revenues are intended to supplement (and not supplant) annual appropriations for described activities. SEC. 8. SAVINGS CLAUSE. The Secretary will manage public land under the principles of multiple use and sustained yield, including consideration of mineral and nonrenewable energy projects, for land use planning and environmental reviews."
