    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Domestic Refugee Resettlement Reform and Modernization Act of 2013\". The Congress finds that the United States has increased efforts to resettle Iraqi refugees since 2007, highlighting the importance of resettlement for refugees worldwide without durable solutions. Many refugees are victims of torture, persecution, or forced to flee due to their support for American operations. The traumatic experiences of refugees necessitate protection and support upon arrival in the United States, with 58,238 refugees resettled in fiscal year 2012, including 12,163 from Iraq. Upon arrival in the United States, refugees are entitled to cash and medical assistance for up to 36 months, but actually receive only 8 months. Adequate support can help refugees become self-sufficient and contribute positively to their communities. Additional resources and better data could strengthen refugee services. Funding formulas used by the Office of Refugee Resettlement are retroactive, based on admission data from up to 3 prior years. Some refugees face mental health challenges due to trauma or torture, hindering their self-sufficiency and integration. Secondary migration is not adequately monitored, leading to resource shortages in states with high levels of migration. Refugee services are provided by various organizations and coordinated locally by State refugee programs to support high levels of secondary migration. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
