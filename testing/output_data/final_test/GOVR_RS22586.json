    "content": "The transaction involved two Coltec subsidiaries, A and B. A transferred a promissory note and property to B in exchange for stock and assumption of asbestos liabilities. Coltec claimed a $378.5 million loss from selling the stock, arguing that the basis was $379 million and not reduced by the liabilities. The IRS challenged the transaction's economic substance, leading to a court ruling in 2004 that the economic substance doctrine was unconstitutional. The court ruled that it was unconstitutional for courts to require taxpayers to meet criteria beyond compliance with congressionally written tax laws. They argued that applying the economic substance doctrine on top of statutes was unfair and unpredictable. The court found that previous decisions only used the doctrine as support and raised questions about its viability. In 2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the lower court's decision on the economic substance doctrine, finding it constitutional and laying out five principles for its application. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit established five principles for applying the economic substance doctrine, including using an objective test to determine economic substance and scrutinizing inter-company transactions. In a specific case involving Black & Decker Corp., a transaction lacked economic substance as it did not create real economic benefits aside from a tax advantage. Black & Decker Corp. sold stock for $1 million, claiming a $560 million loss. The IRS disallowed the loss, but the district court agreed with BDC's characterization of the transaction, focusing on the economic substance doctrine. The court found that the transaction had economic substance and granted BDC's motion for summary judgment, despite the disagreement from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. The appeals court reversed the district court's decision on the economic substance issue regarding Dow's purchase of corporate-owned life insurance policies. The court found that the lower court had misapplied the test by focusing on irrelevant facts, such as the subsidiary's business activities. The case was remanded for further proceedings. The company paid insurance premiums by borrowing funds from insurers using policies' cash value as collateral and making partial withdrawals. The plan required substantial cash investments to generate positive cash flows or significant interest earnings. Dow deducted over $33 million for interest on loans used for premiums, disallowed by the IRS for lacking economic substance. The district court disagreed, stating the transaction had economic effects. The court analyzed whether the transaction had economic substance by considering factors like positive cash flow, potential for profit, and risk transfer. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed with the district court's decision regarding the economic substance of the transaction involving COLI plans. The appellate court disagreed with the district court's findings on the economic substance of the transaction involving COLI plans. It criticized the district court for not considering Dow's past conduct in determining the likelihood of future investments and mortality gain. The court ultimately ruled that the plans lacked economic substance and should be disregarded for tax purposes. Dow filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court. Dow filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court on October 4, 2006 after entering into a transaction to monetize the value of its airplanes by forming an LLC and transferring assets. Foreign banks invested in the LLC, which distributed income to them, resulting in a difference between book and tax income due to depreciation. The taxpayer formed an LLC to monetize airplane value, with banks investing and receiving income. The IRS challenged the transaction, but the court found it had economic substance, considering both subjective business purpose and objective economic effect. The court found that the transaction had economic substance and met both tests, with banks investing $117.5 million in an LLC to raise capital. The court determined that the banks were partners in the transaction due to legitimate business reasons and active involvement in the LLC's performance. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit later reversed the lower court's decision. The appellate court reversed the lower court's decision regarding a transaction that raised equity capital. The court found that the banks involved did not meet the partnership test from Comm ' r v. Culbertson, as their interest was more like a secured loan with minimal equity involvement. Therefore, the transaction was disregarded for tax purposes. The Export Products Not Jobs Act would codify the economic substance doctrine, creating criteria for determining if a transaction has economic substance. It introduces a new penalty for tax understatements related to transactions lacking economic substance, with a 40% penalty that can be reduced to 20% if adequately disclosed. Additionally, the bill denies a deduction for interest on underpayments from such transactions."
