    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Drug Kingpins Bankruptcy Act of 1999\". The Congress finds it necessary to impose economic and financial sanctions on foreign international narcotics traffickers and their organizations. Presidential Decision Directive 42 prioritizes combating international crime and using all legal means available. Executive Order No. 12978 targets and sanctions these entities effectively. The Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) is used to target and sanction specific narcotics traffickers and their organizations operating from Colombia. Similar sanctions should be applied to other international narcotics traffickers worldwide. The purpose of this Act is to use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to sanction additional international narcotics traffickers. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with other key officials, must submit a list of individuals involved in international narcotics trafficking by January 1 each year. The Director of National Drug Control Policy reviews the list and makes recommendations to the President by February 1. Certain individuals may be excluded from the list. The Director of Central Intelligence can exclude individuals from the list of those involved in international narcotics trafficking if their disclosure could compromise US intelligence sources. The President decides by March 1 each year if individuals on the list pose a threat to national security. The President can designate individuals involved in international narcotics trafficking as a threat to national security, foreign policy, and the economy of the United States. If not designated, a report must be submitted to Congress. If a person is found to be playing a significant role in narcotics trafficking after March 1 but before January 1 of the following year, they may be designated as a threat. The President can designate individuals involved in international narcotics trafficking as a threat to national security, foreign policy, and the economy of the United States. If a designated person no longer poses a threat, they will be removed from the designation. Designated individuals may be referred to as \"specially designated narcotics trafficker\" in this Act. SEC. 5. BLOCKING ASSETS. Congress has found a national emergency exists regarding individuals designated as narcotics traffickers.

Prohibited acts include transactions involving property of designated narcotics traffickers by US persons or within the US. Law enforcement and intelligence activities are not affected by these prohibitions. The Secretary of the Treasury oversees implementation. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with other key officials, is authorized to take necessary actions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to enforce this section. Violations of licenses, orders, or regulations will be subject to civil or criminal penalties as provided by the Act.
