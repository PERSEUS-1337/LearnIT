    "content": "In 1976, President Gerald R. Ford signed the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), giving the EPA authority to regulate industrial chemicals in U.S. commerce. Stakeholders agree that TSCA needs updating, with proposed legislative changes in Congress. Previous bills aimed at amending TSCA were introduced but not voted on. Proposed Amendments to the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA): Senate and House Bills Compared with Current Law. Senator Frank Lautenberg introduced legislation (S. 847) in the 112th Congress to amend core provisions of TSCA Title I. This report compares key provisions of S. 847 with provisions of TSCA Title I that would be affected if S. 847 becomes law. New provisions related to reduced use of animals for toxicity testing are summarized. S. 847 would not affect Titles II through VI of TSCA or change the basic organization of TSCA Title I. S. 847, introduced by Senator Frank Lautenberg in the 112th Congress, aims to amend core provisions of TSCA Title I. The bill would establish varied minimum data set requirements for different chemical substances, with manufacturers given a specified time frame to submit data for existing and new chemicals. Key changes include provisions for reduced animal testing and bans on exports of elemental mercury. S. 847 proposes to require data submission for chemicals within five years of enactment. EPA can mandate data submission for chemicals posing health or environmental risks. The bill directs EPA to prioritize chemicals for evaluation and risk management based on three priority classes, with immediate risk management for priority class 1 chemicals. The Senate bill S. 847 proposes prioritizing chemicals for evaluation and risk management based on three priority classes. Priority class 1 chemicals require immediate risk management, with data submission within 18 months. Priority class 2 chemicals are those with safety standard uncertainties, while priority class 3 chemicals require no immediate action. Manufacturers must provide scientific data demonstrating no harm to human health or the environment. S. 847 would prohibit the manufacture, processing, and distribution of any chemical substance for any use not included in the safety determination. Exemptions would be allowed for national security, economic disruption, essential/critical uses with no safer alternatives, or if the chemical provides benefits to health, environment, or public safety. This is a contrast to current law where chemicals can be manufactured unless EPA finds an \"unreasonable risk\" to human health or the environment. S. 847 would expedite regulatory action by authorizing EPA to issue administrative orders instead of rules in some cases, exempting certain EPA decisions from judicial review, and expanding EPA oversight. The bill S. 847 expands EPA's authority to define different forms of substances, broadens the scope of environmental risks to include indoor environments, and increases public access to information about chemicals. It also authorizes EPA to implement international agreements on persistent organic pollutants. The bill S. 847 expands EPA's authority to regulate chemicals manufactured solely for export in accordance with three international agreements on persistent organic pollutants. It prohibits the production and use of chemicals that are inconsistent with U.S. obligations under these agreements. The bill also modifies the effect of TSCA on state and local chemical laws. TSCA Section 18 does not preempt state laws, but prohibits states from requiring testing of a chemical already tested by EPA. States can petition EPA for exemptions from certain requirements under TSCA. S. 847 aims to simplify TSCA by not preempting state laws unless compliance with both federal and state laws is impossible. It includes provisions for identifying areas with high toxic chemical exposure, developing action plans to reduce exposure, and creating market incentives for safer alternatives to hazardous substances. EPA would be required to establish a program for this purpose. The bill aims to reduce hazardous substances by expediting review of safer alternatives, conducting biomonitoring studies, and disclosing chemical uses. It also addresses children's environmental health. The bill, S. 847, aims to establish a children's environmental health research program at EPA, promote green chemistry and engineering, minimize the use of animals in toxicity testing, and develop safer alternatives to hazardous chemical substances. An advisory committee would be created to provide independent advice on TSCA implementation and protection of children's health."
