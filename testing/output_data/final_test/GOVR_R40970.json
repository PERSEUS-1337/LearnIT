    "content": "The Senate passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2009, which includes provisions affecting Medicare payments and benefits. A subsequent amendment in 2010 extended certain Medicare program authorizations. The Congressional Budget Office estimates a significant increase in mandatory Medicare expenditures from 2009 to 2019, reaching over $7 trillion. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that Medicare expenditures from 2010 to 2019 will exceed $7 trillion. The provisions in H.R. 3590 would result in approximately $400 billion in net reductions in Medicare direct spending over the same period. The Senate bill includes various titles focusing on payment and program modifications to Medicare, including fee-for-service, prescription drug benefit, and Medicare Advantage programs, as well as efforts to reform payment methods and address fraud and abuse. The report discusses the financial impact of these provisions on the Medicare program. The report discusses the financial impact on the Medicare program by the bill established by the CBO, Medicare changes by provider type and program, efforts to address efficiencies and quality, long-term Medicare financing, and program integrity changes. Appendices provide details on current law, proposed changes, and a comparison of Medicare provisions in different bills. The CBO updated analyses on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, estimating a $478 billion reduction in direct spending over the FY2010-FY2019 period. Medicare accounts for about $400 billion of the reduction, with total reductions estimated at $450 billion offset by payment increases of close to $50 billion. The Senate bill proposes significant savings in Medicare spending over 10 years, including permanent reductions in fee-for-service payment rates, changes to Medicare Advantage payment rates, reductions in payments to DSH hospitals, modifications to high-income Part B premiums, and the creation of an Independent Medicare Advisory Board. The Senate bill proposes significant savings in Medicare spending over 10 years, including permanent reductions in fee-for-service payment rates, changes to Medicare Advantage payment rates, reductions in payments to DSH hospitals, modifications to high-income Part B premiums, and the creation of an Independent Medicare Advisory Board. This is expected to save $28 billion over 10 years. Additionally, a new Hospital Insurance tax on taxable wages over $200,000 per year for single filers ($250,000 for joint filers) is expected to raise $87 billion from FY2013 through FY2019. CBO estimates that Medicare spending under the bill would increase more slowly over the next 20 years compared to the past 20 years\u2014a 6% average annual rate compared to the prior 8%. The Medicare Advisory Board established by the bill aims to reduce costs, but it is uncertain if this will be achieved through greater efficiencies or lower quality of care. Medicare is a federal program covering health services for individuals 65 and older or permanently disabled under 65, with different parts responsible for various benefits and payment mechanisms. Traditional Medicare pays for services on a fee-for-service basis using prospective payment systems or fee schedules. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) sets Medicare payment rates annually for providers, physicians, practitioners, and suppliers. Updates are made to reflect inflation and other factors, sometimes linked to the consumer price index or provider-specific market basket index. Congress establishes basic parameters for payments, while CMS implements detailed rule-making. MedPAC makes payment update recommendations in March each year. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) recommends payment updates for Medicare's fee-for-service systems to Congress based on provider efficiency and projected cost changes. Efficiency gains are tied to overall economy productivity, influencing MedPAC's recommendations for providers annually. Part A of Medicare provides coverage for inpatient hospital services, skilled nursing facility services, home health services, and hospice care. Approximately 20% of beneficiaries use these services each year, with spending projected to increase from $223 billion in 2008 to $435.2 billion in 2019. Provisions in the Senate bill aim to reduce Part A spending through payment constraints to acute care hospitals. The bill affecting Medicare's payments to acute care hospitals would constrain payment increases, restructure payments to address inefficiencies, reshape Medicare's DSH hospital subsidies, and eliminate the exception for physician-owned hospitals. It would adjust Medicare's annual payment updates to account for productivity increases, aiming to significantly reduce Medicare spending over 10 years. The bill aims to reduce Medicare spending by adjusting payments to acute care hospitals, restructuring payments, and reshaping DSH hospital subsidies. It would also eliminate exceptions for physician-owned hospitals and reduce hospitals' DSH payments. The bill aims to reduce Medicare spending by adjusting payments to acute care hospitals and restructuring DSH payments. It would save $25.1 billion from FY2015 to FY2019 by reducing hospitals' DSH payments and providing additional payments based on specific criteria. Medicare covers nursing home services for beneficiaries needing skilled nursing care post-hospitalization. The BBA 97 required the establishment of a prospective payment system for SNF care, phased in over three years starting in 1998. SNFs receive a daily payment covering all services provided, with profits retained and losses absorbed by the SNF. The daily base payment is based on 1995 costs adjusted for inflation and location, with additional adjustments for area wages and a temporary 128% increase for HIV-positive or AIDS residents. Base payments are required to be adjusted annually. The BBA 97 established a prospective payment system for SNF care, with base payments adjusted annually. The final FY2010 rule proposed recalibrating case mix indexes to account for resources used in complex care, resulting in a 1.1% decrease in Medicare payments to SNFs. Individual providers may see larger payment decreases due to case-mix utilization. Proposed PPS and Consolidated Billing SNF payment regulation for FY2010 aims to match service needs of beneficiaries more accurately. MedPAC recommends revising the PPS for SNFs by separating payments for nontherapy ancillary services and establishing an outlier policy for stays with high ancillary care needs. They also suggest recalibrating the payment category for therapy costs to improve payments for therapy services. MedPAC recommends adjusting payment categories for therapy costs to better match actual therapy services needed by patients and eliminating the market basket update for 2010. Additionally, there is a concern about high readmission rates for Medicare beneficiaries with complex health conditions, suggesting a need for new incentives and payment models to improve care coordination across different healthcare settings. The Senate bill aims to slow the growth in payments to SNFs and could result in payment reductions. The Secretary would be required to implement changes to therapy services and case mix classification in SNFs. The Senate bill aims to slow payment growth to SNFs by implementing changes to therapy services and case mix classification. Medicare-certified SNFs, hospitals, physicians, and post-acute care providers may participate in a National Pilot Program on Payment Bundling to test bundled payments' effectiveness in coordinating patient care. The Secretary must develop a plan by October 1, 2011, for a Medicare value-based purchasing program for SNFs. Home health agencies are paid under a prospective payment system, excluding durable medical equipment. The 60-day episode rate for home health agencies is annually increased based on the projected increase in the home health market basket index. Agencies failing to submit quality data will receive a lower update. In CY2010, the market basket will increase by 2.0%. CMS will cap outlier payments to HHAs at 10% of total payments and overall outlier payments at 2.5% of total payments. Refinements were made in CY2008 to improve payment efficiencies in the home health prospective payment system. The Secretary made changes to the home health agency case-mix index to improve payment efficiencies, resulting in a downward adjustment of the national prospective 60-day episode payment rate. MedPAC recommended eliminating the increase for 2010 and accelerating payment coding changes. Additionally, MedPAC suggested rebasing HHA rates to better reflect average costs of care. The Senate bill includes provisions that would impact home health payments, such as reducing updates and implementing productivity adjustments. It also requires rebasing of payments to reflect services provided and establishes annual caps on reimbursements. Additionally, there is a 3% add-on payment for providers in rural areas. The Senate bill includes provisions for a 3% add-on payment for home health providers in rural areas. It also mandates the development of a Medicare value-based purchasing program for HHAs and a National Pilot Program on Payment Bundling to test bundled payments for coordinated patient care. Changes to Medicare payments for physicians, including new bonus payments and program adjustments, are also proposed in the bill. The Senate bill proposes adjustments to Medicare payments for physicians, including new bonus payments and program modifications. It also allows the Secretary to review and adjust potentially misvalued codes, extend geographic variation in physician work payments, and make changes to payment structures for certain services. Additionally, the bill modifies the physician quality reporting initiative program and introduces penalties for non-reporting. The maximum payment to Medicare Advantage plans would also be altered, along with other payment and administrative adjustments. The bill proposes changes to Medicare Advantage (MA) plan payments by transitioning to a benchmark based on the weighted average of plan bids, rather than statutorily determined formulas. This change could lead to reductions in benchmarks, potentially resulting in decreased extra benefits and increased costs. The bill proposes changes to Medicare Advantage (MA) plan payments by transitioning to a benchmark based on plan bids, potentially leading to reductions in extra benefits, increased cost sharing, and access issues in some areas. Bonus payments for care coordination and quality improvement programs are also included in the bill. The bill proposes changes to Medicare Advantage (MA) plan payments by transitioning to a benchmark based on plan bids, potentially leading to reductions in extra benefits, increased cost sharing, and access issues in some areas. The provisions aim to save $34.4 billion over the FY2010-2014 period and $118.1 billion over the FY2010-2019 period. Additionally, the bill extends the Secretary's authority to adjust payments to plans for differences in diagnosis coding between MA plans and original Medicare. The bill proposes changes to Medicare Advantage (MA) plan payments by transitioning to a benchmark based on plan bids, potentially leading to reductions in extra benefits, increased cost sharing, and access issues in some areas. The Secretary would conduct further analyses on coding patterns and adjust payments based on the results for 2011-2013, with estimated savings of $0.7 billion over FY2010-2019. Additional changes to the Medicare Advantage program would result in costs or savings of less than $1.0 billion over the 10-year period. The Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA, P.L. 108-173) established the voluntary outpatient prescription drug benefit under Medicare Part D, effective January 1, 2006. Medicare replaced Medicaid as the primary source of drug coverage for dual eligibles. Prescription drug coverage is provided through private prescription drug plans (PDPs) or Medicare Advantage prescription drug plans (MA-PDs). Medicare's payments to plans are determined through competitive bidding, and enrollee premiums are tied to plan bids. Plans bear some risk for their enrollees' drug spending. Medicare law sets out a defined standard benefit structure under the Part D benefit. The standard benefit structure under Medicare Part D includes a $310 deductible and a 25% coinsurance until reaching $2,830 in total drug spending. After this limit, there is a coverage gap (doughnut hole) until hitting the catastrophic threshold of $6,440 in 2010. Low-income individuals can receive enhanced coverage through the low-income subsidy (LIS), which reduces out-of-pocket costs by paying for premiums, deductibles, and limiting copayments. The Senate bill proposes changes to the Part D program affecting beneficiary premiums. The Senate bill proposes changes to the Medicare Part D program, including increasing premiums for higher income enrollees and providing discounts of 50% for brand name drugs during the coverage gap. However, the full drug price would still be used to calculate out-of-pocket costs, resulting in a projected cost increase of $17.8 billion over 10 years for the federal government. The Senate bill proposes changes to the Medicare Part D program, including increasing premiums for higher income enrollees and providing discounts for brand name drugs during the coverage gap. The bill also aims to improve access to and availability of LIS plans by postponing redetermination of LIS eligibility after the death of a spouse and eliminating cost sharing for individuals receiving care under a Medicaid home and community based waiver. Additionally, changes to the methodology for enrolling low-income beneficiaries in plans are proposed to reduce the number of low-income individuals. The Senate bill proposes changes to the Medicare Part D program, including increasing premiums for higher income enrollees and providing discounts for brand name drugs during the coverage gap. Additional funding would be provided for outreach and assistance for low-income programs. The CBO cost estimate for the changes to the low-income subsidy program in the bill is $2.4 billion over 10 years. Provisions aimed at expanding consumer protections for Part D enrollees are included, such as developing a centralized system for handling complaints and requiring a uniform exceptions and appeals process for Part D plans. Medicare is prohibited from interfering in the practice of medicine or the manner in which medical services are provided. Medicare pays for covered products and services deemed medically necessary, but some services for beneficiaries may be unnecessary. Differences in practice patterns lead to varying expenditures with no impact on health status. MedPAC issues annual reports to Congress on Medicare, recommending improvements for efficiency and payment accuracy. Medicare's fee-for-service system is criticized for promoting excessive care over quality. Senate bill aligns with MedPAC recommendations. The Senate bill aligns with MedPAC recommendations for quality care by establishing a national pilot program to bundle payments for physician and hospital services, rewarding accountable care organizations for meeting quality targets and reducing costs. CBO estimates $4.9 billion in Medicare savings over FY2010-2019 through a shared savings program. Additionally, the bill addresses preventable readmissions under Medicare's IPPS. The Senate bill aims to reduce preventable readmissions under Medicare's IPPS by adjusting payments for hospitals based on their percentage of potentially preventable Medicare readmissions. This provision is estimated to save $7.1 billion over FY2010-2019. Additionally, the bill includes a provision to penalize hospitals for certain high-cost and common health conditions acquired during hospital stays, resulting in estimated savings of $1.4 billion over the next 10 years. The Senate bill includes a provision to create a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation to develop innovative payment and delivery arrangements, aiming to improve care quality and reduce costs. The provision is estimated to save an additional $1.3 billion over 10 years. Medicare's financial operations are managed through two trust funds, with the primary source of income being payroll taxes. The Medicare trust fund operates as an accounting mechanism with no actual money transfer, funded by interest-bearing government securities. The HI trust fund is projected to become insolvent in 2017, requiring Congress to decide on funding for Medicare Part A. Medicare Parts B and D are financed through premiums and general revenues credited to the SMI trust fund. The SMI trust fund is funded by premiums and general revenue transfers, ensuring it remains balanced and not depleted. However, growth in SMI expenditures will necessitate higher beneficiary premiums and revenue. The Senate bill includes provisions like establishing an Independent Medicare Advisory Board to control spending growth. If Medicare spending exceeds targets, the Board must propose recommendations to reduce it. The Senate bill includes provisions for an Independent Medicare Advisory Board to control spending growth by developing recommendations to reduce per capita growth rates. Recommendations made by the Board would be implemented automatically if Congress takes no action, potentially saving $28.0 billion between 2015 and 2019. Additionally, the bill imposes a 0.9% tax on high-income workers and freezes income thresholds for determining higher Part B premium rates. The Senate bill includes provisions to save Medicare costs by implementing higher premiums for high-income beneficiaries in both Part B and Part D programs. The bill would also reduce net Part A outlays by $245 billion over FY2010-2019, leading to an increase in the HI trust fund balance by $385 billion over the same period. The HI trust fund had a balance of about $170 billion at the end of FY2019, but it would still be declining and become insolvent a few years after 2019. CBO warns against combining trust fund accounting with budget accounting rules to avoid double-counting savings. Health care fraud costs billions annually, with estimates ranging from 3% to 10% of all health care expenditures. Developing new approaches to fight fraud in health insurance programs is crucial as expenditures rise. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) conduct program integrity activities to prevent health care fraud in public and private insurance programs. They collaborate with the Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General (OIG), the Department of Justice (DOJ), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to investigate and prosecute suspected cases of fraud. The OIG is responsible for detecting fraud in federal health care programs, while the FBI handles complex fraud investigations in both private and public health care programs. The legislation targets fraud in CMS's program integrity activities, HHS OIG and DOJ enforcement efforts, and funding for anti-fraud activities. It includes enhanced oversight and screening measures for providers enrolling in Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP, requiring providers to pay an enrollment fee for these measures. Other measures include implementing compliance programs, suspending provider payments, and clarifying access to payment and claims data for law enforcement agencies. The legislation aims to combat fraud in healthcare programs by increasing oversight and screening for providers enrolling in Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP. It introduces new penalties for infractions like falsifying information and delays in investigations. The bill also expands the Recovery Audit Contractor program and increases funding for anti-fraud activities. Medicare spending is growing faster than the economy, mainly due to new treatments and medical technology. The program will need significant new financing sources and will impose a financial burden on taxpayers. Rising costs will also lead to higher premiums and cost sharing for Medicare beneficiaries. The Senate bill aims to reduce Medicare program costs by $400 billion over the next 10 years through payment adjustments and increasing efficiencies in health services delivery. There are debates on using these savings to fund health care coverage expansion or strengthen Medicare's financial standing while ensuring access to quality care for beneficiaries. The Senate bill aims to reduce Medicare program costs by $400 billion over the next 10 years through payment adjustments and increasing efficiencies in health services delivery. Appendix A contains selected Medicare provisions in the Senate-passed H.R. 3590, including Title II provisions related to protections for American Indians and Alaska Natives. Sec. 2902 eliminates the sunset for reimbursement for all Medicare Part B services furnished by certain Indian hospitals and clinics. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 expanded Medicare Part B coverage for services provided by Indian Health Service (IHS) hospitals or clinics operated by Indian tribes or tribal organizations. This five-year reimbursement extension will expire on January 1, 2010. The provision would amend SSA Sec. 1880(e). The reimbursement extension for IHS, IT, and TO services under Medicare Part B will expire on January 1, 2010. The CBO score is $0.1 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.2 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Title III focuses on improving the quality and efficiency of health care, including the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Program. Acute care hospitals that submit quality data receive higher payments under Medicare's RHQDAPU program. The RHQDAPU program collects 46 quality measures impacting FY2011 payments. Hospitals' performance is available on Hospital Compare. CMS recommended expanding the program to financially reward hospitals based on performance. Starting October 1, 2012, hospitals would receive value-based incentive payments from Medicare. Performance would be key for payment adjustments starting in FY2013. The program excludes certain hospitals in a fiscal year based on payment reductions, deficiencies posing jeopardy to patients, and insufficient measures or cases. Maryland acute-care hospitals under state-specific Medicare are exempt if a similar state program shows comparable outcomes. The Secretary selects measures for the hospital VBP program, covering at least five conditions in FY2013. Measures in FY2014 and beyond include efficiency measures. The Secretary establishes VBP performance standards for hospitals, with the highest scores receiving larger payments. Hospitals meeting or exceeding standards receive increased base operating DRG payments per discharge. Starting in FY2013, incentive payments are funded by reducing base DRG payments by a percentage. In FY2013 and subsequent years, hospitals face reductions in discharges by a set percentage. Adjustments within Medicare's payment system remain unaffected. Hospital performance on quality measures will be publicly reported, with an appeal process established. No judicial or administrative review of certain VBP aspects. The VBP program would undergo modifications, with the Secretary consulting small rural and urban hospitals. Hospitals may be required to submit additional data for quality measures not used in VBP payments. Risk adjustment for quality measures would be implemented for FY2013 payments. The GAO and the Secretary would conduct studies on the VBP program, with reports due by specific dates. VBP demonstration projects would be established within two years of enactment. The VBP program would be modified with new demonstration projects in critical access hospitals and those excluded from VBP due to low volume. Reports on the projects would be submitted to Congress within 18 months. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Additionally, improvements to the Physician Quality Reporting System would be made, including incentive payments to eligible professionals for reporting quality measures. The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 made the Physician Quality Reporting Initiative (PQRI) permanent, with increased incentive payments through 2010. The bill extends PQRI incentive payments through 2014 and implements penalties for providers who do not report quality measures starting in 2015. Eligible professionals who report successfully in 2010 would receive a 1% bonus in 2011, with additional bonuses for reporting in subsequent years. An extra 0.5% incentive payment is available for those meeting Maintenance of Certification Program requirements. The Maintenance of Certification Program (MOCP) is a continuous assessment program for board certified specialty physicians focusing on competencies like patient care, medical knowledge, and professionalism. Physicians must maintain a valid license, participate in educational programs, pass a secure examination, and complete the MOCP practice assessment. Eligible professionals must participate in and complete a qualified MOCP practice assessment more frequently than required for board certification. The MOCP would submit information to the Secretary on behalf of eligible professionals who successfully meet program criteria and patient experience surveys. Participation in the program would impact quality of care measures and failure to participate would result in payment penalties. Incentive payments and adjustments would be based on allowed charges for covered services. The proposal aims to integrate the PQRI program with electronic health records standards, costing $600 million over FY2010-FY2014. It also includes improvements to the Physician Feedback Program to help physicians assess their resource use and adjust practice styles accordingly. The Physician Feedback Program aims to improve efficiency and control costs by providing confidential reports to physicians based on Medicare claims data. The program evaluates resource use on an episode or per capita basis, with incentives to encourage efficiency. The GAO will study the program's implementation and submit a report. The proposal aims to enhance the Physician Feedback Program by introducing new reports and data analysis. By January 1, 2012, an episode grouper will be developed to combine related services into care episodes. Starting in 2012, physicians will receive reports comparing their resource use patterns to peers, with methodologies established for attribution and comparison. The proposal aims to enhance the Physician Feedback Program by introducing new reports and data analysis. Physicians will receive reports comparing their resource use patterns to peers, with methodologies established for attribution and comparison. The Secretary would make adjustments to account for differences in socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, ethnicity, and health status of individuals. Medicare pays for inpatient care provided by IRFs and LTCHs, and for hospices. The Secretary would establish quality reporting programs for LTCHs, IRFs, and hospices, requiring data submission on specified quality measures starting in rate year 2014. Non-compliance would result in a 2 percentage point reduction in annual updates, potentially lowering payment basis. Any reduction would not impact subsequent years' payments. The CBO score is $0 for FY2010-FY2014 and -$0.1 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Quality reporting programs for IPPS-exempt cancer hospitals would be established starting FY2014, with measures published by October 1, 2012. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019 Sec. 3006 as modified by Sec. 10301. Plans for a Value-Based Purchasing Program for Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs), Home Health Agencies (HHAs), and Ambulatory Surgical Centers (ASCs). The Secretary would be required to develop three plans to implement Medicare value-based purchasing programs and submit them to Congress by specific dates. These plans would consider quality and efficiency measures, data collection, and value-based payment structures. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to establish a separate payment modifier based on quality and cost for the Medicare physician fee schedule. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is mandated to create a separate payment modifier for the Medicare physician fee schedule based on quality and cost. Quality would be assessed using risk-adjusted measures established by the Secretary, while costs would be evaluated based on appropriate measures that consider various factors. Specific measures of quality and cost, implementation dates, and prospective performance period would be published by January 1, 2012. The Secretary would implement a value-based payment adjustment starting in 2013. During the performance period beginning in 2014, physicians would receive information on the value of care they provide based on quality and cost measures. The payment modifier would be applied starting January 1, 2015, for specific physicians and groups, and by January 1, 2017, for all physicians. The modifier would promote systems-based care and consider special circumstances in rural and underserved areas. CBO estimates no impact on spending over 5 or 10 years. Starting October 1, 2008, hospitals did not receive additional Medicare payment for complications acquired during a patient's hospital stay for select conditions known as hospital-acquired conditions (HACs). These conditions are high cost, high volume, or identified through a secondary diagnosis resulting in assignment to a higher paid MS-DRG. Starting FY2015, hospitals with high HAC rates would receive reduced payments. Maryland hospitals under state Medicare system would be exempt if they meet quality outcomes. HAC condition reports would be made public after review, with no administrative review allowed. The Secretary would submit a report to Congress by January 1, 2012, with recommendations for expanding Medicare's HAC payment policy to various facilities. A pilot pay-for-performance program would be established for certain Medicare providers by January 1, 2016, with waivers of Medicare requirements as necessary. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$1.4 billion for FY2010-FY2019. The Secretary can expand the pilot project to reduce Medicare spending without compromising care quality. The Chief Actuary of CMS must certify any expansion to reduce spending. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Public reporting of performance information for eligible professionals is required. The Secretary is required to develop a Physician Compare Internet website with information on physicians enrolled in the Medicare program by January 1, 2011. Additionally, by January 1, 2013, a plan for publicly available information on physician performance through Physician Compare must be implemented. The Secretary must develop a plan for publicly reporting physician performance on the Physician Compare website, ensuring data accuracy, timely feedback, and support for valid reporting activities. The section authorizes the Secretary to develop a plan for transitioning to a value-based purchasing program for physicians and practitioners. A report on the Physician Compare website will include data on physician quality and efficiency. Additionally, a demonstration program may provide financial incentives to Medicare beneficiaries using high-quality physicians. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Establishment of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS is also discussed. The Social Security Amendments of 1967 and 1972 allow the Secretary to conduct experiments and demonstrations for new payment and service delivery models in federal health care programs. A Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMI) was established within CMS to test innovative models to reduce program expenditures while maintaining quality of care. The Secretary is required to select models that improve coordination, quality, and efficiency of health care services for individuals with poor clinical outcomes or avoidable expenditures. The models can address various themes like medical homes, coordinated care, alternative payment mechanisms, HIT, medication management, patient education, and more. Budget neutrality is not a requirement for testing these models. The CMI would consult with various stakeholders in carrying out its functions. The Secretary would evaluate each model tested and make evaluations publicly available. Evaluations would include analysis of care quality, patient outcomes, and spending changes. States would be required to collect and report information for evaluation. The Secretary would terminate or modify demonstrations that do not improve quality without increasing spending, reduce spending without reducing quality, or improve quality and reduce spending. The provision grants the Secretary authority to expand demonstration duration and scope if it meets criteria and reduces program spending. The Secretary can waive certain requirements to conduct these demonstrations and exempt them from the Paperwork Reduction Act. The provision authorizes funding of $5 million for model design in FY2010, $10 billion annually for activities from 2011 to 2019, and $10 billion for each subsequent 10-year period starting in 2020. At least $25 million must be allocated for specific models. The Secretary must report to Congress every two years starting in 2012 on CMI activities, including participant numbers. The provision includes descriptions of demonstrations, number of Medicare and Medicaid participants, payments made, models chosen for expansion, and evaluation results. Reports must also include recommendations for legislative action. The CBO score is $0.7 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$1.3 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Medicare Shared Savings Program involves accountable care organizations (ACOs) going beyond the Physician Group Practice (PGP) model. The provision allows groups of providers to be recognized as ACOs, eligible for cost-savings in the Medicare program. ACOs must meet quality criteria and achieve threshold savings to qualify for annual incentives. ACOs consist of practitioners in joint decision-making mechanisms and must participate for a minimum of three years. ACOs, comprised of various healthcare providers, can receive shared savings payments if they meet cost-saving targets compared to benchmark expenditures. The benchmark is based on the previous three years of spending for assigned beneficiaries, adjusted for beneficiary characteristics and national growth. The benchmark for ACOs is reset at the start of each agreement period and is based on beneficiary characteristics and national growth in Medicare expenditures. A qualifying ACO can receive a percentage of the difference between their estimated average per capita Medicare expenditures and the benchmark, with limits set on shared savings payments by the Secretary. The Secretary may also implement a partial capitation model for ACOs, where they are at financial risk for some Part A and B services. The Secretary may limit participation in the model to highly integrated systems capable of bearing risk. Spending under this model cannot exceed what would be spent without its implementation. Organizations must submit quality data and meet specific requirements related to clinical processes, outcomes, patient experience, and utilization measures to earn incentive payments. The Secretary can adjust savings thresholds for different ACO sizes and impose sanctions on ACOs avoiding at-risk patients. The CBO score is -$0.5 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$4.9 billion for FY2010-FY2019. The National Pilot Program on Payment Bundling aims to test new incentives and payment models for Medicare services to encourage better coordination of patient care across different providers. The program, to be established by January 1, 2013, will run for five years on a voluntary basis, providing incentives for providers to coordinate care across the continuum. Total estimated savings are -$0.5 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$4.9 billion for FY2010-FY2019. The National Pilot Program on Payment Bundling aims to test new incentives and payment models for Medicare services by encouraging better coordination of patient care across providers. Providers would be jointly accountable for an entire episode of care around a hospitalization, covering the full hospital stay plus the first 30 days post-discharge. The Secretary could expand the pilot after January 1, 2016, with certification from the Chief Actuary of CMS, if it reduces Medicare spending without compromising care quality. Provider payment methods may include bundled payments and bids for episodes of care, comprehensively covering applicable services like acute care, physicians' services, and outpatient hospital services. The National Pilot Program on Payment Bundling tests new payment models for Medicare services by promoting better coordination of patient care. Participating beneficiaries must be entitled to Medicare Part A and enrolled in Part B, with specified conditions. Payment methodology includes services like care coordination and medication reconciliation. The Secretary would conduct a Medicare demonstration program to test a payment incentive and service delivery model using home-based primary care teams for chronically ill Medicare beneficiaries. The program aims to reduce expenditures and improve health outcomes. The Secretary would establish agreements with qualifying independence at home medical practices, comprised of individual physicians or nurse practitioners providing home-based primary care services to beneficiaries. These practices would offer 24/7 care tailored to chronic conditions, with a methodology for sharing savings if expenditures are below target levels. The Secretary would establish agreements with qualifying independence at home medical practices to provide home-based primary care services to beneficiaries. Practices would receive incentive payments if actual expenditures are below the estimated spending target, subject to performance on quality measures. Incentive payments would be a portion of the amount by which actual expenditures are less than 5% below the target. Agreements with practices under the program could not exceed a three-year period, and an independent evaluation would be conducted with a final report submitted to Congress. The Secretary would conduct an independent evaluation of the demonstration program and submit a final report to Congress on best practices and impact. A plan for program expansion would be submitted by January 1, 2016, if it improves patient care quality and reduces spending. $5 million would be appropriated annually for program administration. The CBO score ranges from -$50 million to +$50 million for fiscal years 2010-2019. The Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program under Medicare pays for inpatient care provided by acute care hospitals using a prospective payment system. Hospitals may receive additional payments based on various factors such as outlier cases, teaching hospital status, disproportionate share hospital payments, and treating a low volume of Medicare patients. Certain types of hospitals in Maryland have a state-specific reimbursement system. Starting in 2012, Medicare implemented a hospital readmissions reduction program for preventable inpatient hospital readmissions, targeting 3 high-volume or high-rate conditions. This program aimed to reduce Medicare spending, as readmissions accounted for $15 billion in costs. Medicare's base operating DRG payment amounts would be reduced by an adjustment factor, with certain exemptions for outlier, IME, DSH, and low volume payments. Hospital-specific payments to SCHs and MDHs would also be exempt. Acute care hospitals in Maryland could be exempt if a state program achieves similar patient outcomes and cost savings. The adjustment factor for hospitals would be based on a floor adjustment factor or excess readmissions ratio, with the floor adjustment factor decreasing over fiscal years. The excess readmissions ratio is calculated as 1 minus the ratio of aggregate payments for excess readmissions to all discharges. It includes readmissions over a minimum number for specific conditions within a certain period for a hospital. Applicable conditions are defined as high volume or high expenditure conditions for Medicare with specified readmission measures. Excluded readmissions are those unrelated to prior discharge. This policy starts in FY2015. Beginning in FY2015, the readmission program will expand to include 4 additional conditions identified by MedPAC in 2007. Readmission data for various types of hospitals will be publicly available after review, with no judicial or administrative review permitted. A program to improve readmission rates through patient safety organizations will be established for eligible hospitals with historically high rates of readmissions. Hospitals and organizations will report on processes used to reduce readmissions. CBO score is -$0.5 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$7.1 billion for FY2010-FY2019. The Secretary would fund eligible hospitals and community-based organizations to provide improved care transition services to high-risk Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions or other risk factors for hospital readmission. The Secretary would fund hospitals and community-based organizations to provide care transition interventions for high-risk Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions or risk factors for readmission. Entities must propose interventions like initiating services prior to discharge and arranging post-discharge follow-up. Priority would be given to entities serving underserved populations, small communities, and rural areas. $500 million would be transferred from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. The Secretary can transfer funds from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund for a program to improve care quality and reduce Medicare spending. The program could be expanded based on its effectiveness. A gainsharing demonstration extension is in progress, with projects in New York and West Virginia. The project began in 2008 and will end in 2009, with a budget of $6 million in FY2006. The project received $6 million in FY2006 and an additional $1.6 million in FY2010, with funds available through FY2014. The gainsharing demonstration project was extended until September 30, 2011, with reports due by March 31, 2011 and March 31, 2013. The CBO score for FY2010-FY2014 and FY2010-FY2019 is between -$50 million and +$50 million. Subtitle B focuses on improving Medicare for patients and providers, including increasing physician payment updates and extending geographic adjustments. The Medicare fee schedule is adjusted geographically for physician work, practice expense, and medical malpractice insurance using Geographic Practice Cost Indices (GPCIs). A temporary floor value of 1.00 on the physician work index was set in January 2004, extended through December 2009 by Section 134 of the MIPPA. Other geographic indices were not affected. The proposal aims to extend the 1.00 floor for the geographic index for physician work through December 31, 2010, and adjust the practice expense GPCI methodology to reflect a blend of local and national averages for employee wages and rents. Relief would only apply to areas with a practice expense GPCI less than 1.0. The proposal aims to adjust the practice expense GPCI methodology for areas with a GPCI less than 1.0, ensuring accurate geographic adjustments by January 1, 2012. The Secretary will analyze current methods and make necessary adjustments without regard to previous years if not completed by 2012. The 2011 payment rule for the Physician Fee Schedule would remain in effect if no changes are made for 2012. The estimated cost of this provision is $1.8 billion over the next three years. The exceptions process for Medicare Therapy Caps has been extended through December 31, 2009, allowing for additional therapy services when medically necessary. The exceptions process for therapy caps was extended through various acts, costing $800 million over two years. Sec. 3104 also extended payment for certain physician pathology services. The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 extended the provision for technical pathology services until January 1, 2010. The proposal aims to extend it further until January 1, 2011, with an estimated cost of $100 million in 2010. Additionally, bonus payments for ground ambulance services in qualified rural areas were established, with a 3% increase in Medicare rates for rural ambulance services. The provision extends bonus payments and increased rates for rural ambulance services until January 1, 2011. Urban air ambulance services are also treated as rural during this period. The CBO estimates a cost of $0.1 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Additionally, there is an extension of certain payment rules for long-term care hospital services. LTCHs provide medical care for complex patients with multiple conditions. CMS has imposed organizational requirements on LTCHs to ensure they are separate entities, with some exemptions for grandfathered HwHs. Starting October 1, 2004, limits were set on the number of Medicare patients discharged from HwHs and satellite LTCHs, affecting subsequent patient admissions and payments. Starting July 1, 2007, CMS extended a payment policy to various types of LTCHs, including grandfathered entities, resulting in lower payments for subsequent patient admissions. Congress implemented a three-year moratorium on this policy starting December 29, 2007. LTCHs are paid under a prospective payment system (PPS) since October 1, 2002, with a five-year transition period. CMS proposed a one-time adjustment to correct errors in the original budget neutrality calculations for LTCH payments. The LTCH-PPS includes case level adjustments for short stay and interrupted stay cases. A moratorium was applied to a short-stay outlier payment policy to reduce payments for patients with lengths of stay below average. Additionally, a three-year moratorium on new LTCHs and bed increases was established, extending until December 29, 2012. The CBO score is $0.2 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.2 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Extension of Physician Fee Schedule Mental Health Add-On was also included in the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008. The Patients and Providers Act of 2008 increased payments for certain Medicare mental health services by 5% from July 1, 2008, to December 31, 2009, with a proposed extension through December 31, 2010. It also allows physician assistants to order post-hospital extended care services in skilled nursing facilities. Extended care services are provided as an extension of care for a condition following inpatient hospital services. A physician assistant collaborating with a physician can certify the need for post-hospital extended care services for Medicare payment. The CBO score ranges from -$50 million to +$50 million for FY2010-FY2019. MIPPA requires DMEPOS suppliers to be accredited by October 1, 2009, with an extended deadline for pharmacies until January 1, 2010. Pharmacists and pharmacies are not exempt from accreditation requirements, but certain pharmacies can be exempt if their Medicare DMEPOS billings are less than 5% of total pharmacy sales for the previous three years. All pharmacies must still meet accreditation requirements for competitive bidding. The bill allows pharmacies with DMEPOS billings less than 5% of total pharmacy sales for the past three years to be exempt from accreditation requirements. They must submit an attestation of enrollment as a Medicare provider for five years with no adverse determinations. The Secretary may create alternative accreditation requirements for all pharmacies. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. TRICARE For Life (TFL) is a program that provides supplemental coverage to Medicare-eligible military retirees, their spouses, dependent children, and widow/widowers. Beneficiaries must enroll in and pay premiums for Medicare Part B to participate in TFL. Declining Part B results in loss of TRICARE eligibility. Medicare Part A eligibility is based on age, disability, or ESRD. Declining Part B results in loss of TRICARE benefits. A twelve-month special enrollment period is proposed for military retirees, spouses, and dependent children who are eligible for TRICARE and Medicare Part A but have declined Part B. This special enrollment period would be available once in their lifetime and starts the day after the initial enrollment period ends. The proposed special enrollment period (SEP) allows individuals to choose Part B coverage retroactively after the initial enrollment period without facing a late enrollment penalty. The Secretary of Defense will identify and notify eligible individuals, with support from the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Commissioner for Social Security. The provision would take effect upon enactment, with a CBO score ranging from -$50 million to +$50 million for FY2010-FY2014 and FY2010-FY2019. Additionally, Medicare will cover bone density tests using DXA machines for eligible individuals every two years or more frequently if necessary. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 capped reimbursement for x-ray and imaging services under Medicare. Reimbursement rates for DXA services have been reduced by more than half since 2006. A provision would set payments for DXA at 70% of the 2006 rates in 2010 and 2011. The provision in 2010 and 2011 would set payments for DXA at 70% of the 2006 rates. The provision would also direct a study on the ramifications of Medicare reimbursement reductions for DXA. CBO estimates the cost at $0.1 billion each in FY 2010 and FY 2011. Additionally, a provision would eliminate funding in the Medicare Improvement Fund, with CBO scores of -$15.6 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and - $20.7 billion for FY2010-FY2019. The proposal aims to establish a demonstration project under Medicare part B for separate payments to laboratories for complex diagnostic laboratory tests provided to Medicare beneficiaries. These tests include gene protein expression analysis, topographic genotyping, and cancer chemotherapy sensitivity assays. The tests must be approved by the FDA and billed using specific HCPCS codes. The proposal establishes a Medicare part B demonstration project for separate payments to laboratories for complex diagnostic tests approved by the FDA. The project will run for two years with a budget of $100 million, aiming to assess its impact on access to care, quality, health outcomes, and expenditures. The proposal includes a Medicare part B demonstration project for separate payments to laboratories for complex diagnostic tests approved by the FDA. It aims to assess the impact on access to care, quality of care, health outcomes, and Medicare program expenditures. The estimated cost is $100 million over the next 5 years with no additional impact in the following years. Additionally, there is a provision for improved access to certified nurse-midwife services under Medicare. The proposal includes a Medicare part B demonstration project for separate payments to laboratories for complex diagnostic tests approved by the FDA. It aims to assess the impact on access to care, quality of care, health outcomes, and Medicare program expenditures. The estimated cost is $100 million over the next 5 years with no additional impact in the following years. Additionally, there is a provision for improved access to certified nurse-midwife services under Medicare. The amendment to Section 1833 limits fees for certified-midwife services to 100% of physician fees. Medicare coverage is extended to individuals exposed to environmental health hazards, including those with specific medical conditions. Individuals with specified lung diseases or cancer living in areas under EPA public health emergency declarations are entitled to Medicare benefits. A pilot program will provide coordinated care to these individuals. The Secretary can also extend benefits to those diagnosed with illnesses caused by environmental hazards covered by EPA declarations. $23 million is appropriated for FY2010-FY2014, with $20 million for each subsequent year. The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 requires the implementation of a bundled payment system for renal dialysis services, phased in over four years starting January 1, 2011. The bundled payment includes various services and medications previously paid for separately under Part B. The program would be appropriated $23 million for FY2010-FY2014, and $20 million for each 5-fiscal year period thereafter. The CBO score is $0.1 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.3 billion for FY2010-FY2019. The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 implements a bundled payment system for renal dialysis services, including medications previously paid for separately under Part B. A study is required to assess the impact on Medicare beneficiary access to high-quality dialysis services by including specified oral drugs in the bundled payment system. The study will analyze providers' ability to furnish oral drugs, comply with state laws, and ensure appropriate quality measures for Medicare beneficiaries. The CBO score for the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Part II of the Act focuses on Rural Protections, specifically the extension of Outpatient Hold Harmless Provision for small rural hospitals. These hospitals can receive additional Medicare payments if their outpatient payments are less under the prospective payment system compared to the prior hospital outpatient department reimbursement system. The hospitals receive 85% of the payment difference for covered HOPD services furnished on or after January 1, 2009. Small rural hospitals and SCHs with not more than 100 beds would receive 85% of the payment difference in CY2010. The 100-bed limitation for SCHs would be removed so that all SCHs would receive 85% of the payment difference in CY2010. The CBO score is $0.2 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.2 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Extension of Medicare Reasonable Costs Payments for Certain Clinical Diagnostic Laboratory Tests Furnished to Hospital Patients in Certain Rural Areas is also included. Reimbursement for clinical diagnostic laboratory services in qualified rural hospitals with under 50 beds was reinstated from July 1, 2010, to July 1, 2011. The CBO score ranges from -$50 million to +$50 million for FY2010-FY2014 and FY2010-FY2019. Extension of the Rural Community Hospital Demonstration Program is ongoing to test feasibility and advisability. The Rural Community Hospital Demonstration Program aims to test cost reimbursement for small rural hospitals in low population density areas. The program, currently with 10 participating hospitals, may be extended for five years with up to 30 hospitals and 20 states involved. Hospitals can continue participation unless they choose to opt out. The Medicare-Dependent Hospital (MDH) Program, which benefits small rural hospitals with a high Medicare patient population, is set to be extended for one year. MDHs receive higher payments under Medicare and must meet specific criteria to qualify for the program. The current sunset date for the MDH classification is September 30, 2011. The Medicare-Dependent Hospital (MDH) Program is set to be extended for one year until September 30, 2012. The CBO score ranges from -$50 million to +$50 million for FY2010-FY2014 and FY2010-FY2019. Sec. 3125 as modified by 10314 includes temporary improvements to the Medicare Inpatient Hospital Payment Adjustment for Low-Volume Hospitals, which are defined as acute care hospitals with less than 800 total discharges and located more than 25 road miles from another comparable hospital. The regulations provide a 25% payment increase for qualifying low-volume hospitals with less than 200 total discharges, located more than 25 road miles from another comparable hospital. A temporary adjustment would increase payment for certain low-volume hospitals in FY2011 and FY2012, with specific criteria for eligibility based on discharges and distance from other hospitals. The CBO score is $0.3 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.3 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Sec. 3126 authorizes a demonstration project for new healthcare delivery models in rural counties with specific population criteria. Eligible entities in states with low population density can participate in the project. The demonstration project for new healthcare delivery models in rural counties with specific population criteria allows up to 6 counties to participate. Eligible counties must have 6 or fewer residents per square mile, a critical access hospital providing specified services, and a daily inpatient census of 5 or less. The project starts on October 1, 2009, and is budget neutral. Rural health clinic services are no longer included, and physician services are added. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Sec. 3127 requires MedPAC to review payment adequacy for rural health care providers serving Medicare beneficiaries and submit a report to Congress by January 1, 2011. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Sec. 3128 relates to technical corrections for Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) in rural areas. Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) in rural areas have less than 25 acute care inpatient beds with a 96-hour average length of stay. They receive 101% reasonable, cost-based reimbursement for Medicare services. CAHs can opt for an all-inclusive outpatient payment equal to 101% of facility costs plus 115% of the Medicare physician fee schedule. Starting October 1, 2009, CMS will lower the facility payment to 100% of reasonable costs while professional services remain at 115% of the fee schedule amount. Medicare covers ambulance services from CAHs at 100% of reasonable costs. Medicare would pay for qualifying ambulance services provided by a CAH or by an entity owned and operated by a CAH at 101% of reasonable cost. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Sec. 3129 extends and revises the Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility Program, including a grant program administered by HRSA for small rural hospitals. The FLEX grant program, authorized at $55 million for each fiscal year from 2009 to 2010, would be extended until 2012. Grant funding starting January 1, 2010, could assist small rural hospitals in delivery system reforms. Protections for frontier states ensure a minimum area wage index for hospitals in sparsely populated areas. The provision would establish a floor of one on the practice expense index for physician services in frontier states, with a CBO score of $0.8 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $2.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Payment adjustments for home health care under a prospective payment system would be made based on 60-day episodes of care for beneficiaries. The Medicare Home Health Prospective Payment System (HH PPS) adjusts base payment amounts for patient care needs using HHRGs and outlier adjustments. Urban and rural base payments are currently the same. Refinements in CY2008 included a payment rate reduction to address coding-related case mix increases. The proposed rule for CY2010 continues a 2.75% reduction in HH PPS rates and implements a cap on outlier payments. Starting in CY2014, home health payments will be rebased as deemed appropriate by the Secretary. The Secretary may adjust health payments to reflect the number, mix, and intensity of home health services, considering differences between providers. A four-year phase-in period, ending in 2017, would limit adjustments to 3.5% per year. A provider-specific annual cap of 10% of revenues from outlier payments would be established starting in CY2011. The Secretary would provide a 3% add-on payment for home health providers serving rural areas between April 1, 2010, and January 1, 2016. MedPAC would conduct a study on the impact of this provision on access to care, quality outcomes, and different types of home health agencies. Recommendations for legislation and administrative action would be submitted to Congress by January 1, 2015. Additionally, the Secretary would study home health agency costs related to providing care to low-income Medicare beneficiaries and those in medically underserved areas. The Secretary could provide a four-year demonstration starting in 2015 to test payment adjustments for home health services for patients with high severity of illness or low-income Medicare beneficiaries. $500 million would be transferred from trust funds for this purpose, with funds available until expended. An evaluation would be conducted, and a report submitted to Congress. The CBO score for the project is -$4.2 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$39.7 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Sec. 3132 involves Hospice Reform, requiring certification of terminal illness for Medicare's hospice benefit. Medicare payments to hospices are fixed daily amounts based on different levels of care. The provision requires the Secretary to collect additional data for revising payments for hospice care by January 1, 2011. By October 1, 2013, budget neutral revisions to hospice payments methodology must be implemented, which could include per diem payments reflecting resource differences or end-of-episode payments. New requirements for hospice providers participating in Medicare would also be imposed, including the need for a hospice physician or advanced practice nurse starting January 1, 2011. The provision requires a face-to-face encounter for hospice eligibility and recertification, with visits over 180 days needing medical review by CMS. The CBO score ranges from -$50 million to +$50 million for FY2010-FY2014 and -0.1 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Medicare's DSH adjustment aims to compensate hospitals serving low-income patients for higher treatment costs. Medicare's DSH payments are distributed to hospitals based on patient days provided to poor Medicare or Medicaid patients. A 2007 MedPAC report found that three-quarters of the payments were not justified by higher patient care costs. Starting in FY2015, DSH payments would be reduced to 25% of the original amount. Starting in FY2015, DSH payments to acute care hospitals would be reduced to 25% of the original amount. In addition, an additional payment formula would be implemented based on factors such as the difference in uninsured population changes. Starting in FY2015, DSH payments to acute care hospitals would be reduced to 25% of the original amount. An additional payment formula would be implemented based on factors such as the difference in uninsured population changes. The Medicare physician fee schedule is based on assigning relative weights to each of the more than 7,000 physician service codes used to bill Medicare. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$25.1 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Sec. 3134 addresses misvalued codes under the Physician Fee Schedule. The resource-based relative value scale (RBRVS) is used by CMS to compare the value of physician services. CMS updates the fee schedule based on advice from the RUC, which can result in lower fees for some services due to budget neutrality. Evaluation and management codes have seen payment decreases compared to codes with increased RVUs and new technologies. The CMS periodically reviews RVUs for physician services to identify potentially misvalued services and make adjustments to the fee schedule. This includes examining codes with fast growth, changes in practice expenses, new technologies, low relative values, frequently billed services, and codes not reviewed since the implementation of RBRVS. The Secretary would review and adjust work relative value units under the fee schedule, repealing certain sections of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and the Social Security Act. This provision is estimated to have no impact on spending. The Medicare fee schedule reimburses for the technical and professional components separately. When both components are provided by one provider, a single global payment is made. CMS's method for calculating reimbursement rates for advanced imaging services assumes machines are operated 25 hours per week, leading to higher payments due to lower equipment use factor. MedPAC is recommending CMS to use a higher utilization rate of 65% for advanced imaging services, increasing to 75% by 2014. This change aims to improve efficiency in Medicare fee schedule payments by accounting for savings from sequential imaging services. The proposal aims to increase the technical component payment reduction for sequential imaging services on contiguous body parts during the same visit from 25% to 50%. By January 1, 2013, the CMS Chief Actuary would analyze if the expenditure reductions exceed $3 billion for the period 2010 through 2019. The CBO score is -$0.4 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$1.1 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Starting January 1, 2011, Medicare would restrict lump-sum payments for wheelchairs to only complex, rehabilitative power wheelchairs. The rental payment for power-driven wheelchairs would also change to 15% of the purchase price for the first three months and 6% for the remaining months. The rental payment for power-driven wheelchairs will be 15% of the purchase price for the first three months and 6% for the remaining months. The CBO score is -$0.6 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and - $0.8 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Sec. 3137 as modified by Sec. 10317 focuses on Hospital Wage Index Improvement, adjusting the standardized amount to account for local wage variation in hospital areas. The independent consulting firm is evaluating the impact of recommended changes for hospitals to reclassify from rural to urban areas. CMS raised the reclassification threshold in FY2010, and MGCRB hospital reclassifications are budget neutral. Section 508 of the MMA provided $900 million for a three-year geographic reclassification of certain hospitals. The Section 508 of the MMA provided $900 million for a three-year geographic reclassification of certain hospitals, extending reclassifications until September 30, 2010. The Secretary would use FY2010 wage index data and adjust payments for hospitals with lower wage indexes. The Secretary is required to provide a plan to Congress by December 31, 2011, for Medicare wage index system reform based on MedPAC recommendations. Reclassification thresholds for hospital reclassifications will be restored to FY2009 levels starting in FY2011. The provision will be budget neutral with a CBO score of $0.3 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and FY2010-FY2019. Treatment of Certain Cancer Hospitals: Eleven cancer hospitals are exempt from the IPPS and OPPS payment systems. Medicare pays for outpatient services using APC groups. A study will be conducted to compare outpatient costs for IPPS-exempt cancer hospitals with other hospitals under OPPS. If costs exceed, an adjustment will be made starting January 1, 2011. CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014. Starting January 1, 2011, Medicare Part B pays for biologics administered in physician offices and hospital outpatient departments. CMS assigns HCPCS codes to drugs, and payments are based on ASP. Brand-name and generic drugs with the same HCPCS code have prices averaged together. The provision allows reimbursement for a Part B biosimilar product at the ASP of the biosimilar plus 6% of the ASP of the reference product. This is based on the assumption of the enactment of Title VII of the bill, which expands FDA regulatory activities for biosimilars. The CBO score for this provision is -$0.1 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$7.1 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Additionally, there is a Medicare Hospice Concurrent Care Demonstration Program for terminally ill beneficiaries. The provision introduces a three-year Medicare Hospice Concurrent Care Demonstration Program for terminally ill beneficiaries, allowing them to receive all Medicare covered services in addition to hospice care. The program aims to improve patient care, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness. The CBO score ranges from -$50 million to +$50 million for FY2010-FY2014 and FY2010-FY2019. Additionally, there is a provision for applying Budget Neutrality on a national basis in the calculation of the Medicare Hospital Wage Index Floor for all urban and rural states. The wage index for urban areas in a state cannot be less than the rural wage index, known as the rural floor. CMS transitioned to fund the budget neutrality requirement through a state-specific adjustment starting in FY2009. States without hospitals receiving the rural floor wage index would not have reduced payments. The proposal aims to have a reduced payment for hospitals in urban areas with higher rural wage indexes, funded by affected hospitals. It includes a budget neutrality requirement on a national basis starting October 1, 2010. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Additionally, there is a study on Medicare dependent hospitals (MDHs) which are small rural hospitals with a high proportion of Medicare patients, receiving special treatment under Medicare's inpatient prospective payment system. Sole community hospitals (SCHs) and critical access hospitals (CAHs) receive special payment treatment under IPPS. IPPS includes adjustments like IME and DSH to compensate for higher costs. A study is required to assess the need for additional Medicare payments for urban Medicare-dependent hospitals under IPPS. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014. Sec. 3143 of the Senate bill protects home health benefits under title XVIII of the Social Security Act. Sec. 10325 revises the Skilled Nursing Facility Prospective Payment System, adjusting payments based on case mix and area wages. The 53-group RUG model maintains parity with the 44-group RUG model in a budget neutral manner. CMS established a revised case-mix classification methodology (RUG-IV) in the final rule published on August 11, 2009, to address changes made for FY2006. Changes include adjustments to the billing method for concurrent therapy. The final rule specifies that concurrent therapy time in a Part A SNF setting would no longer be counted as individual therapy time for each patient. CMS would require allocating concurrent therapy minutes among individual patients before reporting total therapy minutes on the MDS 3.0. The recalibration for FY2010 would result in a 1.1% decrease in Medicare payments to SNFs. Some providers may experience larger payment decreases due to case-mix utilization. The Secretary would be prohibited from implementing the RUG-IV system before October 1, 2011. Changes to therapy and lookback period for SNF case mix classification would be implemented starting October 1, 2010. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Medicare Advantage Payment allows private plans to provide Medicare-covered benefits to beneficiaries. Medicare Advantage (MA) plans provide Medicare-covered benefits to enrollees based on plan bids compared to a benchmark. Bids reflect revenue needed for services, with payments below the benchmark receiving a rebate. Benchmarks are determined by historical payment rates and adjusted annually. Enrollees may pay a premium if bids exceed the benchmark. Regional MA plans have benchmarks based on historical payments and plan bids. The benchmark amounts for Medicare Advantage plans are increased annually based on the growth in Medicare spending. Local MA plans choose the counties they serve, while regional plans must serve entire regions defined by the Secretary. MA organizations are required to have a quality improvement program, but payments are not tied to the quality of care. In 2011, the national MA per capita growth percentage used to increase benchmarks would be reduced by three percentage points. Starting in 2012, MA benchmarks would be phased in based on a weighted average. The bill would phase-in MA benchmarks based on a weighted average of plan bids starting in 2012. Local benchmarks would be determined by the enrollment weighted average of MA bids by 2015. MA plan rebates would increase from 75% to 100% of the difference between the bid and the benchmark starting in 2014. Bid information would need to be certified for bids submitted on or after January 1, 2012. The bill, submitted on or after January 1, 2012, would require bid information to be certified by a member of the American Academy of Actuaries. Starting in 2012, new MA payment areas based on Core Based Statistical Area (CBSA) would be established for urban areas. MA plans would be allowed to choose which payment areas to serve but would be required to bid and serve the entire payment area. Bonus payments for local and regional MA plans would be established in 2014, including a care coordination and management bonus and a quality bonus. The bill introduced bonus payments for MA plans in 2014, including a care coordination and management bonus and a quality bonus. Plans could earn bonuses based on specified percentages of national per capita monthly costs, with quality bonuses determined by a 5-star rating system. Plans with ratings of 3 stars or higher could receive bonuses up to 4% of national expenditures. Plans with lower ratings could still be eligible for a 1% quality bonus if their ratings improved. The bill introduced bonus payments for MA plans in 2014, including care coordination and management bonuses and quality bonuses based on a 5-star rating system. Plans with ratings of 3 stars or higher could receive bonuses up to 4% of national expenditures, while plans with lower ratings could still be eligible for a 1% quality bonus if their ratings improved. Additionally, MA plans would be allowed to grandfather extra benefits for current enrollees in certain areas with specific conditions and transitional rebates would be provided for enrollees experiencing a reduction in benefits due to competitive bidding. The bill introduced bonus payments for MA plans in 2014, including care coordination and management bonuses and quality bonuses based on a 5-star rating system. Plans with ratings of 3 stars or higher could receive bonuses up to 4% of national expenditures. MA plans in specific areas with certain conditions could retain extra benefits for current enrollees. Transitional rebates would be provided for enrollees facing benefit reductions due to competitive bidding. Total transitional benefits available would be $5 billion through 2019. The CBO score for the bill is -$34.4 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$118.1 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Beginning in 2011, MA plans would be prohibited from charging cost sharing greater than original Medicare for certain services like chemotherapy, renal dialysis, and skilled nursing care. In 2012, plans' ability to allocate rebates and bonuses would be restricted, with priority given to reducing cost sharing, covering preventive benefits, and other non-Medicare benefits. Plans cannot reduce or eliminate Part B premiums as an additional benefit. MA plans would be prohibited from reducing or eliminating the Part B premium as an additional benefit. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Medicare payments to MA plans are risk-adjusted to account for the variation in the cost of providing care. The bill would require the Secretary to conduct an analysis of the differences in coding patterns between MA and original Medicare and incorporate the results into risk scores for 2011, 2012, and 2013. The bill requires the Secretary to analyze coding patterns between MA and original Medicare and use the results to calculate risk scores for 2011-2013. The CBO score is -$0.7 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and - $0.7 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Changes to Medicare enrollment periods include shifting the annual election period to October 15-December 7 starting in 2011. The bill from October 15 through December 7, 2011, would restrict beneficiaries from changing MA plans or joining an MA plan after the benefit year begins. However, beneficiaries could switch to original Medicare during the first 45 days of the new benefit year and enroll in a Part D drug plan. The CBO estimates a financial impact of between -$50 million and +$50 million for FY2010-FY2014 and FY2010-FY2019. Additionally, there is an extension for Specialized MA Plans for Special Needs Individuals. The bill extends Special Needs Plans (SNPs) authority through December 31, 2013, targeting enrollment for institutionalized, dually eligible, and individuals with severe chronic conditions. The Secretary would establish a frailty payment adjustment for fully-integrated dual-eligible SNPs. Fully-integrated plans would be exempt from the IME payment phase-out and SNPs without Medicaid contracts can continue operating until the end of 2012 without expansion. The proposal aims to transition SNP beneficiaries who do not qualify as special needs individuals to fee-for-service Medicare and other MA plans. SNPs would need approval from the National Committee for Quality Assurance to serve targeted populations starting in 2012. The Secretary would periodically evaluate and revise the MA risk adjustment payment methodology to recalibrate payments for higher medical and care coordination costs for specified conditions. The CBO score is $0.7 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.9 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Sec. 3206 extends Reasonable Cost Contracts. Sec. 3206 extends Reasonable Cost Contracts for Medicare Advantage plans, allowing them to operate indefinitely unless two other plans of the same type are offered in the service area for the entire year. The phase-out of these contracts has been delayed through Congressional action. The Secretary may not renew a reasonable cost contract if two or more MA plans are already operating in the service area. The bill extends the operation of reasonable cost plans for three years, allowing them to continue regardless of other MA plans in the area. The CBO score ranges from -$50 million to +$50 million for FY2010-FY2014 and FY2010-FY2019. Additionally, MA coordinated care plans must meet medical access requirements by forming networks of contracted providers. Starting in 2011, PFFS plans sponsored by employers or unions must establish contracted networks of providers to meet access requirements. Non-employer sponsored MA PFFS plans are required to establish contracted networks of providers in \"network areas\" defined as areas with at least two network-based plans. In areas without at least two network-based plans, non-employer PFFS plans can establish access requirements through payment rates not less than those under original Medicare. Employer-based PFFS plans with enrollment as of October 1, 2009 may be granted a waiver from network requirements. The waiver from network requirements for MA plans was granted to employer-based PFFS plans with enrollment as of October 1, 2009. This waiver allows plans to target smaller areas of healthier, low-cost enrollees, such as residents of retirement communities. The CBO score for this waiver is $0.1 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.1 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Additionally, the bill creates a new type of MA plan called an MA Senior Housing Facility Demonstration, effective January 1, 2010. Effective January 1, 2010, a new MA plan called an MA Senior Housing Facility Plan would be created, allowing service area limitations to senior housing facilities. This plan serves beneficiaries in continuing care retirement communities with on-site primary care providers, transportation benefits, and at least one year of existence under a demonstration. The Secretary has authority to negotiate bids submitted by MA plans, similar to negotiations with plans in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. The Secretary has the authority to negotiate bids from MA plans in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. Private Fee-for-Service MA plans are excluded from negotiations. Starting January 1, 2011, the Secretary is not obligated to accept every bid from MA or Part D plans. Additionally, new standards for certain Medigap plans are being developed to provide coverage for Medicare deductibles, coinsurance, and some services not covered by Medicare. The law includes standardized plans (Plan \"A\" through Plan \"L\") with coverage for items not covered by Medicare. NAIC establishes minimum standards, with new model plans for C and F in 2015 to encourage Part B physician services. CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$0.1 billion for FY2010-FY2019. The MA Regional Plan Stabilization Fund, initially set at $10 billion, was created to support plans in the MA Regional Program. However, subsequent legislation reduced the fund to one dollar and delayed its availability until 2014. The current bill aims to eliminate the Fund and transfer its amounts to the Part B Trust Fund. The CBO score is -$0.1 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$0.2 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Subtitle D\u2014Medicare Part D Improvements for Prescription Drug Plans and MA-PD Plans Sec. 3301 introduces the Medicare Coverage Gap Discount Program for Brand-Name Drugs, which involves a voluntary agreement with PhRMA to provide 50% discounts on brand-name drugs for Part D enrollees in the coverage gap. Manufacturers would offer discounts to plan sponsors, with the discount amount counting towards plan enrollees' costs. Low-income subsidy recipients and those with higher incomes would also benefit from this program. Incomes exceeding Part B income thresholds ($85,000 for singles, $170,000 for couples in 2009) are not eligible for discounts. Drugs sold in the U.S. by a manufacturer must participate in the discount program to be covered under Part D. A third party entity will administer the program with performance requirements. Effective July 1, 2010, the provision is expected to save $5.8 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $17.8 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Part D premiums for low-income subsidy beneficiaries enrolled in benchmark plans are calculated based on basic Part D coverage with premiums equal to or lower than the regional low-income premium subsidy amount. MA plans offering prescription drug coverage may use rebate payments to lower the Part D premium, potentially reducing the number of plans that qualify as low-income plans. The provision aims to exclude Medicare Advantage rebate amounts from premium bids when calculating low-income regional benchmarks for subsidy determinations. It would take effect in 2011 and is projected to save $0.3 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.7 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Additionally, a voluntary policy starting in 2011 would allow plans to absorb small differences between their bids and the benchmark to qualify as LIS-eligible plans. The Secretary would have discretion to auto-enroll LIS beneficiaries into plans with small differences between bids and benchmarks to maintain LIS plan choices. A de minimus threshold amount would be set by the Secretary. The CBO score is +$0.1 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and +$0.4 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Sec. 3304 establishes a special rule for widows and widowers regarding eligibility for low-income assistance under the Part D LIS program. Each year, the Secretary conducts a review process to determine continued eligibility for those who automatically qualified for the full subsidy in the previous year. The agency responsible for monitoring subsidy eligibility requires a redetermination in case of events like marriage, divorce, or death of a spouse. This can lead to changes in deductible, premium, and subsidy status, or even termination of LIS eligibility. The death of a spouse may result in the surviving spouse no longer qualifying for the LIS program due to exceeding resource limits. The proposal suggests that surviving spouses of LIS-eligible couples undergo a redetermination of eligibility status one year after the death of a spouse. This would align them with other LIS-eligible beneficiaries. The CBO estimates a positive impact on the budget. Additionally, there are improvements in information for subsidy eligible individuals reassigned to Prescription Drug Plans and MA-PD Plans. The proposal involves reassigned LIS beneficiaries to new plans with bids at or below regional benchmark amounts to maintain premium subsidies. Beneficiaries may experience differences in plan coverage and drug formularies. The Secretary is required to provide information on formulary variances within 30 days of reassignment. The proposal involves reassigning LIS beneficiaries to new plans with bids at or below regional benchmark amounts to maintain premium subsidies. Beneficiaries may experience differences in plan coverage and drug formularies. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Funding Outreach and Assistance for Low-Income Programs includes $25 million for beneficiary outreach and education activities related to low-income programs. This provision would extend MIPPA Section 119 and provide an additional $45 million for outreach and education activities related to Medicare low-income assistance programs. The proposal involves reassigning LIS beneficiaries to new plans with bids at or below regional benchmark amounts to maintain premium subsidies. Beneficiaries may experience differences in plan coverage and drug formularies. Funding Outreach and Assistance for Low-Income Programs includes $25 million for beneficiary outreach and education activities related to low-income programs. An additional $45 million would be allocated for outreach and education activities related to Medicare low-income assistance programs, with funds available through 2012. The Secretary would have the authority to enlist support for outreach activities aimed at preventing disease and promoting wellness. The CBO score is between -$50 million and +$50 million for FY2010-FY2014 and FY2010-FY2019. Sec. 3307 focuses on improving formulary requirements for Prescription Drug Plans and MA-PD Plans with respect to certain categories or classes of drugs. The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 requires Part D plans to cover drugs within each therapeutic category and class, with a minimum of two drugs in each. Certain drug classes like immunosuppressant and antidepressant must be fully covered. The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 further specified drug classes to be protected by Part D plans. The proposal aims to protect certain categories of drugs under Part D plans to ensure beneficiary access to various therapies. The Secretary would identify classes of clinical concern, which PDP sponsors must include in their formularies. The bill would remove criteria for identifying protected drug classes and be effective for the 2011 plan year. The CBO score is $0.0 billion. The provision aims to protect certain drug classes under Part D plans for beneficiary access to therapies. It would be effective for the 2011 plan year with a CBO score of $0.0 billion. High-income beneficiaries are required to pay higher premiums for Part B benefits based on income thresholds, but Part D premiums are not means-tested. The provision in Sec. 3309 eliminates cost-sharing for certain dual eligible individuals in Part D plans, linking cost-sharing subsidies for LIS enrollees to standard prescription drug coverage. Full-subsidy eligibles have no deductible and minimal cost-sharing during the initial coverage period and coverage gap. The CBO score is -$2.4 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$10.7 billion for FY2010-FY2019. The provision in Sec. 3310 aims to reduce wasteful dispensing of outpatient prescription drugs in long-term care facilities under Prescription Drug Plans and MA-PD Plans by requiring Part D plans to offer contracts to pharmacies meeting certain criteria. The CBO score is +$0.3 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and +$1.1 billion for FY2010-FY2019. The provision requires Part D plans to offer contracts to pharmacies meeting specific criteria for long-term care facilities. Plan formularies must meet residents' needs and cover all necessary medications. Dispensing practices may result in medication waste, prompting the use of utilization management techniques by sponsors from January 1, 2012. Utilization management techniques are employed to reduce medication waste for beneficiaries in long-term care facilities by dispensing medications in smaller quantities per fill. This could involve weekly, daily, or automated dose dispensing. The CBO estimates savings of -$1.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$5.7 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Additionally, a centralized complaints system tracks and resolves Part D and Medicare Advantage related complaints within CMS, while plan sponsors handle grievances independently. The provision requires the Secretary to develop a user-friendly system to handle complaints about Medicare Advantage and Part D plans. This system would report complaints, initiate interventions, and guide quality improvement. Complaints can be received through various means and a model electronic complaint form would be available on relevant websites. The Secretary is required to develop a complaint system for Medicare Advantage and Part D plans, with annual reports analyzing complaints. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Additionally, there are uniform exceptions and appeals processes for Prescription Drug Plans and MA-PD Plans outlined in the Social Security Act. The provision requires a single, uniform exceptions and appeals process for prescription drug coverage in MA and Part D plans, with instant access through a toll-free number and website. Auto-enrollment of dual-eligible individuals into Part D plans by CMS may not always align with their needs due to plan formulary variations. The proposal aims to ensure that Medicare Part D plans are obtaining price concessions on drugs to reduce costs for the government and beneficiaries. It would require the Office of Inspector General to report on formularies used by prescription drug plans and compare drug prices under Part D to those negotiated by state Medicaid plans. The proposal aims to compare drug prices under Medicare Part D to those negotiated by state Medicaid plans for the top 200 drugs. The report would not disclose proprietary information and the CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Additionally, the proposal includes costs incurred by AIDS Drug Assistance Programs and Indian Health Service towards the annual out-of-pocket threshold under Part D. The proposal includes costs incurred by AIDS Drug Assistance Programs and Indian Health Service towards the annual out-of-pocket threshold under Part D, with costs counted as incurred only if paid by the individual or on their behalf. Additional payments not counting towards the threshold include Part D premiums and coverage by other insurance. The CBO score is +$0.2 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and +$0.6 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Immediate Reduction in Coverage Gap in 2010. Medicare law establishes a standard benefit structure for Part D prescription drug coverage, including a coverage gap. In 2010, the standard benefit includes a $310 deductible and 25% coinsurance until reaching $2,830 in drug spending. After reaching this limit, the enrollee is responsible for full drug costs until hitting the catastrophic threshold of $6,440. A proposed increase of $500 to the initial coverage limit would reduce the time spent in the coverage gap for Part D enrollees in 2010. Premiums, bids, and other parameters would remain unchanged, with the Secretary required to establish procedures for reimbursing drug plan sponsors for the reduction in beneficiary cost sharing. The Secretary would develop an estimate of increased costs for drug utilization and adjust payments to Part D sponsors. The initial coverage limit for 2010 would be increased by $500 to reduce time in the coverage gap. The CBO score is +$5.8 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and +$17.8 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Additionally, Part D sponsors are required to incorporate Medication Therapy Management Programs into their plan benefit structures. The MTM program aims to optimize therapeutic outcomes and reduce adverse events for targeted beneficiaries with multiple chronic diseases. It includes elements to improve medication use and adherence, developed in collaboration with pharmacists and physicians. Part D sponsors must provide an annual comprehensive medication review by a licensed pharmacist or qualified provider, along with follow-up interventions. The MTM program requires annual medication reviews by a licensed pharmacist for targeted beneficiaries with chronic diseases. The plan sponsor must also assess medication use quarterly for at-risk individuals and have a process for automatic enrollment in the program. The Secretary of HHS can modify requirements and study new MTM models. Subtitle E\u2014Ensuring Medicare Sustainability Sec. 3401 as modified by Sec. 10319 and Sec. 10322 revises market basket updates for fee-for-service Medicare providers to reflect unit cost increases in health care services. Medicare's annual updates are linked to changes in market basket indices to account for inflation on providers' costs per service. The provision revises market basket updates for Medicare providers to reflect inflation on costs per service. Updates are based on the MB or CPI minus productivity estimates for Parts A and B providers. Full productivity adjustments would be implemented for various healthcare services starting in FY2012. The proposal includes full productivity adjustments for hospice providers starting in FY2013 and for home health providers starting in FY2015. It also replaces the 0.5% payment reduction for clinical laboratory test fee schedule providers with a full productivity adjustment for CY2011 and beyond. Update adjustments may result in lower payment than the previous year for Medicare providers and suppliers. The MB update for acute care inpatient services and outpatient hospital services would be reduced by 0.25 percentage points in FY2010 and FY2011, and by 0.1 percentage points in FY2012 and FY2013. From FY2014 to FY2019, a 0.2 percentage point reduction would be contingent on the level of the insured nonelderly population relative to projections. If the non-elderly insured population is within 5 percentage points of projections, the MB update would be reduced by 0.2 percentage points. The IPF update would also be subject to a 0.2 percentage point reduction. The LTCH update would be reduced by 0.25 percentage points in RY2010 and 0.5 percentage points in RY2011, with a 0.1 percentage point reduction in RY2012 and RY2013. The LTCH MB update would be subject to a 0.2 percentage point reduction from RY2014 to RY2019 based on the insured nonelderly population. Skilled nursing facilities would face a productivity factor adjustment starting in FY2012. Home health services would see a 1.0 percentage point reduction in MB update in 2011, 2012, and 2013, with a productivity factor adjustment beginning in 2015. Hospice care would also be subject to a productivity factor adjustment. The hospice MB update would be subject to the productivity factor adjustment starting in FY2013, with a 0.3 percentage point reduction in FY2013. For FY2014 through FY2019, a 0.3 percentage point reduction would be based on the insured population levels. The ESRD MB would no longer have a 1 percentage point reduction in 2012, but would face productivity factor adjustments. Ambulance and ambulatory surgical services would have productivity adjustments applied to their fee schedules starting in CY2011. In CY2011, there would be a reduction in the update for laboratory services and certain durable medical equipment. The productivity adjustment factor would be applied to the CPI-U for ambulatory surgical services. Certain DME would no longer receive a 2 percentage point increase in CY2014. The productivity adjustment factor would be applied to the CPI-U update for DME category starting in CY2011. CBO score is -$23.5 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$146.7 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Sec. 3402 involves a temporary adjustment to the calculation of Part B premiums in Medicare. In 2009, higher-income Medicare beneficiaries faced increasing premium costs based on income thresholds. The provision would freeze income thresholds at 2010 levels from 2011 to 2019. The CBO score is -$7.5 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$25.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Sec. 3403 establishes an Independent Medicare Advisory Board to propose Medicare spending reductions. The Independent Medicare Advisory Board would consist of 15 members appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate to develop proposals to reduce Medicare spending. Proposals would focus on payments to MA and PDP plans and reimbursement rates for certain providers, with specific savings targets to meet. Recommendations made by the Board would automatically go into effect unless Congress enacted legislation to prevent their implementation, starting in 2015. The Independent Medicare Advisory Board would consist of 15 members appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Members would serve six-year staggered terms, with a limit of 2 consecutive terms. Recommendations made by the Board would automatically go into effect unless Congress intervened. The Board would also include ex-officio, non-voting members from relevant healthcare agencies. The Independent Medicare Advisory Board would have 15 members appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Qualifications for membership would be similar to those required for MedPAC members, with restrictions on individuals involved in healthcare services. Members must disclose conflicts of interest and not engage in other business activities. Former members are prohibited from lobbying relevant entities for one year. The Chair would have significant responsibilities. The Independent Medicare Advisory Board, with 15 members appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, would have the Chair responsible for executive functions and fund usage. Proposals must be submitted to the President when Medicare spending growth exceeds target rates, with the first proposal due by January 15, 2014. If the Board fails to submit a proposal, the Secretary must submit a contingent proposal to Congress. The Independent Medicare Advisory Board must submit proposals to reduce Medicare spending when growth exceeds target rates. The Secretary would submit a contingent proposal to Congress if the Board fails to do so. Starting in 2018, proposals are required only when spending growth exceeds GDP plus 1.0%. Recommendations must reduce spending by specified percentage points or the amount by which growth exceeds the target rate. The Senate bill outlines specific criteria for the Independent Medicare Advisory Board to follow when submitting proposals to control Medicare spending growth. Proposals must prioritize extending Medicare solvency, improving the healthcare delivery system, and protecting beneficiary access to care. The Board must also consider the impact of changes in provider payments on beneficiaries and providers with negative profit margins. The Independent Medicare Advisory Board must consider the effects of proposals on providers with negative profit margins, prioritize extending Medicare solvency, and include recommendations for administrative funding. Proposals should aim to reduce spending in Medicare Parts C and D by cutting administrative expenses, denying high bids for drug coverage, and reducing performance bonuses for MA plans. The Board is prohibited from making recommendations that ration care, raise revenues, increase beneficiary premiums, or restrict benefits. The Independent Medicare Advisory Board is tasked with considering the effects of proposals on providers with negative profit margins, prioritizing extending Medicare solvency, and including recommendations for administrative funding. Proposals should aim to reduce spending in Medicare Parts C and D by cutting administrative expenses, denying high bids for drug coverage, and reducing performance bonuses for MA plans. The Board is prohibited from making recommendations that ration care, raise revenues, increase beneficiary premiums, restrict benefits, or modify eligibility. Recommendations are submitted to the President and then to Congress for consideration and automatic implementation unless Congress acts by a specified deadline. The Senate bill establishes special \"fast track\" procedures for congressional consideration of the Independent Medicare Advisory Board's recommendations, ensuring quick action on the proposal. Legislation implementing the Board's recommendations must be introduced by the House and Senate majority leaders on the day it is submitted to Congress and referred to specific committees for review. The Senate bill establishes expedited procedures for congressional consideration of the Independent Medicare Advisory Board's recommendations, allowing for quick action on the proposal. The bill includes provisions to restrict any amendments or changes to the Board's recommendations unless they meet specific fiscal and policy criteria. The Senate bill establishes expedited procedures for congressional consideration of the Independent Medicare Advisory Board's recommendations, with restrictions on amendments and a requirement for three-fifths vote to waive restrictions. Amendments in the Senate must be germane and not reduce Medicare savings targets, with limited debate time and overall consideration not exceeding 30 hours. The Senate bill includes \"fast track\" provisions for limited debate and final votes on legislation, with additional procedures for discontinuing the Independent Medicare Advisory Board. The Senate bill includes \"fast track\" provisions for limited debate and final votes on legislation, with a supermajority requirement for passage of joint resolutions. The Secretary must implement the Board's recommendations by August 15 of the submission year, with payment rate changes taking effect in the following fiscal, calendar, or rate year. Starting in 2019, the Secretary is prohibited from implementing recommendations if certain conditions are met. The Board must submit draft proposals to MedPAC and the Secretary for review. Starting in 2014, the Board must provide advisory reports to Congress on Medicare program matters. Recommendations to slow the growth rate must be submitted to Congress and the President starting in 2015. The Board will submit advisory recommendations to Congress and the President to slow the growth rate in NHE. Recommendations cannot target federal health care program expenditures and must be coordinated with other Board proposals. Recommendations must be made public and can be implemented administratively or legislatively. Funding of $15 million will be provided to the Board annually, increasing with inflation. Oversight mechanisms will be established. The provision establishes a consumer advisory council to advise the Board on payment policies' impact on consumers. The council includes 10 consumer representatives appointed by the Comptroller General. The GAO will conduct a study on Medicare payment policy changes resulting from the Board's proposal, assessing effects on access, affordability, quality of care, and more. The report is due by July 1, 2015. Subtitle G\u2014Protecting and Improving Guaranteed Medicare Benefits requires that no provisions in the Senate bill can reduce Medicare benefits currently guaranteed under Title XVIII. Medicare savings achieved under the bill must be used to extend Medicare trust fund solvency, reduce premiums, improve benefits, and protect access to providers. Amendment 2826 also ensures that MA plans continue to provide all Medicare covered benefits. The Senate bill prohibits any reduction or elimination of benefits guaranteed by law to Medicare Advantage plan participants. Medicare covers an initial preventive physical examination for health promotion and disease detection within one year of Medicare Part B enrollment. Routine health examinations are not covered by Medicare. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) provides evidence-based recommendations for preventive services, grading them as A, B, C, D, or I. Grades A and B are recommended, C has no specific recommendation, D is not recommended for asymptomatic patients, and I statements are provided for services where evidence is insufficient. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) grades preventive services as A, B, C, D, or I. Grades A and B are recommended, C has no specific recommendation, D is not recommended for asymptomatic patients, and I statements are provided when evidence is insufficient. A proposed amendment would require Medicare Part B to cover personalized prevention plan services without cost sharing, including a health risk assessment and preventive screenings for enrolled beneficiaries annually. The Secretary would develop guidance for personalized prevention plan services and health risk assessments, included in Medicare's covered preventive services. The CBO estimates costs at $1.4 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $3.6 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Section 4104 aims to remove barriers to preventive services in Medicare by amending coinsurance and deductible requirements. The provision would amend Medicare to cover preventive services without coinsurance, including colorectal cancer screening and personalized prevention plan services. Coverage would be subject to current criteria for each service. The provision would authorize the Secretary to modify coverage of preventive services recommended by USPSTF, waiving deductibles for certain services. CBO estimates a cost of $0.3 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.8 billion for FY2010-FY2019. The provision allows the Secretary to modify coverage of preventive services recommended by USPSTF, withholding payment for services graded D. The CBO estimates a cost of -$0.3 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$0.7 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Subtitle C involves a Medicare Demonstration for promoting healthy lifestyles through community-based programs for Medicare beneficiaries. The evaluation for self-management of Medicare beneficiaries includes an evidence review and assessment of community prevention programs. $50 million would be transferred to CMS for funding. A GAO study on vaccine coverage under Medicare Part D for beneficiaries aged 65+ is required. Title V\u2014Health Care Workforce Subtitle F\u2014Strengthening Primary Care and Other Workforce Improvements Sec. 5501. Expanding Access to Primary Care Services and General Surgery Services. Medicare reimburses physicians using a fee schedule, with additional payments for targeted activities like quality achievements and practicing in underserved areas. Bonus payments are provided under Section 1833(m) of the Social Security Act for physicians in geographic areas with medical care shortages. The Health Resources and Services Administration designates bonus payments for physicians in primary care health professional shortage areas under the Medicare fee schedule. The bonus equals 10% of the fee schedule payment and applies to select evaluation & management and general surgery codes for five years starting January 1, 2011. Primary care practitioners eligible for the bonus include physicians with specialties in family medicine, internal medicine, geriatric medicine, or pediatric medicine, as well as nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, and physician assistants. Practitioners providing major surgical procedures in health professional shortage areas would be eligible for a 10% bonus on select codes for five years starting January 1, 2011. General surgeons in HPSAs would also qualify for the bonus. RVUs would be adjusted to account for these incentives, with only half of the bonus cost factored into budget neutrality calculations. The CBO score for the modification of the conversion factor is $2.5 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $3.5 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Medicare Federally Qualified Health Center Improvements focus on FQHCs providing various healthcare services in designated areas. Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) provide a range of healthcare services, including nurse midwives, visiting nurses, clinical psychologists, and social workers. They receive cost-based reimbursement from Medicare, with payment limits and productivity standards. Medicare pays FQHCs on an interim basis using an all-inclusive rate per visit, with final payment rates calculated based on total allowable costs divided by total visits. Payment limits are adjusted annually by the Medicare Economic Index and vary for urban and rural FQHCs. The upper payment limit per visit for urban FQHCs is $119.29 starting January 1, 2009, through December 31, 2009, and for rural FQHCs is $102.58 effective January 1, 2009. FQHC services would include Medicare's definition of preventive services, screening, preventive services, initial preventive physical examination, and personalized prevention plan services. The Secretary would develop a prospective payment system for FQHC services. The implementation of a Prospective Payment System (PPS) for FQHC services would begin on October 1, 2014. The system aims to ensure expenditures are 103% of prior spending levels. Payment rates would be increased annually. A new payment system would establish rates for specific codes based on services provided. FQHCs must submit necessary data by January 1, 2011. FQHCs must submit data by January 1, 2011 for the new payment system starting on October 1, 2014. Initial payments equal 100% of reasonable costs without limits. Payment rates increase annually by MEI or MB. Program payments are at 80% of actual charge or PPS amount. Medicare payments for FQHC services no longer subject to reasonableness tests. Physicians are limited in referring Medicare patients for certain services to facilities where they have financial interests, with exceptions for whole hospitals and providers in rural areas. Physician-owned hospitals meeting specific requirements would be exempt from this limitation. Physician-owned hospitals meeting certain requirements would be exempt from the prohibition on self-referral, with limitations on facility expansion and patient safety measures. Existing hospitals with physician ownership and provider agreements before August 1, 2010, would be exempt from the ban, but could not increase their licensed capacity. Regulations would allow for hospital expansion by February 1, 2011, with specific criteria to be met. The provision allows physician-owned hospitals to expand their facilities on the main campus once every two years, with no administrative or judicial review. The Secretary must establish compliance policies, including unannounced site reviews starting from May 1, 2012. The CBO score is -$0.1 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$0.5 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Additionally, a new section 1128G would require manufacturers to report payments to physicians or teaching hospitals. Physician-owned hospitals can expand facilities on the main campus every two years without review. Manufacturers must report payments to physicians or teaching hospitals to the Secretary of HHS. Certain exclusions apply, including payments under $10 unless annual total exceeds $100. Penalties for non-compliance. The Secretary would establish procedures for public availability of information submitted under this section. CBO scores are $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Section 6003 amends the Social Security Act to allow physician referrals for certain imaging services under specific conditions. The bill requires referring physicians to inform patients in writing that they have the option to obtain designated health services from other providers. A list of suppliers in the area must be provided to the patient. The CBO score for the bill is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Authorized distributors of applicable drugs must submit annually to the Secretary of Department of Health and Human Services the identity and quantity of drug samples requested and distributed under the Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987. This submission must include information on the practitioner making the request and any other relevant details determined by the Secretary. The bill also includes Pharmacy Benefit Managers Transparency Requirements for companies administering drug benefit programs. Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) are required to share financial information with the Secretary of HHS, Medicare Part D plans, or exchanges. This includes disclosing information on prescription percentages from retail and mail-order pharmacies, as well as generic dispensing rates. Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) must share financial information with the Secretary of HHS, Medicare Part D plans, or exchanges, including prescription percentages from different types of pharmacies and generic dispensing rates. The information is considered confidential and protected. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Subtitle D\u2014Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Sec. 6301. Patient-Centered Outcomes Research as modified by Sec. 10602. Patient-Centered Outcomes Research, also known as comparative effectiveness research (CER), aims to provide credible information on the best clinical strategies for individual patients. It involves comparing the benefits and harms of different methods to prevent, diagnose, treat, and monitor clinical conditions. CER helps tailor decisions to meet the needs of patients. Comparative effectiveness research, also known as patient-centered outcomes research, compares the clinical effectiveness of various medical interventions. Legislation such as the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 support research on outcomes, clinical effectiveness, and appropriateness of healthcare services. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated $1.1 billion for Comparative Clinical Effectiveness Research (CCER) and established the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to conduct research on healthcare effectiveness. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute aims to improve health decisions through research on preventing, diagnosing, treating, and managing diseases. Its duties include setting research priorities, collecting data, appointing advisory panels, and releasing research findings. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute would establish a Board of Governors responsible for its duties, with members appointed by the Comptroller General of the United States representing various stakeholders. The proposal includes limitations on the use of CCER. The proposal for the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute includes limitations on the use of CCER, ensuring that the Institute cannot mandate coverage or reimbursement policies for payers. The Secretary can only use CCER research for Medicare coverage determinations if the process is transparent and considers the impact on subpopulations. CCER evidence cannot be used to discourage individuals from choosing healthcare treatments. The proposal for the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute includes limitations on the use of CCER, ensuring that the Institute cannot mandate coverage or reimbursement policies for payers. A new trust fund, the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (PCORTF), would be created to fund the Institute and its activities. Monies would be directed to this fund from various sources including the general fund of the Treasury, Medicare Trust Funds, and fees imposed on health insurance and self-insured plans. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (PCORTF) would receive funding from various sources including the general fund of the Treasury, Medicare Trust Funds, and fees on health insurance and self-insured plans. The funding amounts would vary from $10 million to $150 million in different years, with additional transfers from the Treasury and fees on health plans from 2013 onwards. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (PCORTF) would receive funding from various sources including the general fund of the Treasury, Medicare Trust Funds, and fees on health insurance and self-insured plans. The funding amounts would vary from $10 million to $150 million in different years, with additional transfers from the Treasury and fees on health plans from 2013 onwards. A fee on each health insurance policy in the United States multiplied by the number of lives covered under that policy would be imposed, adjusted for health care spending increases, with exemptions for policies providing non-health benefits. The fee would sunset after FY2019. The CBO score indicates an increase of $100 million for the five-year period from FY2010-FY2014 and a decrease of $300 million for the ten-year period FY2010-FY2019. Subtitle E\u2014Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP Program Integrity Provisions Sec. 6401 as modified by Sec. 10603 would establish procedures for screening providers and suppliers enrolling in Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP. The Secretary, in collaboration with the OIG, would establish screening procedures for providers enrolling in Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP programs. These procedures would include enhanced oversight, disclosure requirements, moratoriums on enrollment, and compliance program development. The Secretary would have six months to develop the procedures and three years to implement them. Screening levels would be determined based on fraud risk, with all providers subject to licensure checks and potential additional measures like criminal background checks and site visits. The proposal includes screening procedures for providers enrolling in Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP programs, with fees starting at $500 for institutional providers. The Secretary could exempt fees in cases of hardship and impose a temporary moratorium on enrolling new providers if necessary. New disclosure requirements would be imposed on applicants, who must disclose affiliations with providers or suppliers with certain negative histories. The provision in Sec. 6402 of the proposal enhances Medicare and Medicaid program integrity by requiring providers to establish compliance programs, giving the Secretary authority to adjust payments or deny enrollment based on affiliations posing risks, and mandating data matching in the IDR with claims and payment data from various programs. The CBO estimates a cost of -$50 million to +$50 million for FY2010-FY2014 and -$0.1 billion for FY2010-FY2019. The proposal aims to integrate data from various health-related programs like Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, VA, DOD, Social Security, and IHS for fraud detection. It grants access to OIG and DOJ for conducting oversight activities and obtaining necessary information from healthcare providers. The provision grants the OIG and DOJ explicit access to Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP payment and claims data for law enforcement and oversight activities. It also allows the OIG to obtain information from individuals providing medical services payable by a Federal health care program. Health care providers must repay overpayments to CMS within 30 days. Failure to do so may result in interest and collection by offset. Providers must report and return overpayments within 60 days. The National Provider Identifier (NPI) is a unique identifier required for all health care providers. The National Provider Identifier (NPI) is required for all health care providers under HIPAA since May 2007. A regulation by January 1, 2011 mandated Medicare and Medicaid providers to include their NPI on all claims and enrollment applications. States must operate an automated claims processing system to administer their state plans, capable of providing timely and accurate data. The Secretary has the authority to withhold federal matching payments to states for medical assistance expenditures if requirements are not met. The provision allows HHS OIG to exclude healthcare providers from federal programs for false statements. It applies to MA, PDP, and Medicaid managed care plans. Civil Monetary Penalties can be imposed on individuals under Section 1128A (a) of the SSA. The provision allows HHS OIG to impose Civil Monetary Penalties (CMPs) on individuals engaging in improper conduct with federal health care programs. CMPs can be up to $10,000 for each false claim submitted, $15,000 or $50,000 under other circumstances, and an assessment of up to three times the amount claimed. The provision also includes actions subject to CMPs such as individuals excluded from federal health care programs who order or prescribe items or services, make false statements on enrollment applications, bids, or contracts, or fail to return overpayments, with a CMP of $50,000. The testimonial subpoena authority grants the power to issue subpoenas, require witness testimony, and produce evidence related to investigations. The Secretary can delegate this authority to the OIG and CMS Administrator for exclusion investigations. DME suppliers must provide a $50,000 surety bond to bill Medicare. The Secretary can impose similar requirements on other providers. The Secretary has the authority to impose surety bond requirements on Part A and B providers and suppliers, excluding physicians. Home health agencies must provide a surety bond equal to 10% of Medicare and Medicaid payments or $50,000, effective for four years. The Secretary can require providers to provide bonds based on billing volume, with a minimum of $50,000. Payment suspensions can be imposed by CMS for overpayments or fraud. The Secretary has the authority to suspend payments to providers or suppliers pending a fraud investigation, funded by the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control (HCFAC) account established by HIPAA. This account funds programs to fight health care fraud, waste, and abuse. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act extended funding for the HCFAC program until 2010, but not for the MIP program. A provision was made to allocate an additional $10 million annually to the HCFAC program from 2011 to 2020, with funds available until expended. The CPI adjustment was applied to both the MIP and HCFAC programs starting in 2011, and the Secretary was authorized to enter contracts to promote Medicare program integrity. The Medicare Integrity Program (MIP) contracts with private entities to protect Medicare from fraud, waste, and abuse. The Medicaid Integrity Program (MIP) is modeled after Medicare's program and aims to reduce fraud, waste, and abuse in Medicaid. Both programs require contractors to provide performance statistics to the Secretary and the OIG. The Secretary is required to report performance statistics to the OIG, including overpayments recovered and fraud referrals. Evaluations of eligible entities must be conducted every three years. A report on MIP funds' use and effectiveness must be submitted to Congress within six months after the fiscal year. The CBO score is -$1.3 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$3.2 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Additionally, the Secretary must develop a plan and budget to modernize CMS computer and data systems to support care delivery improvements. The Secretary is required to develop a plan to provide timely support to providers and suppliers for better care coordination. The plan must be posted on the CMS website within 9 months. The legislation aims to eliminate duplication between the Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank (HIPDB) and the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB). The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. The NPDB collects data on professional competence of healthcare practitioners, including malpractice payments and adverse actions. States must report adverse actions to the NPDB. The provision transfers information from the HIPDB to the NPDB, eliminating the HIPDB. Access to this information is available to certain agencies, officials, and healthcare providers for a fee. States must report final adverse actions against healthcare providers. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Sec. 6404 reduces the maximum period for submission of Medicare claims to not more than 12 months for efficient administration. Medicare payments require a written request within three calendar years, but this provision allows the Secretary to reduce it to one year if necessary. Beginning January 2010, claims must be submitted within 12 months. Physicians must certify specified services meet conditions to receive Medicare payment. For home health services, certification includes confinement to home, need for skilled nursing care, established service plan, and physician oversight. For DME, Secretary can require payment for specified items and services. The provision requires physicians to provide written orders for specified covered items to suppliers for payment. Physicians ordering DME or HH services must be enrolled in Medicare. The Secretary can extend these requirements to other categories of Medicare items to reduce fraud. The CBO score is -$0.2 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$0.4 billion for FY2010-FY2019. The Secretary has the authority to exclude entities or individuals from federal health programs for various reasons, such as failing to provide documentation for payment. Starting January 1, 2010, Medicare enrolled physicians or suppliers can be disenrolled for up to one year for not maintaining or providing access to necessary documentation. The OIG's exclusion authority is extended to individuals or entities that order, refer, or certify healthcare services without adequate documentation. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Physicians must have a face-to-face encounter with patients before certifying eligibility for home health services or durable medical equipment under Medicare. Certification is required to ensure that specified services meet certain conditions, such as the individual being confined to their home and needing skilled nursing care or therapy. Payment from Medicare is contingent on physicians certifying the necessity of these services. Physicians must have a face-to-face encounter with patients before certifying eligibility for home health services or durable medical equipment under Medicare. This provision requires physicians to document the encounter within a specified time frame for different types of services. The Secretary may extend the face-to-face encounter requirement to other Medicare services to reduce fraud. Eligible professionals include nurse practitioners and physician assistants. The CBO estimates savings of -$1.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Enhanced penalties under Section 1128A of the SSA allow for CMPs for improper conduct in federal health care programs. The provision mandates penalties of up to $50,000 for false claims and $15,000 for failure to grant access to the Office of the Inspector General. Medicare Advantage plans can face sanctions for contract violations. The provision mandates penalties for Medicare Advantage plans that violate the terms of the contract, including failing to provide necessary care, imposing excess premiums, and misrepresenting information. Sanctions and CMPs can be imposed for various violations, such as enrolling individuals without consent or transferring for commission purposes. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. The CBO score for FY2010-FY2014 and FY2010-FY2019 is $0.0 billion. The HHS Office of the Inspector General issued a Self-Disclosure Protocol for health care providers to voluntarily disclose potential fraud to avoid investigation costs. The protocol now requires a minimum $50,000 settlement for anti-kickback violations. The HHS OIG requires a minimum $50,000 settlement amount to resolve potential violations of the physician self-referral law. A self-referral disclosure protocol (SRDP) would be established for health care providers to disclose violations. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and FY2010-FY2019. Adjustments to the Medicare Durable Medical Equipment Competitive Acquisition Program are also discussed. The proposal includes establishing a Competitive Acquisition Program for medical equipment in specified areas to replace the Medicare fee schedule. It will be phased-in starting in nine large metropolitan areas in 2009, expanding to 100 areas by 2011, and extending to all areas by 2016. The CBO score is -$0.3 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$1.4 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Additionally, the expansion of the Recovery Audit Contractor (RAC) Program is discussed, involving private organizations contracted to identify and collect improper Medicare payments. The Recovery Audit Contractor (RAC) Program was initially a three-year demonstration program in the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003. It became permanent in 2006 and was expanded nationwide by 2010. RACs are paid using contingency fees for every overpayment recovered. The program was mandated to be expanded to include Medicaid and Medicare Parts C and D by 2010. Part C and D RACs are required to ensure anti-fraud measures in MA or PDP plans. The Recovery Audit Contractor (RAC) Program, expanded nationwide in 2010, includes Part C and D RACs ensuring anti-fraud measures in MA or PDP plans. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Sec. 10606 focuses on health care fraud enforcement, requiring the U.S. Sentencing Commission to review and amend sentencing guidelines for federal health care offenses. Certain criminal offenses would be deemed \"federal health care fraud offenses\" under the U.S. Criminal Code. Convictions for violations of federal health care offenses may result in longer prison terms and higher fines. The offenses include violations of the federal anti-kickback statute, U.S. Criminal Code, Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, and ERISA. Amendments to subpoena authority related to health care are also proposed, including changes to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act. The General or a designated person can subpoena institutions under investigation under CRIPA for information to protect residents' rights. The obtained information cannot be used for other purposes. The CBO score for FY2010-FY2019 is $0.0 billion. Title IX includes Revenue Offset Provisions, such as an additional Hospital Insurance Tax on high-income taxpayers. The Senate bill proposes a 0.9% additional tax on high-income workers with wages over $200,000 for single filers and $250,000 for joint filers, effective after December 31, 2012. Employers would collect the tax from all workers exceeding the wage thresholds. The self-employed would also be subject to this tax without the ability to deduct it as a business expense. The provision is estimated to increase revenue by $19.3 billion during FY2010-FY2014 and $86.8 billion during FY2010-FY2019. The Senate passed an amendment to H.R. 4213, the American Workers, State, and Business Relief Act of 2010, containing provisions similar to H.R. 3590. A side-by-side comparison of changes made by the provisions in both bills is provided. Additional details on H.R. 3590 provisions can be found in Appendix A."
