The Congress acknowledges the importance of an affordable and ample energy supply for economic prosperity and national security. They recognize the link between environmental quality and energy production. With the expected increase in population, economic development, energy consumption, and environmental stress, pursuing long-term energy options like fusion energy is crucial due to its virtually inexhaustible fuel supply, minimal land mass requirement, and promise of minimal environmental impact and safety. The National Research Council, President's Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology, and Secretary of Energy Advisory Board strongly support the Fusion Energy Sciences Program for its progress towards practical fusion energy. United States fusion scientists emphasize the need for a magnetic fusion burning experiment to address key scientific issues and advance fusion energy development. The United States fusion research community supports involvement in the international experiment ITER for a burning plasma experiment. If ITER fails, a domestic experiment should be pursued. The National Research Council advocates for broadening the Fusion Energy Sciences Program to integrate the fusion science community into the broader scientific community. The program's budget is insufficient to support necessary science and innovation for current experiments. The Department of Energy's Fusion Energy Sciences Advisory Committee is developing a plan to demonstrate fusion power on the US electric grid within 35 years. Congress emphasizes the need to accelerate this timeframe for fusion energy development. The United States aims to demonstrate electric power and hydrogen production using fusion energy at the earliest possible date. The goal is to develop the necessary infrastructure to be competitive globally in providing fusion energy. The United States aims to be competitive globally in providing fusion energy by demonstrating electric power and hydrogen production at the earliest possible date. The Secretary of Energy is required to submit a plan to Congress within 6 months of this Act's enactment, outlining cost estimates, budgets, potential international partners, and specific programs for implementing the fusion energy policy. The plan for implementing the fusion energy policy includes ensuring existing fusion research facilities are fully utilized, strengthening fusion science and technology, selecting new research facilities based on innovation and cost-effectiveness, funding selected facilities at a reasonable rate, and promoting communication of scientific results within the scientific community. The plan for implementing the fusion energy policy includes utilizing inertial confinement fusion facilities for research, exploring alternative fusion energy approaches, and addressing the status of fusion materials and technology projects. The plan includes designing and implementing international or national facilities for testing fusion materials and key fusion technologies. SEC. 5. ITER. The Secretary of Energy is authorized to negotiate an agreement for US participation in ITER, which must define financial contributions, ensure US access to data, and allow US researchers to propose experiments. The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the Fusion Energy Sciences Advisory Committee, will develop a plan for US scientists' participation in ITER. This plan will include the US research agenda, methods to assess ITER's progress in fusion energy, and how ITER work will align with the US fusion program. The plan will be reviewed by the National Academy of Sciences, with results transmitted to Congress. The Secretary of Energy will transmit results to Congress within 90 days of enactment. No Federal funds for ITER construction until reports on agreement, management structure, cost estimate, and funding source are provided to Congress. The Secretary of Energy will transmit results to Congress within 90 days of enactment, including the plan required by subsection (b). 60 days have elapsed since the transmission of the plan. If ITER construction is deemed unlikely, the Secretary of Energy will present a plan for a domestic burning plasma experiment like FIRE to Congress, with input from advisory committees and the National Academy of Sciences. Results of the review must be sent to Congress within a year of the Act's enactment. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS.\n\n(1) \"construction\" means physical construction of ITER facility, purchase, or manufacture of equipment/components specifically for ITER, not design.\n(2) \"FIRE\" is Fusion Ignition Research Experiment, supported by DOE as alternative burning plasma experiment if ITER fails.\n(3) \"ITER\" is international burning plasma fusion research project announced for US participation on January 30, 2003.\n\nSEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of appropriations for the Fusion Energy Sciences Program: \n- $335,000,000 for fiscal year 2006\n- $349,000,000 for fiscal year 2007\n- $362,000,000 for fiscal year 2008\n- $377,000,000 for fiscal year 2009\n- $393,000,000 for fiscal year 2010\n\nAuthorization of appropriations for ITER activities for fiscal years 2006 through 2010 as necessary."
