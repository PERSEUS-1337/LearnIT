    "title": "AB 1060",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges that clinical trial participation is hindered by low patient involvement, recruitment challenges, and financial barriers. Only 3 percent of eligible cancer patients participate in trials, with a mere 5 percent from minority communities. Financial constraints, such as ancillary costs, prevent many low to moderate-income patients from participating in FDA clinical trials. The American Medical Association study on cancer trial participation from 1996 to 2002 found low diversity in National Cancer Institute trials, with only 3.1% Hispanic, 9.2% Black, and 1.9% Asian participants. Lack of diversity hinders researchers' ability to evaluate new treatments' effects on different populations and limits access to potentially life-saving trials. The Legislature aims to establish a program for low to moderate-income patients to boost participation rates, ensure accessibility, improve cancer therapy development, and enhance innovation. The Cancer Clinical Trials Foundation is established by the agency to improve diversity in cancer trials. The Foundation will be governed by a board of five members appointed by the Governor, Speaker of the Assembly, and President pro Tempore of the Senate. The board members of the Cancer Clinical Trials Foundation must have an interest in increasing access to cancer clinical trials and be willing to solicit funds for this purpose. The Governor appoints the president of the board from among the appointed members. The foundation must apply for tax-exempt status and operate under the Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation Law. Board members serve without compensation but can be reimbursed for expenses related to their duties. The California Health and Human Services Agency will determine the department to administer the Cancer Clinical Trials Foundation. Board members have staggered terms, and a Cancer Clinical Trials Fund is created in the State Treasury for program support upon legislative appropriation. The Cancer Clinical Trials Foundation can receive funds from various sources to administer the Cancer Clinical Trials Grant Program. The agency can seek federal funds for the foundation and must limit administrative costs to 20 percent of available funds. The agency is limited to spending $300,000 to establish the foundation, with repayment required from donations to the Cancer Clinical Trials Fund. General Fund moneys cannot be used to operate the foundation after the initial investment. The board will establish the Cancer Clinical Trials Grant Program with a contribution of at least $500,000 to increase patient access to cancer clinical trials in underserved communities. Grants may be awarded to research institutions, hospitals, and nonprofit organizations specializing in patient support for clinical trial enrollment and retention. Grants awarded under the Cancer Clinical Trials Grant Program aim to enhance patient access to cancer clinical trials. Activities funded include patient navigator services, education, technical tools for trial identification, translation services, counseling, well-being services, and payment of ancillary costs like airfare, lodging, rental cars, and fuel for patients and caregivers during the trial. The Cancer Clinical Trials Grant Program funds activities to enhance patient access to trials, including patient navigator services, education, trial identification tools, translation, counseling, well-being services, and payment of ancillary costs like airfare, lodging, rental cars, fuel, local transportation, meals, and child care. Recipients must report fund usage within one year of receiving a grant. The board must report to the Legislature on fund usage for the Cancer Clinical Trials Grant Program, including accountability measures and recommendations. The report is due by January 1, 2020, and the requirement expires on January 1, 2024. This chapter is effective until January 1, 2022, unless extended or deleted by a later statute before that date."
