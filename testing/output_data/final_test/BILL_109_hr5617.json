The lands should be available for subsistence uses and managed under policies consistent with adjacent Native Corporation owned lands until development.

Transfer includes sale, exchange, or transfer of land for consideration, excluding certain exchanges or leasing agreements. SEC. 4. REVENUE SHARING. Section 7(i)(1) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act is amended to allocate a percentage of revenues from timber and subsurface estate among Regional Corporations based on the number of Natives enrolled in each region.

Revenues from the 13th Regional Corporation are exempt from certain requirements, and distribution is determined by the Regional Corporations. The 13th Regional Corporation receives 10 percent of revenues and is bound by the section 7(i) Settlement Agreement with the 12 Regional Corporations. Amendments to the agreement apply unless not of general applicability. The 13th Corporation has no rights to revenues distributed by the 12 Regional Corporations or the power to approve amendments."
