    "content": "The \"Article V Records Transparency Act of 2016\" requires the compilation and transmission of applications and rescissions of applications to call a convention for proposing amendments to the Constitution to Congress. The Archivist of the United States is required to compile and transmit all applications and rescissions of applications made by States under Article V of the Constitution to Congress. The Archivist will use records from the National Archive and Records Administration and make efforts to obtain official copies of any missing applications or rescissions. The Archivist is mandated to compile and transmit all Article V applications and rescissions to Congress, categorizing them by year. A report on missing applications must be submitted within two years of the Act's enactment. The Archivist is required to compile Article V applications and rescissions, categorize them by year and State, and include this information in the material sent to Congress. Upon receipt of the compilation of Article V applications and rescissions, the judiciary committees in Congress must make them available on a public website. They are also responsible for updating the website with any new applications or rescissions that were not initially included in the compilation. Applications and rescissions received after the submission under Section 2. The Congress recommends procedures for State legislatures to submit applications or rescissions under article V of the Constitution for a convention to propose amendments. The secretary of state should send copies of the resolution to Congress, one to the President of the Senate and one to the Speaker of the House of Representatives. Each copy should include specific contents. The resolution or measure should include the exact text with the authenticating signature of the relevant officer of the legislature and the date of adoption. If a State submits an application or rescission incorrectly, the Clerk of the House or the Secretary of the Senate will notify the State official to resubmit the application. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS.\n\nIn this Act, \"transmit to Congress\" and \"submit to Congress\" mean sending to specific government officials, \"application\" refers to a request from a State legislature to call a convention, and \"rescission\" is a measure to cancel a previously submitted application. No additional funds are authorized for this Act; existing amounts will be used instead."
