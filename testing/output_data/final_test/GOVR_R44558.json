    "content": "The Higher Education Act of 1965 authorizes federal financial assistance for postsecondary education and institutions. It has been amended multiple times, with recent changes in the 114th Congress. Amendments include the Federal Perkins Loan Program Extension Act of 2015 and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016. The Higher Education Act of 1965 authorizes federal financial assistance for postsecondary education and institutions. Recent amendments in the 114th Congress include H.R. 5528, H.R. 3178, H.R. 3179, H.R. 5529, and H.R. 5530, which propose changes to programs under the HEA related to student aid and financial counseling. The expected family contribution (EFC) is a key factor in determining a student's ability to pay for higher education, calculated based on income and assets reported on the FAFSA form. H.R. 5528 proposes changes to the FAFSA process to reduce respondent burden and adjust the calculation of Pell Grants. The bill aims to allow importing tax information using the IRS-DRT and potentially base EFCs on tax returns from the prior-prior year. H.R. 5528 would amend the HEA to specify that ED \"shall\" base income for calculating the EFC on information from the second-preceding tax year, making permanent the recent administrative change. This shift aims to reduce manual input on the FAFSA by using IRS-DRT for tax information. H.R. 5528 directs ED to make the mobile version of the FAFSA available within 180 days, conduct consumer testing for usability, and improve the IRS-DRT for importing tax information. The bill aims to increase functionality and reliability of the IRS-DRT for all tax filing statuses. The total maximum Pell Grant award amount is determined by the discretionary base maximum award and the mandatory \"add-on\" award. H.R. 5528 proposes a change in the calculation of the inflation rate for award year 2017-2018, measuring the change in CPI-U over the most recently completed fiscal year. This change would not apply automatically thereafter as per current law. The HEOA amended the HEA to require detailed reporting and publication of information about higher education institutions, students, and college costs. H.R. 3178 proposes a College Dashboard to replace the College Navigator website, with changes to the required information. It also suggests repealing the publicizing of College Affordability and Transparency Lists and State Higher Education Spending Charts, revising net price calculator requirements, and removing the need for multi-year tuition calculators. H.R. 3178 proposes replacing the College Navigator website with a new consumer-tested College Dashboard. The bill would revise reporting requirements for consumer information, including disaggregated completion rates for all undergraduate students and information on cost of attendance, net price, financial aid, and student loan debt. H.R. 3178 would require reporting on various aspects of undergraduate student enrollment, including cost of attendance, financial aid, and veterans education benefits. It would also add requirements for reporting on academic faculty and eliminate reporting on undergraduate admissions and standardized test scores. Additionally, students completing a FAFSA would be provided with a link to the College Dashboard website for each institution listed on the FAFSA. Net price calculators would be required on each institution's website to help students estimate their costs. H.R. 3178 aims to establish new requirements for net price calculators at IHEs, including clear links on websites for cost and aid information. Calculators must display components of full-time undergraduate costs and available grant and scholarship aid. The bill also prohibits IHEs from selling aid information. H.R. 3179 proposes amendments to enhance loan counseling for Direct Loan borrowers, aiming to improve the timing, frequency, and content of counseling to help borrowers make informed borrowing decisions. H.R. 3179 proposes amendments to enhance loan counseling for Direct Loan borrowers, requiring counseling for all individuals receiving a Pell Grant or Direct Loan, except for those with a Direct Consolidation Loan. H.R. 3179 proposes enhanced loan counseling for Direct Loan borrowers, requiring annual financial counseling for all borrowers, including Pell Grant recipients. Exit counseling is still required for graduating or leaving borrowers. Loan terms, conditions, and borrower rights are covered in entrance counseling. H.R. 3179 proposes enhanced loan counseling for Direct Loan borrowers, requiring annual financial counseling for all borrowers, including Pell Grant recipients. The bill would provide specific information to individuals based on the type of federal student aid they receive, including budgeting for educational expenses, credit report access, state income and employment rates, and financial resources. The federal Pell Grant terms and conditions, including repayment details and eligibility periods, are explained. H.R. 3179 proposes annual financial counseling for Direct Loan borrowers, tailored to the type of loan received. Borrowers are advised to consider other financial aid options before taking out a federal student loan. H.R. 3179 proposes annual financial counseling for Direct Loan borrowers, emphasizing the importance of exhausting federal student loan options before considering private education loans. The counseling includes details on monthly payment amounts and repayment plans, aiming to educate borrowers on their rights and responsibilities. H.R. 3179 would require borrowers to confirm acceptance of Direct Loans before disbursement, either through a promissory note or a separate statement. Exit counseling for graduating or leaving students would include information on repayment plans and borrower responsibilities. The proposed changes to exit counseling requirements for Direct Loan borrowers would include providing a summary of outstanding balances, details on repayment grace periods, and information on available repayment plans based on the borrower's loan balance. Currently, institutions of higher education (IHEs) have flexibility in developing their own counseling methods, including online, written, or in-person sessions, as long as they meet HEA requirements. The Secretary encourages the use of interactive programs with simple language for entrance counseling. H.R. 3179 would require the Department of Education (ED) to maintain online financial and exit counseling tools that are consumer tested, understandable, and freely available to all institutions of higher education (IHEs). IHEs can choose to use ED's tools or provide their own interactive counseling. ED must keep records of individuals who complete counseling using the online tool. H.R. 3179 mandates the Department of Education to conduct a longitudinal study on the impact of online financial and exit counseling tools. $2 million would be allocated for this purpose, with interim reports evaluating progress. Additionally, the bill prohibits additional funds for student aid counseling. H.R. 5529 aims to enhance educational opportunities for Hispanic students at Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) by expanding the uses of grant monies awarded to HSIs, potentially increasing the number of Hispanic physicians in the workforce and expanding educational offerings. The bill would allow Title V-A HSI grants to be used for a variety of activities to improve academic success and serve underrepresented graduate and professional students. H.R. 5529 expands the authorized uses of Title V-A HSI grants to include student support services for advancing students to postbaccalaureate doctoral programs and access to dual enrollment programs. The program is funded through annual discretionary appropriations, with the authorization of appropriations expiring in FY2014. Despite this, annual appropriations have continued to be provided each fiscal year. H.R. 5529 authorizes $107,795,000 for FY2016 for the Developing HSIs program, excluding automatic extensions. This suggests no further appropriations for program expansion. The HBCU Capital Financing program offers federal assistance to HBCUs for campus projects. H.R. 5530 aims to enhance the program's operations and oversight. The program involves a private corporation issuing bonds for HBCU projects, with ED guaranteeing repayment. HBCUs must use 95% of the loan for capital projects and deposit the remaining 5% into an escrow account. H.R. 5530 proposes replacing the \"pooled escrow\" account with a \"bond insurance fund\" in the HBCU Capital Financing program to address issues faced by some state institutions. This change aims to maintain functionality while increasing access to the program. H.R. 5530 aims to address barriers faced by some HBCUs in participating in the HBCU Cap Fin program by replacing the pooled escrow account with a bond insurance fund. The bill also authorizes financial counseling and technical support for eligible HBCUs, and directs the HBCU Capital Financing Advisory Board to provide annual reports on program loans and recommendations for addressing construction financing issues. The H.R. 5530 bill aims to address barriers faced by HBCUs in participating in the HBCU Cap Fin program by providing financial counseling, technical support, and legislative recommendations for construction financing issues."
