The United States needs more renewable energy sources to address climate change, meet energy standards, diversify the energy mix, and enhance energy independence. Coastal waters in the US have significant offshore wind, wave, and tidal energy potential, accounting for over 50% of the country's renewable energy capacity. The Department of Energy estimates over 900,000 MW of renewable energy potential exists offshore. Offshore wind energy in the United States has a potential capacity of 900,000 MW, equivalent to the country's total installed electrical capacity. This energy is located near major population centers with high energy costs. It could generate 3,547,800,000 megawatt hours of electricity annually, which is comparable to 25% of the nation's total oil consumption. Additionally, offshore wind energy alone could produce 3,548 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity per year, representing 87% of the electricity generated in the US in 2006. Offshore wind energy potential in the United States is significant, with 90% of the 900,000 MW capacity located in Federal waters beyond 5 nautical miles from shore. In Europe, countries like Germany have ambitious renewable energy goals, surpassing a 12% target in 2007. Germany announced in 2008 a target of 27 percent renewable energy by 2020, focusing on offshore wind energy development in deeper waters with advanced technology. Offshore ocean energy projects could create hundreds of thousands of jobs, with the United States having the potential for significant wind energy production and manufacturing opportunities. The United States has the capacity for renewable energy generation from the ocean, including wave, wind, and tidal sources. Experts suggest that a policy framework is necessary for offshore site identification and rapid resource development. SEC. 3. IDENTIFICATION OF OFFSHORE SITES FOR ALTERNATIVE ENERGY FACILITIES. The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with coastal zone management agencies, will enter agreements with eligible persons to assess and identify sites in the coastal zone and exclusive economic zone for renewable energy facilities. Eligible persons must not have a financial interest in offshore renewable energy projects. (c) Consistency With Coastal Zone Management Programs.--Any activity for offshore renewable electric energy generation in a location identified as suitable under this section is deemed consistent with State coastal zone management programs. SEC. 4. OFFSHORE ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION FUND. Establishment of Offshore Electric Power Generation Trust Fund within the Treasury of the United States to finance approved projects. Secretary of the Treasury to transfer $100,000,000 annually to the Fund for investments. The Secretary can invest in US obligations for the Offshore Electric Power Generation Trust Fund. Interest and proceeds from these investments will be credited to the Fund. The Secretary of Energy can provide grants from the Fund for approved projects. The Secretary of Energy can provide grants to private and public entities in the US for offshore renewable energy projects. Grants must be matched by the entities receiving them and can be used for research, planning, demonstration projects, and scaling up renewable energy generation. The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with coastal State Governors, designates sites for offshore renewable energy projects. Funding is only available for projects located in designated sites. SEC. 5. OFFSHORE RENEWABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT FUNDING. The Secretary of Energy is authorized $25,000,000 for offshore site assessment and planning assistance for coastal States to identify sites for renewable energy projects. Additionally, $160,000,000 is authorized for offshore renewable energy technology development to promote advances in technology and provide infrastructure assistance for approved projects in State coastal zone management plans. The Secretary of Energy is authorized funds for offshore site assessment and planning assistance for coastal States to identify sites for renewable energy projects. Furthermore, funds are allocated for marine renewable energy centers and testing to support collaborations in offshore renewable energy and validate offshore wave, wind, and tidal technologies. Funds are allocated for testing and validation of offshore wave, wind, and tidal energy technologies, including wind energy blades and offshore platforms. The funds will be used for developing and operating test center facilities, monitoring technology performance and environmental impacts for 3 years. Additionally, $20,000,000 is authorized for streamlined permitting of offshore renewable energy technology demonstration sites to promote collaboration with other agencies. The Secretary of Energy is authorized $40,000,000 for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory to promote public understanding of offshore renewable energy benefits and address project siting issues. The Secretary may also provide job training and career assistance in the offshore renewable generation industry."
