    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Religious Freedom Peace Tax Fund Act\". Congress acknowledges the importance of religious freedom as a fundamental right protected by the First Amendment and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Many immigrants, including Quakers and Mennonites, came to America to escape persecution for their beliefs, yet during WWI, conscientious objectors were imprisoned and mistreated for their refusal to participate in warfare. During the Second World War, \"alternative civilian service\" was established in lieu of military service to accommodate various religious beliefs. Case law has expanded exemptions for conscientious objectors, describing it as a long-standing tradition in the country. Thousands of conscientious objectors provided service during and after the war. During the Second World War, conscientious objectors provided essential staff for mental hospitals, volunteered for medical experiments, and served the national health and safety. They sought legal relief from government seizure of their property and objected to war participation based on moral, ethical, or religious beliefs, with no provision for alternative service for taxpayers. The Joint Committee on Taxation has certified that a tax trust fund for conscientious objector taxpayers would increase Federal revenues. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. Designated Conscientious Objector refers to a taxpayer opposed to war based on moral, ethical, or religious beliefs, certified in writing to the Secretary of the Treasury. Military Purpose includes activities that augment military forces or intelligence, or enhance war capabilities, such as funding for the Department of Defense. The curr_chunk discusses the allocation of funds for various military-related activities, including the Department of Defense, intelligence community, Selective Service System, Department of Energy, NASA, foreign military aid, and military personnel training and equipment development. The curr_chunk introduces the establishment of a Religious Freedom Peace Tax Fund. The Secretary of the Treasury establishes the \"Religious Freedom Peace Tax Fund\" for conscientious objectors' taxes. Funds are allocated to non-military purposes, and an annual report is submitted to Congress. The Religious Freedom Peace Tax Fund is established for conscientious objectors' taxes, with funds allocated to non-military purposes. Congress senses that any revenue increase should align with the Fund's purposes. Individual privacy when using the Fund is protected."
