    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. The Congress finds that the United States has invested $6.5 billion in military infrastructure in NATO countries and plans to reduce troop strength in Europe. Many military sites in Europe have already been closed, leaving behind infrastructure improvements. The United States has invested $6.5 billion in military infrastructure in NATO countries and plans to reduce troop strength in Europe. Some allies have agreed to pay for the value of improvements left behind, but as of 1994, only $33.3 million has been recouped. Germany has received over 60% of military sites planned for closure, with an estimated value of $2.7 billion in facilities to be returned. The German government has budgeted only $25 million for compensation for the United States' $2.7 billion investment in military infrastructure in NATO countries. SEC. 2. POLICY. The German government has budgeted only $25 million for compensation for the United States' $2.7 billion investment in military infrastructure in NATO countries. The sense of Congress is that the President should prioritize recovering the value of the US investment in NATO military infrastructure through negotiations for cash payments, with in-kind contributions as a last resort. In lieu of cash payments, in-kind contributions should offset costs for overseas base support approved by Congress or requested by the President in the budget for the succeeding fiscal year. SEC. 3. REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITATIONS RELATING TO PAYMENTS IN KIND. Requirement for Justification for Negotiations for Payments-in-Kind: Amends subsection (e) of section 2921 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1992 to require a written notice to congressional defense committees regarding intended negotiations for payments-in-kind with a host country, including a justification for entering into such negotiations. The amendment requires a written notice to Congress for negotiations on payments-in-kind with a host country, specifying benefit options, and activities that could be reduced to offset the cost of improvements released to the host country. The amendment mandates notifying Congress before accepting improvements from a host country as payment-in-kind, requiring a request for rescission of appropriations for overseas base support or a reduction in the budget request for such support. The Secretary of Defense may not accept improvements to real property as payment-in-kind if they would require authorization of appropriations for military construction or if they do not constitute a military construction project authorized by law. The term 'overseas base support' is defined as military construction, maintenance of real property, and contributions for the NATO Infrastructure Program outside the United States."
