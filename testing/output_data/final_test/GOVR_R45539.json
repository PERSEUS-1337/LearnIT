    "content": "Illegal aliens have exploited asylum loopholes at an alarming rate, with a 2000 percent increase in aliens claiming credible fear over the last five years. Many know this will give them an opportunity to stay in the country, even if they do not have a valid claim to asylum. The increased number of Central Americans petitioning for asylum in the United States is not due to more people lying about the dangers they face in their country of origin. The asylum debate is heated due to conflicting views on asylum seekers. Policymakers aim to balance approving legitimate claims while deterring illegitimate ones. Changes in U.S. asylum policy reflect attempts to strike this balance, especially during periods of increased asylum-seeking. The Trump Administration has implemented policies to tighten the asylum system in response to an influx of Central Americans seeking asylum, leading to court challenges. This report analyzes the landscape of U.S. asylum policy. The report explores the landscape of U.S. asylum policy, analyzing current processes, data, legislative history, and policy questions. The Immigration and Nationality Act provides for granting asylum to refugees based on persecution or fear of persecution. Asylum can be granted to individuals based on grounds such as race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. Applicants for asylum are physically present in the United States or at a land border or port of entry. After one year, they can apply to become a U.S. lawful permanent resident. Aliens in the United States or arriving in the U.S. can apply for asylum. An adult applicant, regardless of immigration status, may apply for asylum in the United States. Asylum may be granted by a USCIS asylum officer or an EOIR immigration judge without numerical limitations. To receive asylum, the applicant must meet the INA definition of a refugee and other requirements. Certain aliens, deemed a security threat, are ineligible for asylum. An asylum applicant can apply for employment authorization 150 days after filing and may travel abroad if granted asylum. A grant of asylum does not expire but can be terminated under certain circumstances. After one year of physical presence in the United States, an asylee may be granted LPR status. Special provisions apply to certain aliens without proper documentation subject to expedited removal. Asylum applications can be defensive or affirmative, each with different procedures. An asylum application can be either defensive or affirmative, with different procedures for each type. An affirmative asylum application is submitted by an alien physically present in the United States to DHS's USCIS, regardless of immigration status. There is no fee to apply for asylum. Figure 1 displays the number of new affirmative asylum applications filed with USCIS since FY1995. The data in Figure 1 represent applications, not individuals, and reflect the impact of various factors such as reforms in the mid-1990s. The asylum application process involves fingerprinting appointments and interviews by USCIS asylum officers to confirm identity and conduct security checks. Reforms in the mid-1990s made the asylum system more restrictive, impacting application numbers. An increase in applications in later years was due to an influx of unaccompanied alien children from Central America seeking asylum. The USCIS Asylum Division prioritizes asylum interviews for applications pending for 21 days or less to deter filing for employment authorization. The interview is nonadversarial, allowing the applicant to bring counsel, witnesses, and evidence. A decision is reviewed by a supervisory officer, and if eligible, the applicant receives a letter. The USCIS Asylum Division conducts nonadversarial interviews for asylum applications. If eligible, the applicant receives a letter documenting the grant of asylum. If deemed ineligible, the case may be referred to an immigration judge for adjudication in removal proceedings. Data on affirmative asylum applications show four outcome categories, including closures for various reasons. The majority of cases referred to an immigration judge each year, including defensive asylum applications filed since FY2009. Different ways an asylum application can be processed. An alien can be placed in standard removal proceedings by DHS for violating immigration law or through expedited removal if found inadmissible and expressing intent to apply for asylum or fear of persecution. An alien expressing intent to apply for asylum or fear of persecution is interviewed by an asylum officer to determine credible fear. If found credible, the case is referred to an immigration judge for a full hearing on the asylum request during removal proceedings. Data on USCIS credible fear findings since FY1997 is provided in Figure 4, showing the number of cases referred and completed, along with outcomes. During removal proceedings, an attorney from DHS's ICE presents the case for removing the alien, the alien can present evidence and cross-examine witnesses, and an immigration judge determines removal. The judge's decision can be reviewed administratively and judicially. Data on EOIR decisions in defensive asylum cases shows a decrease in administrative closures since FY2016. In May 2018, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ruled that immigration judges and the BIA do not have general authority to administratively close cases. The INA Amendments of 1965 added language on the conditional entry of refugees, authorizing the entry of those fleeing persecution on account of race, religion, or political opinion. In 1968, the United States acceded to the 1967 United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, expanding the definition of a refugee to include those with a well-founded fear of persecution based on race, religion, or political opinion, without geographic limitation. The Protocol expanded the definition of a refugee to include those with a well-founded fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, social group, or political opinion. It also prohibited states from forcibly returning refugees to territories where their life or freedom would be threatened. INS issued regulations in the 1970s for applying and adjudicating asylum applications in the United States. The 1980 Refugee Act established a neutral adjudication process for asylum and refugee status, applying equally to all applicants regardless of origin. The Act defined a refugee as any person outside their country with a well-founded fear of persecution based on specific criteria. The 1980 Refugee Act established a neutral adjudication process for asylum and refugee status, applying equally to all applicants regardless of origin. The Act defined a refugee as any person outside their country with a well-founded fear of persecution based on specific criteria. The asylum provisions added by the 1980 act to the INA were considered less significant compared to the refugee process. The 1980 act to the INA established asylum application procedures for aliens physically present in the US or arriving at a land border or port of entry. It granted the Attorney General discretionary authority to grant asylum to refugees and allowed for termination of asylum status if the alien no longer met the refugee definition. Additionally, it provided for granting asylum status to the spouse and children of an alien granted asylum. The Refugee Act of 1980 amended the INA to grant the Attorney General discretionary authority to adjust the status of asylees in the US, with an annual limit of 5,000. It revised the language on withholding deportation to prevent the return of aliens to countries where they would face persecution based on race, religion, or political opinion. The Refugee Act of 1980 amended the INA to grant the Attorney General discretionary authority to adjust the status of asylees in the US, with an annual limit of 5,000. It revised the language on withholding deportation to prevent the return of aliens to countries where their life or freedom would be threatened due to race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. Exclusions were added for participation in persecution, serious crimes, nonpolitical crimes, and national security concerns. The Refugee Act of 1980 amended the INA to grant the Attorney General discretionary authority to adjust the status of asylees in the US, with an annual limit of 5,000. It revised the language on withholding deportation to prevent the return of aliens to countries where their life or freedom would be threatened. INS published interim regulations in June 1980 to implement the Refugee Act's provisions on refugee and asylum procedures. The asylum regulations included the following: INS district directors had jurisdiction over all requests for asylum except for those made by aliens in exclusion or deportation proceedings. The applicant had the burden of proof to establish eligibility for asylum and would be examined in person by an immigration officer or judge. The district director could grant work authorization to an asylum applicant. The district director had discretionary authority to grant work authorization to asylum applicants with a \"non-frivolous\" application. Reasons for denying asylum included being firmly resettled in another country, participating in persecution, conviction of a \"particularly serious crime,\" committing a serious non-political crime outside the US, or being a danger to national security. Initial asylum grants were for one year and could be extended annually. In the 1980s, there was much debate about asylum laws and regulations. The creation of EOIR in 1983 separated immigration courts from INS. In July 1990, INS revised asylum procedures, emphasizing the core principles of granting asylum. The 1990 final rule established asylum officers within INS to adjudicate asylum applications, emphasizing humanitarian principles and the need for an orderly system. Comments on asylum applications by DOS became optional under this rule. The 1990 rule made comments by the Department of State on asylum applications optional, focusing on distinguishing between claims of past persecution and well-founded fear of future persecution. Applicants had to establish fear of persecution based on protected grounds with a reasonable possibility of suffering such persecution upon return, detailing burden of proof requirements. The 1990 rule allowed an applicant's testimony alone to prove refugee status and established criteria for showing a well-founded fear of persecution. It granted asylum indefinitely to the principal applicant and their family, unless revoked. Additionally, an asylum application also served as a request for withholding of deportation. The 1990 rule established criteria for proving refugee status and a well-founded fear of persecution. It allowed indefinite asylum for the applicant and their family, unless revoked. Asylum applications also served as requests for withholding of deportation. The rule stated that an applicant's life or freedom must be threatened by persecution based on specific grounds for eligibility for withholding of deportation. The 1990 rule allowed for indefinite asylum for applicants and their families, with the possibility of renewal in one-year increments. It required asylum officers to provide a written decision on asylum applications and granted specified officials the authority to review these decisions. The Immigration Act of 1990 and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 made changes to asylum-related provisions in the INA, including increasing the annual numerical limitation on asylee adjustment of status. The 1994 act amended INA \u00a7208 to make aliens convicted of aggravated felonies ineligible for asylum and limited employment authorization for asylum applicants. INS proposed a rule in March 1994 to address delays in asylum adjudication. The 1994 final rule made significant changes to the asylum process, including prohibiting asylum officers from denying applications based on excludability or deportability. The 1994 final rule changed the asylum process by prohibiting officers from denying applications based on excludability or deportability. It also altered the employment authorization process to discourage meritless claims for work authorization. Applicants had to wait 150 days after submitting their asylum application before applying for employment authorization. The 1994 final rule changed the asylum process by prohibiting officers from denying applications based on excludability or deportability. It also altered the employment authorization process to discourage meritless claims for work authorization. Applicants had to wait 150 days after submitting their asylum application before applying for employment authorization. The goal was to make a decision on an asylum application within 150 days. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) of 1996 significantly amended asylum provisions in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). The IIRIRA of 1996 made significant changes to the asylum provisions in the INA, including replacing the concept of excludable aliens with inadmissible aliens. This amendment made aliens ineligible for visas or admission if they fell under the reconfigured grounds of inadmissibility. The 1980 Refugee Act and INA allow aliens in the US to apply for asylum, with restrictions under IIRIRA amendments. An alien must apply within one year of arrival and not have a previous denial, unless there are changed circumstances or extraordinary circumstances. The Attorney General can deem an alien ineligible for asylum if removal is possible under an agreement. The IIRIRA amended the INA to allow the Attorney General to impose fees on asylum applications and added new provisions such as checking applicant identities and imposing a permanent bar on those filing frivolous asylum applications. It also established time frames for asylum processing. The IIRIRA amended the INA to establish time frames for asylum processing, including completing administrative adjudication within 180 days. It also added provisions prohibiting early employment authorization for asylum applicants and grounds for denying asylum based on criminal convictions or national security concerns. The IIRIRA amended the INA to establish time frames for asylum processing, added grounds for denying asylum based on criminal convictions or national security concerns, and provided additional ineligibilities for asylum by regulation. It also stated that asylum does not convey a right to remain permanently in the United States and added new termination grounds for asylees. The IIRIRA amended the INA to establish time frames for asylum processing, added grounds for denying asylum based on criminal convictions or national security concerns, and provided additional ineligibilities for asylum by regulation. It also included new grounds for terminating asylum, such as removal to a safe third country where the alien would be eligible for asylum or equivalent temporary protection. Additionally, it expanded the definition of a refugee to include individuals subjected to coercive population control measures. The IIRIRA amended the INA to include new grounds for denying asylum based on criminal convictions or national security concerns, as well as additional ineligibilities for asylum by regulation. It also expanded the definition of a refugee to include individuals subjected to coercive population control measures. Additionally, it established expedited removal as a new immigration enforcement mechanism, allowing for the removal of aliens without further hearings or review if determined to be inadmissible. Under the INA, expedited removal allows for the swift deportation of arriving aliens or those designated by the Attorney General if they have not been admitted or paroled into the United States and cannot prove continuous presence for the 2-year period prior to determination of inadmissibility. Under the INA, expedited removal has been expanded to classes of aliens beyond arriving aliens. An alien expressing intent to apply for asylum or fear of persecution is interviewed by an asylum officer to determine credible fear. If credible fear is found, the case is referred for further processing. The INA allows for expedited removal of aliens beyond arriving aliens. If an alien is found to have a credible fear, their case is referred to an immigration judge for full consideration of the asylum request. To receive asylum, the alien must show past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. The INA also includes a withholding of removal provision to protect aliens whose life or freedom would be threatened in their home country. The IIRIRA provision includes language on ineligibility for withholding of removal based on race, religion, nationality, social group, or political opinion. It also addresses treatment of aggravated felonies for withholding of removal. Some ineligibility grounds apply to both withholding of removal and asylum applicants, but asylum has additional restrictions such as the one-year filing requirement. Withholding of removal does not have the same restrictions as asylum. The INA provisions on asylum and withholding of removal have differences in adjustment to LPR status. DOJ issued rules in 1997 and 2000 regarding asylum procedures, including eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal under INA \u00a7241(b)(3). The 2000 regulations outlined eligibility for asylum based on a well-founded fear of future persecution, including reasons such as race, religion, nationality, social group, or political opinion. It also mentioned the possibility of relocation within the home country as a factor. The 2000 regulations on eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal outlined criteria for demonstrating a future threat based on race, religion, nationality, social group, or political opinion. It also considered the option of relocating within the home country to avoid the threat. The standards for granting withholding of removal and asylum differ in the threshold required. The expedited removal provisions initially applied only to arriving aliens but were later expanded to additional classes of aliens by DOJ and DHS. In November 2002, DOJ extended expedited removal to sea arrivals who are not admitted or paroled and have not been continuously present in the US for the prior two years. In August 2004, DHS authorized expedited removal for aliens present in the US without admission or parole, found inadmissible due to lack of documentation or fraud, within 100 air miles of the US border and not continuously present for 14 days prior. Protection from removal is available to aliens in the United States who are likely to be tortured in their home country, as per the United Nations Convention Against Torture. Torture is defined as the intentional infliction of severe physical or mental pain. The Department of Justice (DOJ) established procedures to implement U.S. obligations under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (CAT) in the removal process. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) regulations address handling cases where an alien expresses fear of torture during expedited removal. An asylum officer interviews the alien to determine credible fear of torture, requiring a significant possibility of eligibility for CAT protection. Eligibility for protection under the CAT does not require a nexus to a protected ground like asylum. If an asylum officer finds credible fear, the case is referred to an immigration judge for CAT application consideration. If the judge determines the alien is likely to be tortured, CAT protection is granted through withholding or deferral of removal. Another screening process exists for reasonable fear of persecution or torture. Established a separate screening process for reasonable fear of persecution or torture, applicable to certain aliens not eligible for asylum. If an alien in this category expresses fear of returning to their country, USCIS makes a reasonable fear determination, subject to review by an immigration judge. To establish reasonable fear of persecution, the alien must show a reasonable possibility of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, membership in a social group, or political opinion, the same standard used for asylum eligibility. To establish a reasonable fear of torture, an alien must show a reasonable possibility of being tortured in the country of removal. If a positive reasonable fear finding is made, the case is referred to an immigration judge to determine eligibility for withholding of removal under INA \u00a7241(b)(3) or under the CAT. Granting withholding of removal or deferral of removal does not prevent the US from removing the alien to a third country. Subsequent laws have made further changes to the INA provisions, such as the Real ID Act of 2005 adding \"burden of proof\" provisions for granting asylum. The Real ID Act of 2005 added \"burden of proof\" provisions for granting asylum, requiring applicants to show persecution based on specific grounds. The Act also eliminated annual caps on asylee adjustment of status. The 2008 TVPRA addressed asylum applications by unaccompanied alien children in the US. The 2008 TVPRA addressed asylum applications by unaccompanied alien children in the United States, allowing USCIS asylum officers initial jurisdiction over their applications. In November 2018, DHS and DOJ issued an interim rule for asylum claims of aliens contravening entry restrictions, following a proclamation by President Trump to suspend entry for those crossing the Southwest border. The interim rule aims to direct inadmissible aliens to ports of entry for orderly processing, barring them from asylum eligibility if they enter the US against the proclamation. Asylum officers would assess credible fear of persecution, but aliens entering the Southwest border without inspection could still seek other forms of protection. The interim rule directs inadmissible aliens to ports of entry for processing and bars them from asylum if they enter the US against the proclamation. Aliens ineligible for asylum would still be screened for statutory withholding or CAT protection under the reasonable fear standard. On December 19, 2018, a federal court granted a nationwide injunction against the reasonable-fear standard for further proceedings on withholding or CAT protection claims. The next day, DHS announced the Migrant Protection Protocols, allowing individuals entering the US from Mexico to be returned for immigration proceedings. The Migrant Protection Protocols aim to address illegal immigration by implementing 'catch and return' instead of 'catch and release.' This will require aliens to wait in Mexico for immigration court decisions, reducing incentives for illegal migration to the US. The US government will use INA \u00a7235(b)(2)(C) to return certain aliens to a foreign contiguous territory pending removal proceedings. The Migrant Protection Protocols aim to address illegal immigration by implementing 'catch and return' instead of 'catch and release.' INA \u00a7235(b)(2)(C) will be used to return certain aliens to Mexico for immigration court decisions, reducing incentives for illegal migration to the US. USCIS and CBP issued memoranda on MPP implementation, starting at the San Ysidro port of entry in California. The Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) allow certain aliens to be returned to Mexico for immigration court decisions, reducing incentives for illegal migration to the US. Aliens subject to the MPP process will receive a Notice to Appear (NTA) and be placed into removal proceedings in Mexico. Some aliens, such as unaccompanied alien children and those likely to face persecution or torture in Mexico, are not amenable to MPP. The MPP is currently in effect, but there are challenges in federal court regarding how DHS is making decisions about which aliens to process under the protocols. The House bills H.R. 4760 and H.R. 6136, along with H.R. 391, addressed asylum provisions, including amending the INA \"safe third country\" asylum provision. They aimed to eliminate the requirement for asylum seekers to be removed to a safe country under bilateral or multilateral agreements. Both H.R. 4760 and H.R. 6136 proposed changes to asylum provisions in the INA, including terminating asylum status if an alien returns to their home country without changed conditions. DHS would have discretionary authority to waive this provision, with an exception for certain Cubans. The bills also aimed to amend provisions on frivolous asylum applications. The bills proposed changes to asylum provisions in the INA, including adding a written notice on asylum applications about consequences of filing frivolous applications. They also aimed to redefine credible fear of persecution and required that statements made in support of an asylum claim are true. H.R. 391 proposed amendments to asylum provisions in the INA, including defining particular social group and requiring truthful statements in support of asylum claims. H.R. 391 aimed to amend asylum provisions in the INA by defining a particular social group and prohibiting its application to criminal gang membership cases. It also included language regarding determinations that would preclude granting asylum, such as being firmly resettled in another country. H.R. 391 aimed to amend asylum provisions by defining a particular social group and prohibiting its application to criminal gang membership cases. Other bills in the 115th Congress, like the Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act (H.R. 3697), added new grounds for ineligibility for asylum based on criminal gang membership or activity. The 115th Congress introduced bills like H.R. 3697, which added new grounds for asylum ineligibility based on criminal gang membership. Other measures, such as H.R. 2431 and S.Amdt. 1959, aimed to make aliens ineligible for asylum on broader terrorist-related grounds and exempt them from removal restrictions. These bills also proposed changes to the INA's asylum provisions. H.R. 2431 and S.Amdt. 1959 proposed amendments to INA provisions on asylee adjustment of status to LPR status, limiting DHS/DOJ waiver authority and adding deportability requirements. President Trump issued a proclamation to suspend entry of aliens crossing the Southwest border between ports of entry. President Trump issued a proclamation to suspend entry of aliens crossing the Southwest border between ports of entry, with provisions expiring 90 days after issuance or upon reaching a bilateral safe country agreement with Mexico. A rule was also issued to bar such aliens from asylum eligibility, currently facing legal challenges. Asylum policy debates have focused on the Trump Administration's efforts to tighten the system, including considerations on grounds for granting asylum. There has been much discussion about an increasing backlog of asylum applications. The term asylum backlog may suggest that there is a single queue of pending asylum cases. In fact, USCIS and EOIR separately adjudicate affirmative and defensive asylum cases. The numbers of pending USCIS affirmative asylum applications and EOIR defensive asylum cases have varied over the years, impacted by factors including international developments, changes to U.S. immigration laws, and agency resources. In the case of affirmative applications, there have been significant fluctuations in the size of the backlog over the history of the asylum program. Since FY2009, backlogs of both USCIS affirmative asylum applications and EOIR cases have increased annually. The number of pending affirmative asylum applications at USCIS rose from 6,000 in FY2009 to 320,000 in FY2018. Similarly, pending cases before EOIR increased from 224,000 to 786,000 during the same period, with about 45% involving asylum applications. Arguments for prioritizing the reduction of the asylum backlog include preserving the integrity of the asylum process and providing timely protection to legitimate asylum seekers. The USCIS is facing a growing backlog of affirmative asylum applications, with debates on how to address it. Some argue for prioritizing newer applications to reduce the backlog, while others believe more resources should be dedicated to adjudicating cases to prevent longer waits for individuals with older, valid claims. The USCIS is dealing with a backlog of affirmative asylum applications, leading to longer waits for relief under the last in-first out system. Efforts to reduce the backlog are impacting other humanitarian admissions programs, with refugee officers being shifted to assist the Asylum Division. The Administration plans to continue this shift in FY2019 to address the asylum backlog and immigration court cases. Attorney General Sessions addressed the challenges contributing to the backlog of immigration court cases, emphasizing the need for increased case completions and efficiency. He set a goal for each EOIR judge to complete 700 cases annually and mentioned the hiring of additional immigration judges. Sessions also mentioned the use of electronic and video-teleconference methods to deploy judges. Some question the effectiveness of the DOJ's approach to reducing the backlog. The DOJ aims to reduce the EOIR backlog by increasing case completions, particularly the annual goal of 700 cases per judge. Concerns have been raised about immigration judges adjudicating asylum cases within the set time frame. The INA defines a refugee based on five persecution grounds, including race, religion, nationality, social group membership, and political opinion. Legislation in the 115th Congress proposed amending the refugee definition to include persecution for resisting coercive population control programs. In the 115th Congress, an amendment to the INA refugee definition was proposed to include persecution for failure to comply with laws preventing homeschooling as persecution based on membership in a particular social group. Attorney General Sessions made a decision in June 2018 regarding asylum claims based on social group membership, impacting cases of domestic violence victims. Attorney General Sessions concluded that claims involving private criminal activity like domestic or gang violence may not qualify for asylum, as they are unlikely to meet the statutory grounds for proving group persecution that the government is unable or unwilling to address. The decision emphasized that problems with policing certain crimes or certain populations being more likely to be victims of crime do not automatically establish an asylum claim. The decision by Attorney General Sessions stated that claims related to domestic or gang violence by non-governmental actors may not qualify for asylum or credible fear of persecution. USCIS issued a policy memorandum in July 2018 to guide asylum officers on required findings regarding the home government's ability to protect individuals in cases of private violence. The Attorney General's decision on asylum claims related to domestic or gang violence may have wide-sweeping consequences for asylum seekers, particularly from Central America. Immigration advocates are concerned that the decision could lead to denials of asylum for women fleeing domestic violence, even in life-threatening circumstances. A federal district court judge in Washington, DC, ruled on a case challenging the policies regarding credible fear of persecution determinations. The judge permanently enjoined the U.S. government from continuing some of the new policies related to credible fear of persecution determinations. There are discussions about amending the INA definition of a refugee to address gender-based asylum claims. Legislative options include adding \"gender\" to persecution grounds or defining \"particular social group\" to include gender-based asylum claims like domestic violence. The credible fear of persecution threshold has been a recent focus due to the increasing number of individuals found to have a credible fear. House bills in the 115th Congress proposed adding a new requirement to the definition of credible fear. USCIS Director Francis Cissna supports tightening the credible fear standard. USCIS Director Francis Cissna endorses tightening the credible fear standard for asylum seekers at the border, stating that the current threshold is too low and easily exploited. The American Immigration Lawyers Association argues that the lower threshold is necessary due to the challenges faced by asylum seekers. Concerns about frivolous asylum applications persist. There are concerns about frivolous asylum applications in the U.S. asylum program. Regulations bar individuals who knowingly file frivolous applications from receiving immigration benefits. Attorney General Sessions highlighted the issue in 2017, describing the system as being abused and fraudulent. The USCIS Director and Attorney General have raised concerns about abuse and fraud in the asylum system, calling for penalties for frivolous claims. The scope of the issue is a key point of contention in the debate. The Center for Immigration Studies and Law Professor Lindsay M. Harris have differing views on the prevalence of fraud in asylum claims. While some believe most claims are not genuine, others attribute the increase in claims to humanitarian crises in Central America. Asylum seekers face restrictions on employment authorization under current law. Asylum seekers can only apply for employment authorization 150 days after submitting a complete asylum application. There is no fee for the initial application, but renewals require standard fees. Debate surrounds the policy, with concerns about creating incentives for fraudulent claims. USCIS Director Cissna highlighted the potential for an increase in claims linked to employment opportunities in the United States. The growth in asylum seekers' receipts since FY 2014 may be due to individuals seeking work authorization rather than asylum status. Central American asylum seekers are driven by high levels of violence and organized crime. The asylum EAD clock, which tracks employment authorization eligibility, has been a controversial issue with various events stopping the clock. The asylum EAD clock, which tracks employment authorization eligibility, has been controversial. USCIS and EOIR identify events that pause the clock as delays caused by the applicant, such as missing appointments or requesting more time. Immigration advocacy groups have criticized clock-related policies. In a 2017 report by TRAC, judges in Newark and San Francisco were found to have the most significant impact on asylum outcomes. The report by TRAC highlighted significant judge-to-judge differences in asylum cases at the Newark and San Francisco Immigration Courts. In San Francisco, denial rates varied widely among judges, ranging from 9.4% to 97.1%. TRAC's analysis suggests that these differences are likely due to individual judges' perspectives rather than the nature of the cases they handle. This analysis was based on asylum cases decided by judges from FY1994 through early FY2005. A TRAC report in July 2006 revealed disparities in asylum case decisions by immigration judges nationwide from FY1994 to early FY2005. The U.S. Government Accountability Office also examined variations in asylum case outcomes in reports from 2008 and 2016. An EOIR fact sheet in November 2007 emphasized the complexity of asylum adjudication and cautioned against simplistic statistical analysis. The 2008 report highlighted disparities in asylum grant rates among immigration judges, creating a perception of unfairness in the adjudication process. A follow-up report in 2016 analyzed data from FY1995 to FY2014, estimating significant variations in asylum grant rates across immigration courts and judges. Under the INA, an alien may be ineligible for asylum in the US if they can be removed to a third country where their life or freedom is not threatened. The US and Canada signed a safe third country agreement in 2002. Asylum seekers must request protection in the first country they arrive in, unless they qualify for an exception. The Trump Administration is considering a safe third country agreement with Mexico to reduce the flow of Central Americans seeking asylum in the United States. Human Rights First opposes this agreement, citing increased dangers for refugees and migrants in Mexico. The House bills in the 115th Congress aimed to amend the INA safe third country asylum provision to allow for removals to a third country without a bilateral agreement. The high volume of asylum cases has prompted policy responses from the Trump Administration, including considering a safe third country agreement with Mexico. In October 2018, USCIS Director Cissna discussed challenges at the U.S. southern border and the Administration's perspective on asylum-related actions. The Administration's policies are seen as necessary to maintain the immigration system's integrity, but some argue they are tightening the asylum process against the law. It is uncertain if the Administration will continue reshaping U.S. asylum policy and if Congress will make legislative changes to the asylum system. Table A-1 provides data on new affirmative asylum applications filed annually with USCIS since FY1995. Table A-2 shows the top 10 nationalities filing new affirmative asylum applications annually since FY2007. Chinese nationals consistently ranked high in filing asylum applications, holding the top spot in most years except FY2017 and FY2018. In FY2017 and FY2018, China's rank in new affirmative asylum applications fell to 2nd and 4th, respectively. Venezuelans filed the most applications in those years, comprising one-fifth in FY2017 and over a quarter in FY2018. Since FY2015, nationals of Venezuela and four other Latin American countries have been among the top six nationalities filing new asylum applications annually. In addition to deciding affirmative asylum cases, USCIS assesses credible fear of persecution claims in expedited removal. Tables B-1, B-2, and B-3 provide data on referrals, interviews, and completions of these cases. B-3 provides breakdowns of Table B-2 \"Completions\" data by case outcome, including the percentage of completed cases with credible fear. Table C-1 shows data on defensive asylum applications, with growth in recent years mainly from applications filed in immigration court. EOIR immigration judges decide defensive asylum cases. Table D-1 and D-2 provide data on defensive asylum cases decided annually since FY2009, including a subset of EOIR asylum decisions involving credible fear claims."
