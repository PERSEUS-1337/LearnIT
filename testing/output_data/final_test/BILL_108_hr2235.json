The Act will take effect in each local time zone two weeks after enactment. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. The Congress emphasizes the importance of the effective establishment and organization of the Directorate of Border and Transportation Security to carry out immigration enforcement responsibilities. Certain immigration programs may need to be temporarily suspended to ensure national security interests are not compromised. Assistance to law enforcement agencies is crucial until the Secretary of Homeland Security can make required certifications to Congress. The certifications to Congress required in section 9 will establish the effective operational transfer of immigration enforcement functions to the new Directorate. The visa waiver program under section 217 of the Immigration and Nationality Act is temporarily suspended. Additionally, the adjustment of status for aliens to permanent residence under sections 240A and 245 of the Act is also temporarily suspended. Renewals of temporary protected status are also temporarily suspended. The Secretary of Homeland Security's authority to extend certain designations under the Immigration and Nationality Act is temporarily suspended. Additionally, certain immigrant visa programs are also temporarily suspended. The allocation of family-sponsored immigrant visas for siblings and children of citizens, as well as unmarried sons and daughters of permanent resident aliens, is temporarily suspended under the Immigration and Nationality Act. The allocation of immigrant visas for certain family-sponsored and diversity immigrants is temporarily suspended under the Immigration and Nationality Act. The suspension of immigrant visa allocations includes the suspension of acceptance for filing of classification petitions under section 204 of the Immigration and Nationality Act for affected immigrant visa categories. SEC. 7. RESTRICTION OF NONIMMIGRANT VISAS FOR NATIONALS OF COUNTRIES DENYING OR DELAYING ACCEPTANCE OF ALIENS. The Secretary of Homeland Security will create a public listing of aliens with final removal orders but no significant likelihood of being removed due to countries refusing or unreasonably delaying acceptance. If 24 or more citizens of a foreign state are on this list, that state will be considered as denying or unreasonably delaying acceptance of these aliens. The Secretary of Homeland Security will notify the Secretary of State if a foreign state denies or unreasonably delays accepting aliens with final removal orders. Consular officers in that state will stop issuing nonimmigrant visas to its citizens. Subsection (a) will expire according to section 9. The Secretary of Homeland Security has the authority to waive certain sections on a case-by-case basis or for designated classes of applicants, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State. The waiver authority can be delegated to the Secretary of State for specific classes of applicants. The temporary suspensions will terminate according to section 9. The Secretary of Homeland Security can waive specific sections for certain applicants with the Secretary of State's agreement. The waivers can be delegated to the Secretary of State for particular applicant classes. Sections 3 through 8 will end one week after the Secretary of Homeland Security certifies that certain conditions are met, including the full operation of the integrated entry and exit data system at all ports of entry. The Department of Homeland Security must ensure that the visa waiver program is fully operational at all entry points and consular posts. They should also have the capability to detain and remove aliens identified by state or local law enforcement. Adequate federal funds must be available for reimbursing verified claims, and the alien registration data system must be fully compliant and operational. The alien registration data system must comply with integration standards and ensure timely entry of registrations for visa applications and change of address notifications. The Department of Homeland Security must ensure timely entry of change of address notifications in the data system. A random audit program for immigration status changes must be implemented, with fraud incidence not exceeding 3%. The foreign student monitoring system must comply with the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act. The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 ensures that educational institutions certified to receive nonimmigrant students do not admit aliens in violation of the law. The number of aliens removed from the US must be at least 25% higher than the previous year for certification. All reports and plans required under title IV of the Homeland Security must be complied with. The functions required under the Homeland Security Act of 2002 have been successfully implemented. The backlog of immigration benefit applications has been eliminated. The annual report required by the American Competitiveness Act of 2000 has been submitted to Congress.

The provisions of 2000 (8 U.S.C. 1574(b)(2)(C)(vi)) have been implemented and are substantially operational. SEC. 10. SUSPENSION OF NONIMMIGRANT VISAS. The Secretary of State's authority to issue nonimmigrant visas and the Secretary of Homeland Security's authority to admit nonimmigrant aliens into the United States are suspended. This includes the suspension of accepting applications for nonimmigrant visas and admission as a nonimmigrant. The Secretary of Homeland Security may waive these suspensions under certain conditions. Personal interviews are required for aliens seeking admission to the United States under section 217 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The Secretary, along with the Secretary of State, ensures that each alien entering on a nonimmigrant visa has undergone a personal interview with a consular officer. Additionally, during any period where a waiver is granted to aliens prohibited from receiving nonimmigrant visas, the visa bar takes precedence over the waiver. SEC. 11. TEMPORARY FUNDING FOR DETENTION AND REMOVAL ASSISTANCE BY STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. The Secretary of Homeland Security will reimburse verifiable claims from law enforcement agencies for emergency medical care, housing, and transportation of detained aliens. Reimbursement is contingent upon transfer to Federal custody, a determination of removability, or permanent departure from the United States, excluding transportation costs. Reimbursement for all costs except transportation is based on a per diem rate set by the Secretary, with the first day of detention not later than the certification date in section 9."
