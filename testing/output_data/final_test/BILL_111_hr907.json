    "content": "SECTION 1. LIVESTOCK ENERGY INVESTMENT CREDIT. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to include a new section for renewable energy produced from livestock waste using EPA-verified technologies for environmental treatment. The livestock-derived renewable energy production credit under section 38 is $5.56 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) of energy produced by the taxpayer from qualified feedstock at a qualified facility using EPA-verified technology for waste treatment. The section discusses odor and air emissions, including greenhouse gases, ammonia, methane, hydrogen sulfide, and volatile organic compounds, related to livestock-derived renewable energy production. It defines livestock-derived renewable energy as fuel derived from processing qualified energy feedstock, which includes livestock manure. The curr_chunk discusses nonhazardous, organic agricultural or food industry byproducts derived from renewable biomass, harvesting residue, fermentation processes, ethanol production, biodiesel production, and food processing. The curr_chunk defines renewable biomass as materials from pre-commercial thinning or invasive species from National Forest System land and public lands, including byproducts of preventive measures. The curr_chunk specifies that renewable biomass includes materials from pre-commercial thinning or invasive species on National Forest System land and public lands, such as the byproducts of preventive treatments to reduce disease or insect infestation and restore ecosystem health, which must be harvested in accordance with applicable laws and land management plans. The Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 defines renewable biomass as organic matter available from non-Federal or Indian land, including renewable plant material like feed grains, agricultural commodities, plants, trees, and algae. The term 'renewable biomass' includes organic matter from non-Federal or Indian land, such as plant material, trees, algae, waste material, livestock, and various byproducts. A 'qualified facility' is a taxpayer-owned facility in the US placed in service before January 1, 2018. The term 'EPA-verified technology' refers to any technology verified by the Environmental Technology Verification Program of the EPA. Additionally, the credit for renewable energy output from livestock-derived sources is based on the market price of Btus. The credit for renewable energy output from livestock-derived sources is subject to reduction based on the market price per mmBtu exceeding $11. The market price is determined by the daily average on the Chicago exchange during the 3-month period ending the previous taxable year. Any reduction not a multiple of 10 cents is rounded to the nearest multiple of 10 cents. Special rules apply for the allocation of production from a qualified facility among multiple owners based on their ownership interests. Related persons are treated as a single employer, and in the case of a corporation in an affiliated group filing a consolidated return, it is treated as selling livestock-derived products. The corporation is treated as selling livestock-derived renewable energy to an unrelated person if the biogas is sold by another group member. Rules similar to section 52 apply for estates and trusts. The amount of renewable energy produced and sold by the taxpayer is reduced by the amount sold under section 45K. In the case of government-owned facilities using poultry waste for renewable energy production, credit eligibility can be transferred through assignment to another person with consent from the Secretary. Regulations ensure the credit is claimed once and not reassigned. Adjustment for inflation is also considered. Adjustment for inflation is applied to certain amounts in subsections (a)(1) and (c)(2)(A) by multiplying them by the inflation adjustment factor for the year of sale. The Secretary determines and publishes the inflation adjustment factor annually by April 1. The inflation adjustment factor is a fraction based on the GDP implicit price deflator, with the numerator from the previous year and the denominator from 2007. The GDP implicit price deflator is the latest revision published by the Department of Commerce before March 15 of the year. Additionally, the credit treated as business credit includes livestock-derived renewable energy production. The text discusses amending the tax code to include the livestock-derived renewable energy production credit under section 40B. It also mentions a clerical amendment to the table of sections. The tax code is amended to include renewable energy from livestock waste under section 40B. The effective date for these amendments applies to energy produced in taxable years after the enactment of the Act."
