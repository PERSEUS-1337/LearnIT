    "content": "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) released a final rule implementing the Ability-to-Repay requirement of the Dodd-Frank Act, effective January 10, 2014. Lenders must make a reasonable determination that the consumer can repay the loan, with one option being to originate qualified mortgages. The ATR rule outlines criteria for qualified mortgages, offering legal protections for lenders. Concerns exist that lenders may only offer mortgages with QM status, potentially limiting who can qualify for a loan. This report analyzes the impact of the ATR rule on the mortgage market by examining the underwriting process lenders use to evaluate borrowers. Some lenders relaxed underwriting criteria in the mid-2000s, accepting loan applications with little or no documentation. They relied on the house's value for collateral-dependent lending instead of verifying borrower income or assets. This led to increased foreclosure rates when house prices fell in 2007. In 2008, the Federal Reserve Board issued a rule to prevent lenders from offering \"higher-priced mortgages\" without verifying borrower income and assets, aiming to address increasing foreclosure rates. The rule defined higher-priced mortgages as those with an APR exceeding 1.5 percentage points above the average prime offer rate. This rule aimed to enhance consumer protection by focusing on the borrower's ability to repay the loan. The ATR requirements in the Dodd-Frank Act expanded consumer protection by emphasizing disclosure to borrowers and ensuring lenders verify borrower's ability to repay the loan. The CFPB's final rule in January 2013 aimed to prevent a repeat of the financial crisis by enforcing these requirements on a broader portion of the mortgage market. Failure to comply could result in lenders having to pay damages. The final rule on Ability-to-Repay (ATR) requirements provides six compliance methods for lenders, offering varying levels of protection in case of a lawsuit. Lenders can be exempt from the ATR rule in certain situations. The General ATR Option requires consideration of eight criteria for loan approval. The General ATR Option for loan approval considers eight criteria including income, employment status, monthly payments, debt obligations, credit history, and does not have restrictions on mortgage product features. Lenders must verify these criteria using reliable third-party records to prevent no or limited documentation loans. The General ATR Option for loan approval considers various criteria, including income, employment status, monthly payments, debt obligations, and credit history. Borrowers suing lenders for not verifying their ability to repay bear the burden of proof. Lenders face legal risks with non-qualified mortgages. Qualified mortgages must meet underwriting requirements, including a maximum debt-to-income ratio of 43%. Monthly payments are based on the highest amount in the first five years. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) sets guidelines for Qualified Mortgages (QM), which must have monthly payments calculated based on the highest amount in the first five years. A QM with an APR less than 1.5 percentage points above the average prime offer rate (APOR) for a first lien qualifies for a safe harbor, ensuring compliance with the Ability-to-Repay (ATR) requirement. Mortgages above the thresholds but meeting QM requirements are deemed non-prime. The CFPB sets guidelines for Qualified Mortgages (QM) based on monthly payments and APR. Mortgages meeting QM requirements but above certain thresholds are considered non-prime. QMs with a higher APR qualify for a rebuttable presumption of compliance, while safe harbor QMs have a conclusive presumption. Borrowers with prime mortgages must prove non-QM status to win a case. Lenders may prefer prime mortgages for safe harbor benefits. Borrowers with higher-priced mortgages can challenge lender compliance with the ATR rule. The CFPB established guidelines for Qualified Mortgages (QM) based on monthly payments and APR. Mortgages meeting QM requirements but exceeding certain thresholds are considered non-prime. Borrowers with prime mortgages must prove non-QM status to win a case. Lenders may prefer prime mortgages for safe harbor benefits. Borrowers with higher-priced mortgages can challenge lender compliance with the Ability-to-Repay (ATR) rule, where a reasonable and good faith determination of repayment ability is crucial. The CFPB established guidelines for Qualified Mortgages (QM) based on monthly payments and APR. The CFPB final rule establishes a Temporary Agency/GSE QM Option for loans eligible to be purchased by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or insured by government entities. Lenders can rebut the presumption of compliance with the option, balancing costs, certainty, and consumer protection. The Temporary Agency/GSE QM option provides lenders with compliance protection similar to the Standard QM option. It allows mortgages with DTI ratios above 43% to still receive QM status through less restrictive underwriting criteria used by GSEs and agencies. This option is not permanent and will expire when Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are removed from conservatorship. Freddie Mac will be removed from conservatorship, and the temporary QM option for government-insured loans will expire when each agency's own QM rule for mortgages it insures becomes effective. The CFPB's final rule allows for a new category of qualified mortgages with balloon payments for small creditors in rural or underserved areas. The CFPB's final rule introduces a new category of qualified mortgages with balloon payments for small creditors in rural or underserved areas. To qualify, lenders must meet specific criteria and the loan must meet certain requirements such as verifying borrower's income, having a fixed interest rate, and meeting affordability criteria. Balloon QM loans provide lenders with protection similar to general QM loans, depending on whether the mortgage is higher-priced or not. Small lenders have a higher threshold for safe harbor QM loans, with balloon mortgages used to reduce risk exposure. Some community banks use short-term balloon loans to hedge against interest rate risk. Balloon loans are used by community banks to hedge against interest rate risk, ensuring access to credit in rural areas. Lenders pass on interest rate risk to borrowers with balloon mortgages, adjusting to market rates after a certain period. The final rule requires lenders to keep balloon mortgages on their books for three years to address concerns about potential harm to borrowers from large balloon payments. This helps align the incentives of borrowers and lenders. The CFPB established a two-year transition period for small lenders to offer balloon mortgages that would receive qualified mortgage status if retained in the lender's portfolio and meet specific requirements. During this period, the CFPB will study adjustments to the definitions of 'rural' or 'underserved' and work with small creditors to transition to other qualified mortgage products. The CFPB established a category of QM for mortgages with DTI greater than 43% held by small creditors for at least three years. Safe harbor QM threshold for small lenders making balloon mortgages is increased to 3.5 percentage points above APOR. Lenders are exempt from verifying repayment ability when refinancing borrowers from non-standard to standard mortgages. The CFPB established a category of QM for mortgages with DTI greater than 43% held by small creditors for at least three years. Safe harbor QM threshold for small lenders making balloon mortgages is increased to 3.5 percentage points above APOR. Lenders are exempt from verifying repayment ability when refinancing borrowers from non-standard to standard mortgages, with specific criteria to be met for eligibility. The CFPB exempted certain creditors and lending programs from complying with the Ability-to-Repay rule, allowing for streamlined refinancing without full documentation. This exemption aims to reduce default risk for mortgage holders by lowering borrowers' monthly payments. Exempted lenders and programs include Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) approved by the government to assist low-income communities. Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) and Community Housing Development Organizations (CDHOs) provide financial products and services for affordable housing. Downpayment Assistance through Secondary Financing Providers (DAPs) and certain nonprofits also help low-to-moderate income consumers with financing. The final rule exempts certain entities like Housing Finance Agencies (HFAs) and programs authorized by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act to provide credit to low-to-moderate income consumers. It also allows consumers to recover special damages for violations of the ability-to-repay requirements within a three-year statute of limitations. The statute of limitations for ATR rule violations is generally three years, but there is no time limit for asserting a violation as a defense in foreclosure cases. The CFPB estimated potential damages for non-qualified mortgages, with average awards of $29,200 within three years and $51,250 after three years in foreclosure. Lenders' legal expenses are estimated at $25,500. The final rule by the CFPB sets limits on prepayment penalties for qualified mortgages, implementing the Dodd-Frank Act's prohibition on certain penalties. Lenders may pass on expected costs to borrowers through higher borrowing costs. Concerns have been raised about lenders only originating mortgages that meet safe harbor QM requirements. The CFPB's final rule on qualified mortgages sets limits on prepayment penalties, with concerns about lenders only offering mortgages that meet safe harbor QM requirements. The QM definition may restrict mortgage eligibility, highlighting the tradeoff between consumer protection and credit availability. The CFPB estimated compliance with the Ability-to-Repay rule in the 1997-2003 mortgage market. The CFPB analyzed the mortgage market from 1997-2003 and in 2011. Approximately 70% of mortgages from 1997-2003 would have received QM status. Most would have been safe harbor QM, with 1-4% as qualified mortgages subject to rebuttable presumption. An additional 22% would have satisfied the ATR rule, while 8% would not have complied. The CFPB estimated that close to 100% of the 2011 mortgage market would have been in compliance with the rule, with 76% as safe harbor QM, 2% as qualified mortgages with rebuttable presumption, and 22% subject to the ability-to-repay requirements. Data limitations may have led to overestimation of QM status for some mortgages due to points and fees, while underestimating others that would have qualified for rural balloon qualified mortgages. The CFPB estimated that nearly all of the 2011 mortgage market would comply with the rule, with over 95% eligible for qualified mortgage status, including the temporary QM option for GSE and government-insured loans. The analysis by the Congressional Budget Office found that most newly originated mortgages since 2008 would have been eligible for the Temporary Agency/GSE QM option. The CFPB expects its final rule to reduce future foreclosure rates and have a minimal effect on access to credit. Roughly four percent of qualified mortgages loans are estimated to ever be 60 days delinquent, with less than one percent expected to result in foreclosure. The final rule is not anticipated to significantly reduce consumers' access to mortgage credit, with any restrictions primarily affecting borrowers who would not have the ability to repay the loan. The CFPB's final rule aims to reduce future foreclosure rates and have a minimal impact on credit access. It is expected to primarily affect borrowers who may struggle to repay the loan, especially those with atypical financial characteristics. CoreLogic's analysis suggests a minor short-term impact on credit availability due to the new rule. The CFPB's final rule aims to reduce future foreclosure rates with minimal impact on credit access, primarily affecting borrowers with atypical financial characteristics. CoreLogic's analysis indicates a minor short-term impact on credit availability, especially for jumbo loans, which make up 10% of the mortgage market. CoreLogic's analysis of the CFPB's final rule did not include the points and fees cap or discuss the rural QM option. It may misestimate the number of loans that could receive QM status in the future by using 2010 mortgage market data. CoreLogic notes that a significant portion of mortgages not qualifying for a safe harbor is due to insufficient documentation, largely driven by high refinancing activity. The analysis does not consider potential changes in borrower and lender behavior to comply with the ATR rule. Amherst Securities studied the impact of the QM definition on jumbo loans in 2012. 24% of jumbo loans in the dataset would not receive QM status, with 10% exceeding the 43% debt-to-income ratio and 14% not meeting other QM requirements like interest-only payments or prepayment penalties. The ATR rule may have various effects on the mortgage market, including impacting who can qualify for a mortgage. CoreLogic suggests that offering QM status to loans meeting GSE underwriting standards reinforces the GSEs' dominant role. Some believe the final rule could reduce uncertainty, potentially allowing private capital to enter the market and lessen reliance on the GSEs. Regulatory uncertainty prior to the final rule's release hindered private capital from entering the mortgage market. The final ATR rule may reduce regulatory uncertainty and encourage private capital to enter the housing finance system. The FHFA directed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to limit future mortgage acquisitions to qualified mortgages, aiming to decrease the GSEs' role in the market. The FHFA's announcement aligns GSEs' standards with the Temporary Agency/GSE QM Option, restricting purchase of loans that do not meet certain criteria. This includes limitations on interest-only loans, negative amortization, high points and fees, and terms longer than 30 years. Some mortgages with DTI ratios above 43% may still be purchased. The CFPB's definition of \"rural\" for \"Balloon Mortgages in Rural or Underserved Areas\" is based on USDA's Urban Influence Codes. The CFPB's final rule on \"Balloon Mortgages in Rural or Underserved Areas\" uses a broader definition of rural based on USDA's Urban Influence Codes, including 9.7% of the population in rural areas. Some have called for a more expansive definition of rural, such as the Conference of State Bank Supervisors. The CFPB is considering different options for defining rural areas, including a petition process or using the USDA's Rural Housing Loan program's definition. Some prefer the latter, which would classify 37% of the population as rural with an average of 10 lenders per area. The CFPB, however, has not made a decision yet. The CFPB is reviewing options to define rural areas, including using the USDA's Rural Housing Loan program's definition. This could classify 37% of the population as rural with an average of 10 lenders per area. The CFPB has not made a final decision yet and has established a two-year transition period for small lenders not operating in rural or underserved areas. The Ability-to-Repay rule is part of the mortgage market rules required by the Dodd-Frank Act. Other rules, such as Risk Retention and Qualified Residential Mortgage rule, are expected to be finalized by other agencies soon. The CFPB is coordinating Title XIV Rulemakings, with concerns raised about the impact on credit availability and compliance burden in the mortgage market. To receive QM status, loans must not exceed points-and-fees caps, with different caps based on loan amounts. The CFPB sets caps on points and fees for loans to incentivize lenders to earn more through interest rates rather than upfront payments. This may lead lenders to take more care in originating loans. The Consumer Mortgage Choice Act, H.R. 1077, aims to make it easier for mortgages to qualify for QM status by removing certain items from the calculation of points and fees. This includes excluding insurance paid in escrow from the definition of points and fees. The bill, Consumer Mortgage Choice Act, H.R. 1077, aims to simplify mortgage qualification for QM status by excluding certain fees from the calculation of points and fees. This includes escrow insurance payments and fees paid to lender affiliates for title insurance. Compensation paid by a lender to its employees is also excluded from the definition of points and fees."
