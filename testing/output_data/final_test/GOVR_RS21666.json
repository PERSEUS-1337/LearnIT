    "content": "Tunisia's 2011 \"Jasmine Revolution\" ended authoritarian rule, leading to expanded civil liberties and democracy. A new constitution was adopted in 2014, with successful presidential and parliamentary elections. Political factions overcame crises through negotiations, earning a Nobel Peace Prize for Tunisian civil society groups. President B\u00e9ji Ca\u00efd Essebsi, founder of Nidaa Tounes party, is a 92-year-old political veteran. The ruling party in Tunisia, Nidaa Tounes, led by Prime Minister Youssef Chahed, has formed a coalition government with the main Islamist party, Al Nahda. The coalition has implemented economic reforms, political decentralization, and gender equality initiatives. However, fiscal austerity measures and a stalled transitional justice process have caused division. Prime Minister Chahed faces challenges retaining political support within the coalition due to public backlash against austerity measures and internal power struggles within Nidaa Tounes. The pragmatic partnership between Nidaa Tounes and Al Nahda in Tunisia is seen as necessary for stability in the new democracy, although critics view it as self-serving and alienating to party bases. Concerns include slow constitutional implementation, former-regime figures in top posts, government's strained relationship with civil society groups, and a prolonged state of emergency limiting civil liberties. Some Tunisians feel Nidaa Tounes resembles the old regime, with familiar politicians and practices. Tunisia faces challenges such as terrorism threats, economic decline, and corruption. Efforts to address socioeconomic grievances have not been successful, and the country has lost its \"upper middle income\" status. Despite sharing similarities with neighboring countries, Tunisia has unique attributes like a small territory, a liberalized economy, and a history of promoting women's rights. The population is predominantly Arabic-speaking and Sunni Muslim. Tunisia's population is predominantly Arabic-speaking and Sunni Muslim, with a culture influenced by Europe. Women in Tunisia have equal citizenship rights, the right to initiate divorce, and can serve in the military and various professions. The country's liberal Personal Status Code and educational reforms have contributed to women's advancements. Tunisia was previously seen as stable and authoritarian, with a focus on economic growth. Tunisia's regime, led by Bourguiba and Ben Ali, prioritized economic growth over political liberalization. Ben Ali relied on internal security services and the RCD party to maintain power, suppressing political participation and freedom of expression. Despite economic growth, corruption, nepotism, and a growing socioeconomic divide fueled popular discontent. Unrest often originated in the interior, leading to the 2011 uprising. The 2014 constitution was adopted to address these grievances. The 2014 constitution established a semi-presidential political system in Tunisia with a directly elected president and a strong legislature. The top two parties, Al Nahda and Nidaa Tounes, dominate post-2011 politics. Nidaa Tounes, a secularist party formed in 2012, won the most seats in the 2014 elections but has faced defections, leaving Al Nahda with the largest bloc. The secularist leftist Popular Front is the largest opposition party in parliament. The Popular Front (FP) in Tunisia includes activists from banned parties, with two members assassinated in 2013. Al Nahda and Nida Tounes, wary rivals, share power in \"consensus politics.\" Al Nahda presents as \"Muslim Democrats\" and both parties advocate for a government of \"national unity\" for stability and economic reforms. The alliance aims to prevent further Islamist-secularist polarization and political exclusion of former-regime figures. In 2017, Tunisia's democratic trajectory raised concerns as parliament passed a controversial amnesty law for state employees involved in corruption. President Ca\u00efd Essebsi's cabinet reshuffle included ministers with ties to the Ben Ali regime, sparking worries about democratic consolidation. President Essebsi's consideration of changing the constitution deepened concerns about strengthening the presidency at the expense of democracy. In May 2018, Tunisia held local elections to fill posts created under a new political decentralization law, seen as a key step towards more accountable governance. Turnout was low at 34%, with Al Nahda winning 29% of votes and Nidaa Tounes at 21%. Independent lists collectively garnered 32% nationally, signaling uncertainty in future political competition. The future political competition in Tunisia is uncertain ahead of the 2019 national elections. Nidaa Tounes, a party with a diverse base, is struggling with internal fractures. The president, aged 92, has not confirmed if he will run for another term. There is controversy within the party over an alliance with Al Nahda, leading to senior figures leaving. Prime Minister Youssef Chahed faces pressure to resign due to fiscal austerity measures. There are perceptions that the president is grooming his son to succeed him, causing backlash and splits within the ruling party. Some Tunisian Islamists do not support Al Nahda, leading to backlash and splits within the ruling party. Salafists, including some who advocate for an Islamic state, have challenged government authorities and other groups through protests and violence. Armed Islamist extremist groups in North and West Africa have taken advantage of porous borders and security weaknesses since 2011. Armed Islamist extremist groups in North and West Africa have exploited divisive identity issues and frustrations with governance. Some have ties to Al Qaeda or ISIS, while others focus on local objectives. Tunisia has seen the rise of violent extremist organizations since 2011, with threats from groups in Libya. Notably, Ansar al Sharia was blamed for an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Tunis in 2012. In 2012, a school in Tunis was attacked by a terrorist group. Tunisia declared the group a terrorist organization in 2013, and the U.S. designated it as a Foreign Terrorist Organization in 2014. The group's leader, Abou Iyadh, was reportedly killed in a U.S. airstrike in Libya in 2015. Terrorist attacks in Tunis and Sousse in 2015 caused fear and impacted the tourism sector. An IS-linked assault in Ben Guerdane in early 2016 raised concerns of domestic insurgency. Security conditions have improved since then, partly due to changes in the security apparatus and donor assistance. Tunisia has been a significant source of Islamist foreign fighters in Syria and Libya, with some attacks in Europe linked to Tunisian fighters. In April 2017, Tunisia had around 3,000 militants active abroad, with 760 killed and 800 returning. The country's high number of foreign fighters may be due to youth marginalization and the release of terrorism suspects in 2011. Tunisia has a diverse economy with key sectors in textile exports, tourism, agriculture, and phosphate mining. It is also a net energy-importer and was an upper-middle-income country until recently. After President Ben Ali was ousted in 2011, Tunisia faced challenges with corruption, inequalities, and a concentration of wealth along the coast. Efforts to promote growth and create jobs have been hindered by political risk, terrorist attacks, and labor unrest. Per-capita GDP has declined every year since 2014. Per-capita GDP in Tunisia has fallen annually since 2014, dropping below the upper middle-income threshold in 2015. Youth unemployment remains high, and corruption has increased since the political transition, leading to regional divisions. Economic growth is expected to reach 2.4% in 2018, driven by strong agricultural production and exports. The IMF has raised concerns about rising inflation, declining foreign exchange reserves, and urged policymakers to reduce energy subsidies, public sector wages, and pensions. Tunisia's austerity measures, supported by Prime Minister Chahed, have led to protests due to cuts in state subsidies for fuel and consumer goods. The powerful UGTT trade union opposes these measures, warning of worsening economic and social crises. Domestic opposition is expected for further economic reforms, including protectionist trade policies and labor law liberalization. Calls for economic reforms focus on combating high-level corruption. U.S. engagement and aid to Tunisia have increased since 2011, following the country's peaceful political transition. The United States has increased bilateral assistance funding to Tunisia following the country's peaceful political transition. President Trump and President Ca\u00efd Essebsi discussed Tunisia's democratic transition and security threats, reaffirming the historic relationship between the two countries. Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan visited Tunisia to show support for security improvements and economic modernization efforts. U.S. military conducts ISR activities at a Tunisian facility, and Special Operations Forces assist in counterterrorism operations. The United States has increased bilateral assistance funding to Tunisia following the country's peaceful political transition. President Obama designated Tunisia a Major Non-North Atlantic Treaty Organization Ally in 2015, reflecting the historic relationship between the two countries. Tunisia cooperates with NATO's Operation Active Endeavor for counterterrorism surveillance in the Mediterranean and participates in NATO's Mediterranean Dialogue. The U.S. Agency for International Development opened an office in Tunis in 2014, providing economic aid support. U.S. bilateral aid to Tunisia totaled $205.4 million in FY2017, focusing on fiscal stabilization, economic growth, good governance, and civil society capacity-building. The United States has increased bilateral assistance funding to Tunisia following the country's peaceful political transition. U.S. economic assistance supports stabilization, economic growth initiatives, good governance, civil society capacity-building, and assistance to the police and military. A U.S.-endowed Tunisian-American Enterprise Fund invests in small- and medium-sized enterprises, and U.S. loan guarantees have allowed Tunisia to access up to $1.5 billion in affordable financing. Military aid from the State Department and Department of Defense focuses on counterterrorism and border security. The Trump Administration proposed $54.6 million in bilateral aid for Tunisia in FY2018, but the FY2018 Appropriations Act provided $165.4 million. The FY2019 aid budget request is $94.5 million, with additional funding from the U.S. Millennium Challenge Corporation for a development compact. The FY2019 budget proposal includes $292 million for a multi-year development compact with Tunisia to address water scarcity and job creation regulations. Tunisia has increased its acquisitions of U.S. defense materiel to enhance its counterterrorism capacity. U.S.-Tunisian relations date back over 200 years, with ties strained at times, such as during the 1985 Israeli bombing of Palestine. In the 1960s, U.S.-Tunisian ties were strained by the 1985 Israeli bombing of the Palestine Liberation Organization headquarters in Tunis. The 2012 attack on the U.S. embassy and American school also affected relations. Despite achieving political milestones since 2011, Tunisia faces internal tensions, security threats, and regional challenges. It remains a potential battleground for rival political ideologies and extremist groups. Tunisia's coalition government faces challenges from violent extremist groups. Key questions include its response to terrorist threats, political and economic reforms, civil liberties, and popular demands for improvements. Tunisian leaders welcome U.S. assistance, but local resistance to outside policy influence has been observed."
