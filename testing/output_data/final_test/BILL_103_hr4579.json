    "content": "The Act titled \"Section 515 Rural Housing Reform\" amends Title V of the Housing Act of 1949. It restricts the Secretary from accepting prepayment offers or refinancing requests for loans made under section 515 for a minimum of two years from the enactment of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1994. An independent assessment of the situation is required to be conducted by the Secretary. The Act requires an independent assessment of rural housing preservation provisions to be submitted to Congress by May 31, 1996. Section 502(c)(4)(C) is amended to only approve assistance if the restrictive period for loans made under sections 514 or 515 has expired. Title V of the Housing Act of 1949 is amended to change the loan term from fifty to thirty years and allow for rescheduling of loans for up to fifty years. Sec. 301 amends Section 515(t) of the Housing Act of 1949 by renumbering paragraphs. Sec. 401 modifies Section 510(d)(1) regarding litigation under Section 515. Sec. 501 adds a new subparagraph to the Internal Revenue Code related to housing assistance programs. Sec. 601 pertains to Section 536 of the Housing Act. Sec. 601 of the Housing Act authorizes the Secretary to establish a process for evaluating assistance to prevent excess aid. The evaluation will utilize information from previous sections and may align with HUD procedures. Section 509(f) of the Housing Act of 1949 is amended to designate targeted underserved areas with severe housing needs. Eligibility is based on unmet housing needs in the preceding 5-year period. The designation of targeted underserved areas with severe housing needs is based on unmet housing needs in the preceding 5-year period. Eligible areas must have received substantially lower assistance compared to other counties on a per capita basis, with at least 15% of the population below the poverty level and 5% residing in substandard housing. The Secretary gives preference to projects in these areas when selecting projects for assistance. The Secretary gives preference to projects in underserved areas with high poverty levels and substandard housing conditions. At least 5 counties or communities with tribal allotted or Indian trust land must be designated each fiscal year. No more than 10 counties or communities in one State or Puerto Rico can be designated during each cycle. The Secretary prioritizes projects in underserved areas with high poverty levels and substandard housing conditions. The top 10 most underserved counties or communities will be selected based on population below the poverty level and households in substandard housing. Additional underserved areas may be designated based on severe housing needs, natural disasters, consistent poverty, or colonias. The Secretary may set aside funds for underserved applicants, including socially disadvantaged persons such as women, blacks, Hispanics, Asian and Pacific Islanders, and Native Americans. Underserved applicants are those who have received significantly lower assistance compared to their proportionate percentage of the rural population in the 5-year period preceding the designation. The Secretary will publicize grants and loans availability to underserved areas and promote efforts to apply. After the 1990 census data, a review will be conducted on designations and preferences, with a report to Congress within 9 months. The Secretary will set aside 5-10% of lending authority for targeted underserved housing and colonias each fiscal year. Reports to Congress will include recommendations for modifications to promote assistance targeting based on decennial census data. During each fiscal year, the Secretary will allocate section 521 rental assistance and other program assistance to provide for underserved housing. Any unspent assistance for targeted underserved areas will be reallocated for use in colonias that meet eligibility criteria. The procedure for reallocating unspent assistance for underserved areas ensures that any remaining funds are made available for allocation under relevant laws and regulations. Underserved areas designated under paragraph (1) will retain their designation for two years. Designated underserved areas shall remain designated for two years, except for counties with tribal allotted or Indian trust land, which shall remain designated for three years. Colonias are eligible for assistance with reserved amounts, with priority given by the Secretary each fiscal year. The Secretary prioritizes assistance for colonias in designated underserved areas, with a focus on states described under clause (iii). Once 10 percent of assistance is provided to a state or an average size loan, the priority no longer applies to applications in that state. This applies to the total amount of assistance allocated to any state. The Secretary prioritizes assistance for colonias in designated underserved areas, with a focus on states described under clause (iii). Grants are provided to promote affordable housing development in targeted underserved areas and colonias. The Secretary determines the amount of project preparation assistance grants based on customary costs for loan or grant applications. The Secretary must approve or disapprove loan or grant applications within 60 days of receipt. Loan or grant amounts will be adjusted to include project preparation costs paid from grant proceeds. Priority for colonias in providing assistance under this title shall be given by each State where colonias are located in any fiscal year. Eligible applicants include nonprofit organizations, community housing development organizations, States, local governments, or agencies. Funding for this purpose remains available until expended. In any fiscal year, priority for assistance under this title shall be given to colonias in Arizona, California, New Mexico, or Texas. The definition of a colonia is an identifiable community in these states. This priority does not apply after 5 percent of the assistance available has been allocated to qualifying colonias. This provision applies to states that have not obligated the total assistance allocated to them in the previous two fiscal years. The text chunk discusses the criteria for defining a colonia, including its location near the US-Mexico border, lack of essential services, and existence before a specific date. Additionally, it mentions amendments to the Housing Act of 1949 regarding fees for colonias. No fee other than a late fee or reasonable application fee not to exceed one-half of one percent of the proposed mortgage amount may be imposed on a loan made or insured under this section. The application fee will help cover the cost of professional market studies and may be waived for non-profit applicants not receiving tax credit benefits under section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code."
