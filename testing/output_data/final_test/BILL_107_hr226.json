    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Family Income to Respond to Significant Transitions Insurance Act\". The Congress acknowledges the importance of paid parental leave for infant care, highlighting the impact of parent-infant interactions on infant development. It notes that many employees cannot afford to take family or medical leave, despite the benefits of wage replacement not being equally shared in the workforce. Employees with lower education and income, as well as female, minority, and younger employees, are less likely to receive wage replacement during family or medical leave. Those without full wage replacement often cut their leave short, delay bill payments, borrow money, or seek public assistance. Compared to 30 years ago, families have experienced a 22-hour per week decrease in time spent with children. Studies show that shortages in infant care are expected to worsen with welfare reform, leading to low-wage employees resorting to public assistance when taking family or medical leave without full wage replacement. The Act aims to establish a program providing wage replacement for new parents to spend time with their children and learn about effective mechanisms for assistance. The definitions in the Act include terms like \"Secretary\" and \"son or daughter.\" SEC. 5. DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS. The Secretary will provide grants to eligible entities for 5 years to assist families with wage replacement for caregiving needs. Eligible entities include States or political subdivisions. Funds can be used for wage replacement directly or through insurance programs. To receive wage replacement under the grant, eligible individuals must meet specified criteria set by the entity providing the replacement. Administrative costs for projects funded by the grant cannot exceed 10% of the total funds over a 5-year period. Eligible individuals for wage replacement must meet specific criteria set by the entity providing the replacement. This includes individuals taking leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 for specified reasons. To be eligible for a grant under this section, an entity must submit an application to the Secretary with a project plan and evidence of consultation with employers and employees. The entity must meet specific criteria for wage replacement, including leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. Representatives of employers and employees, including labor organizations, collaborate in developing the project plan. The plan includes estimates of costs and benefits, information on families covered, criteria for eligibility for wage replacement, expansion on existing systems, and how wage replacement assistance will be provided. The project will provide replacement assistance to families when an individual takes leave. The selection criteria for grant recipients include project scope, cost-effectiveness, expanding access to wage replacement for family caregiving needs, and benefits for families. The proposed projects aim to offer benefits to families and children, utilizing diverse mechanisms such as expanding State unemployment compensation and temporary disability insurance programs for wage replacement. The Federal share of costs decreases over the grant period, starting at 50% in the first year and decreasing to 20% in subsequent years. The non-Federal share of costs is also required. The non-Federal share of the cost for projects may be in cash or in kind, including plant, equipment, and services from various sources. Funds from this Act should supplement, not replace, other public and private funds for wage replacement. The Act does not override existing collective bargaining agreements or employment benefit programs that offer greater rights to employees. SEC. 6. EVALUATIONS AND REPORTS. The Secretary will allocate up to 2 percent of funds for evaluations of projects funded under section 5, comparing project scopes, utilization, and benefits provided. The Secretary will prepare a report on the characteristics of individuals benefiting from projects, costs, savings, and overall need for wage replacement. This report will be submitted to Congress within 3 years of the grant period. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress containing information from evaluations and usage data for demonstration projects annually, starting 4 years after the grant period. Authorization of appropriations for the Act includes $400,000,000 for fiscal year 2002 and necessary sums for subsequent years."
