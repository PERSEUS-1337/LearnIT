The Bangladeshi Adjustment Act allows for the adjustment of status to permanent residence for eligible aliens before July 1, 2001, excluding certain grounds for inadmissibility. The Bangladeshi Adjustment Act allows eligible aliens, including nationals of Bangladesh, who have been excluded, deported, or ordered to depart from the United States, to apply for adjustment of status without needing to file a separate motion. If the application is granted, the order is canceled; if denied, the order remains enforceable. The Bangladeshi Adjustment Act applies to Bangladeshi nationals who have been physically present in the US since July 1, 1989, with allowances for absences totaling 180 days. Proof of continuous presence before July 1, 1989, is required for adjustment of status.

The Attorney General may authorize an alien to work during the pendency of an application, and if the application exceeds 180 days without denial, employment authorization shall be granted.

The Immigration and Nationality Act definitions apply to this section. The Attorney General's powers in immigration enforcement are not affected. Eligibility for permanent residence status under this section does not prevent seeking it under other laws."
