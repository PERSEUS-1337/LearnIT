    "content": "On May 29, 1993, 66 nations approved the Hague Adoption Convention, establishing uniform standards to protect the rights of children, birth parents, and adoptive parents in intercountry adoptions. The Convention mandates the creation of a national Central Authority in each signatory country to oversee international adoption processes and cooperation among countries. The Hague Adoption Convention, established on May 29, 1993, aims to facilitate international adoption cooperation among signatory countries. It ensures the recognition of adoptions certified through its provisions. The Convention has entered into force in 75 countries, including the United States in 2008. To be fully operative, countries must sign, ratify domestically, and deposit approval instruments with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The United States signed the Hague Adoption Convention on March 31, 1994, and ratified it on September 20, 2000, with specific qualifications regarding adoption service providers and the implementation of federal law. The Convention aims to facilitate international adoption cooperation among signatory countries. The United States ratified the Hague Adoption Convention on September 20, 2000, with the International Adoption Act of 2000 establishing the administrative framework for implementation. Private agencies were permitted to provide adoptive services under the Convention, with the U.S. Department of State overseeing these functions as the Central Authority. Administrative actions by the DOS were necessary before ratification could be finalized. The DOS published final rules on accreditation and approval for international adoption under the Convention on February 15, 2006. These regulations cover the approval of adoption service providers and the federal government's preservation of Convention records. Extensive preparations were required before formal ratification, including establishing and staffing the Central Authority. The final rules on accreditation and approval for international adoption under the Convention were published by the DOS on February 15, 2006. Preparations for formal ratification included establishing the Central Authority and promulgating regulations for accrediting entities, adoption agency standards, case-tracking system, and accreditation of adoption providers. The DOS completed preparations for ratification of the Convention in late 2007, including accrediting entities, overseeing adoption provider lists, establishing education programs, and depositing the U.S. instrument of ratification. The United States became a full member of the Hague Adoption Convention after depositing the instrument of ratification in The Hague. The Department of State has new responsibilities for intercountry adoption under the Convention, including reporting to Congress and other countries. Prior to the Convention, adoptions in the U.S. were governed by state law only, but now state authorities must comply with the Convention and the Intercountry Adoption Act. The United States is a full member of the Hague Adoption Convention since April 1, 2008, governing intercountry adoptions with other member countries. The Department of State has new responsibilities for ensuring compliance with the Convention, requiring close cooperation with state authorities. DOS maintains oversight, reporting, and record-keeping duties related to intercountry adoptions."
