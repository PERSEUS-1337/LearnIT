    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Detention of Enemy Combatants Act\". The Congress finds that the al Qaeda terrorist organization has committed attacks against the United States, including the bombings of U.S. Embassies and the USS Cole, and poses a threat of using weapons of mass destruction. The United Nations Security Council has declared these attacks as a threat to international peace and security. The United States has the right to self-defense under international law and the UN Charter. Congress authorized the President to use force against those responsible for the September 11 attacks to prevent future terrorism. The US is in armed conflict with al Qaeda, which has a presence in over 60 nations worldwide. The term \"enemy combatant\" in the war on terrorism is broad and not defined by simple criteria like citizenship or military uniform. American citizens have been detained as enemy combatants in the past, as seen in Ex Parte Quirin. In Ex Parte Quirin, 2 of the 8 German soldiers who planned sabotage in the US claimed American citizenship. Detention of enemy combatants who are US citizens is necessary for public safety, intelligence gathering, and national security. The Executive has the authority to establish regulations for detaining US citizens as enemy combatants. The Congress authorizes the President to detain enemy combatants who are United States persons under Section 4001(a) of title 18, United States Code. This provision ensures that any detention of US citizens must be pursuant to an Act of Congress, as Chief Justice Burger emphasized in Howe v. Smith. During wartime, a nation must take extraordinary steps to protect itself, including measures that would never be acceptable during peacetime. Nonetheless, \"the Constitution of the United States is a law for rulers and people, equally in war and in peace, and covers with the shield of its protection all classes of men, at all times, and under all circumstances.\" Ex Parte Milligan. Nothing in this Act permits the Government, even in wartime, to detain American citizens or other persons lawfully in the United States as enemy combatants indefinitely. The Supreme Court has ruled that citizens held in the United States as enemy combatants must have a chance to challenge their detention before a neutral decisionmaker. Even enemy aliens in the US are entitled to habeas review of their conviction. The validity of detaining citizens as enemy combatants can be challenged through a writ of habeas corpus. Citizens detained as enemy combatants have the right to challenge their detention through a writ of habeas corpus. Access to counsel is crucial to ensure this right is not nullified. Congress must oversee detentions to ensure they align with due process. SEC. 3. DETENTION OF ENEMY COMBATANTS. (a) A United States person or resident may be detained as an enemy combatant if they are a member of al Qaeda or knowingly cooperated with them in terrorist acts against the United States. This does not apply to individuals who are prisoners of war under the Geneva Convention. (b) The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with other officials, will establish procedural rules for the detention of enemy combatants. The standards, process, and criteria for determining an American citizen or lawful resident as an enemy combatant and their detention. SEC. 4. PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS. The rules for detaining enemy combatants must establish clear standards and procedures for detaining US persons or residents, ensuring the government's ability to detain potential threats, gather intelligence, and protect sensitive information. These rules should also provide timely access to judicial review and allow detainees access to counsel. The duration of detention for a United States person or resident under section 3 is limited to when there is a certification by the President that the Armed Forces are in armed conflict with al Qaeda or detention is necessary to prevent aiding terrorist acts. Certification is valid for 180 days. The President may make successive certifications under paragraph (1) for 180 days. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia has exclusive jurisdiction to review detentions under this Act. Detainees must be treated humanely, provided with basic necessities, and housed in hygienic conditions designated by the Secretary of Defense. Detainees must be treated humanely, provided with basic necessities, including necessary personal hygiene, and allowed to exercise their religion in detention. The President must report to Congress every 12 months on the use of the authority granted by this Act, specifying individuals detained under it. The definition of \"United States person or resident\" includes US citizens and lawful permanent residents. The authority granted by this Act expires on December 31, 2007."
