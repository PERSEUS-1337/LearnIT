    "content": "The American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) provides financial assistance for post-secondary education. This report examines how the AOTC works, its impact on higher education attendance, and administrative issues. It also includes a legislative history and analysis of the credit's economic impact. The American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) allows eligible taxpayers to reduce federal income taxes by up to $2,500 per student. It replaced the Hope Credit temporarily in 2009 and 2010, was extended through 2017, and made permanent by the PATH Act, eliminating the Hope Credit. The American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) is a permanent tax credit that replaced the Hope Credit. It allows eligible students to claim up to $2,500 for qualifying education expenses. The credit phases out for taxpayers with income above $90,000 ($180,000 for married couples filing jointly) and is refundable, benefiting taxpayers with little to no tax liability. The American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) is a refundable tax credit that can benefit taxpayers with little to no tax liability. The refundable portion is calculated as 40% of the credit value based on qualifying education expenses. Qualifying students include the taxpayer, spouse, or dependent. There are limitations on who can claim the AOTC and what expenses qualify for the credit. The American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) is available for taxpayers, spouses, or dependents, with limitations on eligibility. Requirements include being in the first four years of post-secondary education, enrolled in a degree program, and taking at least half-time courses for at least one academic period in the tax year claimed. The credit can only be claimed for four years per student. The American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) has specific requirements for eligibility, including being in the first four years of post-secondary education, enrolled in a degree program, and taking at least half-time courses for at least one academic period in the tax year claimed. Qualifying education expenses are limited to tuition and certain required expenses for enrollment at a higher education institution. Expenses such as room and board, insurance, medical fees, transportation, and personal expenses do not qualify for the AOTC. Additionally, students must not have a felony drug conviction to claim the credit. Qualifying education expenses for the AOTC must be reduced by tax-free education assistance received. Expenses claimed must be incurred in the same tax year. Reporting tax-free grants may not require reducing education expenses. President Trump signed into law P.L. 115-97 at the end of 2017, which made numerous changes to the tax credit for education expenses. Qualifying expenses for the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) must be incurred in the same tax year or the first three months of the following year. If expenses used to calculate the credit are refunded, the taxpayer must recalculate the credit value. Dependent students' expenses are treated as if paid by the taxpayer, and qualifying students can claim the credit if the taxpayer does not claim an exemption for them. President Trump signed P.L. 115-97 in 2017, changing the tax credit for education expenses. The dependent exemption was set to zero until 2025, but this doesn't affect the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC). Taxpayers and students must provide their taxpayer ID number to claim the credit, which must have been issued before the due date of the return. If the ID wasn't obtained by the due date for filing 2017 taxes, the AOTC couldn't be claimed on the return. Taxpayers must provide their employer identification number (EIN) for institutions where expenses were paid for the student to claim the AOTC. Failure to provide the EIN may result in denial of the credit. A tax filer can be barred from claiming the AOTC for 10 years for a fraudulent claim, or 2 years for reckless disregard of the rules. Higher education tax credits, first enacted in 1997, originated in the 1960s during consideration of the Higher Education Act of 1965. The Johnson Administration opposed tuition credits, believing they would reduce revenues for financial aid programs. Treasury Secretary Stanley Surrey stated that a tax credit for higher education would not result in additional attendance. Surrey argued against higher education tax credits, stating they wouldn't increase college attendance. He suggested using the lost revenue for direct financial assistance to students in need. Congress in the late 1970s considered tax credits but instead expanded federal student aid programs. President Clinton later proposed the Hope Scholarship. President Clinton proposed the Hope Credit at Princeton University, aiming to make the first two years of higher education universal and affordable. The credit would provide a tax credit for students with a B average in high school to cover tuition costs at community colleges, inspired by Georgia's HOPE Scholarship. The Hope Credit was enacted as part of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, providing eligible taxpayers with up to a $1,500 credit for tuition expenses for the first two years of higher education. The requirement for students to maintain a B average in high school for eligibility was dropped. Additionally, the Lifetime Learning Credit was created for education beyond the first two years. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 introduced the Lifetime Learning Credit, which was valued less than the Hope Credit for many taxpayers. In 2008, Barack Obama proposed replacing both credits with the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC), offering up to $4,000 annually for qualifying higher education expenses. The AOTC was fully refundable, benefiting low-income Americans, and the credit would be directly provided to the educational institution. The American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) was enacted with a value of $2,500, requiring 100 hours of community service from students. It replaced the Hope Credit and was partially refundable, benefiting taxpayers with little or no tax liability. Unlike the proposed version, the AOTC did not go directly to educational institutions but was claimed by eligible individuals. The American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) was extended multiple times, eventually becoming permanent under the PATH Act. The credit did not go directly to educational institutions but was claimed by eligible households. The community service requirement was not included in the final provision of the credit. The AOTC has led to a significant increase in education credits claimed by taxpayers, especially benefiting middle-income and upper-middle-income individuals. Congress may want to assess the economic impact of this provision, which has been part of federal financial assistance for higher education since 1997. The AOTC is an effective tax policy for encouraging post-secondary education, but research suggests it may not significantly increase attendance, especially for middle- and upper-middle-income taxpayers. The credit may not be influencing behavior as intended and may have administrative issues. The AOTC primarily benefits middle-income taxpayers, with some benefits also going to lower-income and upper-middle-income taxpayers. In 2015, 46.6% of AOTC dollars were claimed by taxpayers with income between $30,000 and $100,000. The credit is available to low- and upper-income taxpayers through its refundability component. The AOTC is a tax credit that benefits middle-income taxpayers, with some benefits also going to lower-income and upper-middle-income taxpayers. It is refundable, allowing taxpayers to receive up to 40% of the credit as a refund, even if they have no tax liability. In 2015, taxpayers with income under $10,000 received 6.2% of AOTC benefits, while those with income between $10,000 and $20,000 received 12.2% of benefits. The majority of the credit's value comes from its refundable portion, with over half claimed by taxpayers with less than $20,000 income. The AOTC benefits middle-income taxpayers, with some benefits extending to lower and upper-middle-income taxpayers. The credit is refundable, with taxpayers able to receive up to 40% as a refund. In 2015, taxpayers with incomes between $50,000 and $200,000 claimed 7.1% of the refundable portion of the AOTC. The credit is available to taxpayers with income up to $90,000 ($180,000 for married joint filers), and in 2015, those with incomes between $100,000 and $200,000 claimed $3.8 billion of the credit. The AOTC has shifted more benefits to higher-income taxpayers compared to its predecessor, the Hope Credit. In contrast, over a fifth (22.9%) of AOTC dollars was claimed by taxpayers with income between $100,000 and $200,000, more than six times the share of Hope Credit dollars (3.4%) claimed by taxpayers in this income class. Notably, these gains were accompanied by the reduction in the share of AOTC dollars that went to taxpayers with income between $20,000 and $100,000. Specifically, 89.8% of Hope Credit dollars was claimed by taxpayers in this income range, compared to 58.7% of AOTC dollars. This shift in benefits may not increase enrollment at higher education institutions but instead reward behavior that would have occurred regardless of the incentive. The American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) aims to increase college attendance by subsidizing costs associated with higher education. Factors influencing student attendance include family socioeconomic level, educational aspirations, peer support, academic performance, and college expenses. AOTC benefits individuals with higher wages and societal benefits like increased productivity and innovation. The American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) subsidizes higher education costs, potentially influencing college attendance based on students' sensitivity to price. Some students may be induced to attend college due to cost reduction, while others would attend regardless, making the credit a windfall gain for certain taxpayers. Studies on the impact of education tax incentives on college attendance have shown mixed results. Research on education tax incentives like the Hope Credit, Lifetime Learning Credit, and tuition deduction found that tax credits did not significantly increase college enrollment. Recent studies show that while tax-based aid influenced college attendance, 93% of recipients would have attended college even without these benefits. Research on education tax incentives like the Hope Credit, Lifetime Learning Credit, and tuition deduction found that tax credits did not significantly increase college enrollment. One study noted that education credits had \"a meager effect on college-going.\" Another study found that the tax credit and tax deduction do not affect school decisions. Factors limiting the impact of the AOTC on college attendance include the income level of beneficiaries, with lower-income students being more sensitive to college costs. The AOTC primarily benefits middle-income taxpayers and may result in a windfall to many of them. Unlike aid and loans received before attendance, the AOTC can be received up to 15 months after education expenses. For families with limited resources, tax credits may not significantly help finance college costs. However, the AOTC could help families reduce loan balances. Tax benefits like the AOTC, Lifetime Learning Credit, and tuition deduction can provide financial relief for students and families when filing taxes. The complexity of these benefits, including eligibility criteria and income phase-outs, can make it challenging for taxpayers to determine which option is most beneficial. This complexity may lead some taxpayers to not claim certain benefits, resulting in missed opportunities for savings. Studies have shown that a significant percentage of taxpayers do not claim available tax benefits. Studies have found that 27% to 37% of taxpayers fail to claim eligible education tax benefits, leading to missed opportunities for savings. Experts are concerned that colleges may increase tuition in response to education tax credits, potentially negating the benefits for students. Research suggests that the Hope and Lifetime Learning Credits do not lead to tuition increases. The AOTC may not significantly increase college attendance, similar to other forms of federal financial aid like Pell Grants. Factors like college preparedness also play a role in student attendance. Other societal factors, such as college preparedness and income levels, may limit the impact of financial aid on increasing college attendance, especially among lower-income students. Taxpayers are more likely to claim tax benefits when they are easy to claim, but this simplicity can lead to errors, as shown in a 2015 report on the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC). The TIGTA report identified over $5.8 billion in potentially erroneous AOTC credits claimed by taxpayers. The majority of these credits ($3.2 billion) were due to the IRS being unable to confirm students' attendance at a college or university. Another $1.3 billion in credits were claimed for students not attending eligible educational institutions. The IRS could verify student attendance by matching information from colleges' 1098-T forms with tax returns. The TIGTA report highlighted potential errors in claiming AOTC credits, with discrepancies in 1098-T forms and tax returns. TIGTA recommended filing 1098-Ts by January 31 to improve verification processes. The IRS does not have the audit resources to significantly reduce erroneous claims of the AOTC, despite recommendations to use Education databases for verification. Coordination with the Department of Education may help flag questionable returns for audit. The IRS lacks resources to reduce erroneous AOTC claims, despite recommendations to use Education databases for verification. Legislation may be needed to grant the IRS authority to deny erroneous claims before issuing refunds. Congress could consider modifying the AOTC or consolidating it with other education tax benefits. Additionally, policymakers may choose to modify the AOTC in various ways to address the issue. The AOTC could be modified in several ways, such as changing the credit formula, adjusting qualifying expenses, refundable portion, income level phase-out, duration of eligibility, definition of expenses, and including nondegree-seeking students. Changes could expand the credit to lower-income recipients by making a higher percentage refundable or lowering expense requirements. The AOTC could be modified to lower expenses needed for maximum credit or increase income level for upper-income taxpayers. Consolidating AOTC with other education tax incentives like Lifetime Learning Credit may reduce confusion for taxpayers. Senator Baucus introduced the Education Competitiveness Act of 2006 to consolidate these tax benefits. Senator Baucus introduced the Education Competitiveness Act of 2006 (S. 3902) to replace the Hope and Lifetime Learning Credits with a $2,000 higher education tax credit. The Universal Higher Education and Lifetime Learning Act of 2007 (H.R. 2458) combined these credits into one $3,000 partially refundable credit with a $12,000 lifetime limit per student. The House-passed version of H.R. 1 aimed to eliminate the Lifetime Learning Credit and expand the AOTC to a five-year credit. The AOTC was considered for expansion to a five-year credit, costing $17.8 billion. However, this change was not included in the final bill signed into law in December 2017. Policymakers may reevaluate education tax credits and federal financing for higher education. Policymakers could expand federal financial aid options for higher education, such as broadening expenses covered by the AOTC to benefit low-income students using Pell Grants. They may also consider alternative financing mechanisms like human capital contracts. Taking a holistic approach to higher education policy could provide more benefits to low- and middle-income students. Under current law, taxpayers have various benefits for higher education expenses, including the AOTC, Hope Credit, Lifetime Learning Credit, and tuition and fees deduction. Taxpayers cannot claim both a deduction and an education credit for the same student in the same year. Details on the Lifetime Learning Credit and tuition and fees deduction are provided. The Smiths pay $8,000 for Sarah's college expenses, with $6,000 for tuition qualifying for the AOTC. Sarah receives a $4,000 tax-free scholarship and uses student loans to cover the rest. She is eligible for the AOTC as a first-year undergraduate at University X. Sarah, claimed as a dependent by the Smiths, has $6,000 in qualifying expenses for the AOTC. Her tax-free scholarship of $4,000 reduces her qualifying expenses to $2,000. Therefore, her parents can claim a $2,000 AOTC."
