    "title": "SB 738",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 49414 of the Education Code is amended to require schools to provide emergency epinephrine auto-injectors to trained personnel for anaphylactic reactions. Anaphylaxis is defined as a life-threatening hypersensitivity with symptoms like shortness of breath, hives, and swelling, caused by various factors such as insect stings or food allergies. An \"epinephrine auto-injector\" is a device for emergency administration of epinephrine for anaphylaxis. A \"qualified supervisor of health\" can include a school nurse. A \"volunteer\" or \"trained personnel\" is an employee designated by a school to administer epinephrine auto-injectors after receiving training. Private elementary and secondary schools in the state have the option to decide whether to have emergency epinephrine auto-injectors and trained personnel available. They must consider the emergency medical response time and decide if using emergency medical services is a suitable alternative. Schools choosing to provide epinephrine auto-injectors and trained personnel will not receive state funds for this purpose. Each school in the state can appoint volunteers for training on the storage and use of epinephrine auto-injectors as per set standards. The Superintendent reviews minimum training standards for administering epinephrine auto-injectors every five years, consulting with various organizations and experts in the field. Training under this subdivision includes recognizing anaphylaxis symptoms, storing and using epinephrine auto-injectors, emergency procedures, CPR certification, determining appropriate injector type based on pupil's age/grade, and providing written materials. A school district, county office of education, or charter school must provide written materials and distribute a notice annually to staff about training volunteers to administer epinephrine auto-injectors for anaphylaxis. A qualified supervisor of health at a school district, county office of education, or charter school must obtain a prescription for epinephrine auto-injectors for each school, including one regular and one junior injector for elementary schools, and one regular injector for junior high, middle, and high schools if needed. The supervisor is responsible for stocking and restocking the auto-injectors when used. If a school district, county office of education, or charter school lacks a qualified health supervisor, an administrator must fulfill their duties. Prescriptions for epinephrine auto-injectors can be filled by local or mail-order pharmacies. Physicians issuing prescriptions are protected from liability unless gross negligence or willful misconduct is involved. A school nurse or volunteer can administer an epinephrine auto-injector to someone showing signs of anaphylaxis at school. The injector must be restocked within two weeks of use and before expiration. Volunteers must seek medical follow-up as per training materials. (j) School districts, county offices of education, or charter schools must provide defense and indemnification to volunteers for civil liability. This includes following the guidelines in the Government Code. The information must be documented, given to the volunteer, and kept in their personnel file. (k) Public schools can accept gifts, grants, and donations to support the provisions of this section, including epinephrine auto-injectors from manufacturers or wholesalers."
