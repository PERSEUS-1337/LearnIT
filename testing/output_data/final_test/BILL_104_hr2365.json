    "content": "Section 1 introduces Retirement Years Savings Accounts under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. A Retirement Years Savings Account (RYS Account) is treated like an individual retirement plan. It must be designated as such at the time of establishment. Contribution rules include no deduction before age 40 and denial of deduction after age 40. No deduction allowed for contributions to an RYS account after age 40. Increased spousal contribution allowed for individuals meeting certain criteria. Individuals filing a joint return may have their contribution limit reduced if their compensation is less than their spouse's. Excess contributions to individual retirement plans are subject to a separate tax under Section 4973. Limitations on rollover contributions apply to individual retirement plans, including RYS Accounts. Contributions must be from another RYS Account or a non-RYS Account made before January 1, 1998. Qualified distributions from an RYS Account are excluded from gross income. A qualified distribution from an RYS Account is includible in gross income if it meets certain criteria, such as being made after age 59 1/2, to a beneficiary after the account holder's death, or due to disability. Rollover contributions and compensation are defined for the purposes of this section. The term 'compensation' is defined in section 219(f). A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for subpart A of part I of subchapter D of chapter 1 of the Code. The amendments for Retirement Years Savings Accounts under Sec. 408A will apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 1995."
