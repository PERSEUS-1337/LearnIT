    "content": "Wolves have been historically targeted by humans, who see them as a threat to game animals and livestock. Efforts to eliminate wolves were supported by the science community until a shift in perspective around 1948, influenced by Aldo Leopold's essay \"Killing the Wolf.\" Leopold's essay \"Killing the Wolf\" highlighted the impact of predator-prey interactions on ecosystems, leading to a shift in scientific perspective. The absence of major predators resulted in unchecked prey populations, causing devastation to plant populations in various ecosystems. The elimination of major predators in various ecosystems devastated plant populations and led to reductions in species dependent on those plants. This contributed to the passage of the Endangered Species Act in 1973 and the re-introduction of wolves into some areas. Conflicts over wolf management have re-emerged, requiring agreement on the scientific classification of gray wolves. Gray wolves (Canis lupus) have a complex taxonomic history, with debates over subspecies and populations based on variations in color, size, and bone structure. Key terms like population, species, and subspecies are central to this taxonomic discussion. Taxon is a grouping of organisms given a formal taxonomic name at any rank. Biologists are often categorized as lumpers or splitters based on their classification tendencies. Lumpers minimize differences, while splitters emphasize them, creating subspecies or populations. The text discusses the classification of wolves by lumpers and splitters, with the recent proposal to recognize a third species of wolf, the eastern wolf. The taxonomic confusion is attributed to the wide-ranging nature of wolves. The debate over the classification of wolves is complex due to their wide-ranging nature, potential interbreeding, and evolutionary adaptability. The scientific community continues to discuss this issue, with no clear resolution in sight. The Endangered Species Act aims to protect species identified as threatened or endangered by the FWS or NMFS. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) allows the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) to list species as endangered if they are in danger of extinction, or threatened if they are likely to become endangered in the future. FWS can also delist, downlist, or uplist species based on scientific changes. The ESA prohibits harming endangered wildlife, and FWS can protect distinct population segments and reintroduce experimental populations. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) allows the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) to list species as endangered or threatened, with regulations prohibiting harm to these species. Special rules, such as Section 4(d) rules, may be issued for threatened species and Experimental Populations (Ex Pops) to provide customized protection. FWS is required to develop recovery plans for listed species, including management actions and criteria for delisting. Congress also allows for the reintroduction of Ex Pops outside their current range to further conservation efforts. The Endangered Species Act allows for the reintroduction of Experimental Populations (Ex Pops) outside their current range to further conservation efforts. Congress intended Ex Pops to expand species ranges without severe restrictions, with two criteria required for establishing an Ex Pop: authorization from the Department of the Interior and geographic separation from nonexperimental populations. Members of an Ex Pop are generally treated as threatened under the ESA and eligible for special rules to reduce public opposition. The committee expects regulations to allow for incidental and directed taking of experimental populations like red wolves to address public opposition. FWS must determine if an Ex Pop is essential for an endangered species' survival. Currently, there are no essential experimental populations designated. Critical habitat is not assigned to nonessential Ex Pops. The Endangered Species Act's definition of species has evolved over time, now including distinct population segments (DPS) for vertebrates. Examples of species with nonessential experimental populations include the Colorado pikeminnow, southern sea otter, gray wolf, black-footed ferret, and whooping crane. The General Accounting Office recommended limiting the definition of species to higher taxonomic categories. The Endangered Species Act's definition of species has evolved to include distinct population segments for vertebrates. Congress revised the definition in 1978 to allow for different management practices for populations of the same species, based on biological evidence. The current definition includes any subspecies of fish or wildlife. The Endangered Species Act's definition of species was revised in 1978 to include distinct population segments for vertebrates, allowing for different management practices based on biological evidence. A distinct population segment refers to a portion of a listed species separated by genetic distinction and range. The Policy introduced by FWS in 1996 further clarified the criteria for identifying DPS. The FWS introduced the DPS policy in 1996, which outlines criteria for protecting species at the population level. The population segment must be discrete and significant, with factors such as genetic diversity and ecological uniqueness considered. International boundaries can define discreteness, but state boundaries are not sufficient under the Policy. The DPS policy introduced by the FWS in 1996 outlines criteria for protecting species at the population level. Factors such as genetic diversity and ecological uniqueness are considered to determine if a population segment is discrete and significant. International boundaries can define discreteness, but state boundaries are not sufficient under the Policy. The significance of a DPS is based on evidence of its importance in the ecological setting, potential range gap if lost, uniqueness within its historic range, or genetic differences from other populations. The determination must be based on the best available scientific and commercial data. The DPS policy introduced by the FWS in 1996 outlines criteria for protecting species at the population level based on the \"best scientific and commercial data available.\" The Policy aims to concentrate conservation efforts on at-risk biological resources, focusing on smaller groups to allow for more timely and cost-effective protection and recovery. FWS has applied the practice sparingly, with only 47 of 375 vertebrates listed under the most recent compilation. The FWS has listed only 47 of the 375 vertebrates in the US under the ESA as DPSs. In some cases, DPS designation is used to remove animals from protected status, with six instances of listing and delisting on the same day. Critics argue that using DPSs to remove ESA protections from certain segments of a listed species is controversial. Some critics argue that using DPSs to remove ESA protections from certain segments of a listed species goes against the goal of protecting species. The court reviewing a challenge to the 2007 Western Great Lakes DPS designation and delisting found this practice contrary to the ESA, leading to the vacating of the designation and delisting. While some species have been downlisted and designated as a DPS on the same day, for many others, the DPS designation increased their protection status. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) allows for the designation of Distinct Population Segments (DPS) to protect specific groups, even if the entire species is not covered. Examples of DPS designations include California bighorn sheep, Canada lynx, Atlantic salmon, Dusky gopher frog, Pygmy rabbit, California tiger salamander, and Northern sea otter. DPSs receive similar protection as species under the ESA, with special rules created for threatened DPSs. The history of gray wolf protection is closely tied to the ESA, as wolves were among the first mammals covered under its precursor. The ESA protected four subspecies of gray wolf initially, later relisted as endangered species throughout the lower 48 states. Wolves in the US have been listed in various categories under the ESA, including never listed, delisted, experimental populations, threatened, and endangered. The ESA protected four subspecies of gray wolf initially, later relisted as endangered species throughout the lower 48 states. Recovery plans were developed for the gray wolf based on its early listing at the subspecies level, including the eastern timber wolf, the Mexican wolf, and the northern Rocky Mountain wolf. The goals included stable or growing populations in Minnesota, sustaining populations of at least 100 wolves for five years, and a viable population of at least 100 wolves in a 5,000 square mile area for the Mexican wolf. The recovery plan for the gray wolf in the Northern Rocky Mountains was modified in 1994 and reaffirmed in 2002. The goal is to maintain a connected three-state wolf population with at least 30 breeding pairs and 300 wolves. When wolves are delisted, each state (Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming) should maintain at least 15 breeding pairs and 150 wolves. Despite near-eradication, suitable habitat in the wolf's historic range survived. FWS planned to reintroduce the wolf at the end of the 20th century. At the end of the 20th century, FWS reintroduced gray wolves to the greater Yellowstone ecosystem, releasing 66 wolves from Canada. This reintroduction was highly controversial due to the presence of other large vertebrates and high elk populations. Scientists were interested in studying the effects of reintroducing a major predator to the ecosystem, which was already well-studied. Wolves had a significant impact on elk populations. The reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone had a profound effect on various species, including elk, aspens, cottonwoods, beavers, beetles, mice, red foxes, ravens, and voles. The decision to reintroduce wolves was controversial, leading to legal battles and challenges regarding the scope of the reintroduction. The Ninth Circuit upheld regulations for the experimental population of Canada wolves introduced into Yellowstone, ruling they became protected under the ESA. A lawsuit challenging the Yellowstone Ex Pop designation violating ESA requirements was overruled by the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, which deferred to the DOI management plan for reintroduction. The court deferred to the DOI management plan for the reintroduction of wolves, dismissing claims of FWS mismanagement. The District Court of Montana is considering whether Ex Pops in Yellowstone and central Idaho still meet the statutory definition, which could lead to Wyoming wolves being classified as endangered. FWS argues that an Ex Pop designation can only be removed through rulemaking or regulatory action, which could have a chilling effect on the program according to Safari Club International. Plaintiffs argue that managing a species as experimental under the ESA is prohibited once it is no longer geographically separate from other populations. FWS has also filed a motion to dismiss the action in light of the reissuance of the 2009 rule. The Mexican wolf, a subspecies recognized by FWS, was reintroduced in the Southwest after a successful captive breeding program. The population totaled 42 in 2010, dropping from 52 the previous year. Ranchers sued over the controversial reintroduction. The reintroduction of the Mexican gray wolf in the Southwest sparked controversy, leading to lawsuits from ranchers and environmentalists. Despite disagreements over the impact on livestock and concerns about hybrid wolves, legal actions were mostly dismissed. In 2010, the Center for Biological Diversity filed a lawsuit to list the Mexican gray wolf as endangered, eventually settling with FWS in 2011. In July 2011, a settlement agreement was reached with FWS regarding the listing decision for the Mexican gray wolf. If listed as endangered, the Ex Pop status would end, along with exceptions allowing takes of the wolves. FWS has pursued dividing the gray wolf into DPSs, but court challenges led to rules being withdrawn. In 2003, FWS divided gray wolves into three DPSs, Western, Eastern, and Southwestern, downlisting the Eastern and Western DPSs from endangered to threatened. The 2003 rule was challenged in federal district courts over how DPS ranges were designated, with plaintiffs arguing FWS only considered current wolf locations, excluding suitable habitats without wolves. In 2005, court rulings found that FWS violated the ESA by not considering the entire range of gray wolves when designating DPSs. The court vacated the rule, reinstating protected status for the wolves. Another lawsuit in Vermont criticized FWS for not considering the significant portion of the wolf's range, leading to procedural flaws in the rule. The court ultimately vacated the rule due to these issues. The court criticized FWS's method before vacating the rule that downlisted or delisted an area previously determined to warrant an endangered listing. After the nullification of the 2003 DPS rulemaking in 2005, FWS proposed two other gray wolf DPSs: Northern Rocky Mountain and Western Great Lakes. The Western Great Lakes gray wolf population was declared a DPS and delisted in 2007, while the Northern Rocky Mountain gray wolf DPS was designated and delisted in 2008, excluding Wyoming due to insufficient protection laws. In September 2008, the District Court for the District of Columbia vacated the final rule that designated and delisted the Western Great Lakes DPS due to procedural issues. The court found ambiguity in the ESA regarding delisting a healthy sub-population and remanded the action to the agency for a \"reasonable explanation.\" FWS reinstated the wolves in the area as either threatened or endangered in December 2008. In July 2008, the District Court for the District of Montana halted the delisting of the Northern Rockies DPS, citing lack of genetic exchange between wolf populations and inadequate state management plans. The court reinstated the wolves as endangered until final disposition. In September 2008, FWS voluntarily moved to withdraw the rule delisting wolves in the area, returning them to nonessential experimental populations with special regulations. Wolves in the Western Great Lakes and Northern Rockies were designated as DPSs and delisted in April 2009, except for Wyoming. Wyoming's population was not delisted due to concerns about maintaining population goals. A lawsuit was filed regarding the delisting in the Western Great Lakes, leading to FWS reinstating the gray wolf as endangered in most areas in 2009. In August 2010, the District Court of Montana declared the Northern Rocky Mountain wolves as endangered. In August 2010, the District Court of Montana declared the April 2009 Northern Rocky Mountain rule invalid, returning Wyoming wolves to their status as an experimental population. Wyoming sued FWS for not meeting wolf recovery goals, and in November 2010, the District Court for Wyoming found FWS acted arbitrarily by requiring a permit to kill wolves in most of the state. The Wyoming wolf management plan allowed for wolf hunting in predator areas without permits. The court remanded the plan to FWS to ensure it met federal recovery goals. A lawsuit claimed FWS failed to conduct required five-year reviews of the gray wolf. FWS agreed to complete a status review by February 2012. Settlement agreements were reached with some plaintiffs challenging the 2009 Northern Rocky Mountain DPS rule, but implementation was hindered by court rejection and congressional legislation. The agreement to delist the Northern Rocky Mountain DPS was hindered by litigation as some plaintiffs refused to participate and only Montana supported the action. The District Court of Montana was unable to partially revoke the stay to allow Idaho and Montana to resume wolf management, as it would violate the ESA by allowing the killing of protected species. The court found that revoking the stay on killing wolves would violate equity and lacked legal authority. The agreement had weaknesses, including binding non-settling plaintiffs to a conclusion they opposed and a delay in additional monitoring for three years. The status of the wolf would remain unknown during this time. The Northern Rocky Mountain DPS and Western Great Lakes DPS have seen population growth over the past two decades. The Western Great Lakes and Northern Rocky Mountains have seen population growth in wolf populations over the past two decades. Data shows that wolf density is higher in the Western Great Lakes compared to the Northern Rocky Mountains. Despite this, more bills have been introduced targeting delisting Northern Rocky Mountain wolves. The Core Wolf Population area in the Western Great Lakes is approximately 78,775 sq. miles, with 4,169 wolves, while the Northern Rocky Mountains Core Wolf Population area is about 134,697 sq. miles, with 1,651 wolves. The 112th Congress passed the Full-Year Appropriations Act of 2011, P.L. 112-10, directing FWS to delist the gray wolf in specific states, marking a significant legislative milestone in species protection efforts. The Full-Year Appropriations Act of 2011, P.L. 112-10 directed FWS to delist the gray wolf in certain states, leading to debates on the future of species protection based on politics rather than science. Despite Section 1713 not being a complete delisting, it instructed the re-release of a 2009 rule supported by the best available science. Judicial review of the rule was prohibited, but regulatory actions like delisting in Wyoming could still occur. The Act did not change the 2010 Wyoming District Court ruling on the management plan, and a challenge was made against Section 1713 for potentially violating the Separation of Powers Doctrine. The District Court of Montana rejected a claim related to the Constitution affecting the outcome of a case without amending the statute. Pending bills in the 112th Congress may restrict federal protection of the gray wolf, with some bills potentially being mooted by P.L. 112-10. For example, H.R. 838 (Kline) proposes eliminating federal protection of wolves in the Western Great Lakes area. H.R. 509 and S. 249 aim to amend the Endangered Species Act to exclude gray wolves from its protection. Representative Candice S. Miller introduced H.R. 1819 to give states management authority over gray wolf populations in the Northern Rockies, Western Great Lakes, and Southwest regions, with specified population level requirements. The Secretary of the Interior would be authorized to treat wolves as protected for at least two years after reestablishing the targeted number of wolves under H.R. 1819. Population goals would be based on individuals rather than breeding pairs, which may be more difficult to measure. H.R. 2584 addresses gray wolf delistings, prohibiting judicial challenge of FWS final rule delisting in certain states with agreements for wolf management. On May 5, 2011, the FWS proposed changes to gray wolf protection, including designating the Western Great Lakes as a DPS, revising the historic range, initiating reviews for the gray wolf in various regions, and recognizing a new species of wolf. The proposed actions could lead to differentiated protection of wolves based on location. The comment period for the proposed rule was reopened for additional input on the eastern wolf and revision of the historic range. The FWS proposed recognizing a new species of wolf, the eastern wolf (Canis lycaon), based on DNA methodology. The proposed historic range would include portions of eastern Canada, the Western Great Lakes, and the northeastern United States. Scientifically, the designation of wolves in the eastern United States as a separate species is not certain, with conflicting evidence on the validity of Canis lycaon as a distinct species. The North American consortium does not currently consider this wolf in the East to be a distinct species. The North American consortium managing ITIS considers the wolf as a subspecies (Canis lupus lycaon) based on evidence related to DNA, morphology, hybridization with coyotes, and low population densities. Designating a new wolf species is likely to be controversial, with potential petitions for listing the species. Subspecies designation has been controversial in other cases, typically with FWS resisting the change. The FWS has rejected petitions to designate two subspecies of the greater sage grouse due to lack of scientific support. Legal challenges to subspecies classifications or DPS designations can be successful based on the court's view of the agency's scientific basis. The agency is reviewing the status of eastern wolves, which could lead to listing them under the ESA. The eastern wolf, proposed as a new species, is not currently protected under the Act. Delisting wolves may result from the scientific reclassification. If finalized, the scientific reclassification could lead to the delisting of wolves currently protected under the ESA. The eastern wolf, proposed as a separate species, may be endangered with no breeding pairs reported outside the Western Great Lakes area. This could impact the protection of gray wolves in the region. The distinction between gray and eastern wolves requires a DNA test. FWS is conducting status reviews for both species, along with two other reviews. FWS proposes status reviews for populations in the Pacific Northwest and Southwest, potentially designating wolves in those areas as DPSs. Gray wolf protections may be altered on a population-by-population basis, aligning with FWS's plan to replace the 48-state listing with regional units. The proposed removal of 29 states from the gray wolf's historic range could impact its protection. FWS may delist the species based on geography, considering two final rules for the Northeast and Southeast regions. The gray wolf's protection status varies based on geography, with potential changes in the Pacific Northwest and Southwest regions. FWS may designate wolves in these areas as Distinct Population Segments (DPSs) and delist the species based on location. The proposed removal of 29 states from the gray wolf's historic range could impact its protection status. The proposed delisting of gray wolves in certain regions could lead to less protection needed, including in the eastern 29 states where FWS claims no historical population existed. FWS's criteria for a significant portion of a species' range may limit ESA listing process. The proposed delisting of gray wolves in certain regions could limit ESA listing process by artificially restricting consideration of a species' historic range and health to its current presence, potentially skewing the process. FWS's interpretation of a species' significance and contribution to its range further narrows the areas being considered, conflicting with broader requirements of the Act. The interpretation of critical habitat under the ESA may limit consideration of a species' broader range beyond its current presence, potentially conflicting with the Act's requirements. On October 5, 2011, FWS proposed ending federal protection of the gray wolf in Wyoming under the ESA. Wolves would still be protected in certain areas, with the rest of the state divided into hunting zones. The rule is dependent on Wyoming passing a wolf management plan meeting specific criteria. Comments on the proposed rule are accepted until January 13, 2012. The state legislature proposed a management plan for wolves in Wyoming, dividing them into protected, hunted, and unregulated zones. Wolves in protected and hunted zones would make up 15.7% of the state, while the rest would treat wolves as predator species with unregulated human-caused mortality. The state aims to manage wolf populations at 10 breeding pairs or 100 wolves in state-controlled areas. The plan would be enforced once federal protection ends under the ESA. The FWS proposal for wolf management in Wyoming is unclear on the division of zones and hunting regulations. Protected areas like Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks will continue to prohibit hunting, while hunting in other areas like the John D. Rockefeller Memorial Parkway is not currently allowed. Any changes to the proposed plan by the legislature may result in the re-listing of the species if conservation efforts are deemed inadequate. The John D. Rockefeller Memorial Parkway does not allow hunting of wolves currently, but the enabling legislation allows for hunting and fishing with certain restrictions. If wolves are no longer protected under the ESA, hunting in the Parkway would be prohibited unless specified by the Secretary or Wyoming management plan. Wolves in the Parkway could be considered as trophy game, potentially leading to population reduction under state management. The John D. Rockefeller Memorial Parkway currently does not allow wolf hunting, but hunting may be permitted under certain restrictions. It is unclear if the Parkway is designated as zone 1 or 2 for wolf management. The National Elk Refuge in northwestern Wyoming allows hunting for elk and bison, but the FWS regulations prohibit wolf hunting in this refuge. The permanency of the prohibition on wolf hunting in the Parkway and the state's role in the National Elk Refuge are unclear. The FWS notice indicates that wolves in 15.7% of the state's area would be managed as game animals or protected, including designated Wilderness Areas and the Wind River Indian Reservation. The tribe currently prohibits hunting on the reservation, except by certain tribes, and may consider regulated harvest in the future. Management plans with the tribes are not specified in the proposal. The Wyoming proposal aims to allow wolf hunting in designated wilderness areas, despite the Wilderness Act not prohibiting hunting in such zones. States typically collaborate with federal agencies to set harvest quotas on lands where hunting occurs. Private landowners in Zone 2 may oppose limitations on wolf hunting on their land under the state's plan. The proposed Wyoming wolf hunting plan includes conflicting information in the map and text regarding hunting areas, with some areas designated for hunting despite contradictions. Section 4(d) rules aim to reduce conflicts between the Endangered Species Act and human needs near wolf habitats. The rule for gray wolves in Minnesota allows designated government agents to kill wolves that have preyed on domestic animals to prevent private citizens from taking wolf control into their own hands. Special rules were issued for Eastern and Western DPSs in 2003, allowing individuals to kill wolves attacking livestock on private land and harass wolves near livestock. Permits could also be issued to landowners facing significant risks to livestock from wolves to increase human tolerance and enhance wolf survival and recovery. The rule aims to increase human tolerance of wolves to aid in their survival and recovery. Michigan and Wisconsin citizens can kill wolves within one mile of livestock, and in other Eastern states, lethal measures can be used within four miles of the site. The rule was vacated but reinstated in 2009. In 2005, a rule was issued to manage wolves in Yellowstone and Central Idaho where they had an impact on ungulate populations. The 2005 Rule allowed states and tribes to kill wolves if they were adversely affecting deer, antelope, elk, and other ungulate populations. Data showed that wolf predation was not the main cause of population reductions in Idaho, Wyoming, or Montana. More wolves were killed each year from 2007 to 2010 than cattle were killed by wolves. In 2008, the special rule regarding wolf population management was changed by FWS. The definition of unacceptable impact was modified to include wolves as a major cause of population decreases in ungulates. States can now kill wolves if they are found to be hybrids or attacking livestock. The rule also allows for killing wolves to prevent the experimental population from dropping below 20 breeding pairs in a state. Public and peer reviews are still required. The 2008 Rule expanded the provision for killing wolves in the act of attacking livestock or dogs on public lands, excluding National Park Service property. In response to the 2009 delisting reversal, FWS reinstated special rules for the Experimental Populations. Idaho was proposed to be allowed to reduce wolf numbers over five years to aid elk population recovery, modifying the special rules for Experimental Populations."
