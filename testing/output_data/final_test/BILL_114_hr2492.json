    "content": "APALACHICOLA, CHATTAHOOCHEE, AND FLINT RIVER PROJECTS. The Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint projects include various dams and reservoirs on the Apalachicola, Chattahoochee, and Flint Rivers in Alabama, Florida, and Georgia. The term \"freshwater flows\" refers to the quality, quantity, timing, and variability of freshwater flows required. The quality, quantity, timing, and variability of freshwater flows are essential to support and reestablish the ecological integrity of the Chattahoochee River, Apalachicola River, floodplain, and Apalachicola Bay. This includes sustaining commercial and recreational fisheries and diverse fish, wildlife, and plant populations. The Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint projects aim to restore ecosystems similar to those in the Chattahoochee River and Apalachicola River, protect endangered species, and prevent harmful impacts. The projects will be operated to maintain freshwater flows, essential for ecological integrity and diverse populations in the area. The Secretary will revise water control manuals for the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint projects within 18 months to ensure the maintenance of freshwater flows. Operational modifications will be made to achieve this goal while maintaining system-wide balance in conservation storage. The Secretary will revise water control manuals for the Chattahoochee-Flint project reservoirs. An independent peer review by the National Academy of Sciences is required before final approval of the revised manuals. Compliance with the Water Resources Development Act of 2007 is necessary for the peer review process. The Secretary must obtain approval from various agencies for water control manuals developed under this subsection. Other federal and state laws still apply to the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint projects, except as provided in subsection (b)."
