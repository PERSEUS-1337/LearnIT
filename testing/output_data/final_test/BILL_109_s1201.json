    "content": "LIMITATION ON DISCRIMINATORY TAXATION OF NATURAL GAS PIPELINE PROPERTY. Definitions related to property tax assessment are provided in this Act, including terms like assessment, assessment jurisdiction, commercial and industrial property, and natural gas pipeline property. The term \"public utility property\" refers to property used for public service and regulated by a governmental agency, excluding natural gas pipeline property. SEC. 2. DISCRIMINATORY ACTS. The acts specified in subsection (b) unreasonably burden and discriminate against interstate commerce by prohibiting certain discriminatory tax assessments and collections on natural gas pipeline property. Ad valorem taxes on natural gas pipeline property should not exceed the tax rate for commercial and industrial property in the same jurisdiction. Additionally, any other taxes imposed should not discriminate against natural gas pipelines under the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. SEC. 3. JURISDICTION OF COURTS; RELIEF. The district court of the United States has jurisdiction to prevent violations of the Act, regardless of the amount in controversy or citizenship of the parties. Relief under the Act is granted if the assessed value of natural gas pipeline property exceeds by at least 5 percent the assessed value of other commercial and industrial property in the same jurisdiction. Other relief may be granted based on the assessed value ratio of other commercial and industrial property in the jurisdiction. If the true market value of natural gas pipeline property exceeds by 5 percent the value of other commercial and industrial property in the same jurisdiction, it is a violation of the Act. This violation can lead to relief being granted under the Act. The Act prohibits collecting higher ad valorem taxes on natural gas pipeline property compared to other taxable property in the same jurisdiction, with potential relief granted for violations."
