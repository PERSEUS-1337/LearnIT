The activities aim to address prisoners' substance abuse problems and develop their skills. The term 'local correctional facility' refers to any facility operated by a unit of local government.

The program includes educational and job training, parole supervision, half-way house, self-help and peer group programs, and placement in community substance abuse treatment facilities for participants upon release from correctional facilities. Coordination and consultation with other rehabilitation programs are required for states receiving grants under this section. The section requires states to implement a statewide communications network to track participants in jail-based substance abuse treatment programs as they move between facilities. States must consult with the Attorney General and Secretary of Health and Human Services to ensure program components include relapse prevention and aftercare services. Grant amounts are to be used by local correctional facilities for program assistance. Each local correctional facility receiving a grant must use it for the jail-based substance abuse treatment program.

Each local correctional facility receiving a grant must submit an annual description and evaluation of their jail-based substance abuse treatment program to the Attorney General. The Attorney General conducts yearly reviews to ensure compliance with program requirements.
