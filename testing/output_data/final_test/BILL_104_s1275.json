    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Prison Conditions Litigation Reform Act\" and provides appropriate remedies for prison conditions. The \"Prison Conditions Litigation Reform Act\" amends Section 3626 of title 18, United States Code, to limit prospective relief in civil actions regarding prison conditions to what is necessary to correct the violation of a Federal right, with consideration for public safety and the criminal justice system. The Prison Conditions Litigation Reform Act allows for temporary restraining orders or preliminary injunctive relief in civil actions related to prison conditions. A prisoner release order cannot be issued unless less intrusive relief has failed to address the violation of a Federal right. The Prison Conditions Litigation Reform Act requires a three-judge court to enter a prisoner release order in federal court only if less intrusive relief has not remedied the deprivation of the Federal right sought to be remedied, and the defendant has had a reasonable amount of time to comply with previous court orders. A party seeking a prisoner release order must file a request for a three-judge court and demonstrate that the requirements have been met. A Federal judge handling a civil action regarding prison conditions can request a three-judge court to consider a prisoner release order if crowding is the primary cause of a Federal right violation and no other relief will remedy it. The court must find clear and convincing evidence of crowding's impact on the violation and that no other solution exists. The text discusses the criteria for a Federal judge to request a three-judge court to consider a prisoner release order in cases where prison conditions violate Federal rights due to overcrowding. State or local officials involved in the prosecution or custody of prisoners have the right to oppose or intervene in such relief proceedings. The text outlines the conditions for terminating prospective relief in civil actions regarding prison conditions, allowing for termination after specific timeframes or by mutual agreement of the parties involved. In civil actions regarding prison conditions, prospective relief can be immediately terminated if it was approved without a court finding that it is narrowly drawn and necessary. However, termination can be limited if the court finds that the relief is still necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right. Prospective relief is the least intrusive means to correct a violation. Termination or modification can be sought before relief is terminable, and settlements must comply with limitations on relief in civil actions regarding prison conditions. Private settlement agreements can be made that do not comply with these limitations. Private settlement agreements that do not comply with limitations on relief in civil actions regarding prison conditions can be subject to court enforcement for reinstatement of the civil proceeding. State law remedies for breach of contract are available, and limitations on remedies in this section do not apply to relief entered by a State court based on claims arising under State law. The court must promptly rule on any motion to modify or terminate prospective relief in a civil action with respect to prison conditions. Automatic stay applies to pending motions for relief in civil actions regarding prison conditions. The stay begins 30 days after the motion is filed for certain types of motions and 180 days for others, ending when the court issues a final ruling. Definitions in this section include 'consent decree' for relief based on party agreement and 'civil action with respect to prison.' The term 'civil action with respect to prison conditions' refers to any civil proceeding under Federal law regarding confinement conditions or government officials' actions on prisoners' lives, excluding habeas corpus challenges. A 'prisoner' is defined as any incarcerated person accused, convicted, sentenced, or adjudicated for criminal violations or parole/probation terms. A 'prisoner release order' encompasses any order reducing confinement effects, including temporary restraining orders or injunctive relief. The curr_chunk defines terms related to court-ordered relief in prison conditions, including injunctive relief, prison definition, prospective relief, and general relief. The curr_chunk discusses the application of an amendment to Section 3626 of title 18, United States Code, and the repeal of certain subsections of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. Additionally, a clerical amendment is made to the table of sections in chapter 229 of title 18, United States Code. The curr_chunk discusses amendments to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, specifically addressing appropriate remedies for prison conditions. Amendments to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act include provisions for attorney's fees in cases where a prisoner proves a violation of their rights, with fees awarded only if directly related to the violation and proportionate to the relief granted by the court. In cases where a prisoner proves a rights violation, attorney's fees awarded should not exceed 25 percent of the judgment. Hourly rates for fees cannot exceed those set by law, but prisoners can agree to pay higher fees personally. Telephone hearings are encouraged when possible. In Federal court actions under section 1979 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, pretrial proceedings for prisoner crimes can be conducted by telephone to avoid removing the prisoner from their facility. States can also implement similar requirements for hearings in their courts. The term 'prisoner' refers to individuals incarcerated, detained, or accused of criminal violations. SEC. 4. SUCCESSIVE CLAIMS IN PROCEEDINGS IN FORMA PAUPERIS. Amends Section 1915 of title 28, United States Code, to restrict prisoners from bringing civil actions or appeals if they have had 3 or more prior cases dismissed as frivolous, malicious, or failing to state a claim, unless they are in imminent danger of serious bodily harm."
