    "content": "The Act titled \"Stewardship Education, Recreation, and Volunteers for the Environment Act of 1999\" includes sections on the short title, table of contents, findings, purposes, definitions, use of volunteers for Federal lands, recognition of volunteers, cooperative agreements, educational outreach, reports, and authorization of appropriations. The Congress finds that Federal lands encompass valuable resources and proper stewardship is a national priority. Volunteers and organizations partnering with land management agencies play a crucial role in resource stewardship. The Act aims to encourage and recognize their contributions. The Act aims to assist the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture in stewardship programs for Federal lands managed by land management agencies. It also recognizes the role of volunteers and partnership organizations in providing assistance. The Act defines Federal lands as those owned and managed by the Forest Service of the Department of Agriculture, and by Federal land management agencies of the Department of the Interior. The Act defines \"Federal land management agency\" as including the Bureau of Land Management, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Park Service, the Bureau of Reclamation, and the Forest Service. It also defines \"partnership organization\" as an organization that promotes the understanding and conservation of natural, recreational, and cultural resources of Federal lands. The term \"volunteer\" is defined as an individual or member of a partnership organization who performs volunteer services pursuant to section 3(a). The term \"Secretary concerned\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior for Federal lands described in paragraph (1)(B) and the Secretary of Agriculture for Federal lands described in paragraph (1)(A). The use of volunteers to perform services for the benefit of federal lands is authorized. The Secretary concerned may recruit, train, and accept volunteers without compensation to supplement the work of Federal land management agency employees. Volunteers are not considered Federal employees under employment law. Volunteers supplement Federal land management agency employees without compensation and are not considered Federal employees under employment law. Volunteers are subject to Federal employment laws regarding work hours, compensation rates, leave, unemployment compensation, and benefits. They are treated as Government employees for purposes of the Federal Tort Claims Act and work injury compensation. \"Recognition of volunteers is outlined in Section 4.\" The Volunteer Passports Program, established by the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture, recognizes volunteers who complete specified hours of service for Federal land management agencies. The program applies uniformly to all agencies and offers various classes of passports that provide exemptions from fees for accessing facilities on federal lands. The Volunteer Passports Program, established by the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture, awards different classes of passports to volunteers based on hours of service, with additional hours leading to fee exemptions. A progress report on the program's implementation must be submitted to Congress within one year of the Act's enactment. SEC. 5. COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS FOR STEWARDSHIP OF FEDERAL LANDS. The Secretary concerned may enter into cooperative agreements with partnership organizations, academic institutions, or State/local government agencies to carry out projects promoting stewardship of Federal lands and supporting Federal land management programs through educational and recreational facilities. Projects and programs funded under this authority aim to increase awareness and understanding of Federal lands, advance education about the missions of land management agencies, and provide financial resources for volunteer or educational programs at specific field offices or projects. The Secretary may use a cooperative agreement to carry out projects on Federal lands, subject to compliance with laws, regulations, and management plans. Federal funding may match non-Federal funds or donations under the agreement. Under a cooperative agreement, Federal funds must not exceed non-Federal donations for projects. Federal funds can only be used for project expenses, not for non-Federal entity operations. Any new facility or improvement on Federal lands will be owned by the United States. Amounts received by the Secretary for projects will go into a Treasury account. Amounts received for projects and programs will be deposited in a separate Treasury account and can be used without further congressional action. Funds can be used for incidental expenses related to volunteer or educational activities at specific field offices or sites. SEC. 6. EDUCATIONAL OUTREACH. Federal land management agencies will cooperate with States, local school districts, and other entities to promote student participation in volunteer programs, enhance understanding of Federal lands, and provide information on careers in natural resource management. SEC. 7. REPORTS AND ACCOUNTABILITY. Progress and results of programs under this Act reported through existing agency mechanisms. SEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Sums authorized for Act implementation during fiscal years 2001-2005."
