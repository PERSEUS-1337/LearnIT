    "content": "Section 2(e)(1) of the Grassley/Loebsack bill allows states to issue tax-exempt bonds for various qualified activities in disaster areas, including financing residential rental projects and below-market-rate mortgages for low- and moderate-income homebuyers. The bonds must be issued before January 1, 2013, with a maximum cap based on the state's population in the disaster area. The Baucus bill does not have a similar provision. Both bills offer modifications to ease the impact of disasters, although not identical. The Grassley/Loebsack bill proposes modifications to ease restrictions on mortgage revenue bond financing for disaster-affected areas. It also allows operators of low-income rental projects to rely on displaced individuals' income qualifications. The Baucus bill does not include a similar provision. The low-income housing tax credit in IRC \u00a7 42 allows owners to claim a credit over a 10-year period based on costs attributable to low-income units. Each state's allocation is limited to $2,000,000 or $1.75 times its population. The Grassley/Loebsack bill proposes additional allocations for disaster areas based on population. The Baucus bill does not have a similar provision. Taxpayers affected by the Midwest disaster can claim a 50% bonus depreciation for property rehabilitation or replacement. The Baucus bill does not have a provision for additional allocations for disaster areas based on population. Taxpayers affected by the Midwest disaster can claim a 50% bonus depreciation for property rehabilitation or replacement. Requirements for property rehabilitation or replacement include being similar to and located in the same county as the damaged property, and being placed in service by specific deadlines. Capital expenditures are generally added to the property's basis, but there is an exception under IRC \u00a7 179 for certain property expenses in the year it is placed in service. The total cost of \u00a7 179 property cannot exceed $125,000, with deductions decreasing for costs exceeding $500,000. The Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 increased limitations for expensing environmental remediation costs and disaster-related property losses. The Grassley/Loebsack bill would further increase limitations for qualified disaster area property. The Baucus bill permits full expensing of qualified expenditures. The Grassley/Loebsack bill proposes increasing the credit for rehabilitating qualified buildings to 13% and 26% for expenditures made by December 31, 2010, to repair structures damaged by a disaster. The Baucus bill does not include this provision. Net operating losses are generally carried back for two years, with the NOL deduction limited to 90% for alternative minimum taxable. The Grassley/Loebsack bill proposes extending the NOL carryback period to five years and suspending the 90% limitation for qualified Midwest disaster losses. It also allows affected states to issue tax credit bonds for qualified governmental bonds or loans to political subdivisions. Bondholders would claim a credit based on a credit rate and outstanding face amount of the bonds. The maximum amount of bonds that could be issued is determined by the population of the disaster area. The Grassley/Loebsack bill proposes extending the NOL carryback period to five years and suspending the 90% limitation for qualified Midwest disaster losses. It also allows affected states to issue tax credit bonds for qualified governmental bonds or loans to political subdivisions, with the maximum amount of bonds determined by the population of the disaster area. Additionally, individuals with eligible tuition and related expenses may claim the Hope Scholarship or Lifetime Learning credit, with specific provisions for students in the Midwest disaster area under the Grassley/Loebsack bill. The Grassley/Loebsack bill includes provisions for excluding employer-provided temporary housing from employee income, waiving the early withdrawal penalty for disaster-affected individuals, and extending the NOL carryback period. The Baucus bill does not have similar provisions. The Grassley/Loebsack bill proposes increasing the amount individuals can borrow from their retirement plans without immediate tax consequences, with a temporary increase in the maximum loan amount to $100,000 or 100% of the accrued benefit's present value for loans made between July 30, 2008, and December 31, 2009. This provision aims to assist disaster-affected individuals in accessing funds for recovery. The Grassley/Loebsack bill allows individuals affected by disasters to borrow up to $100,000 or 100% of their retirement plan's present value without immediate tax consequences. It also allows for re-contribution of funds for a qualified plan without tax consequences if the funds were used for a principal residence in the disaster area. Additionally, eligible employers who continued to pay their employees' wages during a disaster would receive a credit. Eligible employers in the disaster area, with up to 200 employees, can receive a 40% credit on wages paid between business inoperability and resumption of operations. Charitable contribution deductions are limited by a specified percentage of individual or corporate income. Baucus bill has a similar provision for a four-month period after a disaster. The Grassley/Loebsack bill and the Baucus bill both provide deductions for cash contributions made to qualifying charities for disaster relief. Individuals can deduct losses of property not related to business if due to a casualty or theft, including losses in presidentially-declared disaster areas. The Grassley/Loebsack bill allows for deductions for Midwest disaster casualty losses, waiving the $100 and 10% floors. Losses can be deducted if a home is demolished or relocated due to a disaster, with limitations on the amount deductible based on adjusted gross income. The Baucus bill allows taxpayers to amend returns for reimbursement of casualty losses, waives the 10% floor for disaster losses, increases the $100 floor to $500, and includes losses in the standard deduction. The Grassley/Loebsack bill allows disaster victims to use last year's earned income for tax credits and authorizes the Treasury Secretary to adjust tax laws. The Grassley/Loebsack bill authorizes the Treasury Secretary to make adjustments in tax laws for 2008 and 2009 to prevent taxpayers from losing exemptions or credits due to temporary relocations from disasters. It also allows individuals who housed displaced Midwest disaster victims for at least 60 days to claim a $500 personal exemption per person, up to $2,000. This provision is similar to one in the Baucus bill for the two years following a disaster. The Grassley/Loebsack bill and the Baucus bill both include provisions for tax deductions related to disaster relief efforts. The Grassley/Loebsack bill sets the rate for vehicles used for Midwest disaster relief at 70% of the standard business mileage rate, while also excluding qualifying mileage reimbursements from a volunteer's gross income. The Baucus bill has similar provisions applicable during the 18-month period following a disaster. The Grassley/Loebsack bill and the Baucus bill offer tax deductions for disaster relief efforts. The Grassley/Loebsack bill allows exclusion of non-business debt forgiven by certain entities for individuals in the Midwest disaster area. The Baucus bill has a similar provision for discharges after a disaster. Involuntary conversion occurs when property is converted to cash due to destruction. Under IRC \u00a7 1033, taxpayers may defer tax on gains from involuntary property conversions by reinvesting in similar property within a specified time frame. If the converted property is not replaced, any gain must be recognized, unless reinvestment occurs within the designated period. Time limits vary based on the type of property converted, extending up to four years for certain situations like business real property or a taxpayer's principal residence. The Grassley/Loebsack bill proposes extending the time period to five years for Midwest disaster area property converted due to severe weather, as long as most of the replacement property is used in the disaster area. The Baucus bill clarifies existing law for property damaged by federally declared disasters. IRC \u00a7 170(e)(3) allows C corporations to claim an enhanced deduction for donating inventory, based on basis plus 50% of the property's appreciated value or two times basis. Other businesses can claim the enhanced deduction for donating wholesome food inventory. The Grassley/Loebsack bill and the Baucus bill propose extending inventory donation provisions, with special rules for food donations by qualified farmers and ranchers. Both bills also require \u00a7 501(c)(3) organizations to report disaster relief activities on Form 990 for returns due after December 31, 2008."
