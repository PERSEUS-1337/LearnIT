    "content": "The Act titled \"Eliminating Disparities in Breast Cancer Treatment Act of 2008\" is cited as such. Key findings are outlined in the Act. Congress finds that delays in receiving care after breast cancer diagnosis are greater for African-American women than white women. Recent studies indicate that African-American women with breast cancer are less likely to receive standard therapy than white women. African-American and Hispanic patients are significantly more likely than white patients to be diagnosed at a more advanced stage of breast cancer. Regardless of insurance status, African-American women are 1.9 times more likely to be diagnosed with an advanced stage of breast cancer than white women, and Hispanic women are 1.4 times more likely. According to studies, disparities exist in administering vital cancer screenings based on factors like race, income, and education. American Cancer Society researchers note ongoing disparities in cancer diagnosis and treatment. The Act aims to standardize breast cancer treatment practices under Medicare to address disparities based on race, education, income, and insurance status. It introduces a consensus-based performance measures system for breast cancer treatment under Medicare. The Secretary will establish a 6-year breast cancer treatment quality performance system by October 1, 2009, to assess and publicly disclose the quality of care for breast cancer treatment by specified health care providers. Payment under this title will be based on provider performance starting October 1, 2012. The Secretary will specify classes of providers to which these provisions apply, including hospitals, cancer centers, physicians, primary care providers, and specialty providers. The Secretary will establish a breast cancer treatment quality performance system by October 1, 2009, to assess and disclose care quality by specified health care providers. The National Quality Forum will identify uniform performance measures under agreements with the Secretary. The National Quality Forum will identify consensus-based performance measures to evaluate the quality of care for breast cancer treatment, including patient outcomes, care delivery process, patient engagement, experience of care, resource use, and practice capabilities. The system will also include a reporting process for specified health care providers. The Secretary will establish a reporting process for breast cancer treatment providers to submit performance data using specified measures. Voluntary data submission with incentives is allowed for the initial three years. The Secretary will establish a reporting process for breast cancer treatment providers to submit performance data using specified measures. Data submitted must consider the quality of treatment for all patients regardless of insurance coverage and allow for comparison by race, education, income, and insurance status. Public disclosure procedures will be established by the Secretary. The Secretary will establish procedures for public disclosure of quality information on breast cancer treatment providers, allowing providers to review and appeal data before it is made public. Value-Based Purchasing for periods starting October 1, 2012 will be implemented under the system. The Secretary will establish a value-based purchasing program for breast cancer treatment providers from October 1, 2012, to October 1, 2015. Providers must submit data to avoid payment reductions under this program. The Secretary may reduce payments to providers who offer low-quality care for breast cancer treatment under a value-based purchasing program. The Secretary may reduce payments to providers for breast cancer treatment based on improved quality of care, ensuring the reduction is less than specified and based on the extent of improvement. The Secretary may reduce payments to providers for breast cancer treatment based on quality of care, with the amount determined by a method established by the Secretary. Reports evaluating the system's development and implementation are to be submitted to Congress periodically. The system's implementation includes evaluating data submission by health care providers, analyzing its impact on reducing disparities in breast cancer treatment based on race, education, income, and insurance status, and providing recommendations on extending the system. The Secretary will also apply these provisions to treatment under part C."
