    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 25200.1.3 requires the department to hold a public meeting within 90 days of receiving a renewal application for a hazardous waste facilities permit to inform the community about the renewal process. Section 25205 mandates that financial assurances must be established and maintained by the owner or operator of a hazardous waste facility before a permit can be issued or renewed. The grant of interim status for a facility operating since November 19, 1980, will end on July 1, 1997, unless the facility is certified to be in compliance with financial assurance requirements by the Department. The department must review financial assurances for hazardous waste facilities every five years. Inadequate assurances require owners to update within 90 days. No reimbursement is needed for local agencies due to changes in penalties or definitions of crimes. The Legislature declares the economic, social, and environmental benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing carbon sequestration on river systems. Investing in river systems provides cobenefits such as water supply protection, air quality, habitat preservation, recreation, and flood protection. An integrated program is needed to maximize carbon management and utilize existing funding for resilience and proper management of river systems under the California River Revitalization and Greenway Development Act of 2015. The California River Revitalization and Greenway Development Act of 2015, known as CalRIVER, aims to protect, restore, and enhance river systems and their riparian corridors to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve water quality, increase urban greening, and promote active transportation. The Natural Resources Agency will establish a grant program for projects on riparian corridors that align with the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 and the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund Investment Plan. Projects must show a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions to be eligible for funding. The Agency will consider emission reduction levels when selecting projects for funding in consultation with the State Air Resources Board. In evaluating grant applications for funding, the Natural Resources Agency prioritizes projects that provide cobenefits such as recreational access, improved transportation mobility, economic viability, visitor-serving facilities, urban greening, species protections, and improved resiliency to climate change impacts. Improved resiliency to climate change impacts, water supply, flood protection, water quality enhancement, job training for disadvantaged youth and veterans, stormwater retention are key priorities for projects receiving funding. Projects must align with the California Water Action Plan and the Safeguarding California Plan. Flood protection projects must also be consistent with relevant sections of the Water Code. The Natural Resources Agency prioritizes funding for projects consistent with parkway, greenway, or urban greening plans, leverage funds from Proposition 1, and provide recreational access to underserved areas. The CalRIVER fund is created in the State Treasury and administered by the Natural Resources Agency. Moneys in the fund can be used for projects consistent with parkway, greenway, or urban greening plans. The secretary will develop regulations for implementation."
