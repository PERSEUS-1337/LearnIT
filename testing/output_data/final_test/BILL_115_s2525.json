    "content": "The \"First Amendment Defense Act\" may be cited as the short title of this Act. Congress acknowledges the real conflicts between same-sex marriage and religious liberty, as highlighted by legal scholars. President Obama emphasized the importance of maintaining religious freedom in the context of same-sex marriage. Despite this, concerns were raised in 2015 about the potential impact on tax-exempt status for religious schools opposing same-sex marriage. The need to protect religious freedom from government interference is paramount. Protecting religious freedom from government intrusion is a top government priority, as it prevents interference with religious exercise and complements First Amendment protections. Laws safeguarding religious beliefs on marriage promote tolerance and contribute to a diverse and peaceful society in a pluralistic environment. The government must recognize same-sex marriage as mandated by the United States Supreme Court while respecting individuals with religious beliefs or moral convictions opposing it. SEC. 3. PROTECTION OF THE FREE EXERCISE OF RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND MORAL CONVICTIONS. The Federal Government is prohibited from discriminating against individuals based on their religious beliefs or moral convictions regarding marriage and sexual relations outside of marriage. Discriminatory actions include altering tax treatment, imposing penalties, or denying tax exemptions. The Federal Government cannot discriminate against individuals based on their religious beliefs or moral convictions regarding marriage and sexual relations. This includes actions such as altering tax treatment, denying tax exemptions, disallowing deductions for charitable contributions, withholding federal grants or benefits, and denying access to educational programs.

(a) A person can use this Act to claim damages, relief, or defense against the Federal Government without needing to exhaust administrative remedies. (b) Attorneys' fees can be recovered under this Act. The Attorney General has the authority to enforce the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 against independent establishments or their officers/employees through injunctive or declaratory relief actions. This does not affect the right of the Attorney General or the United States to take legal action under other laws. SEC. 5. RULES OF CONSTRUCTION.
