    "content": "When a Vacancies Act-covered executive branch advice and consent position becomes vacant, it can be temporarily filled in three ways: the first assistant assumes duties, the President directs another officer, or the President selects an officer or employee meeting specific criteria. Temporary appointments under the act last up to 210 days, or longer during Senate recesses. The Vacancies Act allows for temporary appointments to executive branch positions when they become vacant. The acting officer can serve for up to 210 days, or longer during Senate recesses. The Supreme Court has ruled on limitations for serving in an acting capacity and as a nominee for the same position. Appointments to vacancies during the 60-day period after a new President's inauguration have different rules under the Vacancies Act. The 210-day restriction period starts 90 days after the President takes office or 90 days after the vacancy. After the Vacancies Act time limits, only the agency head can perform non-delegable duties. Appointees can act temporarily under the Act, but it doesn't apply to certain positions or new unfilled roles. The President's recess appointment power comes from the Constitution. The Constitution grants the President the authority to make recess appointments to fill vacancies during Senate recesses. These appointments can last for less than a year or nearly two years, depending on when they are made. Presidents have used this power to bypass the confirmation process, leading Congress to impose restrictions on recess appointments. The President can make recess appointments to fill vacancies during Senate recesses, but if the position falls vacant while the Senate is in session, the appointee may not be paid until confirmed by the Senate. Exceptions to this rule include vacancies within 30 days before the end of the session, pending nominations, or rejected nominations followed by a new appointment. A nomination must be made not later than 40 days after the next session begins. Since the 110th Congress, the Senate and House have used scheduling practices to prevent the President from making recess appointments. This approach limited President George W. Bush and President Obama's use of recess appointment power. President Obama challenged this practice in January 2012. In January 2012, President Obama made recess appointments during a short Senate recess, challenging the practice of preventing his authority. The Office of Legal Counsel argued that pro forma sessions did not interrupt the recess for appointments, but the Supreme Court later disagreed in a case involving three of the appointments. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the President can only use the recess appointment power during a Senate recess of 10 days or longer. A recess of 3 days is not sufficient, and a recess of more than 3 days but less than 10 is presumptively too short. Congress can also provide for temporary filling of vacancies in certain positions. Provisions for temporary filling of vacancies in top positions at agencies like OMB, FAA, and SBA include automatic designation of acting officials or President's appointment. For example, the Deputy Director of OMB acts as Director when needed, and the Deputy Administrator at FAA acts for the Administrator when necessary. In cases where the Administrator is absent, unable to serve, or the office is vacant, federal law designates the Deputy Administrator as the acting head of the SBA. Similarly, the top positions at GSA and SSA are temporarily filled by the Deputy Administrator or Deputy Commissioner, respectively, unless the President appoints someone else. The Acting Commissioner of the Administration, in the absence or disability of the Commissioner, is designated by the President. The President can also appoint acting officials for specific positions, such as the General Counsel at the National Labor Relations Board and the Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices at the Department of Justice. The President's designee for these positions serves temporarily until the Senate can act on a nomination. The President can appoint acting officials for specific positions, such as the General Counsel at the National Labor Relations Board and the Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices at the Department of Justice. The provision regarding the Special Counsel includes no limitations on the President's ability to designate an acting official during a vacancy. In some departments and agencies, the agency head can establish a line of temporary succession in the event of a vacancy in a particular position, like the Deputy Secretary automatically taking over in the Department of Education when the Secretary's position is vacant. The Secretary can establish a line of succession for officials to act in their absence or during vacancies. Agency heads can designate individuals to temporarily fill lower-level positions. For example, the Attorney General can appoint a person to act as marshal temporarily. The provision allows for temporary appointments to be made through the advice and consent process or if the designee is rejected by the Senate. This provision shows limitations in temporary appointment provisions and has been used for positions like U.S. Attorney, Solicitor of Labor, and Assistant Secretary of Labor for Mine Safety and Health. The Administration has used multiple authorities to place unconfirmed individuals in these positions for longer periods. In 2003, the Department of Justice allowed U.S. Attorney vacancies to be temporarily filled by the Attorney General or under the Vacancies Act. The President used his recess appointment and Vacancies Act authorities to fill Labor Department positions. Eugene Scalia was recess appointed as Solicitor of Labor on January 11, 2001, then given a temporary appointment under the Vacancies Act on November 22, 2002. Scalia resigned before serving the full 210 days in this capacity. In 2003, Eugene Scalia was recess appointed as Solicitor of Labor and later given a temporary appointment under the Vacancies Act. Similarly, Richard E. Stickler was placed in the position of Assistant Secretary of Labor for Mine Safety and Health through a recess appointment and later under the Vacancies Act. Individuals serving temporarily in advice and consent positions may face challenges if their nomination is unsuccessful. Two provisions of law may prevent them from being paid as acting officials. The FY2008 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act includes provisions that may prevent officials from being paid if their nominations are rejected by the Senate. Similar provisions have been included in annual funding measures for the past 50 years. Another provision addresses individuals serving in acting or temporary roles who have been nominated twice and had the second nomination withdrawn or returned. The FY2008 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act includes provisions preventing officials from being paid if their nominations are rejected by the Senate. A provision in the FY2009 Act states that no funds can be used for individuals in acting roles after a second nomination withdrawal. Nominees can only serve in an advisory capacity while awaiting confirmation and have no legal authority to assume the responsibilities of the position they were nominated for. The Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 and other statutes govern the temporary filling of advice and consent positions. After the Vacancies Act time limits expire, functions of a vacant office can be carried out indefinitely by another individual, usually the first assistant, under delegation of authority by the agency head. This individual performs these functions without assuming the vacant office. The Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 allows for temporary filling of vacant advice and consent positions. After the Vacancies Act time limits expire, functions of the vacant office can be carried out by another individual under delegation of authority by the agency head. In a 2008 GAO opinion, the Office of Legal Counsel at the Department of Justice was led by the Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General during a prolonged vacancy in the lead position. The Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 allows for temporary filling of vacant advice and consent positions. The position of Assistant Attorney General for OLC does not have any duties exclusive to the position, allowing for delegation of functions during a vacancy without specific time limits or requirements for the individual carrying out the duties."
