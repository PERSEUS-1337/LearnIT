    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Secretary of State in California will establish a Voting Accessibility Advisory Committee to improve election accessibility for voters with disabilities. The committee will include the Secretary of State, designees, and members with experience in disability voting requirements or as county elections officials. They will provide recommendations to reach as many voters with disabilities as possible. The Voting Accessibility Advisory Committee in California will establish guidelines to reach voters with disabilities, improve accessibility of election materials, increase distribution of public service announcements, and enhance accessibility of election materials on Internet websites. The Voting Accessibility Advisory Committee in California aims to promote voter registration for citizens with disabilities, recommend equal access for disabled voters, establish subcommittees for improving voter services, and advocate for plain language and alternative formats for election materials. The Voting Accessibility Advisory Committee in California promotes voter registration for citizens with disabilities, recommends equal access for disabled voters, and advocates for plain language and alternative formats for election materials. The Secretary of State is required to make the complete state ballot pamphlet available online, including access to campaign contribution disclosure reports for candidates and consolidated information for state ballot measures. Members of the committee do not receive compensation but are reimbursed for expenses. The Secretary of State will create a user-friendly website to consolidate information on state ballot measures, including a summary of the measure's content and total contributions for and against it. The total contributions in support of a ballot measure will be calculated by adding together contributions reported in various statements required by the Government Code. The total contributions in opposition to a ballot measure will be calculated by adding together contributions reported in various statements required by the Government Code, ensuring transfers between committees are not counted twice. The total contributions for each state ballot measure must be updated promptly after receiving required statements, ensuring no double counting of transfers between committees and treating contributions to committees supporting multiple measures as if made for each individual measure. The total contributions for each state ballot measure must be updated promptly after receiving required statements, ensuring no double counting of transfers between committees and treating contributions to committees supporting multiple measures as if made for each individual measure. Additionally, a list of the top 10 contributors supporting and opposing the ballot measure, as well as information on committees formed to support or oppose the measure and their funding sources, must be provided. Information about sources of contributions must be updated as per the Political Reform Act of 1974. If a committee receives $1,000,000 or more in contributions for an election, the Secretary of State will provide online access to information about the top 10 contributors. The Fair Political Practices Commission will automatically provide the Secretary of State with lists of top 10 contributors for compliance. The Secretary of State will ensure that information available online meets accessibility standards and may implement recommendations from the Voting Accessibility Advisory Committee. County and city elections officials can allow voters to opt out of receiving physical ballot materials by mail and instead receive them electronically via email or online. Voter information remains confidential. The procedures allow voters to opt back into receiving sample ballot and other materials by mail, apply electronically to become a vote by mail voter, and make changes before the statutory deadline for the next election. The procedures for voter verification include confirming identity with a signature card or providing a California driver's license number, California identification number, or partial social security number. Information available online must meet current accessibility standards under the federal Rehabilitation Act and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0. Election officials can also follow recommendations from advisory committees for polling place accessibility."
