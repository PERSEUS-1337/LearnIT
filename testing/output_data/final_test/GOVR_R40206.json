The program aimed to provide assistance for farmers to remain in their current occupations by offering technical and training assistance, rather than direct financial aid to continue producing commodities affected by imports. The Trade Adjustment Assistance for Farmers (TAAF) program aimed to help agricultural producers affected by imports by offering technical and training assistance to help them adjust to employment in other sectors. Farmers and ranchers typically did not qualify for the program due to being self-employed and less likely to want retraining. Import surges affected agricultural producers without price protection or direct payments under traditional farm subsidy programs. U.S. fruit and vegetable growers, as well as livestock producers, faced increased competition from imports from Mexico and Canada. The Trade Adjustment Assistance for Farmers (TAAF) program was established to help agricultural producers affected by imports from Mexico and Canada under the North American Free Trade Agreement. The program is administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) and Farm Service Agency (FSA), with training and technical assistance provided by the National Institute for Food and Agriculture (NIFA). The Trade Adjustment Assistance for Farmers (TAAF) program, established under P.L. 111-5, assists agricultural producers affected by import competition. Support includes enhanced technical assistance and seed money for business adjustment plans for producers of various agricultural commodities. To qualify for benefits under the Trade Adjustment Assistance for Farmers (TAAF) program, agricultural producers must be part of a certified producer group and meet individual eligibility requirements. The group must show that increased imports of their agricultural commodity led to a significant decline in national average price, production quantity, or value. The Secretary compares imports of similar products to determine eligibility for TAAF benefits. If certified, producers have 90 days to apply and must show the impact of imports on their commodity. The TAAF program requires producers to demonstrate a decrease in production quantity or price compared to previous years, no receipt of cash benefits from other TAA programs, and eligibility remains unchanged under the reauthorization through FY2021. The Trade Adjustment Assistance for Farmers (TAAF) program offers technical assistance and financial resources to eligible producers to implement business plans for operational adjustments. Producers can receive initial technical assistance to enhance competitiveness in production and marketing, including exploring alternative commodities. USDA may also provide supplemental assistance for transportation and subsistence expenses. Completing the initial phase allows producers to participate in intensive technical assistance. The Trade Adjustment Assistance for Farmers (TAAF) program offers technical assistance and financial resources to eligible producers. Completing the initial phase makes producers eligible for intensive technical assistance, training courses, and financial assistance to develop a business plan. USDA must approve the producer's initial business plan reflecting skills gained from the courses. Approved plans can receive up to $4,000 for implementation or a long-term business adjustment plan. Completing the intensive phase and having an approved initial business plan makes producers eligible for assistance in developing a long-term business adjustment plan, which USDA must also approve if it includes steps for improvement. The Trade Adjustment Assistance for Farmers (TAAF) program provides financial assistance to eligible producers for implementing business adjustment plans. Producers can receive up to $8,000 for a long-term plan, with a total limit of $12,000 over 36 months. Producers must demonstrate economic adjustment, consider worker interests, and show sufficient resources for plan implementation. Applicants with average adjusted gross income exceeding $500,000 are ineligible for TAAF assistance. The Food Security Act of 1985 amended the Trade Adjustment Assistance for Farmers (TAAF) program, setting income limits for eligibility. The Secretary of Agriculture must notify certified producers of benefits and conduct studies when the International Trade Commission initiates a safeguard investigation on agricultural commodities. The Trade Adjustment Assistance for Farmers (TAAF) program provides relief from import competition through safeguards like tariffs or quotas. The program was authorized by the Trade Act of 2002 with annual funding of $90 million until FY2007. In FY2008, $9 million was appropriated for TAAF for the first quarter. The Trade Adjustment Assistance for Farmers (TAAF) program received funding of $9 million for the first quarter of FY2008. Funding was then authorized and appropriated $90 million in each of FY2009 and FY2010, and $22.5 million for the first quarter of FY2011. Congress temporarily extended funding with $10.4 million for a short period in 2011. In FY2012 and FY2013, $90 million was authorized, along with $22.5 million for the first quarter of FY2014. The Trade Adjustment Assistance for Farmers (TAAF) program received funding of $90 million in each of FY2012 and FY2013, and $22.5 million for the first quarter of FY2014. However, no funds were subsequently appropriated, leading to the expiration of TAAF authority on December 31, 2013. In 2015, TAAF was authorized to receive $90 million each year for FY2015 through FY2021, but no new funds have been appropriated yet. The Trade Adjustment Assistance for Farmers (TAAF) program operated with limited authority before changes were made. Funding levels were lower than authorized due to low producer participation. Out of $459 million authorized through December 2007, only $49 million was spent on cash benefits, technical assistance, and administrative costs. USDA certified or approved 30 out of 72 petitions filed by producer groups for assistance. USDA certified 30 producer groups for assistance, with shrimp and salmon producers receiving the most cash benefits. Other eligible producer groups included Concord grapes, lychees, olives, wild blueberries, fresh potatoes, Florida avocadoes, snapdragons, and catfish. Around 8,400 producers qualified for cash payments. The TAAF program was amended in 2010, allowing producer groups to request certification of eligibility for individual members to apply for benefits. In FY2010 and FY2011, USDA accepted petitions from producer groups for the TAAF program, certifying a total of 10 groups. Eligible producers had 90 days to apply for assistance. Changes in 2009 made it easier for producer groups to be certified and for individual producers to receive program assistance, resulting in increased funding utilization. In 2007, USDA committed $127 million of the authorized $203 million for the period ending December 2010. This included cash benefits, training costs, technical assistance resources, and administrative costs. 63% of authorized funding was obligated under the 2009 amendments. 10 producer groups were certified for assistance, including producers of shrimp, catfish, lobsters, asparagus, and wild blueberries. About 4,500 producers were approved for training assistance and cash benefits in FY2010, with another 5,700 applications approved under the FY2011 program. In FY2010, 4,500 producers were approved for training assistance and cash benefits, with an additional 5,700 applications approved under the FY2011 program. Most benefits went to shrimp producers in Alaska, the Gulf, and southern Atlantic states. By late FY2012, 80% of approved producers had completed training, 79% had initial business plans, and 61% had long-term business plans. Approved producers in FY2010 were eligible for $12,000 in cash payments, while in FY2011, each producer received pro-rated benefits due to limited funds available. During FY2012, FY2013, and FY2014, USDA disbursed financial assistance to producers approved under the FY2010 and FY2011 programs. The Government Accountability Office found that TAAF benefited over 10,200 farmers and fishermen who produced certified commodities. The 2009 changes in certification criteria played a role in four out of five commodity certifications. The Government Accountability Office found that TAAF benefited over 10,200 farmers and fishermen who produced certified commodities, with the 2009 changes in certification criteria leading to four out of five commodity certifications. GAO recommended requiring spouses of producers to provide documentation on their contribution to producing certified commodities and ensuring financial assistance is appropriately targeted. The Government Accountability Office recommended steps to ensure financial assistance payments are used for intended purposes and to broaden the evaluation approach of the TAAF program to measure its impact on producers' competitiveness. USDA needs to improve performance measures and surveys to gather insights into the program's long-term effectiveness and isolate its impact from other influences. The USDA agreed with recommendations to improve the TAAF program's impact evaluation and address shortcomings identified in an audit report by the USDA's Office of Inspector General in October 2013. The audit aimed to assess program administration, eligibility of recipients, proper fund distribution, reporting requirements, and oversight to ensure accountability and fairness. The Office of Inspector General found that agencies lacked controls to ensure TAAF program participants' eligibility and accurate payments. Recommendations were made based on key findings, including FAS not returning unobligated funds and not analyzing documentation properly for price pre-certification approvals. Agency responses to the findings were included in the audit report. FAS applied pre-price certification approvals too broadly, leading to some approvals not meeting criteria. FAS failed to effectively monitor TAAF program oversight, resulting in ineligible producers receiving $284,000 in benefits. NIFA did not ensure TAAF program database compliance with security requirements. The Obama Administration concluded negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) regional free-trade agreement, which includes the United States and 11 other Pacific-facing nations. The agreement has not been ratified yet. Negotiations for a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP) with the European Union are ongoing. U.S. agricultural producers and fishermen may qualify for trade adjustment assistance under TAAF in the future due to the potential impact of these agreements. Congress will determine funding for TAAF to potentially resume operations in the future. Oversight of the program may be provided based on recommendations from GAO and USDA's Office of Inspector General."
