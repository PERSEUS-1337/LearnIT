    "content": "Excise taxes are selective taxes on specific consumption or behavior, applying to goods like alcohol, tobacco, firearms, gasoline, ozone-depleting chemicals, and indoor tanning services. They serve purposes like sumptuary taxes, regulatory/environmental taxes, benefit-based taxes, and luxury taxes. Sumptuary taxes discourage activities with negative societal effects, often targeting alcohol or tobacco consumption. Regulatory/environmental taxes aim to offset externalities. Excise taxes, including sumptuary, regulatory, benefit-based, and luxury taxes, are imposed on specific goods or behaviors to regulate public safety, discourage negative externalities, charge for benefits received from public goods, and raise revenue from higher-income households. While excise taxes have historically played a significant role in federal revenue, their importance has decreased with the introduction of income taxes in the early 20th century. Despite this, there is ongoing interest in using excise taxes for revenue generation. This report provides an overview of excise taxes, including their history, various forms, administrative advantages and disadvantages, impact on tax revenue, economic effects, and implications for consumer behavior and taxpayer equity. Federal excise taxes have played a significant role in the U.S. tax system, often being used during wars or to address budget deficits. In recent years, new excise taxes have been utilized to control social costs and as user charges. The history of excise taxes dates back to the early days of the United States, with the first federal excise tax on whiskey implemented in 1791 by Alexander Hamilton. The first federal excise tax on whiskey was implemented in 1791 to fund the federal government, repay debts from the American Revolution, and establish federal supremacy. The tax sparked controversy along geographic and ideological lines, leading to the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794 in Pennsylvania. After its suppression, Congress imposed excise taxes on tobacco, sugar, and carriages, as well as a direct tax on property and slaves due to declining tariff revenue during European wars. During the 1800s, excise taxes played a significant role in public finances, with taxes being repealed and reintroduced during various wars. After the Civil War, excise taxes accounted for a large portion of federal revenue, making them the primary source of internal revenue during that era. Excise taxes were a major source of federal revenue during the 1800s, especially after the Civil War. They were the largest source of internal revenue and even surpassed customs duties during the Spanish-American War. Emergency excise taxes were imposed on items like pianos and yachts to fund military spending during wartime. Excise taxes were also used to finance war-time spending in the early 20th century, with collections quadrupling from 1914 to 1919. However, revenues declined significantly after the start of Prohibition. Excise tax revenues declined during Prohibition but rebounded after alcohol consumption was legalized in 1933. Tax rates were increased around World War II, and new taxes on luxury goods were introduced. Despite critiques, Congress rejected a general sales tax twice in 1932 and 1942. The Revenue Act of 1951 increased many excise tax rates, including alcohol and tobacco. The Excise Tax Reduction Acts of 1954 and 1965 reduced provisions and tax rates, aiming to support economic growth. The Highway Revenue Act of 1956 increased the federal gasoline tax to fund public highways and expanded excise taxes on various industries like air travel and oil spills. Excise taxes on various industries were created in the 1970s and 1980s, with tax increases in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. Since 2000, excise taxes have played a diminishing role in federal revenue, with rates remaining unadjusted for inflation for years. The excise taxes on various industries have been in place since the 1970s and 1980s, with increases in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. Recent changes include new excise taxes introduced by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, such as taxes on indoor tanning bed services, medical devices, and high-value insurance plans. The future role of federal excise taxes in policy remains uncertain, but they could continue to be used to finance public goods and services and raise revenue in the absence of a general consumption tax. Excise taxes at the federal level target specific products or activities like \"sugar-sweetened beverages\" or a carbon tax. These taxes use physical control to determine liability and ensure compliance. The excise tax rate should offset negative costs to society. It can be applied per unit. Excise taxes can be applied per unit or ad valorem, with rates based on the product type or value. Per-unit taxes are more suitable for commodities with alleged negative effects on consumption, like cigarettes. Per-unit taxes, like the federal excise tax on gasoline, are based on consumption levels. However, issues of equality and inflation-adjusted rates can arise with this tax system. For example, the federal excise tax rate on distilled spirits has remained at $13.50 per proof gallon since 1990. The excise tax rate on distilled spirits remains at $13.50 per proof gallon since 1990, equivalent to $2.14 per 750ml bottle. Ad valorem tax rates are based on the price of the commodity and can be more progressive for luxury goods. Excise taxes can be levied at different stages of production and distribution. Excise taxes can be levied at different stages along a commodity's production and distribution chain, including production, manufacturing, wholesale, and retail levels. Turnover taxes, also known as \"cascade taxes,\" are collected at all stages. Taxes levied earlier in the production process have lower administrative costs and reduce opportunities for tax evasion. Excise taxes can be levied at different stages of production and distribution, with lower administrative costs and reduced tax evasion opportunities. Implementing taxes at the manufacturer level can lead to value-added options to minimize tax burden. Manufacturer taxes on firearms are levied on complete rifles, not on add-ons or modification kits. This can result in an effective tax rate higher than the statutory rate. An effective tax rate higher than the statutory rate can occur due to long inventory life of goods, leading to interest costs for manufacturers. Imposing taxes at the retail level allows for exclusions for certain consumers, like farmers receiving excise tax credits. However, exemptions may reduce the tax's impact on its original goal and require additional administrative resources. Excise taxes may require special rules to prevent tax avoidance, such as a \"floor stocks\" tax on existing inventory. Federal excise tax liability is reported on IRS Form 720 due quarterly. Excise taxes are reported quarterly on IRS Form 720, with taxes due in January, March, June, September, and December. Various excise taxes require additional forms like Form 6197, Form 2290, and Form 6627. The real value of excise taxes has decreased over time due to inflation, leading to a decline in tax receipts. The real value of excise tax receipts has decreased over time, despite nominal collections increasing significantly. The decline in real excise tax revenue is evident from FY1960 to FY2012, with a brief spike in the early 1980s due to the excise tax on windfall profits in the oil industry. The data shows a decreasing role of excise taxes in federal public finance, with lower excise tax receipts as a share of GDP compared to the past. Federal excise tax receipts have fluctuated over time, averaging between 2.0% and 2.5% during the Great Depression, peaking above 3.0% of GDP during World War II. However, after the war, excise tax revenue declined as a share of GDP, especially after reforms in the mid-1960s. There was a brief spike in the early 1980s due to the oil industry windfall profits tax, but by the end of the 1980s, excise tax revenue as a share of GDP had dropped below 1.0%. In FY2012, federal excise tax receipts were 0.5% of GDP, and they have also declined as a share of all federal tax receipts. Federal excise taxes comprised 45.8% of all federal tax receipts in FY1934, but this share has steadily decreased to around 3.2% in FY2012. The decline in federal excise tax receipts corresponded with an increase in individual income tax revenue. During World War II, income taxes became the primary source of federal revenue. Higher federal excise tax rates can reduce state and local excise tax revenues. The decrease in consumer demand can reduce the tax base, leading states to consider increasing excise tax rates. However, higher state taxes may also decrease demand for products subject to excise taxes. Excise tax collections make up a small portion of state and local tax revenue, with personal property taxes being the largest source. Individual income taxes and general sales taxes also contribute significantly to state and local tax collections. Excise taxes on motor fuel, tobacco, and alcohol account for a smaller portion of total tax collections. Tobacco sales contribute more to state tax revenue than shown in the data due to settlement payments from major tobacco companies to states and territories. The major tobacco companies made approximately $7.3 billion in payments to states in 2011, which amounted to 41.7% of state and local excise collections. Settlement payments to states are based on tobacco consumption. Economists measure tax equity using vertical and horizontal equity. Vertical equity means higher income households pay a greater share of their income in taxes. Vertical equity means higher income households pay a greater share of their income in taxes, while horizontal equity indicates that households with similar abilities to pay actually pay similar amounts in tax. Excise taxes tend to be regressive in terms of vertical equity, as shown in the distribution of excise taxes paid in 2009. The excise tax rate on a particular good does not necessarily reflect its effects on equity, as the burden of the tax ultimately determines its equity impact. Excise taxes, including luxury taxes, can be regressive in terms of vertical equity. In 2009, the lowest income quintile paid 1.5% of their income in excise taxes, while the highest quintile paid 0.4%. The definition of \"luxury\" can change over time, making it challenging to target upper-income households with such taxes. For example, a federal excise tax on telephone calls, initially considered a luxury in 1892, remained in the tax code until 2006. Excise taxes, including luxury taxes, can create horizontal inequities across consumers of taxed products, affecting consumer choices and distorting optimal behavior. This distortion may be justified by market failures. Excise taxes are used to offset negative spillover effects of certain goods on society. Setting the tax rate at a level that reflects the full cost to society can lead to a more efficient allocation of resources. In a competitive industry, excise taxes increase the price of the taxed product in the short run, with the tax burden shared by producers or consumers. Excise taxes increase the price of the taxed product, with the burden shared by producers or consumers. The quantity demanded decreases, and producers receive less post-tax. The effect depends on the elasticities of demand and supply. The increase in retail price due to the tax is greater with higher supply elasticity and lower demand elasticity. Inelastic demand results in consumers bearing more of the tax burden, while inelastic supply leads to producers bearing more. Excise taxes can affect consumption differently based on demand elasticity. Targeted excise taxes may be more efficient, while broad taxes can lead to economic distortions. Luxury taxes are often used for progressivity or revenue purposes, not economic efficiency. Luxury taxes may not significantly impact demand for luxury goods due to their price insensitivity, especially when purchased by businesses. The yacht industry saw a decline in sales after a 10% luxury tax was imposed in the early 1990s, but economic analysis suggests other factors were at play. The luxury tax imposed in the early 1990s led to a decline in yacht sales, but economic analysis shows that sales were already decreasing before the tax. The tax was later repealed in 1993. Sumptuary tax increases are often based on market failures related to externalized costs of individual behavior. Studies on externalities of alcohol and tobacco consumption involve complex calculations subject to controversy and scrutiny. Studies suggest that current per-unit tax rates on cigarettes may exceed estimated net externalities, while the opposite could be true for alcohol taxes. Behavioral responses to sumptuary taxes vary by consumption good, with beer demand being relatively inelastic to price changes. Meta-analyses show that beer demand is less responsive to price changes compared to wine or distilled spirits. The price elasticity of demand for cigarettes is estimated to be between 0.3 and 0.7, with an average elasticity of 0.3 for the number of smokers. A tax on cigarettes results in a decrease in demand, especially among lower-income households. Benefit-based taxes can reduce inefficiencies in the market by aligning private and social costs. Government intervention is necessary to address negative social externalities and promote positive externalities. Government intervention is needed to incorporate social costs into prices, but determining the correct tax rate is challenging. Benefit-based taxes can impact consumer demand for public goods, but lack of a direct link can lead to declining revenues for upkeep. Alternative policies may involve more direct forms of benefit-based taxation. An alternative policy for incorporating social costs into prices could involve more direct benefit-based taxation, balancing targeting precision with administrative costs. Regulatory and environmental taxes target negative externalities like pollution, contrasting with benefit-based taxes that address underproduction of positive externalities. The negative externalities of pollution can be addressed through a tax on harmful production processes, compensating society for cleanup and mitigation. Economists generally prefer a tax over a total ban on production to minimize waste disposal costs and find the optimum level of pollution. This could involve recycling, switching to safer materials, production modification, or technology adoption. The excise tax on pollution increases private costs to reduce the gap between private and social costs. Economic efficiency is achieved when the tax rate equals the marginal private cost of pollution to the marginal social benefits of production. The tax should be imposed on activities causing negative externalities, with the economic burden influenced by elasticities. Consumers may bear some or all of the tax through higher prices due to elasticities."
