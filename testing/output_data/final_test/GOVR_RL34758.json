    "content": "The creation of the NRF is authorized by various sources, including FEMA's 15 principal emergency authorities, 48 statutory authorities, 17 executive orders, and 20 presidential directives. The Stafford Act establishes federal assistance programs for emergencies and disasters, allowing FEMA to coordinate response plans with states. FEMA released the Federal Response Plan in April 1992 to coordinate federal resources with state efforts. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 consolidated existing federal emergency response plans into a national response plan and created DHS. FEMA retained its authority under DHS to administer the Stafford Act and lead the nation's response plan. President Bush issued HSPD-5 on February 28, 2003, directing further actions. President Bush issued HSPD-5 in February 2003, directing the development of a national response plan that used an \"all-discipline\" and \"all-hazards\" approach. In December 2004, DHS issued the National Response Plan (NRP) as a successor to the Federal Response Plan. The NRP was implemented during Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, but its deficiencies led to Congressional action through the Post-Katrina Act. The Post-Katrina Act amended the Stafford Act and Homeland Security Act to mandate the development of a national preparedness system, ensuring the nation's ability to respond to natural disasters and acts of terrorism. It also required clear and quantifiable performance standards for the national preparedness goal, NIMS, and the NRP. The Post-Katrina Act amended legislation to mandate clear performance measures for national preparedness, NIMS, and the NRP. It requires annual reporting on state compliance with the NRP and federal agencies' capability to meet the national preparedness goal. DHS revised the NRP to address issues and issued the NRF as part of a national strategy for homeland security. The NRF is a key part of the national strategy for homeland security, providing guiding principles for a unified response to hazards. It outlines roles and responsibilities for all levels of government and sectors of communities, focusing on response and recovery. The NRF is not a detailed operational plan but aims to build flexibility into response efforts. It is organized into five parts, giving users discretion in how they respond to incidents. The first chapter of the NRF provides an overview of roles and responsibilities in emergency and disaster response, including federal, state, and local governments, as well as the private sector. It also discusses the key principles of response doctrine and outlines the three phases of effective response: prepare, respond, and recover. The NRF outlines key activities for emergency and disaster response, including preparing, responding, and recovering. Response activities involve gaining situational awareness, deploying resources, and coordinating actions. Recovery activities are categorized as short-term and long-term. The NRF also details the organizational structure and staffing for response actions, based on NIMS and ICS. Planning processes and structures related to national preparedness are described in the document. The final chapter of the NRF outlines the Emergency Support Function Annexes, Support Annexes, and Incident Annexes. These resources are available online for ongoing revisions. The response to Hurricane Katrina highlighted issues with the NRP, leading to changes in the NRF to address criticisms. The NRF addressed criticisms of the NRP by simplifying language, clarifying roles, and reducing length. Despite improvements, some still question the clarity of the NRF. The National Response Plan (NRP) was criticized for its lack of national focus and exclusion of nonfederal stakeholders. The National Response Framework (NRF) was created to address these issues by clearly defining roles and responsibilities for nonfederal entities. While some have praised the NRF for improving coordination among federal, state, and local governments, its implementation has received mixed reviews. The implementation of the National Response Framework (NRF) has led to improved coordination among federal, state, and local governments. However, there are concerns about the clarity of roles and responsibilities during emergencies, as seen in the confusion during Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in Texas. Critics have also raised more serious issues with the NRF since its implementation. Critics have raised concerns about the National Response Framework (NRF) since its implementation. A report by the Inspector General of DHS highlighted issues with FEMA's decisions during Hurricane Ike response. One criticism is the ambiguity around the roles of the Federal Coordinating Officer (FCO) and Principle Federal Officer (PFO). The FCO determines relief needs and coordinates efforts, while the PFO's role is not legislatively authorized. The PFO position was created by DHS in the NRF and designated by the Secretary of DHS. During Hurricane Katrina, Michael Brown served as both the Director of FEMA and the PFO, causing confusion. Despite criticisms, DHS decided to retain the PFO in the NRF, leading to congressional concerns and attempts to clarify or abolish the position. The PFO position, created by DHS in the NRF, was criticized for lack of integration with nonfederal stakeholders. Congressional oversight led to efforts to resolve the issue, with FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate stating that the PFO position would not be used for emergencies under the Stafford Act. The NRF, developed by DHS and FEMA, lacked integration with nonfederal stakeholders. Congress addressed this by requiring operational plans with state, local, and tribal officials. GAO found that DHS deviated from including stakeholder input in the NRF creation process, delaying feedback and failing to establish FEMA's National Advisory Council as mandated by the Post-Katrina Act. The National Advisory Council (NAC) is responsible for incorporating input from state, local, and tribal governments, as well as the private sector in developing and revising the National Response Framework (NRF). Analyst Donald Kettl emphasizes the importance of including local officials in the planning process, as they are often the first to report emergencies. Failing to integrate feedback from local emergency officials could lead to missing known hazards, overlooking lessons learned from local responders, and failing to establish buy-in to the plan. The National Advisory Council (NAC) plays a crucial role in incorporating input from various stakeholders in national emergency planning. One key concern is the gap in emergency readiness between adult and pediatric care, with children being more vulnerable to hazards and requiring specialized care. It is important for DHS and FEMA to involve nonfederal stakeholders in all aspects of emergency planning to ensure effective execution of plans. The witness highlighted that disaster planning often overlooks the unique needs of children, while Save the Children's Mark Shriver emphasized the vulnerability of children during emergencies. Shelters frequently lack essential supplies for children, and Congress has taken steps to address this issue, such as establishing a National Emergency Child Locator Center. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 established the National Commission on Children and Disasters to study and assess children's needs during disasters. Nonprofit organizations like Catholic Charities and Save the Children address children's needs in ESF #6, while ESF #13 aims to protect children with the help of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Congress may need to evaluate the effectiveness of child protection measures. The National Commission on Children and Disasters was established to study children's needs during disasters. Some argue that the NRF annexes do not adequately address child protection, as primary agencies are not designated for children's needs. Multiple annexes focused on children may create service gaps and duplication. Having the NRF available online is important. Having the NRF available online has benefits for emergencies and disasters, providing flexibility and easy access. Users can sign up for email alerts for NRF changes, but it's unclear how infrequent visitors are informed of modifications. The NRF is always in effect, unlike the NRP, which had to be invoked during emergencies, speeding up response time. The Post-Katrina Act requires annual reports to Congress on resources needed for FEMA regional offices and preparedness activities. State compliance with the NRF and federal assistance usage are also reported. Homeland security grants mandate state compliance with national preparedness policy to strengthen emergency management practices. Some argue against adopting federal standards for emergency preparedness and response, citing concerns about a one-size-fits-all approach and increased federal involvement. There is a focus on planning for terrorism in the NRF, with some critics suggesting a lack of emphasis on low-impact, high-probability incidents since Hurricane Katrina. The importance of preparedness for natural disasters, such as earthquakes, is highlighted. Concern over earthquakes on the New Madrid fault line led to a scenario in the 2011 National Level Exercise in Arkansas. The need for an earthquake annex to guide exercises and assess response capabilities is emphasized. Critics point out a lack of emphasis on low-impact, high-probability incidents in terrorism-focused planning. Director Larry Gispert responded favorably to President-elect Obama's plan to support first-responders, improve emergency response plans, and allocate funds based on risk. Gispert objected to plans focusing solely on terrorism, advocating for preparedness for both terrorism and natural disasters. Some argue that planning for terrorism is crucial and can be applied to all-hazards emergency management. The Bush Administration issued the NRF in response to concerns about overemphasizing terrorism in emergency plans. The NRF aims to coordinate federal and nonfederal entities during emergencies and disasters, clarifying roles and responsibilities. Anecdotal reports following Gustav and Ike suggest improved emergency coordination. The NRF, created to improve emergency coordination, still has some issues from the previous NRP. Concerns include the PFO arrangement, unequal treatment of terrorism and natural disasters, and lack of input from nonfederal stakeholders. Some argue that insufficient implementation studies have been done on the NRF, while others believe it has not been tested by a major disaster like Hurricanes Andrew or Katrina to assess its effectiveness."
