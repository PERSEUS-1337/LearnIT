The Northern Forest Stewardship Act emphasizes the rights of people to participate in decisions, respect for private property owners, sustainability of natural systems, preservation of history and culture, partnership between Federal and State/local governments, recognition of differences among Northern Forest States, and appreciation of the forest's values beyond its boundaries. The Northern Forest Stewardship Act prioritizes public benefit, long-term benefits, continuous evaluation of programs, and implementation of the will of various stakeholders as outlined in the consensus report of the Northern Forest Lands Council in September 1994. SEC. 3. MARKETING COOPERATIVES. The Secretary of Agriculture will provide technical assistance to states in the Northern Forest region to establish marketing cooperatives for raw forest products. A study will be conducted to assess landowner interest, economic and environmental benefits, and barriers to creating these cooperatives. Barriers to creating marketing cooperatives for forest landowners in the Northern Forest region will be assessed through a study conducted by the Secretary of Agriculture. SEC. 4. PRINCIPLES OF SUSTAINABILITY. The Secretary of Agriculture, through the Chief of the Forest Service, will provide technical assistance to Maine, New Hampshire, New York, and Vermont to define sustainability benchmarks and techniques. Principles of sustainability include soil productivity, water conservation, forest age balance, timber flow, and timber quality improvement. The Secretary of Agriculture, with the Forest Service Chief's assistance, will help Maine, New Hampshire, New York, and Vermont establish sustainability benchmarks. This includes improving timber quality, addressing scenic impacts, conserving habitats, protecting natural areas, and maintaining traditional recreation opportunities. The Northern Forest Research Cooperative is established to assist Maine, New Hampshire, New York, and Vermont in setting sustainability benchmarks for timber quality, scenic impacts, habitat conservation, natural area protection, and traditional recreation opportunities. The Secretary of Agriculture will collaborate with states and universities in the Northeast to conduct research on ecosystem health, forest management, and technology transfer to the wood products industry. This includes promoting research, forest management practices, technology transfer, and information dissemination to landowners and resource managers. The Secretary of Agriculture will collaborate with states and universities in the Northeast to conduct research on ecosystem health, forest management, and technology transfer to the wood products industry. This includes promoting research, forest management practices, technology transfer, and information dissemination to landowners, public and private resource managers, State forest citizen advisory committees, and the general public through information clearinghouse activities. The Chief of the Forest Service will coordinate with representatives from Maine, New Hampshire, New York, and Vermont to implement Federal, State, and local interests in the Northern Forest. State representatives may include the State forester, legislative appointees, citizen advisory committees, and the congressional delegation. Labor safety and training are also addressed. The Secretary of Labor, in collaboration with the Chief of the Forest Service, will provide technical assistance to forest-based industry groups to enhance workplace safety, training programs, and promote safer timber harvesting methods. Land conservation efforts are also addressed. The Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior will provide technical and financial assistance for land conservation in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, or New York. Criteria for prioritizing conservation include recreational values, biological diversity, willing sellers, and scenic value. The Secretary may acquire lands for conservation purposes through donation, purchase, or exchange with owner consent. Federal and State cooperative projects can be funded solely by the Federal Government or jointly with the State government. These activities complement the State Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan for Northern Forest States. The Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan for Northern Forest States is funded through the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the implementation of this plan. SEC. 9. LANDOWNER LIABILITY EXEMPTION. Congress recognizes that landowners who allow public access to their private lands for recreational purposes should not be held liable for acts based solely on land ownership. States are encouraged to enact laws protecting forest landowners from liability for responsible use of private lands by citizens. SEC. 10. NONGAME CONSERVATION. SEC. 10. NONGAME CONSERVATION. Congress acknowledges the benefits of private land management for wildlife habitat and supports creating incentives for landowners to exceed current forest management standards. It is recommended that legislation be considered to fund the conservation of nongame fish and wildlife on public and private lands without duplicating existing laws supporting game fish and wildlife. SEC. 11. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 1996-2000 to carry out specific sections of the Act in certain states."
