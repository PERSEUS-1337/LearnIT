    "content": "The Act titled \"Improving Emergency Medical Care and Response Act of 2007\" is cited as the short title. Congress finds that emergency medical services are crucial in providing immediate lifesaving care, with a significant increase in emergency department visits between 1993 and 2003 despite a relatively small growth in the population. The demand for emergency care in the United States is rapidly increasing. Between 1993 and 2003, the number of emergency departments in the United States declined by 425. Emergency medical services are often fragmented, overburdened, and poorly equipped, making coordination between Public Safety Answering Points difficult. Regionalized systems of emergency care show promise in improving coordination. Regionalized systems of emergency care aim to coordinate activities among various organizations to ensure patients receive appropriate care and are transported efficiently. These systems also show promise in managing disaster response and resource allocation, although more research is needed on their effectiveness. The Act aims to design, implement, and evaluate regionalized systems of emergency care to support day-to-day operations, disaster preparedness, and different models for urban and rural communities, meeting quality and accountability standards. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include the design and implementation of regionalized communication systems for emergency care response. The Secretary will award contracts or grants to eligible entities to support innovative models of regionalized emergency care systems. Eligible entities include States or partnerships of States and local governments, and regions can be areas within a State or multiple States. The Secretary will award contracts or grants to eligible entities for a demonstration program to design, implement, and evaluate an emergency medical system that coordinates with various services within a region, ensures timely patient transport to appropriate facilities, and allows for tracking of prehospital and hospital data. The emergency medical system demonstration program includes tracking prehospital and hospital resources, such as bed capacity, specialist coverage, and ambulance diversion status. It also involves a region-wide data management system that complies with national EMS information standards and reports data to federal and state registries for evaluating prehospital care and hospital destination decisions. The emergency medical system demonstration program involves tracking prehospital and hospital resources, including bed capacity, specialist coverage, and ambulance diversion status. An eligible entity seeking a contract or grant must submit an application to the Secretary, including assurance that the proposed system is coordinated with the State Office of Emergency Medical Services and compatible with the State emergency medical services system. The State emergency medical services system includes consistent medical oversight, coordinates prehospital treatment and transport, and categorizes special medical facilities in the region according to State laws and regulations. The State emergency medical services system includes protocols for transport and destination throughout the region, a regional medical direction system, patient tracking system, and resource allocation system to support day-to-day emergency care operations, manage surge capacity during disasters, and integrate with national and State emergency preparedness systems. The Secretary shall prioritize awarding based on requirements. The Secretary will prioritize awarding contracts or grants to eligible entities serving medically underserved areas. Recipients must submit a report evaluating the impact of the regional emergency care system on patient outcomes and identifying effective system characteristics. The program evaluates effectiveness, efficiency, financial sustainability, legislation, and barriers of emergency care systems. The Secretary will disseminate findings to the public and Congress. $12,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2008-2013. SEC. 4. SUPPORT FOR EMERGENCY MEDICINE RESEARCH. Part H of title IV of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include section 498D for supporting emergency medicine research. The Secretary will support emergency medical research to expand and accelerate research in emergency care systems and emergency medicine, including basic science, service delivery models, translation of research into practice, and efficient health service delivery. Additionally, research will be supported to determine the economic impact and savings resulting from these efforts. The Secretary will support emergency medical research to expand and accelerate research in emergency care systems and emergency medicine, including basic science, service delivery models, translation of research into practice, and efficient health service delivery. Additionally, research will be supported to determine the estimated economic impact and savings resulting from the implementation of coordinated emergency care systems. Authorization of appropriations is provided for fiscal years 2008 through 2013."
