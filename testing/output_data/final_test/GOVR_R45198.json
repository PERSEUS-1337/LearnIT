    "content": "Congress plays a key role in U.S. trade agreements, shaping negotiations, ratifying agreements, and overseeing implementation. Trade agreements impact various aspects of the U.S. economy and strategic interests. The Trump Administration has made changes to U.S. trade agreement policy by withdrawing from the TPP and renegotiating existing agreements. The Trump Administration has taken a more skeptical approach towards multilateral trade agreements, preferring bilateral FTAs and viewing trade imbalances as a measure of success. Congress is closely examining the implications of U.S. trade agreements and those pursued by major trading partners. Key questions include the impact of other countries' agreements on U.S. interests and the influence of bilateral agreements on international norms. The report analyzes international commercial norms, the role of the United States in trade agreement negotiations, prioritizing potential partners, and the costs and benefits of different negotiating approaches. It also discusses existing U.S. FTAs, bilateral and regional trade agreements, and the trade policies of top U.S. trading partners. The report discusses trade agreements with key partners such as the European Union, China, Canada, Mexico, Japan, and South Korea. It highlights the evolution of trade agreements over the past 70 years, from multilateral to bilateral and regional agreements. Tariff barriers have decreased significantly in the US and globally due to liberalization efforts. Trade agreements have expanded to cover worker rights, environmental protections, investment commitments, and intellectual property rights. The Trump Administration has questioned the economic benefits of recent U.S. FTAs, withdrawn from the TPP, and aims to renegotiate existing FTAs with a focus on trade imbalances. Future agreements may be negotiated bilaterally. Congress will have a significant role in shaping U.S. trade policy. Since the 1934 Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act, U.S. trade policy has focused on reducing international trade barriers on a reciprocal basis. Congress plays a critical role in shaping future U.S. trade agreements by passing implementing legislation. Trade agreements must align with U.S. trade negotiating objectives established in the 2015 Trade Promotion Authority grant, which is effective until July 1, 2021. Policymakers post-World War II aimed to reverse tariff-raising policies of the late 1920s and 1930s. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was created in 1947 to promote economic growth, peace, and stability by reducing tariff barriers. In 1995, GATT became part of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which includes agreements on services, intellectual property rights, agriculture, and dispute settlement. The United States has been a key driver in multilateral trade negotiations since the establishment of GATT. The United States has been a key driver in multilateral trade negotiations, leading to the establishment of GATT in 1947. Since then, new trade rules have been largely established in RTAs due to difficulties in concluding major rounds of multilateral trade liberalization negotiations. The US began negotiating FTAs in the 1980s, with the first one with Israel in 1985. These FTAs go beyond tariffs, with near complete elimination of tariffs among parties and a broad range of commitments. The general outlines of US FTAs have remained consistent since NAFTA. The number of bilateral and regional agreements, including U.S. FTAs, has grown significantly since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round in 1994. Concerns over the effects of import competition on certain domestic U.S. industries and workers have influenced policy decisions. The United States and other countries have special safeguard mechanisms to address harmful import surges and enable adjustment to trade competition. Trade policy tools provide remedies for unfair trade practices such as dumping and subsidies. Trade adjustment programs help workers and firms affected by open markets through training and income support. The Trade Expansion Act of 1962 authorized tariff reductions and created the Trade Adjustment Assistance program. The Trade Act of 1974 expanded Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) and provided new authorities under Section 301 to address foreign trade barriers. The evolution of U.S. trade agreements is influenced by ongoing debates among Congress members and stakeholders with varied interests. The 115th Congress is expected to continue debating U.S. trade agreement policy, including possible modifications to existing FTAs like NAFTA and KORUS, and potential new trade negotiations. The relationship between regional trade agreements (RTAs) and the WTO is complex. RTAs are technically a violation of the WTO's most-favored nation (MFN) concept, which requires uniform treatment of all members. However, RTAs are allowed under certain rules to further trade and economic openness, with debates on their impact on multilateral negotiations. RTAs can impact multilateral negotiations by influencing their pace and outcomes, potentially creating new trade policies or standards. Concerns are heightened due to the increase in RTAs and mega-regionals. WTO Agreements provide exceptions for RTAs under Article XXIV of the GATT and Article V of the GATS. Agreements outside the WTO relating to services trade must be notified to other members, cover \"substantially all trade,\" and not raise barriers on imports from third parties. Special provisions for developing countries allow for mutual reduction or elimination of tariffs in RTAs. RTAs involving developing countries can have greater flexibility in sector coverage. Questions remain about the adherence of RTAs to these criteria, particularly regarding notification and coverage. Approximately 100 RTAs are estimated to exist. The WTO faces challenges in assessing Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) due to ambiguity in requirements and lack of transparency in the notification process. The Doha Round of negotiations was meant to address these issues but remains stalled. Currently, RTA reviews are conducted under a provisional 2006 transparency initiative. The WTO Secretariat presents factual information on new agreements and their provisions as part of an initiative. Some WTO members, like the United States, have concerns about RTAs not adhering to WTO rules, but formal dispute settlement proceedings are rare. Trade scholars suggest that the proliferation of RTAs may deter objections. U.S. FTAs, despite near complete tariff elimination, may still have provisions violating WTO RTA rules. For instance, the TPP agreement, although signed, was not implemented. The ongoing debate over the effects of Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) on the multilateral trading system intensified with the proliferation of agreements, especially after the United States pursued its own FTAs in the 1980s. Key aspects of the debate include the economic effects of RTAs on countries within and outside the agreements, prospects for liberalization, and how RTAs influence the multilateral system. The rise of \"mega-regional\" RTA negotiations, like the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and TPP, has further fueled discussions on the topic. The rise of \"mega-regional\" RTA negotiations, such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and TPP, has added complexity to the debate on the effects of RTAs on the multilateral trading system. These agreements could potentially challenge the WTO's role as the primary forum for trade liberalization and rule-making. Trade liberalization through RTAs and multilateral agreements can have different economic outcomes, with benefits stemming from the removal of trade barriers to allow countries to specialize in areas of comparative advantage. Trade liberalization under RTAs can have ambiguous economic effects due to their discriminatory nature. Countries within the agreement face one set of barriers, while those outside face another. This could result in trade creation and trade diversion, leading to efficiency gains and potential challenges to the multilateral trading system. Trade diversion effects in Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) can negatively impact the economic welfare of countries inside and outside the agreement. This can lead to trade diverting from countries outside the RTA to members inside, causing efficiency losses. The potential effects of RTAs, like the TPP, may result in welfare gains for participating countries but slight losses for non-participants like China, India, and Thailand. The impact of trade diversion on welfare enhancement depends on the balance between trade creation and diversion in an agreement. Empirical studies vary in their estimates of trade diversion significance. Estimates of trade diversion in Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) are challenging due to various factors influencing trade flows. Concerns over trade diversion may be decreasing as tariffs have decreased globally. Recent research suggests that RTAs can still impact trade flows by reducing uncertainty in trade barriers. Economists recognize the benefits of RTAs but emphasize the need for ongoing evaluation of their effects. The debate over the benefits of RTAs continues, with some remaining skeptical. Nontariff commitments, particularly in U.S. FTAs, play a significant role and can benefit non-RTA parties through spillover effects. Applying nontariff commitments on a country-by-country basis is challenging, and not all commitments are exempt from WTO rules, such as the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS). The debate over the benefits of RTAs continues, with some remaining skeptical. IPR commitments in RTAs are not allowed to discriminate against other WTO members. RTAs may have spurred action at the multilateral level, as seen with the formation of the European Union leading to the Kennedy Round of multilateral trade negotiations. NAFTA also played a role in eliminating tariff barriers between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. NAFTA, passed in 1993, eliminated tariff barriers between the US, Canada, and Mexico, possibly influencing the Uruguay Round agreements. Some question if the rise in RTAs has hindered WTO multilateral negotiations. Economists suggest existing RTAs reduce willingness to lower tariffs through multilateral talks. The global trading system's challenges may stem from its own success in reducing barriers over the past decades. The reduction of tariff and nontariff barriers over the past decades has affected incentives for new agreements. The complex nature of nontariff issues and the involvement of developing countries in trade pose challenges for multilateral negotiations. New Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) including commitments on nontariff barriers raise questions on their impact on multilateral rules. Historical cases like NAFTA show how RTA commitments can influence the multilateral system. Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) have quickly integrated into the multilateral system, raising concerns about a potential two-tiered system based on older multilateral rules versus modern RTA commitments. Differences in RTA rules could create obstacles for international commerce. However, some view RTAs as experimental spaces for updating international trade rules, such as digital trade commitments. RTAs present both challenges and opportunities for the multilateral trading system, serving as experimental laboratories for cooperation on unresolved issues. The challenge in controlling discrimination in preferential trade agreements has not been addressed multilaterally. Economic theorists suggest a domino effect of Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs), where countries join to avoid lost competitiveness. Japan joined the U.S.-led TPP negotiations after the U.S. and South Korea implemented their bilateral FTA, aiming to compete in the U.S. market. China's interest in the TPP could impact global trade rules and give original members of trade pacts significant influence. Concerns over competitiveness in export markets may influence countries debating participation in trade agreements. The United States has been a strong advocate of trade liberalization through multilateral agreements and FTAs since the late 1980s for various reasons. The United States has negotiated and implemented 14 FTAs with 20 different countries through bilateral and multi-party negotiations. These agreements have evolved over time with commitments clarified and expanded, new issues added, and some commitments dropped. U.S. FTAs have sought higher standards beyond WTO provisions and have common elements. This section provides a brief history of U.S. FTA negotiations, discussion of Trump Administration FTA policies, typical components of U.S. FTAs, and analysis of trade trends under U.S. trade agreements. The U.S. focused on multilateral trade agreements until the 1980s to avoid discriminatory bilateral arrangements. Global tariff rates were significantly reduced through multilateral negotiations, but nontariff barriers became more problematic as tariffs fell. The Trade Act of 1974 addressed concerns over nontariff barriers and U.S. access to foreign markets. Congress encouraged new international negotiations, leading to the creation of Trade Promotion Authority for expedited consideration of trade agreements and negotiation on nontariff issues. The Trade Act of 1974 established Trade Promotion Authority for expedited consideration of trade agreements and negotiation on nontariff issues. Subsequent grants of TPA in 1979 and 1984 allowed for the first U.S. FTA negotiations under the Reagan Administration. The U.S.-Israel FTA and U.S.-Canada FTA were established in the 1980s for foreign policy and commercial reasons, respectively. The U.S.-Canada FTA negotiations led to the Uruguay Round negotiations, with implementing legislation passed in 1988. The George H.W. Bush Administration furthered FTA negotiations alongside the Uruguay Round under the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. The U.S. initiated trilateral negotiations with Canada and Mexico on NAFTA in 1991, leading to its signing in 1992. Concerns over labor and environmental provisions delayed its consideration by Congress until the Clinton Administration negotiated additional agreements. NAFTA was eventually passed in 1993. The Uruguay Round negotiations, ongoing since 1986, were concluded shortly after NAFTA and passed by Congress in 1994. President Clinton negotiated and signed an FTA with Jordan, the only U.S. FTA not signed or implemented by Congress under TPA procedures. Before leaving office, he also initiated FTA negotiations with Chile and Singapore. President George W. Bush expanded U.S. FTA negotiations, finalizing agreements from the Clinton Administration and initiating negotiations on nine additional FTAs. The Bush Administration pursued these agreements alongside the multilateral Doha Development Agenda. The Bush Administration passed eight trade agreements under the 2002 TPA, including agreements with small U.S. trading partners in the MENA region, Asia, and Latin America. The Bush Administration passed multiple trade agreements under the 2002 TPA, including agreements with various countries in different regions. The Obama Administration addressed concerns regarding pending FTAs from the previous administration, leading to the passage of agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea in 2011. In October 2011, the Obama Administration pursued major multi-party FTA negotiations, including the TPP with key U.S. trading partners. Congress passed a new grant of TPA in 2015 to expedite legislative consideration of TPP. The TPP agreement was signed in February 2016, but implementing legislation was never submitted to Congress by President Obama. The Obama Administration did not submit implementing legislation for the TPP to Congress due to ongoing consultations and uncertain support. Negotiations for the T-TIP with the EU were initiated but remained ongoing. President Trump, critical of trade agreements, continued to express dissatisfaction with U.S. trade during his tenure. During his tenure, the President has expressed dissatisfaction with U.S. trade agreements, particularly the KORUS FTA, calling it \"a disaster for the United States.\" Concerns about the U.S. trade deficit and unfair trading practices of FTA partners have led to examinations of bilateral trade deficits and FTA outcomes. The President prefers bilateral negotiations over multi-party FTAs, citing greater leverage for the U.S. economy. The President has taken steps to alter U.S. FTA policy by withdrawing from TPP and renegotiating NAFTA and KORUS FTA. This shift towards bilateral negotiations is driven by concerns about trade deficits and unfair practices of FTA partners. The President has followed TPA procedures for NAFTA renegotiation but not for KORUS FTA talks. Limited commitments in KORUS modifications may not require implementing legislation. Trump Administration's NAFTA objectives align with U.S. positions in digital trade and state-owned enterprises. The NAFTA modernization talks have negotiating objectives similar to U.S. positions in TPP negotiations. Trump Administration's proposals differ in areas like rules of origin and a \"sunset provision.\" Despite criticizing existing agreements, they are interested in new bilateral FTAs with countries like the United Kingdom and Japan. No TPP country has endorsed new FTA negotiations with the U.S. yet. Trump has mentioned the possibility of unilaterally withdrawing from NAFTA. The U.S. is willing to withdraw from NAFTA if talks do not reach a satisfactory conclusion. U.S. FTAs have evolved with more comprehensive commitments since the 1980s, starting with a 14-page agreement with Israel focused on tariff elimination. NAFTA set a template for future agreements with enforceable provisions on various trade issues. Since NAFTA, U.S. FTAs have evolved with more comprehensive commitments, including changes in provisions on labor, environment, e-commerce, services, and intellectual property rights. These changes stem from updated negotiating objectives and agreements like the \"May 10th Agreement.\" NAFTA included unique provisions like Chapter 19 for trade remedy case review and visa issuance commitments for business persons, not found in later U.S. FTAs. The \"May 10th Agreement\" clarified U.S. trade negotiating objectives. The Jordan FTA, ratified in 2001 without TPA procedures, has fewer commitments than NAFTA. The Uruguay Round Agreements, in force in 1995, included commitments on issues like services trade and intellectual property rights. U.S. FTAs after 1995 build upon these multilateral commitments with variations in specific commitments among the 14 agreements. Common elements in NAFTA and later FTAs include core rules like nondiscriminatory and national treatment among parties. U.S. FTAs prioritize nondiscriminatory and national treatment, transparency in regulations, and market access. They eliminate most tariffs immediately, with sensitive items phased out over time. Nontariff provisions cover import/export restrictions and ban import duties on remanufactured goods. Jordan FTA includes provisions on competition policy, monopolies, and state enterprises. These provisions require parties to maintain laws prohibiting anticompetitive behavior and ensure transparency in purchase and sale decisions by monopolies. The U.S. Singapore FTA includes extensive language on state-owned enterprises (SOEs), requiring nondiscriminatory treatment in the purchase and sale of goods and services. NAFTA established rules on customs procedures and administration, including requirements for importers to claim preferential treatment and customs agencies to respond to requests for advance rulings on imports. Later U.S. FTAs expanded trade facilitation provisions to include the release of goods with target timeframes and automation through electronic systems. The U.S. FTAs with Colombia, Oman, Panama, Peru, and South Korea establish expedited customs procedures for shipments below a minimum de minimis threshold. The de minimis threshold in the United States is currently $800. These FTAs were implemented before the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement in 2017. NAFTA includes core service commitments and rules on customs procedures. The NAFTA financial services chapter establishes transparency commitments in the regulatory process, including time limits for responses to administrative requests. It also ensures that opportunities to supply newly approved financial services in any party's market are accessible to all parties' firms, with a requirement for companies to transfer \"information in electronic form\" across territories. U.S. FTAs following NAFTA also include market access provisions for cross-border and financial services. FTAs post-NAFTA have market access provisions for cross-border and financial services, prohibiting restrictions on service providers, transactions, and legal entities. They also include transparency, regulatory requirements, and a dispute settlement mechanism with a panel of arbiters for resolving disputes. Disputes are usually resolved through consultation before formal adjudication. The U.S. FTAs have provisions for resolving disputes through consultation or WTO adjudication. Only four cases have been resolved through a U.S. FTA dispute settlement panel. E-commerce chapters in U.S. FTAs have expanded with provisions to prohibit customs duties on electronic products and ensure non-discriminatory treatment of digital products. The KORUS FTA has the most comprehensive e-commerce chapter. The U.S. FTAs have provisions for resolving disputes through consultation or WTO adjudication, with only four cases resolved through a U.S. FTA dispute settlement panel. The e-commerce chapters in U.S. FTAs include provisions on electronic authentication, electronic signatures, and data flow across borders. Government procurement commitments in U.S. FTAs provide access to government procurement markets with nondiscriminatory and national treatment, depending on the partner's membership in the WTO Government Procurement Agreement. The number of states participating in U.S. FTAs has decreased over time, with only 10 state participants in the KORUS FTA. Among U.S. FTA partner countries, Canada, Israel, Singapore, and South Korea are members of the GPA. NAFTA's commitments on intellectual property rights were significant, including protections for copyrights, patents, trade secrets, trademarks, and enforcement requirements. The 2002 TPA established new U.S. FTA commitments on IPR, including longer copyright protection, patent term extensions, patent linkage provisions, internet service provider liability, safe harbor provisions, and domain name dispute resolution commitments. The \"May 10th Agreement\" made modifications to U.S. FTA IPR commitments regarding patents for pharmaceutical products, including optional patent term extension and patent linkage provisions, and limitations on data exclusivity period. U.S. FTAs also include commitments to reduce investment restrictions and ensure investor protections, going beyond multilateral commitments. The U.S. FTAs include provisions for treatment of domestic and foreign parties, minimum standard of treatment, compensation for expropriation, restrictions on performance requirements, expeditious fund transfer, denial of benefits to investors with limited activity, and an investor-state dispute settlement mechanism. NAFTA also improved labor and environmental protections in U.S. FTAs. The United States, Canada, and Mexico negotiated side agreements on labor and the environment that were included in NAFTA implementing legislation, requiring effective enforcement of labor and environmental laws with high standards. Subsequent FTAs have included specific labor and environmental commitments in the main text, evolving from the original NAFTA side agreements. The \"May 10th Agreement\" marked a significant progression in U.S. FTA labor and environmental commitments. The United States has made significant progress in FTA labor and environmental commitments, requiring enforcement of laws and specific worker rights. Disputes under U.S. FTAs in these areas have been minimal, with one labor case involving Guatemala. Rules of Origin determine product eligibility for preferential duty treatment under FTAs. Rules of Origin in U.S. FTAs vary in origin requirements for preferential duty treatment. For example, NAFTA requires 62.5% regional value content for autos, while KORUS FTA requires 35%. Safeguards in U.S. FTAs allow temporary reinstatement of tariffs to protect domestic industries from imports, with NAFTA having the strongest language on this provision. The provision in NAFTA requires parties to exclude imports from other FTA parties in global safeguard cases unless they account for a substantial share of imports or cause particular harm. U.S. FTAs also include commitments on antidumping and countervailing duty agreements, as well as Sanitary and Phytosanitary Standards (SPS) to address trade-related measures for health and safety. NAFTA and the multilateral SPS agreement have enforceable provisions to ensure transparent, nondiscriminatory SPS measures. After the SPS agreement came into force in 1995, subsequent U.S. FTA commitments on SPS issues largely reinforce the multilateral agreement and establish committees for consultation. Certain agriculture industries credit these committees for removing SPS barriers to U.S. exports. Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) also address regulations to protect domestic interests and ensure measures are transparent, nondiscriminatory, and based on science and risk assessments. U.S. FTAs on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) aim to be transparent, nondiscriminatory, and based on science and risk assessments. They build on the SPS agreement, affirm rights and obligations, and may include industry-specific commitments. For example, the KORUS FTA has motor vehicle standards. FTAs also cover telecommunications, ensuring access, transparency, and competition in the sector. The U.S. FTAs with Chile and Singapore include provisions for number portability, regulatory bodies, and transparent allocation of resources like frequencies. These agreements also emphasize transparency and good governance, requiring the publication of relevant laws and allowing stakeholder input. Later FTAs expanded on these commitments. U.S. FTAs include provisions for anti-corruption and appeal mechanisms for administrative actions. They cover a significant portion of U.S. trade, influencing global trading rules and sparking debate. Less than half of U.S. trade occurs with FTA partners. In 2016, 99% of all U.S. trade took place with WTO members, while 39% of U.S. exports and 32% of imports were with U.S. FTA partners. NAFTA accounts for the majority of U.S. trade with FTA partners. Future U.S. FTA negotiations could increase the share of U.S. trade covered by FTAs. Not all trade with FTA partners utilizes FTA benefits. The Trump Administration and some Members of Congress focus on bilateral trade balances with U.S. FTA partners, arguing that a trade deficit indicates unfairness. Economists believe trade balances are influenced by macroeconomic factors. In 2016, the U.S. had a goods trade surplus with nine out of 14 FTAs but an overall deficit of $72.6 billion with all FTA countries combined. In 2016, the United States had a relatively balanced trade with its FTA partners, with a total trade deficit of $15.8 billion out of over $1.7 trillion in total trade. U.S. trade with FTA partners accounted for nearly 35% of its global trade, with the largest FTAs like Canada, Mexico, South Korea, CAFTA-DR countries, Singapore, and Australia making up over 90% of the trade. The United States had a balanced trade with its FTA partners in 2016, with a total trade deficit of $15.8 billion out of over $1.7 trillion in total trade. The largest FTAs like Canada, Mexico, South Korea, CAFTA-DR countries, Singapore, and Australia accounted for more than 90% of U.S. trade with FTA partners. Table 1 and Table 2 show the types of goods and services traded with these partners, highlighting supply chain linkages and U.S. specialization in different stages of production. Examples include U.S. motor vehicle and parts trade with Canada and Mexico, U.S. computer equipment trade with Mexico, and U.S. exports of fibers, yarns, and threads to CAFTA-DR countries. U.S. aircraft and parts are top exports to South Korea, Singapore, and Australia, showcasing U.S. specialization in high-tech products. More than 20% of U.S. goods imports come from Australia. U.S. services trade with top FTA partners is concentrated in key categories such as travel, business services, and charges for intellectual property. Travel accounts for over one-third of U.S. services trade with FTA partners, including tourism and travel for business and educational purposes. South Korean student expenses at U.S. universities are considered U.S. travel service exports. Nearly 80% of U.S. imports from CAFTA-DR countries and over 65% of U.S. imports from Mexico are in travel services. More than half of U.S. services imports from South Korea are transport services, while over 65% of U.S. imports from Mexico are in travel services. Roughly half of U.S. goods imports from FTA partners entered under preferential FTA duty rates in 2017, possibly due to challenges in meeting agreement requirements or low existing tariffs. The usage rates of U.S. FTAs highlight the importance of evaluating specific provisions like rules of origin. Preferential tariff treatment is more important to some FTA partners and is concentrated in certain product groups. Less than 10% of U.S. imports from Singapore utilize FTA benefits. Since 1990, regional trade agreements (RTAs) have significantly increased in number and scope, becoming a dominant force in international trade negotiations. Preferential tariff treatment varies among U.S. FTA partners, with apparel being a top import category for some, while motor vehicles account for the largest share of preferential treatment, especially from major partners like Canada, Mexico, and South Korea. The number of RTAs in force and notified to the WTO has increased seven-fold, with the average depth of provisions doubling. The United States is party to 14 out of 287 agreements, potentially affecting U.S. stakeholders and trade policy goals. Lower tariffs in RTAs can disadvantage U.S. exporters, while other countries' participation can attract more investment compared to the U.S. RTAs, including those not involving the United States, can impact global trading rules and U.S. influence. These agreements have a long history predating the multilateral trading system, with negotiations shifting to the GATT post-World War II. Despite the rise of multilateral agreements, RTAs continue to coexist and offer benefits such as preferential market access and lower import costs. RTAs, including those beyond Europe, gained prominence in trade policy post-1980s, alongside the multilateral system. The conclusion of the 1994 Uruguay Round marked progress for both RTAs and the WTO, incorporating provisions from agreements like NAFTA. RTAs, such as NAFTA, spread globally in the 1990s. They have become the main tool for trade reform, with countries like the US, EU, Mexico, Chile, China, Japan, and South Korea pursuing bilateral and regional agreements. East Asia now hosts the second largest number of RTAs. East Asia is the second largest region for Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) after Europe. The European Union leads in forming RTAs with 59 partners. The top 20 U.S. trading partners are actively involved in RTAs, with an average of 20 partners each. The United States has its own Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with 8 of these top partners. Trade agreements are common among developed and developing countries. In the late 1970s, 60% of all Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) were between developed and developing countries, but now agreements among developing countries make up over two-thirds of global RTAs. Trade agreements between developed and developing countries have decreased to one-quarter of global RTAs. RTAs among developed countries now account for less than 10% of global RTAs. This shift highlights the increasing importance of developing countries in international economic activity and policymaking. Mega-regional negotiations have also become more common among the largest trading nations in recent years. Trading nations are engaging in mega-regional negotiations to expand world trade covered by Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs). New agreements between major economies like the United States, European Union, China, and Japan could simplify global trade rules but raise concerns about discrimination. This shift towards larger agreements consolidates existing bilateral RTAs into fewer agreements. Under the Trump Administration, the United States has focused on bilateral agreements instead of mega-regional pacts like the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). Other countries are still pursuing mega-regional agreements, which are likely to remain significant in the global trading system. The U.S. stance on these negotiations could change if there are negative economic impacts from not participating. Major trade agreements currently being negotiated or implemented include the EU-Japan RTA. Trade agreements have expanded in number and depth over the past decades, with various regional trade agreements being negotiated or implemented, such as the EU-Japan RTA, CPTPP, Pacific Alliance expansion, RCEP, and Tripartite Agreement. These agreements vary in their tariff coverage and enforceability of nontariff commitments. Regional trade agreements (RTAs) vary in their coverage of services trade, with only about half of all RTAs covering services. RTAs can deepen multilateral commitments by reducing tariffs or providing access to services markets, but they can also establish new provisions beyond WTO rules. RTAs have become important for creating new rules in the global trading system due to delays in multilateral negotiations. The heterogeneity in RTAs raises questions about adherence to WTO criteria and the potential impact of new rules on U.S. interests. Tariffs remain a core aspect of trade agreements. RTAs notified to the WTO under Article XXIV of the GATT are required to cover substantially all trade, with most agreements liberalizing more than 80% of trade. However, some agreements fall below the 80% tariff line threshold, especially excluding agricultural products. Textile and apparel products are also commonly protected in RTAs. The study analyzed the implementation of RTAs, with 40% requiring tariff phase-outs within 5 years, 63% within 10 years, and over 90% within 20 years. U.S. FTAs showed high rates of tariff liberalization, eliminating most tariffs by the end of the implementation period. Australia, Hong Kong, and Singapore also showed heterogeneity in their RTAs with the U.S. trading partners. Among top U.S. trade partners, Australia, Hong Kong, and Singapore have completely liberalized their tariffs, with higher rates than the United States. India stands out for its low rates of liberalization, while Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand have extensively eliminated tariffs, especially in agricultural products. Despite FTAs with the United States eliminating most tariffs, some U.S. FTA partners still maintain tariff barriers on a significant number of tariff lines in their RTAs. The study shows that U.S. FTA partners have varying levels of tariff liberalization, with some countries like South Korea and Mexico retaining tariffs on a significant number of tariff lines in their RTAs. The U.S. has been successful in extracting concessions and setting parameters for FTA negotiations, prioritizing comprehensive tariff coverage. Additionally, the growth in global RTAs has led to diversity in nontariff provisions, with agreements varying in enforceability and extent of commitments. U.S. FTAs cover a broad range of issues, including services, investment, IPR, and government procurement. Compared to global RTAs, U.S. FTAs have more extensive commitments. Roughly half of agreements include provisions on trade in services. The negative versus positive list approach is a key factor in the structure of these commitments. The negative versus positive list approach is a key factor in the structure of commitments in services agreements. NAFTA was the first U.S. FTA to include extensive commitments on services trade, with the negative list approach becoming a model for global RTAs. The exclusions and specific commitments determine the level of liberalization achieved in agreements. For example, two-thirds of EU agreements exclude audio-visual services, a major export interest of the United States. The WTO study analyzed 122 services agreements, with 54 following a NAFTA-style negative list approach. The GATS positive list approach is used in 48 RTAs, mainly among developing countries. Regional differences exist, with the Americas favoring the NAFTA approach and Asia using the GATS positive list approach. The structure of RTA services commitments varies, but the agreements do not differ significantly to hinder future multilateralization. Concerns include the exclusion of least-developed countries due to lack of institutional capacity for negotiations. The 2016 WTO study found that 174 out of 245 RTAs have IP provisions, with the US, Japan, and the EU leading in IPR coverage. US FTAs consistently include high levels of IP protections, while EU and Japanese agreements vary in their IP content. EFTA countries also have a significant share of RTAs with high IPR commitments. Developing countries, including Mexico, actively participate in RTAs with IPR commitments. The US and EU lead in global trade negotiations, with the EU having the largest RTA network and ongoing negotiations with major partners like Japan. Different approaches to RTA commitments between the US and EU are discussed. The EU and US have different approaches to RTA rules, with the EU having a large network and ongoing negotiations with partners like Japan. This could impact future trade agreements and stakeholders. Digital trade and data privacy have become key priorities in recent RTA agreements due to the increase in internet-based commercial activity and concerns over data privacy and national security. The EU and US have different approaches to digital trade issues, with the EU focusing on privacy as a fundamental right. US firms handling EU citizens' data must comply with GDPR. US FTAs like TPP include enforceable language allowing data transfer across borders and prohibiting data localization requirements. The TPP and EU's FTA with Japan have different approaches to data flows and localization requirements. The EU may be moving towards more explicit language on these issues in future RTAs. Geographical Indications (GIs) are protected intellectual property in both the US and EU, but with different legal regimes. The United States and the EU have different legal regimes for protecting Geographical Indications (GIs), with the US using its trademark registration system and the EU using quality schemes. There is a divide in the US industry over GI protections, with some arguing that EU protections restrict the use of common food names, giving an advantage to EU producers. Other US producers, like those in the wine industry, are seeking a more extensive GI protection system similar to the EU's approach. The EU has secured restrictions on marketing GIs with major U.S. trade partners through trade agreements. The EU-Japan agreement protects over 200 GIs, and negotiations with Mexico are ongoing for expanded GI coverage. The USTR has concerns with the EU's GI approach. The EU has adopted a new investment court model in recent trade agreements with Canada and Vietnam for investment dispute settlement. The EU has adopted a new investment court model in recent trade agreements with Canada and Vietnam, aiming to address perceived shortcomings of ISDS. The U.S. business community supports ISDS in U.S. FTAs, arguing it provides stronger investor protections compared to the EU's system. The U.S. government's position on ISDS may be changing under the Trump Administration, with concerns raised over potential infringement on U.S. sovereignty. The United States, under Ambassador Lighthizer's direction, has proposed significant changes to the NAFTA ISDS system as part of the ongoing NAFTA renegotiation. Differences in standards between the U.S. and EU can impact exports to third country markets. Commitments on recognition of standards in trade agreements may benefit exporters but could also favor EU or U.S. producers in third country markets. The KOREU agreement encourages South Korea to align with EU motor vehicle safety standards, posing a challenge for U.S. automakers. Differences in standards between the EU and U.S. also impact agriculture and food safety regulations. U.S. industry representatives are advocating for Mexico and Canada to adopt U.S. vehicle safety standards in NAFTA negotiations. The U.S. and EU have different approaches to agriculture and food safety standards, with unresolved trade disputes over SPS issues. The EU's precautionary principle guides its regulatory process, leading to differences with the U.S.'s risk-based assessments. Concerns exist about how global RTAs not involving the U.S. may impact U.S. commercial interests. Global RTAs not involving the United States may affect U.S. commercial interests, particularly industries heavily reliant on exports and facing higher tariffs in foreign markets. Concerns include potential price disadvantages and reduced sales compared to foreign competitors. The impact varies based on product specifics, existing tariff rates, and the size of economies involved. Despite falling worldwide average MFN tariff rates, discriminatory preferential treatment through RTAs remains a concern for U.S. industries. Despite falling worldwide average MFN tariff rates, discriminatory preferential treatment through RTAs remains a concern for U.S. industries, with tariff peaks in certain industries and countries. Examples include U.S. exports to major foreign markets negotiating trade agreements with other U.S. trade partners, such as the CPTPP and the EU's agreements with Japan and Vietnam. The analysis compares U.S. FTAs with top trading partners like the EU, China, Canada, Mexico, Japan, and South Korea. It highlights examples of U.S. exports facing tariffs in foreign markets due to RTAs with other U.S. trade partners, such as the EU's agreements with Japan and Vietnam. The analysis examines the characteristics of trading partners' Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs), including enforceable commitments, share of goods trade, and tariff exclusions. Data is sourced from the WTO RTA database, country trade ministry websites, and various databases for enforceable commitments and tariff analysis. The analysis focuses on trading partners' RTAs, with key observations on U.S. FTAs and top U.S. trade partners. The EU has more RTAs than the U.S., while other top trading partners have similar agreements covering more countries. U.S. trade partners like Canada, Mexico, and South Korea have RTAs with the EU, while China and Japan have RTAs with ASEAN. The U.S. is renegotiating NAFTA and KORUS, with new negotiations on hold. U.S. goods trade with FTA partners accounts for 39% of total trade. The Trump Administration notes that U.S. goods trade with FTA partners accounts for 39% of total trade, similar to China, the EU, and Japan. The U.S., China, Japan, and the EU do not have trade agreements in force with each other yet. Canada, Mexico, and South Korea already have trade agreements with their major trading partners, with high shares of goods trade. The U.S. is the only country in this group consistently including enforceable labor and environmental provisions in its RTAs. On average, less than 10% of RTAs among these trading partners include such provisions. Based on the sample covered, U.S. FTAs have the most comprehensive tariff coverage among the group with less than 1% of tariff lines subject to duties following complete FTA implementation. China's RTAs represent the least liberalized among the sample with an average of 15% of tariff lines still subject to duties. The United States has the most comprehensive agricultural coverage with less than 2% of tariff lines subject to duty after all commitments have been phased in. Excluded agricultural tariff lines for top U.S. trading partners range from 9% to 43%. The top U.S. trading partners' RTAs cover goods and agriculture tariffs, with enforceable commitments on customs, services, IPR, investment, and procurement. Differences exist in the level of commitments in various RTAs, with U.S. FTAs having extensive provisions. The Trump Administration has withdrawn from the proposed TPP and initiated renegotiations of existing U.S. agreements. The Trump Administration has withdrawn from the proposed TPP and initiated renegotiations of existing U.S. agreements, including NAFTA and KORUS. Major U.S. trade partners are moving forward with regional trade agreements without the United States. Congress may need to consider the structure of U.S. FTA negotiations and future trade agreement policies. The Trump Administration has focused on bilateral negotiations for future FTAs, while some experts argue for multi-party agreements. Congress may need to consider the effectiveness of bilateral negotiations and the inclusion of multi-party negotiations in U.S. FTA policies. The evolution of U.S. FTA negotiations under Congress direction has led to comprehensive agreements covering tariff, services trade, intellectual property, labor, and environmental protections. The Trump Administration seeks changes to existing FTAs, with some proposals aligning with past positions and others representing significant departures. Congress faces questions on U.S. trade negotiating objectives. The Trump Administration's objectives for NAFTA renegotiation and U.S. FTA negotiating procedures are under scrutiny by Congress to ensure alignment with the 2015 TPA law. Congress and the executive branch collaborate on U.S. FTAs, with the President granted trade promotion authority for expedited consideration of trade agreements. The Trump Administration has adhered to TPA notification requirements for NAFTA renegotiations but not for KORUS talks. Changes to KORUS will focus on tariff and regulatory modifications, not requiring Congress legislation. President has expressed willingness to withdraw from both agreements. Questions for Congress include the need for clarity on congressional consent for FTA modifications. US has played a key role in establishing global trade rules. The United States has played a crucial role in shaping global trade rules through multilateral negotiations and bilateral agreements like NAFTA. Its leadership has influenced provisions in later agreements and set norms aligning with U.S. interests. As other major economies pursue new trade deals without the U.S., questions arise about congressional consent for FTA modifications. Some trade policy experts worry that the United States may be losing an opportunity to shape future trade rules and influence other countries in adopting standards in areas such as IPR and labor as Japan and other countries move forward with new agreements that do not involve the U.S. The proliferation of global RTAs has fundamentally altered the global trading system, raising questions about the long-term implications for U.S. trade rules-setting leadership and the impact on U.S. stakeholders. The proliferation of global Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) has allowed countries to engage in new trade negotiations, reducing barriers and addressing nontariff issues. However, RTAs can be discriminatory towards non-participating countries like the United States, despite exceptions allowed by the World Trade Organization (WTO). There are concerns about the adequacy of criteria for RTAs under WTO rules and their potential impact on U.S. trade leadership. Existing criteria on types of RTAs under WTO rules and their enforcement are being questioned. Ways to improve rules and monitoring systems are being considered. The multilateral system's ability to address key trade issues is being evaluated. The impact of global RTAs on the US economy and stakeholders is a concern, as they can make US exports more costly and less competitive. Certain industries, like agriculture, may be affected due to reliance on imported components. The US industries, such as agriculture, are sensitive to tariff changes and potential disadvantage in foreign markets due to other countries' RTA negotiations. RTAs among top US export partners without FTAs could have significant negative consequences, like the EU-Japan FTA eliminating tariffs on auto and agriculture imports. The CPTPP agreement would likely reduce US exports to Japan. The potential negative consequences of new RTAs among top U.S. trade partners could impact industries like agriculture. The U.S. may need to prioritize its response by pursuing multilateral, bilateral, or regional FTA negotiations. The Trump Administration is interested in negotiating new FTAs with countries like Japan and the United Kingdom. The lack of interest in new trade negotiations with the United States from TPP countries may be due to current contentious talks with NAFTA parties. Congress has encouraged exploring FTAs with specific partners, raising questions on prioritizing partners and the impact of America First agenda on future trade negotiations. The United States has significant bilateral trade deficits with FTA partner countries like Mexico and South Korea. The Trump Administration sees these deficits as signs of flawed FTAs. Economists argue that factors like savings, investment, exchange rates, and economic growth drive trade patterns. Congress may question the impact of FTAs on trade balances and the effectiveness of modifying FTAs without addressing broader macroeconomic factors. The risks of using trade balance as the main metric in evaluating bilateral trade relations are also a concern. The risks of using trade balance as the key metric in evaluating bilateral trade relations and U.S. FTAs are highlighted in various CRS materials on existing and proposed FTAs, including NAFTA, KORUS, TPP, T-TIP, and CAFTA-DR. The American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is discussed in various CRS reports, along with other FTAs like KORUS, TPP, and T-TIP. These reports analyze the potential effects of NAFTA renegotiation, motor vehicle trade, U.S. withdrawal from FTAs, and the risks of using trade balance as a key metric in evaluating bilateral trade relations. The curr_chunk discusses various Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) and Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) involving countries like ASEAN, CARICOM, and CARIFORUM. It provides information on the U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement, U.S.-UK Free Trade Agreement, and T-TIP negotiations. The curr_chunk lists countries included in different Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) such as COMESA, CPTPP, EFTA, and the EU. The curr_chunk provides a list of countries included in various Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) such as EU-Central America, EU-East African Community, EU-Eastern and Southern Africa Interim, EU-South African Development Community, Gulf Cooperation Council, Mercosur, Venezuela's suspended membership, Mexico-Central America RTA, and NAFTA. The curr_chunk lists countries in different Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) like NAFTA, Pacific Alliance, RCEP, TPP, T-TIP, and U.S.-CAFTA-DR FTA. The United States withdrew from TPP in 2017, and T-TIP negotiations are on hold."
