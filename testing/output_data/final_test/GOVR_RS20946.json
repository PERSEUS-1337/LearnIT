    "content": "Medicare is a federal insurance program established in 1965 under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide health insurance to individuals aged 65 and older, as well as permanently disabled individuals under 65. It consists of four parts, A through D, with Part A covering hospital services, skilled nursing facility services, home health visits, and hospice services. Part B covers medical services like physician services, laboratory services, durable medical equipment, and outpatient hospital services. Medicare consists of four parts: A covers hospital services, skilled nursing facility services, home health visits, and hospice services, while Part B covers medical services like physician services, laboratory services, durable medical equipment, and outpatient hospital services. Part C, Medicare Advantage, offers private plan options for those enrolled in both Part A and Part B, and Part D provides optional outpatient prescription drug coverage. Medicare expenditures are influenced by factors such as enrollment levels, medical service complexity, healthcare inflation, and life expectancy. In 2017, Medicare served about 58.4 million individuals at a cost of $710.2 billion, funded through the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund. The HI Trust Fund and SMI Trust Fund, overseen by the Medicare Board of Trustees, report annually to Congress on financial status. Projections are based on economic assumptions. HI Trust Fund faces insolvency, while SMI Trust Fund cannot. Concerns exist about rapid growth in SMI costs. HI portion of Medicare is self-supporting and financed through dedicated sources. The HI portion of Medicare is self-supporting and financed through dedicated sources of income, including payroll taxes, additional taxes on high-income workers, premiums from voluntary enrollees, federal income taxes on Social Security benefits, and interest on federal securities. The HI Trust Fund in the U.S. Treasury receives income from various sources including taxes paid by current workers and their employers to pay Part A benefits for Medicare beneficiaries. Actual money is not transferred into or out of the fund, operating on a \"pay-as-you-go\" basis. Interest-bearing government securities are credited to the trust fund when the government receives Medicare revenues. The HI Trust Fund in the U.S. Treasury receives income from various sources including taxes paid by current workers and their employers to pay Part A benefits for Medicare beneficiaries. The tax income exchanged for securities goes into the General Fund of the Treasury and is used for government spending. When payments for Medicare Part A services are made, the corresponding securities are deleted from the HI Trust Fund. In years with a cash-flow surplus, the fund's assets increase, but these surpluses are not reserved for future Medicare benefits. The HI Trust Fund in the U.S. Treasury receives income from various sources including taxes paid by current workers and their employers to pay Part A benefits for Medicare beneficiaries. If the HI Trust Fund spends more than it receives in income, it has a cash-flow deficit. Medicare can redeem securities accumulated in previous years to cover deficits. When the assets credited to the trust fund reach zero, the fund is deemed insolvent. The Medicare Board of Trustees projected insolvency for the HI Trust Fund has never become insolvent. The Medicare Board of Trustees projected insolvency for the HI Trust Fund in 1970, expecting it to become insolvent in two years. The insolvency date has been postponed multiple times through adjustments like payroll tax rate changes and legislative measures to slow spending growth. Congressional efforts in the mid-1990s aimed to balance the federal budget and led to the passage of legislation to curtail Medicare spending. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA 97; P.L. 105-33) improved short-term projections for the Medicare HI Trust Fund by reducing expenditures through changes in Medicare payments and combating fraud. Strong economic growth also boosted revenues. Concerns arose that the savings from BBA 97 exceeded expectations and had unintended consequences. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA 97) had unintended consequences for health care providers, leading to the enactment of the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 (BBRA 99) and the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA 2000). Despite efforts to reverse spending reductions, the 2001 and 2002 Medicare Trustees Reports continued to delay the projected insolvency date due to economic growth, lower program costs, and improved antifraud initiatives. However, the 2003 report projections showed a shift in direction. The 2003 report projected the HI Trust Fund to become insolvent in 2026, four years earlier than previously projected in 2002. This revision was due to lower HI-taxable payroll and higher hospital expenditures. The 2004 report then projected insolvency in 2019, seven years earlier than in 2003, attributed to slow wage growth and increased inpatient hospital benefits. The enactment of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 also added to HI costs. The HI Trust Fund projected insolvency dates have been revised multiple times over the years. The 2004 report estimated insolvency in 2020, but subsequent reports moved the date earlier to 2017 due to economic factors. The 2010 report, after the ACA enactment, projected depletion in 2029, 12 years later than previously estimated. The 2011 report projected the HI Trust Fund would become insolvent in 2024, five years earlier than the 2010 report. This was due to lower payroll taxes from high unemployment and slow wage growth in 2010. Despite projected economic recovery and additional taxes, income was still insufficient to cover expenses. In their 2013 report, the Medicare trustees projected the HI Trust Fund insolvency date to be 2026, two years later than their 2012 estimate. The improved outlook was due to lower expenditures in 2012 and changes in ACA payment methodology. In 2014, the insolvency date was moved to 2030, four years later than the previous estimate, mainly due to lower expected spending on certain Part A services. The 2015 report maintained the 2030 insolvency date estimate, and the 2016 report projected a slightly worsened outlook. The 2016 Medicare Trustees Report projected a worsened short-term outlook for the HI Trust Fund, moving the insolvency date two years earlier to 2028 due to lower-than-expected payroll-tax income. In 2017, the insolvency date was moved one year later to 2029, attributed to lower HI expenditures in 2016 and reduced future utilization of inpatient hospital services. However, the 2018 report projected a worsened outlook, moving the insolvency date three years earlier to 2026. The 2018 Medicare Trustees Report projected the insolvency date of the HI Trust Fund to be 2026, earlier than their 2017 estimate. This shift was due to changes in estimates affecting HI revenues, including lower-than-expected wages and slower GDP growth. Trust fund assets would be used to cover the difference between income and expenditures until depletion in 2026. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) actuaries have issued an alternative scenario assuming certain ACA changes would be phased out starting in 2028. The HI Trust Fund allows payment of bills during financial strain without legislative action. If the fund cannot cover expenses, it is considered insolvent. The HI Trust Fund is projected to be insolvent by 2026, leading to a shortfall in funding for Part A services. Without action to increase revenues or decrease expenditures, Congress may need to find alternative sources of funding, such as general revenues, to cover the deficits. The financial status of Medicare is a concern, particularly the HI Trust Fund's projected insolvency by 2026. This could lead to a shortfall in funding for Part A services, requiring alternative sources of funding like general revenues. Total Medicare spending obligations are expected to increase due to growing beneficiaries and healthcare costs. The shift towards outpatient care in Parts B and D settings is also noted. The shift to outpatient care in Medicare has led to more spending covered by beneficiary premiums and general revenues. The trustees predict an increase in personal and corporate income taxes needed to fund SMI. Expenditures exceeded income from 2008 to 2017, with the HI Trust Fund assets used to cover the shortfall. Expenditures exceeded income from 2008 to 2015, with a small surplus in 2016 and 2017. Starting in 2018, expenditures are projected to surpass income annually, using trust fund assets until depletion in 2026. This would lead to insufficient funds for full Part A expenditure payments by the HI Trust Fund. See Table A-1 for historical and projected Medicare financial data through 2027."
