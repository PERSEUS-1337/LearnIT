    "content": "The Court adopted the undue burden standard in Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992, reaffirming the right to abortion while allowing new restrictions. They did not overrule Roe v. Wade but refined its holding by abandoning the trimester framework. In Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992, the Court refined its holding in Roe by adopting the undue burden standard, which reconciles the government's interest in potential life with a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy. This standard determines that an undue burden exists if an abortion regulation purposefully obstructs a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus is viable. In Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992, the Court established the undue burden standard, which assesses if an abortion regulation creates a substantial obstacle for a woman seeking an abortion before fetal viability. The Court upheld most provisions of a Pennsylvania law but invalidated the spousal notification requirement due to concerns about potential harm to women in abusive relationships. The Court's decision in Casey established the undue burden standard, which may prevent many women from obtaining abortions by imposing substantial obstacles. This standard allowed more abortion regulations to pass constitutional muster compared to Roe's strict scrutiny standard. Casey recognized the state's interest in protecting the potentiality of human life throughout pregnancy. The state's interest in protecting human life extends throughout pregnancy, allowing regulation favoring childbirth over abortion. The Court applied the undue burden standard in cases like Mazurek v. Armstrong, where a Montana law restricting abortions to licensed physicians was challenged. The Supreme Court found no evidence that a law restricting a specific abortion procedure imposed an undue burden on women seeking abortions. The law only affected a single practitioner and did not have an improper purpose or create a substantial obstacle. The Court's decision in Stenberg v. Carhart invalidated a Nebraska law due to its impact on a woman's ability to terminate a pregnancy. The Court upheld the federal Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 in Gonzales, stating it did not impose an undue burden on women seeking abortions. This law included \"anatomical landmarks\" to identify prohibited procedures without restricting alternate options. Additionally, at least 15 states have laws requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. In Texas, a physician performing an abortion must have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles. Violating this could result in a fine of up to $4,000. The requirement was seen as raising the standard of care for women seeking abortions, but opponents argued it could lead to the closure of abortion facilities. Planned Parenthood and other providers challenged the constitutionality of this requirement. In Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas Surgical Health Services v. Abbott, the Fifth Circuit upheld the constitutionality of the admitting privileges requirement for abortion providers in Texas. Despite concerns about facility closures and increased travel distances, the court found that the requirement did not impose an undue burden. Whole Woman's Health later challenged the requirement as applied to specific clinics in El Paso and McAllen, leading to a federal district court ruling that the requirement was unconstitutional for those clinics. The Fifth Circuit upheld the constitutionality of the admitting privileges requirement for abortion providers in Texas. In Whole Woman's Health v. Cole, the appeals court found the provider's facial challenge to the requirement failed on procedural grounds. The court rejected the facial challenge but upheld an injunction of the requirement as applied to the abortion facility in McAllen. The Fifth Circuit upheld the admitting privileges requirement for abortion providers in Texas, citing a nearby abortion facility in New Mexico to argue it did not impose an undue burden. The court distinguished the Texas requirement from a similar one in Mississippi, which would have led to the closure of the last abortion facility in the state if invalidated. The Fifth Circuit upheld the ASC requirement for abortion providers in Texas, stating that it did not impose an undue burden. Texas regulations define ASCs as facilities that primarily provide surgical services without overnight hospitalization. The court found that the plaintiffs' claim regarding the ASC requirement failed on procedural and merits grounds. The Fifth Circuit upheld the ASC requirement for abortion providers in Texas, stating it did not impose an undue burden. The court found that a facial challenge to the requirement would fail as it did not obstruct women seeking abortions. The court also noted that the ASC requirement was not adopted for an improper purpose, despite the lower court's findings. The Fifth Circuit upheld the ASC requirement for abortion providers in Texas, stating it did not impose an undue burden. The court found that the requirement did not place a substantial obstacle for women seeking abortions, unlike the spousal notification requirement in Casey. The ASC requirement was deemed not to have a similar effect as the spousal notification requirement. The Fifth Circuit upheld the ASC requirement for abortion providers in Texas, stating it did not impose an undue burden. Only 16.7% of women of reproductive age would have to travel more than 150 miles for an abortion. The court acknowledged the distance some women in the Rio Grande Valley would have to travel and enjoined the state from enforcing the requirement at the McAllen facility. The Fifth Circuit upheld the ASC requirement for abortion providers in Texas, stating it did not impose an undue burden. The court acknowledged the distance some women in the Rio Grande Valley would have to travel and enjoined the state from enforcing the requirement at the McAllen facility due to the 235-mile distance. The court declined to affirm the lower court's judgment involving the ASC requirement as applied to the El Paso facility, citing the availability of abortion services in New Mexico. The Fifth Circuit upheld the ASC requirement for abortion providers in Texas, stating it did not impose an undue burden. Whole Woman's Health challenged the decision, arguing that the promotion of women's health was not adequately considered and that newly developed facts should be taken into account. In a 5-3 decision, the Court rejected procedural and constitutional grounds for the Fifth Circuit's decision in Cole. Justice Breyer found that res judicata did not bar facial challenges to admitting privileges and ASC requirements, stating they pose an undue burden on women seeking abortions. The undue burden standard requires courts to consider the benefits and burdens of abortion laws. Justice Breyer emphasized the importance of evidence and arguments in determining constitutionality. The Court rejected procedural and constitutional grounds for the Fifth Circuit's decision in Cole, emphasizing the importance of evidence and arguments in determining constitutionality of abortion regulations. The Court distinguished pre-enforcement and post-enforcement challenges, noting that new material facts can impact the claim's validity. Res judicata did not preclude a facial challenge to the ASC requirement. The Court found that res judicata did not prevent a facial challenge to the ASC requirement, emphasizing the separate nature of the ASC and admitting privileges requirements. The decision not to challenge the ASC requirement in Abbott was deemed reasonable due to the lack of regulations and the possibility of waivers. The Hellerstedt Court heavily relied on evidence from the district court in applying the undue burden standard to the admitting privileges and ASC requirements. The Court disputed the state's assertion that admitting privileges requirement ensures easy hospital access for abortion complications, citing low complication rates and expert testimony. The law did not address significant health problems and created obstacles for women due to facility closures and increased driving distances. The Court found that the ASC requirement imposed a substantial obstacle on women's access to abortion, citing evidence of facility closures and increased costs. Texas's argument that remaining clinics could expand was deemed insufficient, as it would burden abortion access. The Court's focus on record evidence and balancing burdens of abortion regulations against benefits clarifies the undue burden standard. The Fifth Circuit's dismissal of evidence in Abbott and Lakey was criticized in Hellerstedt for not aligning with the Casey Court's standard. Justice Alito, in dissent, argued that the claims should have been barred by res judicata, particularly regarding the ACS requirement. The Court's focus on balancing burdens of abortion regulations against benefits clarifies the undue burden standard. Justice Alito criticized the lack of \"precise findings\" supporting the closure of abortion facilities due to admitting privileges and ASC requirements. It remains uncertain if Hellerstedt guarantees the invalidation of all state requirements, but each regulation may need to be examined individually. The similarities between Texas requirements and others suggest potential challenges to similar laws. The impact of the Hellerstedt decision on state admitting privileges requirements for abortion providers is becoming clearer as courts apply the ruling to other cases. Courts have found that such requirements impose an undue burden on women's access to abortion, leading to dismissals of appeals in related cases. The Hellerstedt decision has prompted anti-abortion groups to seek alternative legislative measures to restrict abortion, focusing on fetal health over women's health. Laws prohibiting abortion after 20 weeks based on fetal pain have been considered, but some have been invalidated by the Ninth and Tenth Circuits. The Supreme Court declined to review a case invalidating Arizona's fetal pain law in 2014. The Supreme Court may apply the undue burden standard differently in cases involving fetal pain laws compared to admitting privileges and ASC requirements. The Ninth and Tenth Circuits considered viability in Roe and Casey when reviewing fetal pain laws in Idaho, Arizona, and Utah. The Court emphasized in Casey that before viability, a state cannot unduly interfere with a woman's right to terminate a pregnancy. The Ninth and Tenth Circuits found state fetal pain laws banning most abortions unconstitutional due to the prohibition of abortion or imposing substantial obstacles to a woman's right to choose. The Supreme Court may focus on viability rather than balancing burdens and benefits when examining fetal pain laws."
