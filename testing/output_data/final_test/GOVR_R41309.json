    "content": "The Small Business Administration (SBA) Disaster Loan Program has been providing economic assistance for over 50 years to individuals and businesses affected by disasters. It offers direct loans to help repair or replace damaged property in federally declared disasters, including support for small agricultural cooperatives. The program includes Home and Personal Property Disaster Loans, Business Physical Disaster Loans, and Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL), with most loans going to individuals. Low-interest rates and loan maturities of up to 30 years are available. The SBA Disaster Loan Program offers loans with maturities of up to 30 years. The report discusses the types of loans available to disaster victims, data on past disasters, and issues of interest to Congress. It also describes the types of disaster loans for homeowners, renters, and businesses. SBA disaster assistance offers loans to individuals and households, not grants, for recovery from disasters. Homeowners, renters, and personal property owners in declared disaster areas can apply for up to $40,000 for personal property repairs or replacements. Personal Property Loans cover uninsured or underinsured property in a declared disaster area, including furniture, appliances, clothing, and automobiles. Interest rates cannot exceed 8% per annum. Borrowers pay equal monthly installments starting five months from the loan date, with maturities up to 30 years. Real Property Loans offer up to $200,000 to repair primary residences to pre-disaster condition for creditworthy homeowners in disaster areas. Loans cannot be used for home upgrades. The SBA offers loans for disaster losses, with restrictions on use for home upgrades or landscaping. Mitigation funds are limited to 20% of damage, up to $200,000 for home loans. Interest rates are capped at 8% per annum, with repayment starting five months from the loan date and maturities up to 30 years. Business assistance is also in the form of loans rather than grants. SBA offers loans for businesses affected by disasters, including Business Physical Disaster Loans and Economic Injury Disaster Loans. Business Physical Disaster Loans provide up to $2 million to repair or replace damaged property. Business Physical Disaster Loans can be used to replace vehicles with SBA loan proceeds if used for business purposes. Up to 20% of the verified loss amount can be used for mitigation measures. Interest rates are capped at 8% per annum or 4% per annum if credit cannot be obtained elsewhere. Borrowers start equal monthly installments five months from the loan date, with maturities up to 30 years. EIDLs are available to businesses in declared disaster areas with substantial economic injury and unable to get credit elsewhere. Small businesses eligible for Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDLs) must meet SBA size regulations, such as having no more than 500 employees for manufacturing firms or $7 million in annual sales for retail trade firms. EIDLs are available to small agricultural cooperatives, private and nonprofit organizations affected by a declared disaster. The maximum loan amount is $2 million, with proceeds used for working capital to alleviate economic injury. The loan has a maturity of up to 30 years and an interest rate of 4% or less for victims in declared disaster areas. The SBA Disaster Loan Program offers loans up to $2 million for small businesses affected by declared disasters. Only victims in disaster areas are eligible, with interest rates of 4% or less. Declarations are official notices recognizing damage from natural disasters or industrial accidents. Slow-onset events like erosion are not typically eligible, but droughts and low water levels may warrant declarations. Five ways exist for the program to be activated, including presidential declarations authorized by the Robert T. Stafford Act. The SBA Disaster Loan Program offers loans up to $2 million for small businesses affected by declared disasters. Declarations are official notices recognizing damage from natural disasters or industrial accidents. The President issues major disaster declarations or emergency declarations, authorizing Individual Assistance (IA) and Public Assistance (PA). SBA disaster loans become available to homeowners, renters, businesses, and nonprofit organizations in the disaster area. The SBA Administrator issues physical disaster declarations in response to gubernatorial requests for assistance, making SBA disaster loans available to eligible individuals and organizations in the disaster area. Nonprofit entities in the disaster area may be eligible for an SBA disaster loan if they provide noncritical services and have been deemed ineligible for SBA assistance. The SBA issues EIDL declarations based on certification from a state governor that small businesses have suffered economic injury due to a disaster. Small agricultural cooperatives and nonprofit organizations in the disaster area are eligible for SBA disaster loans. The SBA Administrator may also issue EIDL declarations based on a natural disaster determination by the Secretary of Agriculture. The SBA administrator can declare a fishery resource disaster or commercial fishery failure based on the Secretary of Commerce's determination. From 2000 to 2014, 4,210 declarations were issued, with the most by the Secretary of Agriculture. Only two declarations came from the Secretary of Commerce during this period. The SBA approved 533,628 disaster loan applications totaling over $26.5 billion for home, business, and EIDLs during the same timeframe, varying yearly due to hurricane damages severity. Approximately 72% of approved disaster loans totaling $15.5 billion were disbursed to businesses and households from FY2000 to FY2014. The majority of disbursed loans were home disaster loans, followed by Business Physical Disaster Loans and EIDLs. SBA disbursed 21,862 EIDLs totaling $2.0 billion during this period, with an average of 1,457 loans per year amounting to $135 million annually. SBA disbursed $9.7 billion in home disaster loans and $3.7 billion in Business Physical Disaster Loans from FY2000 to FY2014. The average number of home disaster loans per year was 21,067, with an average amount of $650 million per year. For Business Physical Disaster Loans, the average number per year was 2,839, with an average amount of $247 million per year. Congress may be interested in issues such as loan processing times and expedited assistance. The Small Business Administration (SBA) faced criticism for delays in processing disaster loan applications after Gulf Coast hurricanes in 2005 and 2008. In 2009, improvements were noted in response to Hurricane Ike, with decreased processing times and better interagency cooperation. SBA aimed to process 85% of disaster loan applications within 14 days in FY2009. SBA established new processing standards for disaster loans based on application volumes, with different timeframes for different levels of applications. The goal was to process 85% of applications within 14 days in FY2009, but later reduced to 27 days for home disaster loans and 30 days for business loans. The new tiered standards resulted in 100% of disaster loans being processed within the goal in FY2010. In FY2010, 100% of disaster loans were processed within the new tiered standard performance goal. In FY2011, the rate remained at 100%, dropping to 95% in FY2012, 55% in FY2013 due to Hurricane Sandy, and back to 100% in FY2014. SBA approved 36,911 hurricane Sandy disaster loans totaling $2.49 billion by May 2015, addressing a backlog of over 29,000 applications by extending office hours and hiring additional personnel. The SBA implemented expedited processes for disaster loans, reducing backlog to 3,000 by April 2013. An SBA OIG study showed expedited home disaster loans saved 2.3 days in processing time, while business disaster loans took 4.4 days longer. Congress may want faster loan processing post-disasters like Hurricane Sandy for timely assistance. Congress passed the Small Business Disaster Response and Loan Improvements Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-234) to improve SBA's Disaster Loan Program by reducing processing times and guarding against potential fraud and abuse. The act included measures to enhance disaster planning and response, aiming to address criticisms of SBA's loan processing following the Gulf Coast hurricanes of 2005 and 2008. The Small Business Disaster Response and Loan Improvements Act of 2008 aims to improve SBA's coordination with other agencies during disasters, ensure communication of relevant information to loan applicants, and provide alternative loan processing facilities within two days if needed. Additionally, the act increases loan amounts in certain situations, reforms loan processes, and allows SBA to defer payments. The Small Business Disaster Response and Loan Improvements Act of 2008 reforms SBA's loan processes, grants authority to defer loan payments for those affected by Gulf Coast hurricanes, establishes various disaster assistance programs, and includes reporting requirements for SBA disaster assistance programs. The Small Business Disaster Response and Loan Improvements Act of 2008 requires monthly reports on the Disaster Loan Program's operation, including lending volume, funding availability, and spending estimates. It also establishes guaranteed loan programs like EDALP, IDAP, and PDAP to assist homeowners and businesses in need of immediate help. The Small Business Disaster Response and Loan Improvements Act of 2008 mandated the establishment of guaranteed loan programs like EDALP, IDAP, and PDAP to provide quick financial assistance to homeowners and businesses in need. However, a 2014 GAO report revealed that these programs were not piloted or implemented, rendering them unavailable during disasters like Hurricane Sandy. SBA responded that the parameters of IDAP would make it difficult to implement, despite developing forms and procedural guidelines. Congress may be concerned about delays in implementing the mandated loan programs, potentially affecting access to expedited loan assistance in future disasters. Oversight could focus on encouraging lender participation and ensuring adequate collateral for SBA loans. SBA requires adequate collateral as security on all loans, including assets like equipment, buildings, accounts receivable, and inventory. Personal assets can also be used as collateral. SBA may decline loans if applicants refuse to pledge collateral, but generally won't decline solely due to inadequate collateral in disaster loan applications. Collateral is not required for EIDL. SBA does not require collateral for EIDL loans of $25,000 or less, physical disaster home or business loans of $14,000 or less, or loans under $25,000 in a major disaster declaration. Collateral is required for larger loans and certified appraisals for loans over $250,000 secured by commercial real estate. Professional appraisals may be required for business and personal assets. According to a report by the Bipartisan Task Force on Hurricane Sandy Recovery, some businesses faced challenges obtaining SBA disaster loans due to the requirement of using personal residences as collateral. Business owners without other collateral were hesitant to risk their homes, the only tangible asset left after the storm. Despite grace periods and low interest rates, some businesses still couldn't afford the loans. Congress may need to consider alternative methods for obtaining disaster loans without risking personal residences or prohibiting SBA from requiring such collateral. For instance, the Small Business Disaster Reform Act of 2015 aims to prevent SBA from mandating personal residences as collateral. The Small Business Disaster Reform Act of 2015 aims to prohibit SBA from requiring small business owners to use their primary residency as collateral for loans if they have other assets of equal or greater value. One proposed solution is to provide direct grants to businesses, similar to FEMA grants for households, to aid in disaster recovery. Critics raise concerns about the increased federal expenditures associated with providing grants, citing FEMA's $16 billion in grants to renters and homeowners from 2004 to 2013. Critics argue against providing grants to businesses, stating that businesses are responsible for obtaining insurance. Disaster loans have set ceilings on interest rates but no set floors. Interest rates vary based on market rates, with examples of rates for businesses affected by different disasters. Some view this as inequitable, and some individuals struggle to repay loans despite lower interest rates. Despite lower interest rates, individuals and households are struggling to repay their disaster loans. Congress may need to establish a set interest rate for all disasters or consider lowering rates for existing loans. H.R. 2857 in the 113th Congress proposed restructuring qualifying disaster loans at a lower rate. Congress could also offer loan forgiveness to those facing repayment difficulties, as SBA typically does not offer forgiveness without congressional intervention. An exception was made after Hurricane Betsy, when loan forgiveness was granted in Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi through the Southeast Hurricane Disaster Relief Act of 1965. Hurricane Betsy led to loan forgiveness and interest waivers for disaster loans. Some argue that low interest rates and forgiveness could hinder SBA's ability to recover administrative costs. Supporters of the SBA Disaster Loan Program argue that improvements have been made since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, with reduced processing times and better interagency coordination. However, critics point to the slow response to Hurricane Sandy and the perceived lack of progress in implementing certain requirements. The question of why SBA issues disaster loans instead of FEMA dates back to President Jimmy Carter's Executive Order 12127 in 1978. In 1978, President Jimmy Carter signed Executive Order 12127, merging disaster-related responsibilities into FEMA. SBA continued to provide disaster loans through the Disaster Loan Program instead of transferring that function to FEMA. Chairman Jack Brooks questioned the rationale for this decision at a 1978 hearing. James T. McIntyre from OMB stated that emergency responsibilities should align with regular agency missions. The Disaster Relief Act of 1974 allows for coordination of agencies in disaster situations, without direct operational control. Transferring the disaster loan function to FEMA would create duplicate sets of skills and resources, hindering the reorganization purpose. Maintaining separate staffs of loan officers and portfolio managers in both SBA and FEMA would be counterproductive. The Stafford Act prohibits recipients of disaster aid from receiving similar aid from other federal sources, ensuring distinct entities for disaster response and recovery operations. The Stafford Act prohibits individuals or businesses from receiving duplicate financial assistance for losses from disasters. SBA Disaster Loan Approvals for Gulf Coast States after the 2005 and 2008 hurricane seasons are provided for discussion."
