The lessee must agree to keep the report confidential, except for necessary repairs. If the premises have a CASp inspection report indicating it meets standards, the owner must provide a copy to the tenant within seven days of lease execution. If no inspection report exists, the owner must disclose this on the lease agreement. \"A Certified Access Specialist (CASp) can inspect the premises to determine compliance with accessibility standards under state law. The commercial property owner cannot prohibit the lessee from obtaining a CASp inspection at their expense. Parties must agree on the time and manner of the inspection.\" The State Architect can suspend or deny renewal of certification for a Certified Access Specialist based on complaints or relevant information. Applicants must pay fees for certification, including application, course, and examination fees.
