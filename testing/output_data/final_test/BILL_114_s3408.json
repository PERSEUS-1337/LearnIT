Section 601 of the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 is amended to include grants, loans, and loan guarantees. The Secretary shall establish evaluation periods to compare applications for grants, loans, and loan guarantees. The Secretary will prioritize grants, loans, and loan guarantees for rural communities without adequate broadband service, giving highest priority to applicants serving the most unserved households.

Applicants must be certified by the affected community, city, county, or designee, or demonstrated on the broadband map of the affected State or the National Broadband Map. Equal consideration will be given to all qualified applicants, including those who have not previously received grants, loans, or loan guarantees. The Secretary will prioritize grants for projects in rural communities with less than 10,000 residents, facing out-migration, high levels of low-income residents, and isolation from significant population centers. Projects must be carried out in rural areas to be eligible for grants. The grant amount under this section cannot exceed 50% of the project's development costs. The Secretary will determine grant rates based on factors like remote locations, low community populations, and low income levels. The project funding will involve various stakeholders such as State, local, and tribal governments, nonprofit institutions, and community anchor institutions like public libraries and schools. The Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7801) includes provisions for funding institutions of higher education, health care facilities, private entities, philanthropic organizations, and targeted funding for broadband service in unserved communities. The Secretary has the authority to adjust funding as needed. The Secretary has the authority to adjust grants up to 75 percent of development costs for projects serving remote or low-income areas without broadband access. In subsection (d), adjustments include grants, loans, or applications for funding. In subsection (d), adjustments include grants, loans, or applications for funding.

Changes are made to the loan application process under this section, including exceptions for eligibility for funding under another title of the Act. The Secretary shall provide technical assistance and training to eligible entities for preparing reports and surveys. The Secretary shall allocate 3-5% of funds for technical assistance and training to help entities with broadband deployment applications and management. In subsection (f), the language regarding loans and loan guarantees is changed to providing assistance. Subsection (j) is amended to include grants and remove references to loans. Subsections (k) and (l) are redesignated as subsections (l) and (m). As a condition of receiving assistance, recipients must provide address-level broadband buildout data for inclusion in the National Broadband Map managed by the FCC. The Secretary must submit corrections to the National Broadband Map based on actual broadband coverage levels in rural areas, including requests from officials. The Commission will use address-level broadband buildout data for the National Broadband Map once data is received. The Commission must incorporate corrections into the National Broadband Map within 30 days of receiving them. If the Map is not updated with corrections when the Secretary is making grant or loan decisions, the Secretary can use the submitted corrections for those decisions. In paragraph (1), change the amount from $25,000,000 to $50,000,000. In paragraph (2)(A), add a provision to set aside at least 1 percent for oversight and accountability measures. In subsection (m), amend by adding \"grant, loan, or\"."
