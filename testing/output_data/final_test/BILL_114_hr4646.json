The \"Fair Day in Court for Kids Act of 2016\" aims to improve immigration court efficiency by amending the Immigration and Nationality Act to allow the Attorney General to appoint counsel for aliens in immigration proceedings at government expense. The \"Fair Day in Court for Kids Act of 2016\" ensures that aliens in immigration proceedings receive all relevant documents from the Department of Homeland Security at the beginning of the proceedings. This includes information from the alien's A-file, except for privileged or sensitive information. The \"Fair Day in Court for Kids Act of 2016\" mandates that aliens in immigration proceedings must receive all relevant documents from the Department of Homeland Security, including information from the alien's A-file, unless waived by the alien. Failure to provide these required documents can delay the removal proceeding. The Attorney General is granted the authority to appoint counsel to aliens in immigration proceedings under the Immigration and Nationality Act. This includes providing access to counsel and ensuring meaningful time to review relevant documents. The Attorney General may appoint counsel for aliens in immigration proceedings under various sections of the Act. The Secretary of Homeland Security must ensure access to counsel in all immigration detention and border facilities. Additionally, the Attorney General is required to appoint counsel for children and vulnerable aliens at the beginning of proceedings. The Attorney General may appoint counsel for vulnerable individuals in immigration proceedings, including children and victims of abuse or violence. Counsel may also be appointed for individuals whose circumstances require legal representation for fair resolution. If cases are consolidated, appointed counsel must represent all aliens involved. Authorization of appropriations is provided for this purpose. The Attorney General is authorized to appoint counsel for vulnerable individuals in immigration proceedings. Regulations will be implemented to carry out this section, with appropriations authorized for the Executive Office of Immigration Review. SEC. 3. ACCESS BY COUNSEL AND LEGAL ORIENTATION AT DETENTION FACILITIES. The Secretary of Homeland Security must ensure access to counsel for detained aliens and establish legal orientation programs to inform them of immigration hearing procedures and their rights under Federal immigration laws. The Attorney General will provide legal orientation programs for detained aliens and a pilot program for nondetained aliens with pending asylum claims. The pilot program will be implemented in at least 2 immigration courts for a 2-year period, with a report to be submitted to the Senate and House Judiciary Committees. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the Executive Office of Immigration Review. The Executive Office of Immigration Review under the Department of Justice will receive necessary funds to implement legal orientation programs for detained and nondetained aliens with pending asylum claims. SEC. 4. CASE MANAGEMENT PILOT PROGRAM TO INCREASE COURT APPEARANCE RATES. The Secretary of Homeland Security will establish a pilot program to increase court appearance rates of certain aliens by contracting with community-based organizations to provide case management services. These services include legal counsel, meeting legal deadlines, housing assistance, enrolling children in school, and accessing health services. The Department of Homeland Security is authorized to appropriate funds for acquiring health services, including mental health services. SEC. 5. REPORT ON ACCESS TO COUNSEL. The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, must submit an annual report to the Senate and House Judiciary Committees on aliens' access to counsel. The report should include the number and percentage of represented aliens in the legal process. The annual report must include information on aliens' access to counsel, such as the stage of legal process, government custody status, and the number and percentage of aliens who received legal orientation presentations. SEC. 6. MOTIONS TO REOPEN amended to allow vulnerable aliens without appointed counsel to file motions without limitations and stay removal proceedings."
