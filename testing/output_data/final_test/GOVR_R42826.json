    "content": "The federal government, mainly the Department of Defense, is the largest buyer of goods and services globally. Executive branch agencies follow the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) for most acquisitions. Members of Congress may consider amending the FAR to save money, promote transparency, or oversee agencies' compliance with procurement regulations. In 2012, the Defense Business Board recommended \"zero-basing\" the acquisition system, including the FAR. The Packard Commission, also known as President Reagan's 1986 Blue Ribbon Commission on Defense, aimed to streamline the requirements, acquisition, and budget processes in the federal government. A report answers 25 frequently asked questions about the FAR, organized into six categories. The FAR is a regulation found in Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations, covering federal procurement contracts and related topics. It includes questions about what the FAR covers, agencies subject to it, purchases under its jurisdiction, and transactions outside its scope. Each part of the FAR is divided into subparts and sections for specific details. The FAR, found in Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations, covers federal procurement contracts. It includes standard solicitation provisions, contract clauses, and forms. Agency FAR supplements, like the DFARS, are not part of the FAR but are important in the acquisition process. The FAR can be accessed in print or online. The FAR can be conveniently accessed online in PDF or HTML format at specific URLs. It applies to certain purchases by executive branch agencies but not necessarily to all agencies or organizational components within an agency. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) applies to purchases by executive branch agencies, with exceptions for agencies like the FAA and the U.S. Mint. It does not apply to legislative or judicial branch agencies, but they may choose to follow it as a policy. The FAR does not directly regulate federal contractors, but they are impacted by its application. The FAR applies to executive branch agencies for purchases with exceptions for agencies like the FAA and U.S. Mint. It does not regulate federal contractors directly but impacts them through definitions, policies, procedures, and requirements by contracting officers. The FAR covers contracts, subcontracting, termination, and payments to contractors. For purposes of the FAR, \"acquisition\" refers to the acquiring of supplies or services by the Federal Government through contract with appropriated funds. Acquisition includes establishing agency needs, describing requirements, soliciting sources, awarding contracts, contract financing, performance, administration, and functions related to fulfilling agency needs by contract. Appropriated funds are funds paid out of the United States Treasury charged to an appropriation provided by an act. The United States Treasury charges appropriations provided by Congress for supplies, which include various items like public works, buildings, ships, aircraft, office furniture, and more. Services refer to tasks performed by contractors under service contracts. A \"service contract\" engages a contractor to perform a specific task rather than supply an end item. Examples include maintenance, housekeeping, advisory services, and more. Certain transactions are not subject to the FAR, such as agency contracts that are not procurement contracts. Certain transactions not subject to the FAR include agency contracts that are not procurement contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, contracts with third parties using federal funds, purchases or leases of real property, and transactions authorized by Congress to acquire goods or services. Subcontracts under federal contracts are also not subject to the FAR. Certain requirements in prime contracts must be passed down to subcontractors, but not all requirements flow down. Some FAR provisions do not apply to subcontractors, such as the requirement for \"full and open competition\" in contractor selection. The FAR contains different types of information in its various parts, guiding the acquisition workforce in their responsibilities. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provides guidance to the acquisition workforce on various topics, including acquisition planning, contract actions, and types of contracts. It also defines terms used in government procurement. The FAR's opening sections outline guiding principles for the federal acquisition system, informing all other sections and procurement practices. The FAR guides contracting officers on government policy, requirements, and exceptions. Subpart 6.1 emphasizes promoting full and open competition, while Subpart 6.3 allows for exceptions under specific circumstances. Procedures for justifying and obtaining approval for non-competitive contracts are also outlined. Part 9 of the FAR outlines general standards for contractor qualifications and grounds for exclusion from federal contracting. It details how contracting officers gather information for determining contractor qualifications, including preaward surveys, FAPIIS, and SAM. Contract administration responsibilities are outlined in the FAR, including tasks such as audits, postaward orientations, production surveillance, and contractor performance information collection. Section 42.302(a) lists 71 specific functions for the contract administration officer (CAO). Parts 52 and 53 provide standard provisions and clauses for inclusion in solicitations or contracts. Part 52 of the FAR contains solicitation provisions and contract clauses with unique identification numbers. For example, it includes provisions for standard competitions under OMB Circular A-76 to evaluate private sector offers and agency tenders. A performance decision from a standard competition will be publicly announced. If a private sector offeror is favored, a contract will be awarded. If an agency or public reimbursable tender is favored, a Most Efficient Organization letter of obligation or fee-for-service agreement will be established. Contests can be filed by directly interested parties following procedures in the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Only legal agents for directly interested parties will have access to relevant documents until contests are resolved. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) contains standard, optional, and agency-prescribed acquisition forms and procedures. It also outlines guiding principles for the federal acquisition system, including performance standards to deliver the best value product or service to the customer while maintaining public trust and fulfilling public policy objectives. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) aims to satisfy customers in terms of cost, quality, and timeliness, minimize operating costs, conduct business with integrity, and fulfill public policy objectives. The acquisition team includes agency personnel and contractors empowered to make decisions and perform assigned duties. The FAR addresses the promulgation process, origins, and amendment of regulations. The FAR system was amended to consolidate procurement regulations from various agencies like the FPR and DAR. Different agencies had their own procurement regulations before the establishment of the FAR system. The Commission on Government Procurement found a burdensome mass of procurement regulations in the federal government, leading to the enactment of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act Amendments of 1979. This allowed the Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy to issue policy directives for a uniform procurement system. OFPP subsequently released Policy Letter 80-5. The Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act Amendments of 1979 led to the establishment of the Federal Acquisition Regulation System, including the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) jointly issued by GSA, DoD, and NASA. The FAR was first published on September 19, 1983, and has been periodically amended since then. The Department of Defense (DOD), the General Services Administration (GSA), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) follow rulemaking procedures to amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). This involves publishing proposed rules, allowing for public comments, and then publishing final rules. The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) outlines the rulemaking process for agencies like the Department of Defense (DOD), the General Services Administration (GSA), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). This process includes publishing proposed rules, receiving public comments, publishing a final rule with a statement of basis and purpose, and a 30-day waiting period before the rule takes effect. Agencies can use a \"good cause\" exception for interim final rulemaking if notice and comment are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. Additionally, other executive orders and statutes may also apply to the rulemaking process. The Federal Register notices proposing or announcing amendments to the FAR are jointly issued by the Department of Defense (DOD), the General Services Administration (GSA), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in accordance with federal statutes and regulations. The amendments are developed with the concurrence of the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council (FAR Council). The FAR Council, consisting of key government officials, is responsible for directing and coordinating government-wide procurement policy and regulatory activities. They manage changes to the Federal Acquisition Regulation by utilizing standing FAR teams for specific parts of the FAR. The FAR Council manages changes to the Federal Acquisition Regulation through FAR teams composed of representatives from military and civilian agencies. The teams draft and submit potential FAR amendments to the CAAC and DAR Council for review, then to OFPP and OIRA for additional review before approval by FAR signatories within GSA, DOD, and NASA. The Administrator of OFPP can also amend the FAR independently if necessary. The Administrator of OFPP has the authority to independently amend the FAR if GSA, DOD, and NASA cannot agree on regulations. Congress cannot directly amend the FAR but can enact legislation to prompt amendments. OFPP provides direction for government-wide procurement policies, regulations, and procedures. The Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy directs the development of procurement policies implemented by the FAR. They also chair the FAR Council, which coordinates government-wide procurement policy. If members of the FAR Council cannot agree on revisions, the Administrator of OFPP can prescribe them independently. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) oversees proposed changes to the FAR, with the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) largely responsible for this task. Both OFPP and OIRA review proposed changes to ensure compliance with laws and policies. The Administrator of OFPP, with the Director of OMB, can deny or rescind any government-wide regulation inconsistent with FAR policies. The process of amending the FAR can be lengthy, taking months to years, and may exceed statutory deadlines. Agencies are rarely compelled to issue procurement regulations promptly, even if there are indications from Congress to do so. The process of amending the FAR can be lengthy, taking months to years, and may exceed statutory deadlines. Factors determining the reasonableness of a delay in rulemaking include danger to human health, agency priorities, interests prejudiced, and disparate treatment. This section discusses the relationship between the FAR and other federal procurement authorities, such as statutes, agency supplements, regulations, and executive branch policies. The primary statutes governing federal procurement are in Titles 10 and 41 of the United States Code, governing defense and civilian agencies. Other statutes include the Anti-Kickback Act, Buy American Act, Small Business Act, and more. Additionally, provisions in other statutes also apply. The FAR implements statutory provisions related to procurement, but other agency regulations may also apply. Some procurement-related provisions in permanent appropriations laws are not covered by the FAR, such as grounds for debarment and restrictions on purchasing certain items. The FAR implements statutory provisions related to procurement, including fuels reduction activities and restrictions on purchasing incandescent lamps. Certain provisions in the FAR, such as grounds for debarment and contractor disclosure requirements, do not have direct counterparts in federal statute and have developed in response to executive orders, judicial decisions, or policy recommendations. Agency heads are authorized to issue agency-specific procurement regulations that supplement the FAR. The regulations in Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations, following the FAR, include agency-specific regulations that supplement the FAR to meet specific needs. These regulations must not conflict with the FAR, except as required by law or with authorized deviations. The FAR contains requirements for agencies to follow when creating agency-specific regulations, including providing notice and comment in the Federal Register when necessary. Agencies must also comply with federal laws like the Paperwork Reduction Act and Regulatory Flexibility Act. The FAR and agency FAR supplements guide executive agencies in acquiring goods and services, but other regulations may also address procurement-related topics. The Department of Energy in Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations discusses energy savings performance contracts for federal agencies. These long-term contracts involve contractors implementing energy-saving measures in exchange for a share of the resulting savings. Title 10 takes precedence over conflicting provisions in the Federal Acquisition Regulation and agency regulations. Other regulations in Titles 13, 28, 29, and 41 of the Code of Federal Regulations cover topics like contracting with small businesses and federal procurement. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions may need to conform to other agency regulations or be issued with the concurrence of all agencies involved. Various procurement policies and guidance are issued by the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) or the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Some documents supplement material in the FAR, while others cover different subjects. For example, Policy Letter 11-01 provides specific guidance on the performance of inherently governmental and critical functions. Policy Letter 11-01 provides guidance on managing inherently governmental functions, while Subpart 7.5 of the FAR lists examples of such functions. OFPP memoranda cover other procurement topics not addressed in the FAR, such as FAIR Act inventories and service contract inventories. This section also addresses Congress's role in amending the FAR and the deference given to FAR provisions. Congress does not directly amend the FAR but can prompt the executive branch to do so through enacted laws. This can be done implicitly or explicitly, with Congress sometimes specifying the FAR Council to make amendments within a certain timeframe. The FAR can be amended by the FAR Council and OFPP without the need for procurement-related legislation or congressional directives. Amendments may be initiated in response to policy concerns, litigation, executive orders, or other procurement matters. Committees and Members of Congress can also encourage the FAR Council to make amendments. Members of Congress can influence amendments to the FAR by encouraging the FAR Council or OFPP to make changes within their authority. They may express concerns informally or through oversight, and in some cases, enact legislation to prevent certain amendments. Congress has the power to influence amendments to the FAR through legislation, such as the Congressional Review Act, which allows for the overturning of final rules. This can result in rules having no \"force or effect.\" The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows for expedited congressional consideration of joint resolutions of disapproval to overturn final rules, including those in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). Judicial review of FAR provisions is guided by Chevron deference, where agencies' interpretations are assessed for consistency with statutory purposes. The tribunal must follow Congress's intent when the statute is clear, but can defer to agency interpretation if the statute is silent or ambiguous. Some FAR provisions have been upheld under Chevron, while others have been found to be contrary to Congress's intent and amended accordingly. Individual agency interpretations of the FAR are not entitled to Chevron deference, but may receive a lesser degree of deference based on various factors. This section addresses the relationship between the FAR and federal contracts, the application of FAR amendments to pre-existing contracts, and the implications of not including a required FAR clause in a contract. The FAR applies to federal agencies, while contracts bind both the agency and the contractor. Contract provisions, not those in the FAR, are binding, but FAR terms may be included in contracts. The FAR sets standard terms, but contract details are crucial. Economic price adjustments in contracts are governed by the FAR. The FAR governs economic price adjustments in contracts, which can be based on established prices, actual costs, or cost indexes of labor or material. Contracts specify the triggers, indexes, and base levels for price adjustments. While courts interpret the FAR based on its plain meaning, the parties' intent in a contract can override the text in certain cases. The FAR governs economic price adjustments in contracts based on established prices, actual costs, or cost indexes of labor or material. Amendments to the FAR generally apply only to contracts entered into after the amendment date, not pre-existing contracts. This convention shields the government from liability for breach of contract and reflects the fundamental canon of statutory interpretation that laws will not be given retroactive effect without clear congressional intent. The FAR requires standard contract clauses to be included in agency contracts to protect the government's interests. Courts may \"read in\" required clauses to contracts lacking them, treating them as terms of the contract. In G.L. Christian & Associates v. United States, the former Court of Claims established the \"Christian doctrine\" where required contract terms can be read into contracts lacking them based on public procurement policy and federal regulations. This includes clauses for government termination for convenience, default, protests after award, and contractor use of government property. This section discusses agency deviations from the FAR, third-party enforcement of FAR terms against government contractors, procurement techniques not explicitly mentioned in the FAR, and the applicability of FAR requirements to agencies or transactions not covered by the FAR. Agencies can deviate from the FAR under specific circumstances, involving noncompliance with mandatory procurement regulations. Deviation from the FAR is only permitted when authorized by the FAR itself. There are two types of deviations: individual and class, with individual deviations affecting single contract actions and class deviations affecting multiple actions. Deviations must be necessary to meet specific agency needs and requirements, and must not be prohibited by law, executive order, or regulation. Class deviations for civilian agencies can be authorized by agency heads after consulting with CAAC. DOD follows DFARS for class deviations, granting authority to the Director of Defense Procurement. Permanent deviations should be proposed as FAR revisions. An example is DOD's deviation for SAM use, requiring contractors to register and certify through the database. The DOD issued a class deviation allowing contractors to use alternative measures for registration and certification requirements due to performance issues with SAM. This deviation was rescinded once SAM's issues were resolved. Agencies have discretion to use strategies not explicitly mentioned in the FAR as long as they benefit the government and comply with laws and regulations. The FAR allows agencies to use alternative procurement procedures that benefit the government, even if not explicitly mentioned. Third parties have limited ability to enforce FAR requirements against contractors, leading to legal disputes over compliance with FAR terms in government contracts. Plaintiffs in a case sought to hold a federal contractor liable for a third party's death, claiming they were third party beneficiaries of a FAR provision. However, such allegations usually fail because non-contracting parties lack standing to enforce contract terms. Agencies not subject to the FAR could still be subject to its requirements due to underlying statutes. In a 2012 decision, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that HUBZone small businesses must receive a price evaluation preference when the General Services Administration (GSA) acquires certain leasehold interests in real property, even if not subject to the FAR. This is because the Small Business Act applies broadly to all federal contracts involving full and open competition. GAO rejected GSA's assertion that price evaluation preferences for HUBZone small businesses are only required in procurements subject to the FAR. Statutes can impose similar requirements on entities not subject to the FAR, like the ARRA imposing \"Buy American\" and \"Davis Bacon\" requirements on certain recipients. Agencies may also adopt FAR provisions as policy, as seen with GSA. GSA has adopted certain FAR provisions as policy in its regulations regarding leases of real property. The U.S. Postal Service and Senate Procurement Regulations also include similar clauses and provisions found in the FAR."
