    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Methamphetamine Awareness and Prevention Act of 2006\". Congress finds that methamphetamine addiction is a growing epidemic in the United States, with existing federal programs not effectively targeting methamphetamine use. The focus on marijuana as a gateway drug has overshadowed the impact of methamphetamine, costing taxpayers millions of dollars annually in various services. In 2004, 1,400,000 individuals aged 12 and older used methamphetamine. The Act aims to prevent methamphetamine spread by establishing a grant program for successful education campaigns. SEC. 506C of the Public Health Service Act introduces a new section on Methamphetamine Awareness and Prevention. The Methamphetamine Awareness and Prevention Office is established within the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. The office is headed by a director appointed by the Secretary and administers a grant program to reduce methamphetamine use through education and awareness campaigns. The Methamphetamine Awareness and Prevention Office administers a grant program to reduce methamphetamine use. Entities eligible for the grant must be State or local governments or private nonprofit organizations. They must submit an application and provide non-Federal funds equal to 100% of the grant amount. The director of the Office will solicit applications for grants within 90 days of the enactment of this section. The Office will solicit grant applications and notify unsuccessful applicants of the reasons. The director will evaluate the scope and impact of the education campaign for grant approval. The Office evaluates grant applications based on tailored messaging to at-risk populations, reduced match requirements for rural or underserved areas, and program benefits. Applications must include a description of the methamphetamine program. The grant application must include a description of the methamphetamine education and awareness campaign, emphasizing its impact on curbing methamphetamine use, especially among vulnerable populations. Additionally, the application should highlight the significance of the methamphetamine problem in the targeted area, supported by relevant statistics from various sources. The grant application must include a detailed budget or spending plan for the use of grant funds, as well as a description of the target audience and the most effective means to reach them. The grant recipient must submit a report on the impact of the education and awareness campaign within 90 days after the grant period ends. The report should include quantitative data on the audience reached and the campaign's impact. Each grant under this subsection is limited to $5,000,000, and an entity can receive only one grant per fiscal year. The director of the Office will use impact reports to determine grant awards. A report to Congress summarizing grant awards and their impact on communities will be submitted within 90 days after each grant cycle. The report can be shared for coordinating methamphetamine prevention activities. The \"education and awareness campaign\" aims to reduce methamphetamine use through various communication channels. The \"grant cycle\" refers to the time from grant award to expenditure. The \"Office\" is the Methamphetamine Awareness and Prevention Office. $25,250,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2006, with $250,000 for the Office's activities and $25,000,000 for grants."
