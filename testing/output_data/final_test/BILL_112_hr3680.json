    "content": "The \"Hydropower Regulatory Efficiency Act of 2011\" includes provisions for promoting small hydroelectric power projects, conduit hydropower projects, extending preliminary permit terms, developing hydropower at nonpowered dams, conducting studies on pumped storage and potential hydropower, and authorizing appropriations. Congress acknowledges the significant role of hydropower in the US, with 300,000 workers employed and it being the largest source of clean electricity. Currently, hydropower accounts for 7% of electricity generated and has a capacity of 100,000 megawatts. There is potential to add 60,000 megawatts by utilizing untapped resources in nonpowered dams. States could potentially add 60,000 megawatts of new hydropower capacity by 2025, leading to the creation of 700,000 direct jobs over the next 14 years. SEC. 3 amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act to increase the threshold for small hydroelectric power projects from 5,000 to 10,000. SEC. 4 promotes conduit hydropower projects. The Federal Power Act is amended to exempt certain hydroelectric facilities from licensing requirements if they meet specific criteria, including using non-federally owned conduits for power generation and having a capacity not exceeding 5 megawatts. The Hydropower Regulatory Efficiency Act of 2011 exempts hydroelectric facilities with a capacity not exceeding 5 megawatts and using non-federally owned conduits from licensing requirements. The term 'conduit' refers to manmade water conveyance systems for water distribution, not primarily for electricity generation. The Hydropower Regulatory Efficiency Act of 2011 exempts hydroelectric facilities with a capacity not exceeding 40 megawatts from licensing requirements. This includes facilities using non-federally owned conduits for water distribution, not primarily for electricity generation. Amendments were made to subsections (c) and (d) of the Act to reflect these changes. The Federal Power Act is amended to allow FERC to extend preliminary permit terms for up to 2 additional years if activities are carried out in good faith and with reasonable diligence. Additionally, there are provisions to promote hydropower development at nonpowered dams and closed-loop pumped storage projects. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is mandated to investigate the feasibility of expediting the licensing process for hydropower development at nonpowered dams and closed loop pumped storage projects within a 2-year period. FERC will conduct workshops and develop criteria for identifying suitable projects for hydropower development. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is required to expedite the licensing process for hydropower development at nonpowered dams and closed loop pumped storage projects within a 2-year period. FERC will conduct pilot projects, enter into memorandums of understanding with relevant agencies, and hold workshops to gather public feedback on the effectiveness of the 2-year process. The Commission will submit a report to Congress describing public comments received and issues justifying the determination that a 2-year process is not practicable, with recommendations on how to address the identified issues. The Commission will submit a report to Congress outlining the outcomes of pilot projects involving a 2-year process, along with public comments on its effectiveness and plans to adopt policies for a 2-year process. The Commission will issue new regulations to adopt a 2-year process or provide justifications for not implementing a 2-year process with recommendations for Congress. The Secretary of Energy will conduct a study on the potential hydropower from conduits in the US and identify land suitable for pumped storage near renewable energy sites. A report on the study results and recommendations must be submitted to relevant committees within a year of the Act's enactment. The President must report on actions taken to implement a memorandum of understanding on hydropower within 180 days. Additionally, authorization of appropriations is included in the Act. Authorization of $5,000,000 for the Act and its amendments, with $1,000,000 allocated to the Department of Energy. Amendment to Section 422(f) of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, allocating $145,000,000 for fiscal year 2013."
