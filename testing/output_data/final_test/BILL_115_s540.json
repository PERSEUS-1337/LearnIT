    "content": "The \"Mobile Workforce State Income Tax Simplification Act of 2017\" limits state withholding and taxation of employee income. The \"Mobile Workforce State Income Tax Simplification Act of 2017\" restricts state income tax to the employee's residence state and the state where they work for more than 30 days in a calendar year. Wages are not subject to state income tax withholding unless the employee meets the criteria outlined in the Act. The Act limits state income tax to the employee's residence state and the state where they work for over 30 days in a year. Employers can rely on employee's determination of time spent in different states for tax purposes, unless there is fraud or collusion. Maintaining records of employee location does not override employee's determination. The Act allows employers to use data from a time and attendance system to determine where an employee performs duties, instead of relying on the employee's own determination. For tax purposes, an employee is considered present in a state if they perform more duties there than in any other state during a day. For tax purposes, an employee is considered present in a state if they perform more duties there than in any other state during a day. The term \"employee\" excludes professional athletes, entertainers, production employees, and certain public figures. Transit time is not included in determining an employee's location for work duties. The term \"professional athlete\" refers to someone who is paid for performing in professional athletic events. Similarly, a \"professional entertainer\" is someone who receives payment for performing in the professional performing arts. A \"qualified production employee\" is defined as someone who directly performs production services in connection with a State. The term \"certain public figures\" refers to individuals of prominence who provide services for wages or other remuneration on a per-event basis, as long as the payment is considered qualified production costs under a State's film incentive program. The term \"employer\" is defined based on the Internal Revenue Code unless the State provides a different definition. \"State\" refers to any of the several States. A \"time and attendance system\" requires employees to record their work location daily when working outside their State. The term \"wages or other remuneration\" may be limited by the State where employment duties are performed, allowing the employer to allocate wages for income tax purposes across multiple States. The Act will take effect on January 1 of the second calendar year after enactment and will not apply to any tax obligations before that date."
