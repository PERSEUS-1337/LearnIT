    "content": "Since 1995, Congress has passed legislation regulating lobbyists' interactions with executive branch officials. Lobbyists must now register with the Clerk and Secretary when contacting legislative or executive branch officials. Additional restrictions apply to lobbyists lobbying executive branch departments on funds from the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The report details the evolution of lobbyist registration requirements since 1995 and actions taken by the Obama Administration. The Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) was enacted in 1995 to regulate lobbyists' interactions with executive branch officials. The Obama Administration implemented restrictions on lobbying for Recovery Act and EESA funds, stopped appointing lobbyists to federal advisory bodies, and faced criticism for its lobbying policies. Options for modifying current lobbying laws and practices are being evaluated. The Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) was amended in 1998 and 2007 to include executive branch officials as covered individuals. The definition of covered officials was expanded to include the President, Vice-President, officers and employees in the Executive Office of the President, and members of the uniformed services. The Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) was amended to include executive branch officials as covered individuals, such as the President, Vice-President, and high-ranking uniformed service members. Lobbyists contacting these officials must register and disclose their activities with the Clerk of the House and the Secretary of the Senate. The technical corrections in the Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) amended the U.S. Code section to allow the Office of Personnel Management to exempt positions from competitive service. The Honest Leadership and Open Government Act (HLOGA) of 2007 refined thresholds and definitions of lobbying activities, changed reporting frequency for lobbyists, required additional disclosures, and added new disclosure requirements for coalitions and associations. The Obama Administration focused on ethics and lobbying influence on executive branch personnel. President Obama issued Executive Order 13490, \"Ethics Commitments by Executive Branch Personnel,\" in January 2009, establishing ethics guidelines and lobbying restrictions for executive branch employees. The order included an ethics pledge, terms for the pledge, waiver provisions, rules for administration, and enforcement by the Attorney General. The White House explained the ethics pledge in the executive order, emphasizing the importance of following ethics and lobbying rules. The order prohibits gifts from lobbyists, closes the revolving door between government and private sector, and mandates government hiring based on qualifications, not political connections. Appointees are required to sign a pledge to abide by these rules. The ethics pledge requires government appointees to abide by strict rules, including a ban on gifts from lobbyists and restrictions on lobbying for funds. This policy aims to prevent lobbyist influence on funding decisions and ensure transparency in government actions. The guidance for federally registered lobbyists aims to ensure transparency and prevent lobbyist influence on funding decisions by categorizing their contacts with executive branch officials and restricting communication during the application process for federal assistance under EESA. The White House issued guidelines for federally registered lobbyists regarding their contacts with executive branch officials responsible for disbursing EESA funds. Lobbyists can ask logistical questions and speak at widely attended gatherings, but all other contacts must be documented if they involve EESA policy or funding applications. These guidelines were put in place to prevent lobbyist influence on funding decisions under EESA. President Obama issued restrictions on lobbyists' contacts with executive officials regarding stimulus funds to ensure responsible distribution and transparency. Updated guidance was issued by the Office of Management and Budget in July 2009, following a 60-day review period. These measures were put in place to oversee the distribution of funds under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The President's memorandum outlined policies for executive branch departments and agencies distributing Recovery Act funds, emphasizing merit-based decision making, avoiding imprudent projects, ensuring transparency with lobbyists, and providing OMB assistance for implementation. The memorandum provides guidelines for executive departments and agencies on interacting with lobbyists for Recovery Act projects, including restrictions on considering lobbyists' views, limitations on oral communication with lobbyists, and requirements for publicly posting written communications from lobbyists. Executive departments and agencies can communicate orally with registered lobbyists for Recovery Act projects under certain conditions, including documenting the contact on policy issues and confirming participants are not registered lobbyists. OMB Director Peter Orszag issued interim guidance outlining required actions for employees in oral communications. Employees must document oral communications with outside parties regarding Recovery Act funds. The guidance allows communications with federally registered lobbyists but outlines restrictions for different types of interactions. Orszag's memorandum does not limit discussions on general questions about Recovery Act funding logistics. The Orszag memorandum outlines four topics not covered: applying for funding, meeting deadlines, directing inquiries, and requesting information under the Recovery Act. Restrictions apply to private oral communications between federal officials and lobbyists at public gatherings, but not for general discussions. Oral communications on policy matters or specific projects must be documented. The Orszag memorandum outlines restrictions on private oral communications between federal officials and lobbyists at public gatherings. If the contact is with a federally registered lobbyist, a four-step process must be followed to document the communication. The process includes informing the lobbyist of restrictions and collecting data, which can be suspended if the communication ceases. The Orszag memorandum outlines restrictions on private oral communications between federal officials and lobbyists at public gatherings. If the contact is with a federally registered lobbyist, a four-step process must be followed to document the communication. This includes documenting policy conversations in writing and posting them publicly on the agency's recovery website within 3 days. Only logistical questions or general information about Recovery Act programs should be discussed, with no mention of specific projects, applications, or funding applicants allowed. Each conversation should be documented with the date, names of parties involved, and the lobbyist's name for public posting. The Orszag memorandum outlines restrictions on private oral communications between federal officials and lobbyists at public gatherings. A four-step process must be followed to document the communication, including submitting information about the contact to the employee's agency for review and posting on the agency's website within 3 business days. Additionally, written communication about Recovery Act projects from federally registered lobbyists must be forwarded to a designated agency official for posting on the agency's Recovery Act website. The updated guidance document expands restrictions on oral communications concerning pending competitive applications under the Recovery Act to all persons outside the Federal Government. It differentiates between oral communications before and after the submission of a formal application for funding. Federal employees are restricted from participating in oral communications regarding pending applications for Recovery Act competitive grants or other forms of Federal financial assistance, unless the communication falls under specific exceptions. Federal employees are restricted from communicating with federally registered lobbyists about pending applications for Recovery Act competitive grants or other forms of Federal financial assistance, unless specific exceptions apply. Communication must be documented and reported following set guidelines.

Any necessary modifications to the LDA or executive branch policy could be implemented through guidance documents, executive orders, or new memoranda."
