    "content": "The text chunk is about the inclusion of Medicare eligible covered beneficiaries in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with other administering Secretaries, will allow covered beneficiaries to enroll in a health benefits plan through the Federal Employees Health Benefits program instead of receiving care through the uniformed services or TRICARE program. The Office of Personnel Management may limit enrollment in the Federal Employee Health Benefits program for covered beneficiaries to ensure adequate access to services. Covered beneficiaries include members of the uniformed services and their dependents entitled to hospital insurance benefits under Medicare, without needing to meet eligibility criteria in chapter 89 of title 5. The administering Secretary is responsible for Government contributions for covered beneficiaries enrolling in the Federal Employee Health Benefits program. The contribution from beneficiaries is based on what would be withheld from a Federal employee. Participation management is handled by the authority approving retired or retainer pay. The Office of Personnel Management manages the participation of members and dependents in the Federal Employee Health Benefits program. Separate risk pools are maintained until complete inclusion is determined not to adversely affect Federal employees and annuitants. Cancellation of coverage is irrevocable, and reporting requirements are set for the Secretary of Defense and the Director of the Office. The Secretary of Defense and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management must submit a report to Congress annually on the provision of health care services to covered beneficiaries. The report includes the number of beneficiaries enrolled in health plans, out-of-pocket costs, and the government's cost of providing care. The Secretary of Defense and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management must submit an annual report to Congress on health care services for covered beneficiaries, including enrollment numbers, costs, and comparisons of costs under different health care options. The Secretary of Defense is required to offer a health benefits option by January 1, 1997. The Federal Employees Health Benefits program is amended to allow eligible covered beneficiaries under section 1079a(b) of title 10 to enroll in a health benefits plan. This is in accordance with an agreement between the Secretary of Defense and the Office, as well as applicable regulations. The Federal Employees Health Benefits program is amended to allow eligible beneficiaries to enroll in a health plan under section 1079a(b) of title 10. This includes individuals enrolling in accordance with section 8905(d) and determines the Government contribution based on section 1079a(c) of title 10."
