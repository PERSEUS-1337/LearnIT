    "title": "AB 2143",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The county recorder in each county in California is required to submit a yearly statistical report of recorded documents to the office of the Insurance Commissioner. The report includes deeds, deeds of trust, mortgages, reconveyances, and trustee's deeds, regardless of the method of transmission. Certified and noncertified copies of records issued by the county recorder are excluded from this report. The Electronic Recording Delivery Act of 2004, known as Section 27390 of the Government Code, defines terms like \"authorized submitter\" for parties working with county recorders. The Electronic Recording Delivery Act of 2004 defines key terms related to electronic records, including \"computer security auditor,\" \"digital electronic record,\" and \"electronic recording delivery system.\" A computer security auditor must be independent and not involved in establishing the system. Digital electronic records are created electronically, while digitized electronic records are scanned images of paper documents. The electronic recording delivery system is used to deliver and return electronic records for recording. Security testing is an independent audit by a computer security auditor to test the security of an electronic recording delivery system. Source code is a human-readable program translated for the system to execute. System certification is confirmation by the Attorney General for a county's electronic recording delivery system. Upon approval by the board of supervisors and system certification, a county recorder can establish an electronic recording delivery system. Upon system certification, a county recorder can contract with a title insurer, underwritten title company, institutional lender, or government entity for the digital recording of instruments. The contract may involve document delivery through an agent, excluding vendors of electronic recording systems. A county recorder can contract with an authorized submitter for digital recording of instruments, allowing document delivery through an agent not a vendor of electronic recording systems. Authorized submitters must provide proof of financial responsibility with a certificate of insurance showing adequate general liability coverage, set by the Attorney General in consultation with interested parties. A county recorder has the authority to refuse, terminate, or suspend a contract with a party accessing the system for various reasons, including protecting public interest, integrity of public records, and homeowners from financial harm. They can also take action if there is a breach of contract or regulations. Additionally, the county recorder may require parties submitting records electronically to mail a copy of the recorded electronic document to a specified address. A county recorder may establish an electronic recording delivery system with specific requirements for electronic signatures of notaries. This section will be in effect until January 1, 2027, and will be repealed after that date. A county recorder may contract with a title insurer, underwritten title company, institutional lender, or government entity for electronic recording of real property instruments. The contract may allow for document delivery by an agent, excluding vendors of electronic recording systems. A county recorder may refuse or terminate a contract for electronic recording for reasons such as protecting public interest, integrity of records, or homeowners from financial harm. They can also do so for insufficient volume or quality of submitted instruments, or if there is a breach of contract or regulations. Additionally, the recorder may require a party to mail a copy of the recorded electronic document upon completion of recording. Section 27393 of the Government Code is amended to include requirements for electronic notary signatures, including the notary's name, \"Notary Public,\" county of filing, and identification numbers. This section will be effective on January 1, 2027. The Attorney General will adopt regulations for electronic recording delivery systems in consultation with interested parties. The regulations will cover technological specifications, security requirements, and computer security audits. Requirements for computer security audits, a detailed definition of \"source code,\" placement of system components in escrow, approval process for system modifications, certification of vendors, and oversight of approved systems will be established for electronic recording delivery systems. Requirements for system certification, general liability coverage, fingerprinting, criminal records checks, uniform index information in records, protecting proprietary information, and certification under Section 27397.5 will be established. The Attorney General may also create additional regulations as needed. The Attorney General will inspect electronic recording delivery systems and provide relevant findings to county recorder, district attorney, and technology vendors. This section will be in effect until January 1, 2027, and regulations for oversight of electronic recording delivery systems will be adopted by the Attorney General in consultation with interested parties. The regulations may include specifications for electronic recording delivery systems, security requirements, computer security audits, a definition of \"source code,\" and escrow requirements for software associated with each county's system. Requirements for approval of modifications to operating systems, initial certification of vendors for electronic recording systems, system certification and oversight, fingerprinting and criminal records checks, uniform index information, protection of proprietary information, and certification under Section 27397.5. The Attorney General may issue regulations for certification under Section 27397.5, including local inspection of electronic recording delivery systems. Findings from inspections will be shared with county recorder, district attorney, and technology vendors. Effective January 1, 2027."
