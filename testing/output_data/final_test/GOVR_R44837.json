    "content": "The federal government provides benefits for qualified veterans, specifically service-disabled veterans who incurred injuries or diseases during their service. This report discusses major benefits offered by the Department of Veterans Affairs, including disability compensation, vocational rehabilitation, housing grants, and other assistance programs. Service-disabled veterans are eligible for various grants and benefits, such as grants for automobiles or clothing. These programs vary in funding levels and the number of beneficiaries served. To qualify as a veteran with a service-connected disability, one must meet the statutory definition of a veteran. This report does not cover benefits available to both service-disabled and non-service disabled veterans, such as health benefits. To be considered a veteran for federal benefits, a person must have served a minimum period of active duty, incurred a service-connected disability, or served the full period for which they were called to active duty. A service-connected disability is a physical or mental injury incurred in the line of military duty that results in a disability. The VA determines disability ratings for veterans using the VASRD, which provides schedules for evaluating different body systems. For example, 38 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 4.75-4.78 covers eye disabilities, with specific ratings assigned based on conditions and symptoms. A detached retina could be rated from 10% to 60% depending on the severity. Veterans Disability Compensation (VDC) is a monthly cash payment to a veteran with a service-connected disability, determined by the disability rating and number of dependents. A veteran is eligible for VDC with a disability rated at least 10% disabling, which can be elevated to 100% under certain conditions. Disability ratings are determined using the VASRD, with specific ratings assigned based on conditions and symptoms. Veterans Disability Compensation (VDC) is a monthly cash benefit paid to veterans with service-connected disabilities. The benefit levels increase with higher disability ratings, with a single veteran eligible for $133.57 at 10%, $838.64 at 50%, and $2,915.55 at 100%. Benefits may be adjusted annually for cost-of-living increases, and additional Special Monthly Compensation (SMC) may be provided for certain disabilities. The Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E) program provides employment-related services to veterans with service-connected disabilities and employment handicaps. Veterans with disability ratings of 20% or more are entitled to VR&E benefits if they have an employment handicap, while those with a 10% rating may qualify with a serious employment handicap. The program also offers independent living services for qualified veterans. Veterans must complete the VR&E program within 12 years of separation to be eligible for benefits. The VR&E program supports veterans with service-connected disabilities and employment handicaps. Veterans work with a VRC to develop a plan for suitable employment, with benefits covering costs like tuition, fees, and supportive services. Training may include a subsistence allowance, and if employment is not possible, independent living services or equipment may be provided. Benefits are generally limited to 48 months but can be extended in certain cases. VA grants are available to assist veterans. The VA offers grants to assist veterans with service-connected disabilities in housing needs. The Specially Adapted Housing Program provides grants for constructing, purchasing, or remodeling homes. The Home Improvements and Structural Alterations grant helps veterans with disabilities make their homes accessible. There are two grant programs within the Specially Adapted Housing Program for veterans and active duty servicemembers. The Specially Adapted Housing Program offers grants for veterans with service-connected disabilities. There are two grant programs available: one for veterans with mobility impairments and another for those who are blind or have lost the use of their hands. Both grants have limits and can be used up to three times. Veterans and servicemembers with severe burn injuries are eligible for both types of adapted housing. The Specially Adapted Housing Program offers grants for veterans and servicemembers who meet the disability criteria, including those who have lost both lower extremities, are blind in both eyes, have severe burn injuries, or have lost the use of both upper extremities. SAH grants are also available to those with a permanent service-connected disability affecting balance and propulsion. The Specially Adapted Housing Program provides grants for veterans and servicemembers with disabilities affecting balance and propulsion, including those who have lost lower extremities. Eligible individuals must have a disability occurring after September 11, 2001, and be approved by the end of FY2017. SAH grant limits are adjusted annually based on construction costs, with a maximum of $77,307 for a veteran's own home and $33,937 for temporary residence in a family member's home. The Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) Program provides grants for veterans and servicemembers with disabilities affecting balance and propulsion. The Special Housing Adaptation (SHA) grant covers 50% of property acquisition or housing construction costs for veterans with specific service-connected disabilities. SHA grants can be used for a veteran's own home or a family member's home, with limits set by statute and updated annually. The SHA grant limits are set by statute and updated annually based on a residential home cost-of-construction index. For FY2017, the grant limit for a veteran's or servicemember's own home is $15,462; for a veteran or servicemember temporarily residing in a family member's home is $6,059; and for a veteran or servicemember indefinitely residing in a family member's home is $15,462. HISA grants provide funds for home improvements and alterations necessary for the veteran's disability treatment or for essential home access and facilities. The HISA grant can be used for alterations with a benefit cap. Veterans may receive both a HISA grant and either an SHA or SAH grant. The maximum benefit for veterans with a service-connected disability is $6,800, and for those with a non-service-connected disability, it is $2,000. Veterans with certain disabilities can also receive grants for automobile purchase or adaptive equipment. Financial assistance is available for veterans to purchase adaptive equipment for their existing automobile to make it safe or legal for their use. Eligibility for the automobile grant requires specific service-connected conditions, such as loss of limbs, impaired vision, severe burns, or ALS. Veterans can also receive grants for adaptive equipment if they have certain service-connected conditions or immobility of joints. The maximum grant amount is $20,235.20, adjusted annually based on the Consumer Price Index. Veterans are eligible for only one automobile grant in their lifetime. A veteran may be eligible for adaptive equipment for up to two automobiles during a four-year period, with payments made to the seller or veteran up to set maximum amounts. A clothing allowance is available for veterans with service-connected disabilities who use prosthetic or orthopedic appliances that may damage their clothing. Veterans can receive one annual clothing allowance for each type of device or medication used. The clothing allowance for veterans with service-connected disabilities is $779.62 annually, payable on August 1. It is not automatically adjusted for cost-of-living increases but may be increased through legislation using Social Security COLA. Veterans in good health can apply for Service-Disabled Veterans Insurance (S-DVI) within two years of receiving a disability rating from the VA. Good health is defined as being free from any medical condition that would weaken normal physical or mental functions or shorten life. Service-Disabled Veterans Insurance (S-DVI) offers term and permanent life insurance plans to eligible veterans with a maximum face value of $10,000. Premiums vary by age and plan type, with options for totally disabled veterans to have their premiums waived. Veterans under 65 with a premium waiver may also purchase $30,000 in supplemental coverage. Gratuitous S-DVI is available for mentally incompetent veterans who did not apply for insurance within the eligibility period and pays out as a $10,000 lump sum to eligible beneficiaries within two years of the veteran's death."
