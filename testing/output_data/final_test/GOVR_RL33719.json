    "content": "The courts and Congress have been dealing with various tobacco-related issues over the past few decades, including the Master Settlement Agreement resulting from lawsuits by states' attorneys general against tobacco companies. Beginning in 1994, states began filing lawsuits for reimbursement of tobacco-related medical expenses. In 1998, 46 states, the District of Columbia, and five U.S. territories signed the Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) with major tobacco companies, receiving annual payments of $206 billion over 26 years. Four states settled individually. The MSA prohibited certain tobacco product advertising and marketing. States have allocated a small percentage of the $61 million received from tobacco companies to anti-smoking efforts, with even less spent on tobacco control. The majority of the payments were allocated to health care, budget shortfalls, general purposes, infrastructure, education, debt service, and other projects. 11.9% of the payments were not allocated. The Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) stemmed from lawsuits by states seeking reimbursement for medical expenses related to tobacco use. The federal government may sue third parties for reimbursement of Medicaid funds used for illness or injury. P.L. 106-31 allows states to keep reimbursements from third parties. A federal lawsuit against tobacco companies aimed to recover tobacco-related medical costs. The federal government sued tobacco companies seeking restitution for healthcare costs related to tobacco-related diseases, disgorgement of profits earned through RICO violations, and orders to prevent future fraud and violations. However, the government could not recover any funds from the defendants. In 2000, two claims for recovery under the Medical Care Recovery Act and Medicare Secondary Payer Act were dismissed by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The government sued tobacco companies under RICO claims for defrauding smokers and sought disgorgement of profits. The defendants challenged the government's right to seek profits, leading to a reversal by the U.S. Court of Appeals in 2004. In 2004, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the defendants, allowing only forward-looking injunctive relief and denying the $280 billion disgorgement sought for tobacco profits since 1971. The court focused on preventing future wrongdoing under RICO rather than punishing past conduct, stating that Congress did not intend to provide additional remedies like disgorgement. The court found that companies and trade organizations deceived the public about smoking's health effects, nicotine addictiveness, and cigarette design manipulation. The defendants were ordered to pay $1.93 million in legal costs, banned from using certain descriptors on packaging, and required to issue corrective statements in various media. The court extended the time for tobacco companies to make litigation documents public and prohibited them from using certain marketing descriptors internationally. Both tobacco companies and the DOJ filed appeals with the D.C. Circuit. The D.C. Circuit upheld the district court's finding of liability against nine cigarette manufacturers and affirmed the remedial order. The court rejected the government's proposed remedies and denied the request to seize corporate profits. Additionally, the court partly vacated the remedial order and remanded for further proceedings on specific issues. The D.C. Circuit upheld the district court's liability finding against cigarette manufacturers, vacating the order on health messages and directing the court to exempt foreign activities with no domestic effects. This decision may impact the earlier ruling that health message prohibitions apply globally. Tobacco lawsuits pre-1992 were mainly product liability cases, with the industry often winning by citing the FCLAA warning label requirements. In 1992, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc. that smokers could pursue state-law damages actions against tobacco companies for failure-to-warn lawsuits and other claims unrelated to advertising. This decision made it easier for smokers to recover damages, despite federal laws precluding additional state requirements on warning labels. After the Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc. ruling in 1992, private parties brought suits against tobacco companies for various reasons including deceptive practices, fraud, conspiracy, and antitrust violations. Shareholders sued for decreased stock prices, insurance companies for medical expenses, and cigarette manufacturers faced legal action for negligence, defective design, and unfair trade practices. Long-term smokers filed a class action suit seeking low dose CT scans for lung cancer detection. The plaintiffs alleged that Philip Morris's actions led to a higher risk of lung cancer. The court dismissed the defective design claims and granted Philip Morris's motion to dismiss. The court found that even if a safer cigarette had been produced, the plaintiffs would still face an increased risk of lung cancer. Philip Morris was granted summary judgment on the implied warranty claim. In the federal class action lawsuit Schwab v. Philip Morris U.S.A., Inc., lead plaintiff Barbara Schwab sued tobacco companies for fraud in marketing light cigarettes as less dangerous. The district court found the MSA did not prevent the suit, but the Second Circuit decertified the class action due to a lack of collective legal or factual questions. The Circuit Court of Miami-Dade County granted class action status in Engle v. Liggett Group, where a jury awarded $145 billion in punitive damages against tobacco companies. However, Florida's Third District Court of Appeal decertified the class of up to 700,000 Florida smokers, and the Florida Supreme Court upheld the decision citing individualized causation and fault issues. The court in the Engle case upheld individual damage awards for two Florida cancer patients but denied certiorari. The decision allowed individual smokers to file lawsuits instead of a class action, giving them an advantage in proving that cigarettes are addictive and cause diseases. The Engle case gave individual smokers an advantage in lawsuits against tobacco companies by establishing findings that cigarettes are addictive, defective, and unreasonably dangerous. Thousands of cases have been filed in Florida, with mixed results in individual suits. For example, a jury awarded $8 million in damages to a widow against Altria. In a series of tobacco-related cases, a Fort Lauderdale jury awarded a plaintiff nearly $300 million in damages in September 2008. However, a state jury in St. Petersburg ruled in favor of R.J. Reynolds in a case involving a widow of a smoker who died of lung cancer. Despite initial victories for plaintiffs in post-Engle cases, tobacco defendants later received a string of favorable verdicts. In a notable case, the Supreme Court of Illinois overturned a $7.1 billion verdict in compensatory and punitive damages in the Price v. Philip Morris U.S.A., Inc. class action lawsuit. The Illinois Supreme Court ruled against plaintiffs in a case involving Marlboro Lights cigarettes, stating that tobacco companies were not liable for fraud in advertising light cigarettes as safer due to FTC authorization. The U.S. Supreme Court later denied certiorari in 2006, and a subsequent case addressed preemption under the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act. The Court ruled that the plaintiffs' claims under the Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act were not preempted by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act. The plaintiffs alleged that Philip Morris USA and Altria Group deceived consumers by using \"light\" and \"low tar\" descriptors on cigarettes. The Court rejected the argument that the FTC's promotion of low-tar cigarettes preempted the state law claims. The California Supreme Court allowed state law claims of fraud based on descriptors like \"light\" and \"low tar\" to proceed, enabling individuals to sue tobacco companies for products liability. The court also ruled that tobacco additives could create unreasonably dangerous products beyond known risks of smoking. In Grisham v. Philip Morris, the California Supreme Court ruled that the statute of limitations for filing a physical injury claim starts when a smoker is diagnosed with a disease caused by cigarettes. The ruling did not address if the statute would run if a smoker was diagnosed with multiple illnesses. Defendant tobacco companies argued the statute should begin when smokers discover they are addicted to cigarettes. Governments of Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Ukraine sued American tobacco companies for money spent on smoking-related issues. The governments of Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Ukraine sued American tobacco companies in the U.S. District Court for money spent on medical care for tobacco-related illnesses. The district court dismissed the lawsuit, and the U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed, stating that the alleged injuries were too remote to be caused by the defendants' conduct. The foreign governments were found to not have standing to sue. The Supreme Court denied standing to foreign nations to sue in the US on behalf of their citizens regarding tobacco advertising regulations under the FCLAA. The FCLAA requires health warnings on cigarette and smokeless tobacco ads, with rotations approved by the FTC. States cannot add their own warnings due to preemption. The MSA limits tobacco advertising but allows certain forms like print and online ads. It bans cartoons, ads on public transport, and gifts to minors for tobacco purchases. The Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) imposes restrictions on tobacco advertising, including bans on giving gifts to minors in exchange for proofs of purchase, free samples in non-adult facilities, large signs outside stores, and billboards in certain locations. However, advertisements within adult-only facilities are allowed. The MSA also prohibits the sale of merchandise with tobacco brand names, except at brand-sponsored events, and limits sponsorships of events by tobacco companies. Additionally, the MSA prohibits payments to media for tobacco promotion and targeting minors. Several states and cities imposed additional restrictions on tobacco advertising after trial courts approved the Master Settlement Agreement (MSA). Baltimore passed ordinances banning tobacco and alcohol ads on billboards, upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals. In 1999, the Massachusetts Attorney General implemented advertising restrictions to complement the MSA, prohibiting outdoor tobacco ads within 1,000 feet of schools, playgrounds, and parks, as well as restricting point-of-sale displays. The Massachusetts Attorney General implemented advertising restrictions in 1999, including banning outdoor tobacco ads near schools and restricting point-of-sale displays. The U.S. Supreme Court later ruled in 2001 that the FCLAA preempted some of Massachusetts's regulations on cigarette advertising, but not those on smokeless tobacco or cigars. The U.S. Supreme Court found that Massachusetts's outdoor and point-of-sale advertising regulations on cigars and smokeless tobacco violated the First Amendment, as they were overbroad and restricted the right to truthful speech on legal products. The Court also struck down the 1,000-foot state ban on point-of-sale retail displays for cigars and smokeless tobacco. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned Massachusetts's outdoor and point-of-sale advertising regulations on cigars and smokeless tobacco, deeming them unconstitutional for restricting truthful speech on legal products. Additionally, the Court struck down a 1,000-foot state ban on retail displays for these products, citing concerns about its effectiveness in preventing minors from accessing tobacco. The Court upheld restrictions on self-service displays and required customer interaction with a salesperson before purchasing tobacco products. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned Massachusetts's outdoor and point-of-sale advertising regulations on cigars and smokeless tobacco, deeming them unconstitutional for restricting truthful speech on legal products. The Court upheld restrictions on self-service displays and required customer interaction with a salesperson before purchasing tobacco products to prevent minors from accessing tobacco. All 50 states ban tobacco sales to individuals under age 18, with federal law playing a role in this restriction through the Synar Amendment. The Synar Amendment requires states to enforce bans on selling tobacco products to individuals under 18 through random inspections. Failure to comply may result in reduced federal funding for substance abuse treatment. The goal is to achieve 80% compliance with laws prohibiting tobacco sales to minors. In 2008, the Supreme Court ruled in Rowe v. New Hampshire Motor Transport Association that Maine laws restricting minors' access to cigarettes online were preempted by federal law. Maine passed laws in 2003 to prevent sales of tobacco products to minors, imposing civil penalties for violations. Retailers were required to use delivery services that verified the purchaser's age and ID, with the purchaser signing for the products. Another provision stated that a package marked by a tobacco retailer indicated knowledge of tobacco products inside. Maine's laws required tobacco packages to be marked by a retailer to indicate tobacco contents and included civil liability for carriers failing to examine packages. The state aimed to prevent minors from accessing cigarettes, but the Supreme Court found the laws preempted by the FAAA due to their impact on carrier operations. Maine's laws, found preempted by the Supreme Court, aimed to prevent minors from accessing cigarettes but were deemed to substitute government commands for market forces in determining carrier services. Justice Ginsburg noted a regulatory gap left by the FAAA's preemption provision, affecting state enforcement strategies. The 2009 FSPTCA now involves the FDA in preventing minors from obtaining tobacco products through regulations like age verification and restrictions on sales. The cigarette industry historically used the FTC Test Method to determine tar and nicotine ratings of cigarettes. This method relies on a machine to produce standardized data. In litigation, tobacco manufacturers reference FTC actions to support the use of descriptors like \"light\" or \"lower tar and nicotine.\" The FTC authorized descriptors like \"light\" or \"lower tar and nicotine,\" cannot be held liable for misleading practices. In 2008, the FTC rescinded guidance on tar and nicotine measurements, stating they do not provide meaningful information to smokers. The Commission did not define terms like \"light\" or \"ultra low\" and declined to ban their use. The FTC declined to ban descriptors like \"light\" or \"lower tar and nicotine\" due to a court order in the government's RICO lawsuit against tobacco companies. The FDA has issued new regulations for testing tobacco products and prohibits marketing \"modified risk tobacco products\" without approval. The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (FSPTCA) prohibits tobacco products from using terms like \"light,\" \"mild,\" or \"low\" to imply reduced risk. Manufacturers must stop using terms like \"light\" and \"low-tar\" for their products. The act also bans the use of any flavor additives in cigarettes, except for menthol."
