    "content": "The Clean Air Act (CAA) aims to protect human health and the environment from air pollution. Debate over using the CAA to regulate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions dates back to 1999. EPA initially denied a petition to regulate GHG emissions from vehicles under CAA Section 202, but the Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that EPA has the authority to set emission standards for GHGs. The EPA Administrator is required to set emission standards for any air pollutant from motor vehicles that may endanger public health or welfare. GHGs are considered air pollutants and EPA was found to have acted arbitrarily in denying a petition. This led to the issuance of GHG emission standards for vehicles in 2010. In 2011, the Supreme Court affirmed EPA's authority to regulate GHG emissions. In the case of American Electric Power Co. v. Connecticut (AEP), the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that EPA's authority to regulate GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act (CAA) displaced common law tort or nuisance claims against power plants. The Court determined that \"air pollutant\" includes GHGs for power plants, and federal judges cannot set limits on GHG emissions as the CAA empowers EPA to do so. EPA proceeded to regulate GHGs under other CAA authorities for stationary sources, including interpreting mobile source GHG regulations triggering regulations under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program. The EPA regulates GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act through programs like Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Title V permits. The PSD program requires permits for new or modified sources emitting threshold amounts of air pollutants, while Title V permits are for \"major sources\" emitting 100 tons per year of any air pollutant. To address the large scale of GHG emissions, EPA issued a \"tailoring rule\" to phase in permitting for smaller sources previously not subject to CAA regulations. The Supreme Court rejected EPA's interpretation of the \"triggering\" provisions for the stationary source programs in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA (\"UARG\"). Justice Scalia stated that EPA's greenhouse-gas-inclusive interpretation of the PSD and Title V triggers was unreasonable and would lead to a significant expansion in regulatory authority without clear congressional authorization. The Supreme Court affirmed EPA's authority to require Best Available Control Technology (BACT) for regulating GHG emissions from power plants under the Clean Air Act. This decision allows EPA to regulate 83% of U.S. stationary-source GHG emissions under permitting programs. The Supreme Court affirmed EPA's authority to regulate GHG emissions from power plants under the Clean Air Act, allowing EPA to regulate 83% of U.S. stationary-source GHG emissions. In 2011, EPA finalized a settlement agreement to establish NSPSs for GHG emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants and emission guidelines for existing power plants. President Obama directed EPA to issue GHG regulations under Section 111(b) and 111(d) in 2013. EPA characterizes Section 111 as addressing pollutants from existing stationary sources. The Clean Air Act (CAA) Sections 108-110 and hazardous air pollutants (HAP) under the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) program are addressed in Section 111, which directs the EPA to establish standards of performance for existing sources in certain categories. NSPSs under Section 111(b) may trigger emission guidelines under Section 111(d). The Clean Air Act Section 111 directs the EPA to establish standards of performance for existing sources in certain categories, including defining \"standard of performance\" and \"stationary source.\" The Administrator must publish a list of categories of stationary sources that cause or contribute significantly to air pollution endangering public health or welfare. The Clean Air Act Section 111 requires the EPA to set standards of performance for existing sources in specific categories of stationary sources that may endanger public health or welfare. Within one year, the Administrator must propose regulations for new sources in those categories. Additionally, regulations must be established for each state to submit a plan with standards of performance for existing sources for air pollutants without air quality criteria. The House-originated amendment in the Clean Air Act Section 111 ends subparagraph (i) with \"or emitted from a source category which is regulated under section 112,\" while the Senate-originated amendment ends it with \"or section 112(b).\" The regulations of the Administrator allow states to consider factors like the remaining useful life of existing sources when applying standards of performance. The Administrator has the authority to prescribe a plan for a state in cases where the state needs to implement and enforce standards of performance. The EPA has the authority to prescribe and enforce a plan for a state if it fails to submit or enforce emission guidelines under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act. The EPA has issued emission guidelines for various air pollutants and source categories under this section since the 1970s. The EPA has issued emission guidelines for various air pollutants and source categories under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act, including methane and non-methane compounds from landfills, acid mist from sulfuric acid production units, fluoride emissions from phosphate fertilizer plants, reduced sulfur emissions from kraft pulp mills, and fluoride emissions from primary aluminum plants. The 2005 Clean Air Mercury Rule established a cap-and-trade system for mercury under Section 111(d) after delisting coal-fired power plants from CAA Section 112. EPA also finalized NSPSs for GHG emissions from power plants, which are being challenged in the D.C. Circuit. The EPA published the \"Carbon Pollution Emission Guidelines for Existing Electric Utility Generating Units\" in 2014, known as the CPP. It received over 4.3 million public comments and was finalized in 2015. Congressional Review Act resolutions were introduced but President Obama vetoed them. Various resolutions and bills have been introduced for and against EPA regulation of GHGs from power plants. The CPP is a detailed rule with many definitions and provisions not touched on here, many of which are the subject of specific challenges or defenses in the present litigation. EPA determined the \"best system of emission reduction\" for affected electric generating units based on three components: heat rate improvements, generation shifts among affected power plants, and efficiency improvements. The EPA used the Best System of Emission Reduction (BSER) to set national emission performance rates for fossil fuel-fired electric steam generating units and natural gas combined cycle units. State-specific targets were calculated based on each state's baseline generation mix. States could reach their targets without needing to comply with specific assumptions or rates, with policies determined by state plans. The EPA set emission performance rates for fossil fuel-fired electric steam generating units and natural gas combined cycle units based on the Best System of Emission Reduction (BSER). States could use an emission-standards approach or a \"state measures\" approach to reach their targets, which could be measured in pounds of CO2 per megawatt-hour or tons of CO2. If a state fails to submit a satisfactory plan, EPA can prescribe a federal plan. The EPA published a proposed federal plan for existing power plants to achieve the NAAQS. The CPP set a deadline of September 6, 2016, for states to submit an implementation plan. The near-term deadlines lack legal effect due to pending litigation. The eight-year interim compliance period for the CPP begins in 2022 and runs through 2029, separated into three steps. The CPP sets an eight-year interim compliance period from 2022 to 2029, divided into three steps with specific CO2 emission performance rates. Challenges to the CPP began before its final publication, with petitions for review filed by coal companies and several states. Compliance with the state's final goal is required by 2030, with the possibility of delayed or adjusted compliance dates if the Rule is upheld. South Carolina, South Dakota, and Wyoming filed petitions for review in the D.C. Circuit challenging EPA's proposed rule on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. The court denied the petitions, stating that EPA has not yet issued a final rule for judicial review. Petitioners are asking the Court to review the legality of a proposed rule, which is something the Court has never done before. Oklahoma and other parties have previously challenged the proposal in federal courts, but their motions were denied. Various petitions were filed in the D.C. Circuit challenging the final CPP after its publication. The D.C. Circuit received petitions challenging the final CPP within 60 days of its publication in the Federal Register on October 23, 2015. 26 states, led by West Virginia and Texas, filed petitions, with additional states and entities joining in opposition. North Carolina later withdrew as a petitioner. Several parties, including labor unions, rural electric cooperatives, industry groups, and fossil-fuel-related companies, have filed petitions challenging the CPP. Over 100 parties have consolidated their petitions into one case, West Virginia et al v. EPA et al. Various amici curiae, such as Members of Congress and scientists, have also filed briefs in support of the petitions. Several parties, including state and local chambers of commerce, legal foundations, electric utilities, former Public Utility Commissioners, and groups representing women, minorities, seniors, and taxpayers, filed intervenor and amicus briefs opposing the CPP. Respondents are the EPA and its current Administrator, Gina McCarthy. Parties supporting respondents include a coalition of 18 states, the District of Columbia, and other cities and a county. Other parties supporting the CPP include utilities, power companies, nonprofit organizations, environmental organizations, and energy industry associations. Former EPA Administrators are also supporting the CPP as amici curiae. Former EPA Administrators, former Secretaries of State and Defense, a Career Diplomat, a policy institute, medical groups, scientists, grid experts, companies, business and labor groups, faith groups, and a local government coalition support the CPP as amici curiae. Members of Congress also filed a brief in support. In total, four intervenor briefs and 18 amici curiae briefs were offered in support of the CPP. Four states have not joined the litigation: Alaska and Idaho. In the ongoing litigation over the CPP, several states have not joined, including Alaska, Idaho, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee. Members of Congress have filed briefs both opposing and supporting the CPP, with arguments centered around Congress's authority and EPA's regulatory role. The D.C. Circuit panel denied petitioners' motions to stay the CPP for the duration of the litigation, citing the stringent requirements for a stay pending court review. The court's order did not provide detailed reasoning but referenced the four traditional factors for a stay. The D.C. Circuit panel denied petitioners' motions to stay the CPP, citing the stringent requirements for a stay pending court review, including irreparable harm, lack of substantial harm to others, and public interest. The stay briefing highlighted legal and factual arguments on EPA's authority and decisions. The court's order also addressed the timing and manner of litigation, rejecting bifurcation of the case into two phases as requested by petitioners. The court's order rejects bifurcation of the case into two phases as requested by petitioners; it does expedite briefing to allow oral argument in the current term. Various parties applied to the Supreme Court for an immediate stay of the Rule, which was granted without explanation, pausing the CPP's legal proceedings. The Supreme Court granted a stay of the Clean Power Plan without explanation, pausing its legal effect while undergoing judicial review. The split decision was five to four, with Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito, and Kennedy granting the applications. Justice Scalia's death and the current vacancy on the Court may impact the CPP litigation. The D.C. Circuit ordered consolidated cases to be rescheduled for oral argument before the en banc court in September 2016. En banc hearings are rare and only ordered for maintaining uniformity or for exceptional importance. The order surprised many participants and delayed the argument by almost four months. The D.C. Circuit ordered consolidated cases to be rescheduled for oral argument before the en banc court in September 2016, delaying the argument by almost four months. Chief Judge Merrick Garland and Judge Nina Pillard did not participate in the decision to hear the case en banc. Judge Pillard later decided to participate in the oral argument, resulting in a panel of 10 judges. In West Virginia v. EPA, arguments were presented before a panel of 10 judges on various issues related to state authority, statutory amendments, constitutional issues, notice issues, and record-based issues. The oral argument scheduled for 3.5 hours lasted about seven hours on September 27, 2016. The litigation of the Clean Power Plan continues in the D.C. Circuit following the Supreme Court's stay. This report provides condensed examples of the legal arguments presented in the case. Arguments in the West Virginia v. EPA case focused on the interpretation and implementation of CAA Section 111, with parties debating the standards for evaluating EPA's authority. The Supreme Court's UARG v. EPA decision raised concerns about potential regulatory overreach by the EPA in cases like the Clean Power Plan. In the West Virginia v. EPA case, arguments centered on EPA's regulatory authority under CAA Section 111, with concerns raised about potential overreach by the agency in cases like the Clean Power Plan. Petitioners in the case emphasize the need for clear congressional authorization for EPA's actions, citing language from UARG v. EPA and King v. Burwell to support their position against deference in the CPP litigation. The Supreme Court has expressed skepticism towards EPA claims of authority to regulate the economy through the Clean Power Plan, with arguments against Chevron deference and in favor of standard statutory interpretation. Respondents argue for Chevron deference and the \"arbitrary and capricious\" standard for reviewing agency actions under the Clean Air Act. EPA defends its inclusion of generation-shifting in the \"best system\" under the Clean Air Act, arguing for Chevron deference in interpreting regulatory authority. Petitioners claim Chevron does not apply, but EPA asserts its authority to fill gaps in pollution reduction regulations for major sources. This case involves EPA's long-standing administration of the statute and its mission to protect public health and welfare. The judges questioned whether a heightened standard of review should be applied beyond traditional Chevron deference, citing a previous Supreme Court ruling. They raised the \"major questions\" doctrine and questioned if the Clean Power Plan was of significant economic and political importance. The court questioned if the Clean Power Plan was of significant economic and political importance, focusing on whether it was transformative in regulating GHG emissions from power plants. Petitioners challenged EPA's design of the CPP, especially its inclusion of electricity generation-shifting measures. Petitioners argue that the EPA's authority under Section 111(d) is exceeded by the Clean Power Plan, as it cannot regulate existing power plants due to hazardous air pollutants regulation under Section 112. They claim that Section 111 only allows measures within the \"fenceline\" of individual sources and does not permit grid reorganization or state energy economy changes. Petitioners argue that the EPA's Clean Power Plan exceeds its authority under Section 111(d) by requiring reduction obligations that can only be met through non-performance by regulated sources. They claim that power plants would be \"subsidizing their competition\" by buying emission credits from renewable energy providers to meet emission limits. EPA's confusion between 'standards of performance' and other air quality programs is also highlighted by amici curiae. The EPA's Clean Power Plan is challenged by petitioners who argue it exceeds authority by requiring reductions that can only be met through non-performance. EPA defends its approach, stating that the term 'system of emission reduction' is broad and includes off-site actions. EPA also argues that limitations proposed by petitioners would hinder the statutory objective. The EPA's Clean Power Plan is challenged by petitioners who argue it exceeds authority by requiring reductions that can only be met through non-performance. EPA defends its approach, stating that the term 'system of emission reduction' is broad and includes off-site actions. Several intervenors support EPA's position, emphasizing the effectiveness of generation-shifting in achieving emission reductions at lower costs. The definition of \"system\" with respect to BSER was a focal point during oral arguments, with judges questioning EPA's interpretation. Petitioners also argue that limitations on EPA's authority are necessary to protect public health and welfare. The EPA's Clean Power Plan is challenged for exceeding authority by requiring reductions that may only be achievable through non-performance. Critics argue that EPA's interpretation of the term \"system\" in the Clean Air Act violates limitations set by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). They also highlight the impact of the plan on states with different regulatory models. EPA defends the plan, stating it does not infringe on FERC's power and appropriately limits air pollution under the Clean Air Act. The EPA's Clean Power Plan does not regulate electricity sales or rates, and it consulted with FERC. Former state officials support the CPP, emphasizing the respect for state regulatory bodies. The core argument in the CPP litigation revolves around the interpretation of language in the Clean Air Act. Prior to the CAA Amendments of 1990, Section 111(d) required EPA to prescribe regulations for states to submit plans establishing and implementing standards of performance for existing sources of air pollutants. This included criteria for pollutants not covered under the hazardous air pollutant program. In 1990, Congress amended the Clean Air Act, replacing the former process for listing hazardous air pollutants with a list of nearly 200 HAPs. This made the cross-reference in Section 111(d) to Section 112(b)(1)(A) obsolete. Both the House and Senate offered amendments to the cross-reference, which were included in the final legislation signed into law by President Bush. The House-originated provision in the Clean Air Act excludes certain air pollutants from regulation under Section 111(d), while the Senate-originated amendment excludes pollutants listed under Section 108(a) or 112(b). Petitioners argue that power plants, regulated under Section 112 for mercury and other HAPs, cannot be regulated under Section 111(d) for CO2. EPA's interpretation of the U.S. Code text is contested. Petitioners dispute EPA's interpretation of the exclusion in the Clean Air Act, arguing that power plants regulated under Section 112 for mercury and other HAPs cannot be regulated under Section 111(d) for CO2. They also challenge EPA's reliance on the Senate-originated amendment and argue that it violates constitutional principles of separation of powers. EPA maintains that its interpretation is reasonable and consistent with the Act. The EPA interprets Section 111(d) to exclude regulation of HAP emitted from a source category regulated under Section 112, to avoid a gap in regulation. The EPA argues that the exclusion of Section 112 in Section 111(d) leaves a gap for unregulated emissions of dangerous pollutants. Judges grapple with the complexity and ambiguity of the legislative history during oral arguments. Petitioners argue that the Clean Power Plan violates the U.S. Constitution by infringing on state powers and coercing states to comply. They claim that the plan does not provide states with a meaningful opportunity to decline implementation, leading to constitutional issues. The Clean Power Plan is criticized for not allowing states to decline implementation, coercing them to comply with federal policy on electricity generation. Some judges question if the CPP is different from other regulatory programs that require state action. Petitioners argue for a non-deferential \"clear statement\" standard of review. Intervenors opposing the Clean Power Plan argue that it intrudes on state regulation unless federal law clearly mandates it. They also claim it violates separation of powers by usurping legislative and judicial authority. EPA defends the plan as an example of cooperative federalism, stating that states can choose not to comply with no new obligations imposed. Supporters of the plan view it as a lawful implementation. Intervenors supporting the EPA and the Clean Power Plan argue that it is a lawful implementation of EPA's obligations under the cooperative federalism structure of Section 111(d). They dispute constitutional claims and counter separation of powers arguments, stating that the CAA delegated discretion to EPA with meaningful criteria. Petitioners and their supporters also base federalism arguments on the text of the CAA. The CAA grants EPA authority to establish standards for new stationary sources, while states have authority for existing sources. EPA's actions are seen as violating the statute's terms by displacing state authority. The national electric power system has a clear divide between federal and state authority. EPA argues it has the necessary authority. EPA argues it has authority under Section 111(d) to establish emission standards for existing sources, allowing states to set specific standards. The CPP maintains the federal-state division of authority over the electrical grid. Petitioners challenge EPA's legal burden in demonstrating the BSER in the CPP and argue against the reliability of the electrical grid and the need for new infrastructure. They also criticize EPA's cost-benefit analysis for the Rule as flawed. The petitioners oppose EPA's cost-benefit analysis for the Rule, arguing that achieving the required emission reductions is an \"impossible task\" for states. They claim that California's proposed plan to limit carbon trading may hinder states like Montana, Kentucky, North Dakota, and West Virginia from meeting their reduction goals. The petitioners argue that California's proposed carbon trading plan may hinder states like Montana, Kentucky, North Dakota, and West Virginia from meeting their emission reduction goals. Amici, including state and local business associations, groups representing disadvantaged populations, and Pedernales Electric Cooperative, raise concerns about the economic costs and impacts on employment and disadvantaged groups resulting from the Clean Power Plan. Pedernales Electric Cooperative and Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia express concerns about the negative impacts of the Clean Power Plan on planning, reliability, and security. MEAG highlights the burden of irrevocable long-term contracts and potential double payments for electricity, leading to environmental justice issues. EPA defends its emission limitation approach as achievable and conservative in its estimates. EPA defends its emission limitation approach as achievable and conservative, refuting petitioners' claims and emphasizing considerations of costs, infrastructure, and grid reliability. Trading programs may be established despite EPA's assertion that they are not required. Intervenors and amici supporting EPA further elaborate on the achievability of emission standards and the evidentiary basis for the BSER. Power companies also weigh in on the discussion. Power companies and environmental organizations support EPA's emission limitation approach, citing flexibility in compliance options and reasonable consideration of factors. Wind, solar, and advanced energy associations argue that EPA's determination of BSER was reasonable. Consumer groups argue that the Clean Power Plan (CPP) would not significantly increase electricity costs and could actually reduce costs by improving efficiency. Various states challenge EPA's calculations and decisions, such as Wisconsin questioning baseline emissions, Arizona and Utah raising concerns about trading with Indian tribes, and New Jersey criticizing the lack of consideration for energy deregulation. North Carolina and Wyoming also dispute EPA's exclusion of their emission reductions. Wyoming and Utah challenge EPA's Clean Power Plan, arguing that their unique circumstances were ignored. EPA defends its state-specific goals and the exclusion of pre-2013 generating facilities from emission-rate credits. Judges suggest issues may be premature, with future opportunities for states to seek review. Petitioners claim EPA overlooks parts of the electrical system, like renewable energy and nuclear generation. The EPA's Clean Power Plan is challenged by Wyoming and Utah for ignoring their unique circumstances, including renewable energy and nuclear generation in the electrical system. EPA defends its state-specific goals and exclusion of pre-2013 generating facilities from emission-rate credits. Petitioners argue that EPA failed to consider important aspects of the problem, such as limitations on enhanced oil recovery and compliance times for lignite coal-fired power plants. EPA maintains that its treatment of hydropower, nuclear plants, and waste-to-energy facilities is adequate, and its limitations on enhanced oil recovery are reasonable. The EPA's Clean Power Plan is being challenged by various entities, including Wyoming and Utah, for ignoring their unique circumstances. Petitioners argue that the final CPP deviated significantly from the proposal, limiting public input. Other issues raised include procedural aspects under the CAA and the Administrative Procedure Act. EPA promulgated a Rule without public comment, maintaining that the final CPP is a logical outgrowth of the proposal. Petitioners argue that EPA did not provide adequate notice, while amici curiae bring additional perspectives and facts to the court. The Pacific Legal Foundation and allies argue that EPA failed to make the required endangerment finding under CAA Section 111 and cannot rely on the 2009 endangerment finding for motor vehicles. They insist that EPA can only regulate GHGs through NAAQS under CAA Section 108. Groups representing seniors, minorities, and women also raise concerns about EPA's plans. Groups representing seniors, minorities, and women, along with 13 scientists and former officials, argue against EPA's plans for low-income communities, scientific conclusions on GHGs, and the Social Cost of Carbon analysis. They emphasize the importance of the CPP in global emission reductions and national security. The Union of Concerned Scientists also supports the CPP's role in worldwide efforts. The Union of Concerned Scientists, technology companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Apple, consumer brand companies, Christian and Jewish faith groups, and a group of 20 scientists all argue in support of the CPP, emphasizing its importance in global emission reductions and environmental protection. A group of 20 scientists and public health groups submitted briefs on the impacts of climate change, particularly in the United States, caused by fossil fuel combustion and utility sector carbon emissions. The briefs touch on legal, technical, and policy issues in the CPP litigation, with oral arguments held in September 2016. The court may take months to issue a decision, with the possibility of Supreme Court review. The D.C. Circuit may streamline the litigation process for the CPP rule challenge, leading to a faster Supreme Court review. 25 states, led by North Dakota and West Virginia, have filed petitions challenging EPA's final NSPS. The case is expected to reach the Supreme Court in 2017 or 2018. Several states, including Dakota and West Virginia, have filed petitions challenging EPA's final NSPS rule for CO2 from power plants under CAA Section 111(b). The petitions have been consolidated under the case North Dakota v. EPA, with various petitioners including a labor union, electric cooperatives, fossil-fuel companies, and industry groups. Key issues in the litigation include EPA's establishment of performance standards based on technologies. The primary issue is EPA's establishment of standards of performance for power plants based on technologies like carbon capture and storage. Critics argue that CCS technology is not yet commercially available or fully feasible, making it unreasonable for EPA to rely on it. EPA defends its Carbon Pollution Standards as reasonable and lawful, providing rationales for requiring partial CCS for new coal plants. EPA provided rationales for basing the standard for new coal plants on partial CCS, explaining technical configurations, operational flexibilities, feasibility, cost, and alternative compliance options. Petitions were filed seeking administrative reconsideration of the NSPS rule, which EPA denied in May 2016. The D.C. Circuit suspended the briefing schedule in the North Dakota v. EPA case in June 2016 to consolidate new lawsuits challenging EPA's denial of the petitions. The court issued a revised briefing schedule starting on October 13, 2016, with oral arguments scheduled for April 17, 2017. The court has scheduled oral arguments for April 17, 2017 in the North Dakota v. EPA case, which could impact the CPP regardless of the outcome of West Virginia v. EPA."
