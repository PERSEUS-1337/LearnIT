    "content": "Prior to 1867, Qatar was ruled by the Al Khalifa family of Bahrain. In 1867, the UK installed the Al Thani family to rule Qatar. The Al Thani family claims descent from the tribe of Banu Tamim and follows Wahhabism. In 1916, Qatar became a British protectorate. In 1971, Qatar considered joining the Trucial States to form a unified entity. The United Arab Emirates was formed in late 1971 with the union of seven emirates, excluding Qatar and Bahrain. Qatar became fully independent on September 1, 1971, and established its first written constitution in April 1970. The United States opened an embassy in Doha in 1973. Qatar is governed by a hereditary Amir, Shaykh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, who took power in June 2013. The last U.S. Ambassador to Qatar, Dana Shell Smith, resigned in June 2017. Mary Catherine Phee has been nominated as a replacement. The Amir of Qatar governs through a prime minister and a cabinet, many of whom are from the Al Thani family. Amir Tamim also serves as Minister of Defense, with his younger brother appointed as deputy Amir and heir apparent. Dissent within the Al Thani family exists, but there is no significant challenge to Tamim's rule. Qatar has not experienced significant protests, political parties are banned, and there is no well-defined opposition. Qatar's political system is characterized by a lack of political parties and opposition. The country's constitution, revised in 2003, maintains Qatar as a hereditary emirate and specifies Islamic law as the main source of legislation. Elections for the Advisory Council have been repeatedly delayed, limiting its powers. The elected Council in Qatar has been granted broader powers, including the ability to remove ministers with a two-thirds majority vote, approve a national budget, and draft and vote on proposed legislation that can become law with a two-thirds majority vote and concurrence by the Amir. In 2008, it was decided that naturalized Qataris who have been citizens for at least 10 years will be eligible to vote, and those whose fathers were born in Qatar can run for office. Qatar is the only GCC state, other than Saudi Arabia, that has not held elections for any legislative seats. The country does hold elections for a 29-seat Central Municipal Council, with the fourth Council elected in 2015. Voter registration and turnout numbers are low compared to the eligible voter population. The recent municipal council elections in Qatar had lower than expected voter turnout, with only 15,171 out of 21,735 registered voters participating. The State Department deemed the elections free and fair, but identified human rights issues such as restrictions on political freedoms and criminalization of same-sex activity in the country. The National Human Rights Committee, under the Qatar Foundation, investigates human rights abuses in the country. The NHRC, founded and led by Shaykha Moza, monitors stateless residents and new laws in Qatar restrict freedom of expression and increase penalties for criticizing the ruling establishment. In July 2017, Qatar held a national conference on freedom of expression where international human rights organizations criticized the country's human rights record. The government owns and funds Al Jazeera, a global media conglomerate featuring debates and criticism of Arab leaders. Some allege government influence on Al Jazeera content. There are calls for Al Jazeera's U.S. bureau to register under FARA. Social and legal discrimination against women continues in Qatar. Despite constitutional equality, social and legal discrimination against women persists in Qatar. Domestic violence is not specifically criminalized, and laws discriminate against certain women. However, women can drive, own property, and hold professional positions. They also serve in public office, including in high-ranking positions. In November 2017, four women were appointed to the national consultative council for the first time. Qatar has made efforts to combat trafficking, upgrading its ranking to Tier 2 in 2018. Despite improvements, it remains a destination for forced labor, especially for female domestic workers who are vulnerable due to lack of protection under labor laws. Qatar's labor laws do not adequately protect workers' rights, including the right to form unions and engage in collective bargaining. The General Union of Workers of Qatar is not functioning effectively. International scrutiny of Qatar's labor practices has increased due to preparations for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, with reports of unpaid wages and lack of dispute resolution. Some workers in Qatar report not being paid and facing issues with dispute resolution, leading to salary delays or nonpayment. Despite criticism from human rights groups, the State Department acknowledges Qatar's efforts to protect labor rights, including reforms such as allowing foreign workers to switch employers at the end of their contracts. The government is also funding housing sites to replace unsafe accommodations for expatriate workers and has increased arrests and prosecutions for labor law violations. Qatar's constitution designates Islam as the state religion and Islamic law as a main source of legislation, but also incorporates secular legal traditions. The law recognizes only Islam, Christianity, and Judaism. The majority of Qatari citizens are Sunni Muslims, with no signs of sectarian schisms. The government allows several Christian denominations to worship publicly and has permitted the construction of a church. Jews and followers of other religions can worship privately. Qatar allows Hindus, Buddhists, and Baha'is to worship privately but lacks authorized facilities for them. The government is open to creating dedicated worship spaces for Hindus, Jews, and Buddhists. Qatar engages in foreign policy with various regional actors, including Israel, Hamas, and Iran, while also hosting U.S. forces. Qatar's foreign policy involves hosting U.S. forces and mediating regional conflicts, but it has caused friction within the GCC due to its support for groups at odds with Saudi Arabia. Qatar also embraces Muslim Brotherhood movements, leading to further tensions within the GCC. In 2013-2014, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Bahrain withdrew their ambassadors from Qatar, accusing it of supporting \"terrorism.\" The Ambassadors returned in November 2014 after Qatar pledged to implement the Riyadh Agreement, committing to noninterference in GCC states' affairs and refraining from supporting Muslim Brotherhood-linked organizations. tensions resurfaced after President Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia in May 2017, leading to Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, Egypt, and other Muslim countries severing diplomatic ties with Qatar. In 2017, Saudi-led countries severed ties with Qatar, accusing it of supporting terrorism and Iran. They presented Qatar with demands to close Al Jazeera, cut ties with the Muslim Brotherhood, scale back relations with Iran, close a Turkish military base, and pay reparations. Qatar expressed willingness to negotiate but not surrender sovereignty. The demands were later reframed as six principles, including combating extremism, refraining from interference in other states' affairs, and complying with previous commitments. President Trump initially responded to the situation. President Trump initially responded to the crisis by echoing the Saudi-led criticism of Qatar's policies, but later sought to settle the rift. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson mediated the dispute with Kuwait through shuttle diplomacy in July 2017. President Trump facilitated a phone call between Amir Tamim and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman in September 2017, but subsequent efforts to resolve the rift have not been successful. Secretary of State Pompeo's visit to the Gulf states in January 2019 also did not yield any progress. Despite no evident movement and General Anthony Zinni resigning as envoy in early January 2019, there are signs that Saudi Arabia and the UAE may want to de-escalate the dispute with Qatar. Qatar asserts that blockading countries seek to change its leadership and might resort to military action. Saudi Arabia closed its Salwa border crossing into Qatar in December 2017 and is reportedly considering building a canal to physically separate their territories. Arabia is considering building a canal to separate its territory from Qatar, causing social disruptions. Qatar's wealth helps mitigate economic effects of the blockade. The dispute hinders the formation of a new Middle East Strategic Alliance to counter Iran and terrorism. The alliance, involving the US, GCC countries, and Sunni-led states, has been delayed due to global criticism of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for his possible role in the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Qatar's disputes with other GCC countries, including the involvement in the killing of journalist Jamal Kashoggi and Egypt's decision to not join the Alliance, have persisted despite resolving a territorial dispute with Bahrain in 2011. The International Court of Justice ruled in favor of Bahrain on the Hawar Islands but awarded Qatar ownership of the Fasht al-Dibal reef and the town of Zubara. Qatar accepted the ruling on the territorial dispute with Bahrain, which awarded two smaller islands to Qatar. Despite allegations of close relations with Iran, Qatar has helped counter Iran strategically by enforcing international sanctions. Qatar has participated in U.S.-GCC summits addressing concerns about the Iran nuclear agreement and has shown solidarity with Saudi Arabia on certain issues. Qatari leaders emphasize the importance of dialogue with Iran for reducing tensions. Qatar has maintained dialogue with Iran to reduce regional tensions, despite accusations of cheating on a shared gas field. In the 2017 GCC rift, Iran supported Qatar by providing food and airspace access, leading to the restoration of full diplomatic relations in August 2017. Qatar restored full diplomatic relations with Iran and did not support the U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA. Saudi Arabia cited Qatar's alleged support for pro-Iranian dissidents in Bahrain as a reason for isolating Qatar in 2017. Qatar's mediation efforts in Lebanon and financial support to Iraqi Shiite militia factions further fueled suspicions from Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Qatar provided hundreds of millions of dollars to release kidnapped Qatari citizens in Iraq. Qatar's support for the Muslim Brotherhood strained its relations with Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Qatar initially supported the ousting of Qadhafi in Libya but later backed Muslim Brotherhood-linked factions, causing tension with the UAE and Egypt. Qatar's support for Muslim Brotherhood-linked factions in Libya has caused tension with the UAE, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, contributing to the intra-GCC rift. In Yemen, Qatar joined the Saudi-led coalition against Iran-backed Houthi rebels, deploying military personnel and conducting airstrikes. Qatar withdrew from the Saudi-led military effort in Yemen in mid-2017 due to the intra-GCC rift. In Syria, Qatar provided funds and weaponry to rebels fighting against President Bashar Al Asad's regime, including ties to Al Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al Nusra. Qatar's involvement in Syria may now be irrelevant due to recent gains by the Asad regime. Qatar has not reopened its embassy in Damascus like Kuwait or Bahrain. Qatar's involvement in Syria includes providing funds and weaponry to rebels fighting against President Bashar Al Asad's regime. Qatar has not reopened its embassy in Damascus like Kuwait or Bahrain. Qatar withdrew from the Saudi-led military effort in Yemen in mid-2017. Qatar allowed 20,000 Syrians fleeing the civil war to retain residency in Qatar and is a member of the U.S.-led coalition combating the Islamic State. In 2014, Qatar flew airstrikes in Syria against Islamic State positions but was later not identified as a participant in coalition strikes. Qatar reportedly paid ransom to obtain the release of 26 Qatari ruling family members abducted by Iraqi Shia militiamen. Qatar has been involved in various regional affairs, including providing funds and weaponry to rebels in Syria. In an effort to exert influence in Lebanon, Qatar made a $500 million investment in government bonds. Qatar has also played a role in Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations by engaging all parties, including hosting Israeli officials in the past. Qatar's involvement in regional affairs includes supporting rebels in Syria and investing in Lebanon. The country has engaged in Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations, with small levels of trade between Israel and Qatar. Qatar's Amir Tamim supports Palestinian efforts for UN recognition and backs negotiations between Palestinians and Israel. Qatar also engages with Hamas to potentially broker reconciliation with the Palestinian Authority. U.S. officials have informed Congress that Qatar's influence over Hamas could help reduce conflict with Israel. Qatar has pledged that its aid to Palestinians does not support Hamas. Critics claim Qatar's ties with Hamas amount to backing a terrorist group. Legislation in the 115th Congress targeted Qatar for alleged support to Hamas. Qatar, like other Gulf states, has tried to offset reduced U.S. aid contributions. Qatar has donated $50 million to the U.N. Relief Works Agency and reached a two-year agreement with them. Qatari forces support U.S. operations in Afghanistan and have facilitated talks between the U.S. and Taliban. Qatar did not recognize the Taliban as the legitimate government of Kabul during their rule from 1996-2001. In 2013, Qatar closed a Taliban office for violating agreements with the U.S. In 2013, Qatar closed a Taliban office for violating agreements with the U.S. Taliban officials remained in Qatar and revived U.S.-Taliban talks, leading to the exchange of Bowe Bergdahl for five Taliban figures. The five were banned from traveling outside Qatar until an agreed solution was reached. In November 2018, the five joined the Taliban representative office in Doha. Since mid-2018, talks have taken place in Doha between Taliban negotiators and the U.S. envoy for Afghanistan. Qatar permitted the Taliban office in Qatar to formally reopen in 2015. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia Alice Wells met with Taliban figures from the office in Doha in July 2018 for discussions about a future peace settlement in Afghanistan. In January 2018, Qatar's air force completed the first two flights of its C-17 (Globemaster) cargo aircraft to Afghanistan, providing logistical support to the NATO \"counterterrorism\" campaign. Qatar has also played a role in mediating conflicts, including helping to release a Canadian hostage from the Haqqani Network in 2016. In 2010, Qatar brokered the Doha Agreements in Darfur region and signed a $4 billion investment deal with Sudan for the development of the Red Sea port of Suakin. Qatar has also established relationships with Central Asian countries like Turkmenistan and Tajikistan for energy and investment projects. Qatar has a strong defense and security relationship with the U.S. The U.S-Qatar defense relationship dates back to the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war, with Qatar being praised as a key military partner for peace and stability in the Middle East. The GCC, including Qatar, supported Iraq during the war despite political differences. Qatar has been a supporter of NATO's mission in Afghanistan and has maintained a strong defense and security relationship with the U.S. since then. During the Gulf War, Qatar participated in the U.S.-led coalition to expel Iraq from Kuwait in 1991. This involvement helped strengthen defense relations with the U.S., leading to a formal defense cooperation agreement. Despite being one of the wealthiest countries per capita, Qatar receives minimal U.S. military assistance. The intra-GCC rift has not impacted U.S. operations in the region. The United States and Qatar signed a defense cooperation agreement in 1992, renewed in 2013, allowing U.S. military access to Qatari facilities and deployment of troops for operations like Operation Inherent Resolve. Up to 13,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Qatar, mainly at Al Udeid air base. The U.S. Army component of U.S. Central Command prepositions armor at Camp As Sayliyah in Qatar, which was deployed in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Qatar has a small military force of about 12,000 personnel, with plans to expand in size and capacity according to General Votel's testimony in February 2018. Qatar is expanding its military size and capacity, investing billions in support of U.S. operations at Al Udeid air field. The State Department approved a $200 million equipment sale to upgrade the Air Operation Center. The Strategic Dialogue in January 2018 led to increased defense cooperation, with Qatar offering to fund capital expenditures for a potential enduring U.S. military presence. Qatar is enhancing Al Udeid Air Base to support a lasting U.S. presence. The expansion includes new housing units and improved facilities. A memorandum of understanding was signed to formalize Qatar's commitment to cover sustainment and infrastructure costs. Additionally, Qatar has extended Hamad Port to accommodate potential U.S. Navy operations. Qatar is increasing its use of U.S.-made equipment, with $25 billion in new Foreign Military Sales (FMS) cases and a projected $40 billion in the next five years. This has resulted in over 110,000 American jobs. Qatar's military currently includes French-made AMX-30 tanks and Mirage 2000 combat aircraft. Qatar's military currently has 18 combat aircraft, including 12 French-made Mirage 2000s. In 2013, Qatar requested to purchase 72 U.S.-made F-15s, with an estimated value of $21 billion. The sale was delayed due to concerns about Israel's Qualitative Military Edge. In 2017, an agreement was signed for 36 F-15 fighters. In December 2017, Qatar announced the purchase of 36 F-15s and signed agreements to buy French-made Rafale and British Typhoon combat aircraft. Previous sales to Qatar included Apache, Blackhawk, and Seahawk helicopters from the United States. Additionally, a sale of 5,000 Advanced Precision Kill Weapons Systems II Guidance Sections for Apache helicopters was approved in April 2018. Qatar purchased 5,000 Advanced Precision Kill Weapons Systems II Guidance Sections for its Apache fleet, valued at $300 million. The United States previously sold Qatar various short-range missile and rocket systems, including Hellfire air-to-ground missiles, Javelin guided missiles, HIMARS, ATACMS, and GMLRS, with a total estimated value of $665 million. Additionally, Qatar was notified of a potential sale of RIM-116C Rolling Airframe Tactical Missiles and Rolling Airframe Telemetry Missiles, valued at $260 million. Qatar has purchased various missile systems from the United States, including Telemetry Missiles, Javelin launch units, and National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems. They also displayed a newly purchased ballistic missile with a 120-mile range. Additionally, Qatar has bought Ballistic Missile Defense Systems from the U.S. to enhance their defense capabilities. In 2012, the United States sold Qatar Patriot Configuration 3 (PAC-3) fire units and missiles at an estimated value of nearly $10 billion. The United States also agreed to sell Qatar the Terminal High Altitude Area Air Defense (THAAD) system, but the sale has not been finalized due to budget difficulties and operational concerns. In February 2017, Raytheon sold Qatar an early warning radar system for $1.1 billion to enhance its missile defense capabilities. In December 2017, the Defense Department awarded Raytheon a $150 million contract to provide services and support for Qatar's PAC-3 system. In August 2016, Qatar was proposed a sale of U.S.-made Mk-V fast patrol boats worth $124 million. In August 2017, Qatar purchased multirole corvette ships, fast patrol missile ships, and an amphibious logistics ship from Italy for over $5 billion. Qatar aims to join NATO and has historically bought major combat systems from France. French Prime Minister Edouard Phillipe signed five agreements with Qatar's Defense and Interior Minister during his visit to Doha in March 2019. The agreements focused on defense information exchange, cooperation to combat cybercrime, and culture and education. Qatar's defense relationship with Turkey, including the presence of a Turkish military base in Qatar, has been a factor in resisting pressure from the Saudi-led bloc. Turkey has shown support for Qatar by sending additional troops and conducting joint exercises. Qatar has strengthened its relationship with Russia since early 2016, increasing investments in Russian companies like Rosneft and expanding cooperation in various sectors. The Qatari Amir has made multiple visits to Russia, with discussions including potential investments in Russian airports and defense systems. These developments have caused concern among Saudi-led states, with Saudi Arabia taking measures in response. Saudi-led states, particularly Saudi Arabia, are alarmed by Qatar's potential purchase of the S-400 system from Russia. Saudi officials have even threatened military action against Qatar and asked French President Macron to intervene. If Qatar proceeds with the purchase, it could face U.S. sanctions under Section 231 of the Countering America's Adversaries through Sanctions Act. This could result in restrictions on exports to Qatar, banking activities, property acquisition, and U.S. investments in Qatari sovereign debt. Qatar's cooperation with the United States on counterterrorism, including signing a Memorandum of Understanding in July 2017 and holding a Counterterrorism Dialogue in November 2017, has been noted positively. Qatar's foreign minister and then-Secretary Tillerson signed the MoU in Doha, which goes beyond combatting terrorism financing. The January 2018 Strategic Dialogue highlighted the progress made under the MoU and thanked Qatar for its efforts in countering terrorism. The U.S. and Qatar signed a memorandum of understanding on counterterrorism and cybercrime. Qatar issued a list of terrorists, held a conference with international experts, and participates in the Antiterrorism Assistance program. Qatar, through the Antiterrorism Assistance program, receives U.S. training and advice on border security. Despite limited manpower, Qatar uses high technology to address law enforcement gaps. Past support to Al Qaeda figures has been reported, but Qatar is taking steps to prevent terrorism financing and movement of suspected terrorists. Qatar is a member of MENAFATF and has implemented laws to combat terrorism financing, including the Cybercrime Prevention Law. The country also hosted a meeting of the Egmont Group and is part of the TFTC. Despite the GCC rift, Qatar has joined TFTC countries in efforts against terrorist financing. In 2017, Qatar joined the United States and other TFTC countries in designating terrorists affiliated with Al Qaeda and ISIS. The State Department's report highlighted Qatar's efforts to monitor and restrict the activities of Qatari charities involved in financing terrorism. Despite progress, terrorist financiers in Qatar can still exploit the informal financial system. The United States has imposed sanctions on individuals in Qatar for raising funds for terrorist groups. Qatar has been accused of individuals raising funds for Al Qaeda and ISIS. Despite efforts to counter violent extremism, experts have noted violations in allowing religious incitement. Qatar's Education City, established by the Qatar Foundation, aims to combat extremism through education. Qatar's economy has been impacted by the fall in world energy prices since mid-2014, leading to a slowdown in GCC economic growth. Despite being a member of OPEC, Qatar announced its withdrawal in 2018 to focus on natural gas exports. The decision was seen as influenced by the intra-GCC rift, with Saudi Arabia's dominance in OPEC being a factor. The impact of the June 2017 intra-GCC rift on Qatar is challenging to determine. Prior to the crisis, 40% of Qatar's food was imported from Saudi Arabia, leading to food shortages at the beginning of the blockade. However, Qatar quickly found alternative sources of goods from Turkey, Iran, and India due to its ample financial resources. The prohibition on Qatar Airways flying over blockading states has significantly affected the airline. Qatar's substantial financial cushion, totaling about $350 billion from the Qatar Investment Authority and Central Bank, has helped the country weather its financial demands. Qatar's investments include real estate and illiquid holdings like Canary Wharf. To raise funds, Qatar issued $9 billion in bonds in 2016 and $12 billion in 2018. The country has cut subsidies and is considering divesting overseas assets due to economic pressures. Despite the intra-GCC rift, Qatar still earns substantial funds from energy exports, with oil and gas accounting for 92% of export earnings and 56% of government revenues. Qatar has significant oil reserves enabling current production levels for over 50 years. It also has vast natural gas reserves, making it the world's third-largest producer. Qatar agreed to a modest oil production cut in 2016 as part of an OPEC-wide initiative. The country is the largest supplier of liquefied natural gas and hosts the Gas Exporting Countries Forum. Qatar, a major player in the global gas industry, is involved in various investments and projects. Qatar Petroleum, with a 70% stake, is expanding an LNG terminal in Texas for export. They also acquired a 30% stake in an Exxon-Mobil project in Argentina. Qatar is the gas source for the UAE's Dolphin Gas Project, connecting to Iran's South Pars Field. Qatar's gas industry provides leverage against the Saudi-led group, but Qatar refuses to reduce gas supplies to GCC states. Both UAE and Qatar filed complaints at the WTO over boycotting each other's goods. Qatar ran its first budget deficit in 2016 due to falling hydrocarbon export prices. Qatari leaders aim to diversify the economy, reduce benefits, and operate more efficiently while minimizing the impact on citizens. The national development strategy in Qatar from 2011 to 2016 focused on infrastructure projects to promote economic diversification and prepare for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. This led to a construction boom in Doha, with reports of government capacity and funding challenges. A metro transportation system is also under construction. In April 2004, the United States and Qatar signed a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA). Qatar has made large investments in the United States, including the City Center project in Washington, DC. U.S. universities and institutions have branches in Qatar. Qatar donated $100 million to Hurricane Katrina victims in 2005. The U.S.-Qatar Strategic Dialogue in January 2018 recognized QIA's commitment of $45 billion in future investments in U.S. companies and real estate. According to the U.S. Census Bureau's \"Foreign Trade Statistics,\" the United States exported $4.9 billion in goods to Qatar in 2016, with imports of $1.16 billion worth of Qatari goods. In 2017, U.S. exports to Qatar decreased by 40%, but imports remained steady. By 2018, U.S. exports rebounded to $4.4 billion, mainly consisting of aircraft, machinery, and information technology. Qatar's main exports to the U.S. are petroleum products, with Qatar Airways being a major buyer of U.S. commercial aircraft. In October 2016, Qatar Airways agreed to purchase up to 100 passenger jets from Boeing with an estimated value of $18 billion. Some U.S. airlines challenged Qatar Airways' benefits under a U.S.-Qatar \"open skies\" agreement due to alleged government subsidies. The U.S. and Qatar reached understandings on civil aviation in January 2018, including commitments to financial transparency and limitations on picking up passengers in Europe for flights to the United States. Qatar Airways' 2018 purchase of Air Italy may violate limitations on picking up passengers in Europe for flights to the United States. Qatar, one of the wealthiest countries per capita, receives minimal U.S. assistance, with most funds allocated to counternarcotics programs."
