    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Big Cats and Public Safety Protection Act\". Congress finds that the global illicit trade in wildlife is valued at up to $20 billion annually, with legal wildlife trade in the United States estimated at $2.8 billion annually. The illegal trade in prohibited wildlife species stimulates demand and expands illegal markets. Private possession, breeding, and sale of prohibited wildlife species have a detrimental effect on the health and welfare of the people in the United States and on species conservation. Private possession and breeding of prohibited wildlife species have a significant impact on interstate commerce, as these species are often used in public exhibitions, sold in the exotic pet trade, and transported across state lines. This activity also contributes to the illegal international wildlife trade, as prohibited species are difficult to control and differentiate once in private possession. Federal control of intrastate private possession and breeding of prohibited wildlife species is crucial for effectively regulating interstate trafficking. The US is a party to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, aimed at protecting species from overexploitation through international trade. SEC. 3.
