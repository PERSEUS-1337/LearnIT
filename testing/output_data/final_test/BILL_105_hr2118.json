    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Ban on Smoking in Federal Buildings Act\". Congress acknowledges that environmental tobacco smoke is a significant health concern, causing lung cancer and respiratory issues in nonsmokers. This smoke originates from secondhand smoke exhaled by smokers and sidestream smoke from burning tobacco products. With Americans spending most of their time indoors, there is a high risk of exposure to this smoke in public buildings. The health risks associated with environmental tobacco smoke are greater than those posed by many EPA-regulated pollutants. SEC. 3. Smoking prohibition in federal buildings. Smoking is prohibited in indoor areas of Federal buildings, with regulations enforced by the Administrator of General Services for Executive branch buildings and by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts for Judicial branch buildings. The House Office Building Commission and the Committee on Rules and Administration of the Senate are responsible for enforcing smoking prohibitions in Federal buildings used by the House of Representatives and Senate, respectively. The Architect of the Capitol oversees enforcement in other establishments. The Architect of the Capitol enforces smoking prohibitions in Federal buildings used by establishments in the legislative branch, excluding the House of Representatives and the Senate. SEC. 4 of the Act clarifies that it does not override any stricter state or local laws. SEC. 5 provides definitions. For the purposes of this Act, definitions include: Executive agency, Federal agency, Federal building, and Military installation. The term \"military installation\" refers to facilities under the Department of Defense's jurisdiction, such as bases, camps, and stations, excluding those used primarily for civil works."
