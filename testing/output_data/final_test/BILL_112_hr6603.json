    "content": "The Act titled \"Tapping America's Energy Potential through Research and Development Act of 2012\" authorizes research, development, and demonstration activities to increase energy security and affordability by enabling safe production of domestic unconventional oil and gas resources. The Secretary may provide grants, agreements, contracts, or assistance to eligible entities through a competitive selection process. The Act authorizes research, development, and demonstration activities to facilitate commercial application of energy technologies related to oil shale resources. Objectives include addressing technological barriers for economically feasible production and minimizing environmental impacts. The Secretary must submit a program implementation plan to relevant committees within 9 months of enactment. The Assistant Secretary is tasked with developing a program implementation plan for oil shale development, including identifying constraints, opportunities, strategies, and research priorities. Consultation with stakeholders is required. Research, development, and demonstration activities may include oil shale resource characterization and modeling of exploration and production technologies. The development of oil shale production technologies focuses on advanced diagnostics, imaging systems, computing applications, water minimization, efficient energy use, and environmental impact reduction. The Secretary will provide a report on the progress of improved mining methods to the House and Senate committees. $10,000,000 is authorized for activities from 2013 to 2017. The Shale Extraction Research and Development Activities are outlined in Section 4 of the legislation. The Secretary will conduct research, development, and demonstration activities to promote energy technologies for shale oil and gas production. Objectives include maximizing benefits, minimizing surface impacts, focusing on public and industry benefits, and advancing scientific foundations. The Assistant Secretary may conduct research and make awards for activities related to water use and sourcing in shale oil and natural gas operations. This includes exploring ways to reduce water volume and find alternative materials for operations. The Assistant Secretary may conduct research and make awards for activities related to water use and sourcing in shale oil and natural gas operations, including alternatives to groundwater, materials used in operations, and improving efficiency and understanding of additives. Authorization of Appropriations: $12,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2013 through 2015 is authorized for activities related to water use and sourcing in shale oil and natural gas operations, including research on proppants, diagnostic imaging, and monitoring technologies for fracture movements. The Produced Water Utilization Research and Development Activities are outlined in Section 5 of the legislation. The Secretary will conduct research, development, and demonstration activities to promote the use of produced water for various sustainable purposes. This includes research on desalination and demineralization to reduce total dissolved solids in produced water, as well as its utilization for agricultural purposes. The Secretary will conduct research on utilizing produced water for sustainable purposes such as agricultural, power generation, and re-injection into geological formations. $5,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2013 through 2017. Eligible entities for grants under this Act include institutions of higher education, National laboratories, private sector entities, nonprofit organizations, and consortia of these entities. The Secretary may enter agreements with consortia experienced in research and development for unconventional natural gas and petroleum production. Coordination is emphasized in carrying out the Act's activities. SEC. 8. COORDINATION. The Secretary must coordinate activities under this Act with other government programs. SEC. 9. COST SHARING. Activities must follow cost-sharing guidelines. SEC. 10. LIMITATIONS. Activities are limited to technology areas industry won't undertake alone. SEC. 11. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, key definitions include Assistant Secretary, institution of higher education, National laboratory, oil shale, and produced water. These definitions clarify terms used throughout the Act. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy. \"Shale oil and natural gas\" includes oil, natural gas, and other liquid resources from shale formations."
