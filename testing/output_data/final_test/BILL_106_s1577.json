    "content": "The \"Broadcast Ownership Reform Act of 1999\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. The findings section follows. The Congress finds that the electronic mass media market offers consumers various sources of news, information, and entertainment, which are converging and proliferating due to digital technology. This convergence makes technology-specific regulation outdated, requiring the Federal Communications Commission to reexamine its regulations to ensure relevance. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 recognizes the need for the FCC to periodically review its broadcast ownership rules in light of the proliferation of electronic media sources. The Commission has revised some rules but has not completed reviews of national television station ownership restrictions or newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership prohibition. This failure to address all pending cross-ownership rules overlooks the changing media landscape. The FCC's failure to address all pending broadcast cross-ownership rules overlooks the changing media landscape, affecting potential buyers and sellers of radio and television stations. The FCC's treatment of national television ownership and newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership restrictions is deemed arbitrary and capricious, lacking consideration for entities affected by outdated ownership rules. The increase in the national television audience reach limitation to 35 percent under the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was not justified as the maximum percentage in the public interest. The FCC is directed to review its broadcast ownership rules biennially. Ownership rules, including those under section 202 of the Act, are deemed necessary in the public interest due to competition. The 35-percent national television audience reach limit and newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership restriction are seen as overly restrictive in light of competition. The FCC's failure to address these issues simultaneously with other ownership rules does not serve the public interest. The Federal Communications Commission will increase the national television audience reach limitation to 50 percent and may further increase it if deemed in the public interest. The newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule will cease to be in effect after December 31, 1999, unless reinstated by the Commission before January 1, 2000."
