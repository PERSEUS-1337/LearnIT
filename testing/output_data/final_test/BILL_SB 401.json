    "title": "SB 401",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 1516 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to allow crisis nurseries to operate a crisis residential overnight program and provide crisis day services. Crisis nurseries must be organized and operated on a nonprofit basis. Facilities licensed before January 1, 2004, as group homes for children under six years old can retain their capacity if issued a crisis nursery license. Crisis nurseries must collect and maintain information on children placed in the program, including length of stay, reasons for use, and age. They can provide crisis day services for children under six years old for up to 30 days in a six-month period, with a maximum of 12 hours per day. Exceptions can be granted by the department for additional services. The department must respond to exception requests within five working days and can grant up to two exceptions per child in a six-month period for crisis day services. A crisis nursery license is issued for a specific capacity determined by the department, with a maximum licensed capacity based on indoor activity space per child. Outdoor activity space for children in crisis residential overnight programs must be at least 75 square feet per child, excluding swimming pools and hazards. The maximum capacity for such programs is 14 children, and voluntary placements count towards licensed capacity for crisis day services. Exceptions to group home licensing regulations apply to emergency shelter care facilities for children under six years old for up to 30 days. Crisis day services provide temporary, nonmedical care for children under six years old during family crises for up to 14 hours a day. Children can stay for a maximum of 30 days or 360 hours in a six-month period unless an exception is granted by the department. Sleeping arrangements must be available after 7 p.m. The \"crisis residential overnight program\" offers short-term, 24-hour nonmedical care for children under six years old in family crises for up to 30 days. Children must be voluntarily placed by a parent or legal guardian and not in foster care. A child day care facility in an office building is exempt from meeting indoor activity space requirements for child care centers."
