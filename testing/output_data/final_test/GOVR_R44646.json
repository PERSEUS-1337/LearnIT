    "content": "Water quality standards are crucial components of the Clean Water Act, established by states and approved by the EPA. They set goals for water quality, dictate discharge permits, identify impaired waters, and establish Total Maximum Daily Loads. These standards include limits on pollutants, designated uses for waterbodies, and policies for maintaining existing uses and high-quality waters. EPA develops risk-based criteria to ensure public health. The EPA develops water quality criteria to protect aquatic life and human health from contaminants in water. The criteria are recommendations to states and are not automatically enforceable. States use the EPA criteria as a starting point for developing their own water quality standards. EPA updated human health water quality criteria in 2015, including revisions to existing criteria and recommendations for 122 pollutants. States use EPA's water quality criteria as a basis for developing their own standards, which must protect waterbody uses and be scientifically justified. If states deviate from EPA's criteria, they must explain their rationale. EPA can issue federal criteria if needed, which become the state's standards until EPA approves revised criteria. EPA also sets discharge permit limits to ensure compliance with water quality standards. The EPA approves the state's revised water quality criteria and withdraws federally promulgated standards. Setting federal water quality standards has been controversial, with a focus on managing risks from chemicals released into the environment to protect human health. Human health criteria ensure pollutants in water are at safe levels for consumption. The EPA's water quality criteria ensure pollutants in water are safe for consumption by considering risk-specific toxicity and exposure factors. The 2015 update reflects revised standard exposure inputs, including a default body weight of 80 kilograms for adults and a drinking water consumption rate of 2.4 liters per day. The EPA's water quality criteria consider exposure factors like body weight, drinking water consumption rate, and fish consumption rate to determine risk levels. Fish consumption rates are crucial in assessing the risk of developing illnesses from toxic pollutants, with higher consumption increasing the risk. Indian tribes, who consume more fish than average, are particularly affected by these factors. Some argue that water quality standards should consider the fish consumption rates (FCRs) of certain subpopulations, like Native Americans, due to cultural significance. Regulatory agencies acknowledge cancer risk even at low exposure levels, with chronic exposure increasing the likelihood of developing cancer. This increased likelihood is known as incremental excess lifetime cancer risk. The EPA calculates human health criteria for carcinogenic effects based on incremental excess lifetime cancer risk, aiming to find an acceptable level of risk for most people. The risk management decision often involves selecting a threshold probability of cancer, with risks below one in one million considered acceptable. EPA's methodology for assessing carcinogenic risks is crucial in environmental regulations. EPA recommends cancer risk levels of 10^-5 or 10^-6 to protect the general population, with states able to choose more stringent levels like 10^-7. Highly exposed populations should not exceed a 10^-4 risk level. States have flexibility to determine risk levels in water quality standards under the CWA. The CWA requires states and tribes to review and revise water quality standards every three years. EPA encourages states to develop criteria to protect highly exposed populations, using local data on FCRs. Recent controversies involve disputes over FCR and cancer risk levels in water quality criteria development. Oregon revised its water quality standards in 2011 based on higher fish consumption rates than previously accounted for, leading to more stringent criteria for protecting the general population and high-consuming subpopulations. EPA raised concerns about the initial criteria, prompting the state to make adjustments. Oregon revised its water quality standards in 2011 to account for higher fish consumption rates, leading to more stringent criteria. Washington State also began work on revised standards in 2013 to reflect updated science and policy. EPA approved Oregon's revised standards, but evidence on how it affects discharge permit limits is limited. Washington State attempted to develop human health criteria based on an FCR of 175 g/d and a cancer risk level of 10-5, but EPA indicated it would disapprove due to the less protective cancer risk level. EPA proposed federal water quality standards for Washington with more protective human health criteria in September 2015. Washington State revised its human health criteria in 2016 to align with EPA's recommendations, incorporating changes for FCR and cancer risk levels. In contrast, Idaho faced EPA disapproval in 2012 for not adequately protecting its residents with outdated criteria. Idaho notified EPA of its intention to revise human health criteria for toxic pollutants in 2012. Based on surveys, Idaho chose an FCR of 66.5 g/d and a 10-5 cancer risk level. EPA expressed concern about Idaho's actions and announced plans to propose human health criteria for Idaho's waters in 2016. EPA also proposed federal water quality standards for certain waters in Maine in April 2016. Maine's water quality standards were partially approved and partially disapproved by EPA in response to a court order. EPA's disapprovals were based on the criteria not adequately protecting all designated uses, including sustenance fishing in tribal waters. Maine disagrees with EPA's decision and refuses to revise its standards. EPA's proposed federal criteria assume a higher fish consumption rate than Maine's standards. In April 2016, federal criteria proposed an FCR of 286 g/d, with both Maine's and EPA's standards including a cancer risk level of 10^-6. States can incorporate various tools in their water quality standards for flexibility, such as time-limited variances and intake credits. These tools are seen as necessary for implementing stringent criteria. EPA regulations acknowledge the importance of variances, intake credits, and other processes for compliance. The EPA disapproves state mechanisms that do not meet CWA requirements, leading to controversies. EPA prefers collaborative work with states to adopt water quality standards. Critics, including affected states and organizations, have raised concerns about EPA's actions. The National Association of Clean Water Administrators (NACWA) criticized EPA's tactics of influence and intimidation regarding water quality criteria. NACWA observed that states have often succumbed to pressure from EPA to make revisions to their rules. Critics argue that EPA's recommended national human health criteria are based on extreme assumptions, leading to compounded conservatism. They claim that EPA's criteria assume unrealistic scenarios, such as everyone in the US consuming contaminated water and fish at the criteria level daily. Less than 1% of the population is estimated to fit these criteria. Critics argue that EPA's recommended national human health criteria are overly conservative, with less than 1% of the population meeting these criteria. Stakeholders, including environmental advocates and tribal organizations, believe that the criteria are underprotective, especially for highly exposed populations. They criticize EPA for not intervening promptly when states fail to meet Clean Water Act requirements. EPA faces legal challenges from states for not meeting Clean Water Act requirements. For example, a coalition sued EPA for not promulgating water quality standards for Washington State within the required timeframe. The court directed EPA to act by specific deadlines to protect public and environmental health. EPA's mission is to prevent underestimation of risks. EPA aims to protect public and environmental health by taking a more \"protective\" stance in developing human health criteria based on science and policies. The agency ensures state water quality standards meet the Clean Water Act's requirements and considers concerns over criteria not being sufficiently protective of tribal treaty fishing rights. Native American tribes have historically insisted on maintaining their fishing rights, which are crucial for food, trade, and cultural significance. EPA must consider tribal fishing rights as they hold the same legal force as federal statutes under the U.S. Constitution. The agency recognizes the importance of respecting tribal treaty rights when approving water quality standards, as seen in the 2015 proposal for federal water quality standards in Washington State. EPA recognizes tribal treaty-reserved fishing rights in Washington State and proposes to consider tribal population as target for deriving protective criteria. Tribal organizations advocate for stringent human health criteria in water quality standards. Analyst estimates 10 states with similar treaties and 40 states with tribes. In total, 40 states are home to tribes with treaties, suggesting water quality standards controversies could arise elsewhere. Industries challenge EPA's authority in developing CWA human health criteria, advocating for more flexibility in the agency's rules. EPA recommends a cancer risk level of 10 -6 for both general population and highly exposed individuals. States are urged to use a 10 -6 risk level for water quality standards to protect all populations, including highly exposed groups. Environmental advocates and Native American organizations call for more EPA intervention to ensure standards are protective. States aim to balance public health protection with business flexibility and uphold their role under the CWA. Many in Congress have been critical of perceived EPA overreach in regulatory areas. Legislation to limit EPA's involvement in state water quality standards has been introduced in the past, but similar bills have not been introduced in the current Congress."
