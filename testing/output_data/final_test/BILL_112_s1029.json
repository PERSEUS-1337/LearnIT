    "content": "The Act is known as the \"Electric Consumer Right to Know Act\" or the \"e-KNOW Act\". The \"Electric Consumer Right to Know Act\" emphasizes consumers' access to electric energy usage information for effective management, regardless of smart metering technology. Utilities must provide usage information based on current metering technology capabilities or upgrade to National Institute of Standards and Technology standards. The Electric Consumer Right to Know Act highlights consumers' rights to access and control their electric energy usage information, ensuring privacy and security when third-party aggregators are involved. Consumers should be able to access unaudited usage information directly from electric meters or independent sources, and know how authorized third-party data managers handle their information. Authorized third-party data managers will handle consumers' retail electric energy information once accessed. Electric consumers have the right to access electric energy information under SEC. 215 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978. The term 'retail electric energy information' includes consumption, prices, costs, and additional data recorded by nonresidential electric meters. A smart meter records electric consumption data in intervals of 1 hour or less and can transmit this information to the utility. Electric consumers in the US have the right to access this data. States have the right to access retail electric energy information of consumers in electronic form, conforming to open standards, and ensuring security and privacy. Consumers with smart meters can also access their energy usage data. The consumer has the right to access usage information from their smart meter in read-only format, either directly from the electric utility or another designated entity. This includes access to retail electric energy information in machine-readable form within 48 hours of consumption. The consumer has the right to access retail electric energy information in machine-readable form as soon as possible after consumption, either through a smart meter or through a designated entity. The data must be provided at a granularity that is not less than the intervals at which it is recorded and stored by the billing meter at the consumer's premise. The consumer has the right to access retail electric energy information through the website of the electric utility or other electronic access authorized by the consumer for at least 13 months after the date of usage. The consumer has the right to access retail electric energy information through the website of the electric utility or other electronic access authorized by the consumer for at least 13 months after the date of usage. Access to data shall not compromise security or privacy, and the utility can recover reasonable costs for providing the information. The right to access electric energy information includes usage data. The Commission will issue guidelines for electric consumer access to retail electric energy information within 180 days of enactment, setting national standards for implementation. This includes data generated by consumer devices transmitted to the electric utility. The Commission will issue guidelines within 180 days for consumer access to retail electric energy information, guided by State and local actions. The guidelines will cover timeliness, data standards, smart meters definition, and data security. The Commission will periodically review and revise guidelines for data security, consumer privacy, and consumer consent in the electric energy market. State attorneys general can enforce compliance with minimum standards through civil actions. The State, acting as parens patriae, can sue an electric utility in federal court to ensure compliance with standards on behalf of consumers. No lawsuit can be filed if the utility has met the standards set by the Commission in the past 2 years. The Commission will establish procedures to review utility policies for compliance. The Commission will establish procedures to review electric utilities' policies, requirements, and measures for compliance with standards. This subsection takes effect 2 years after the issuance of guidelines under subsection (h). A conforming amendment is made to the table of contents for the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978. \"Sec. 215. Electric consumer right to access electric energy information.\""
