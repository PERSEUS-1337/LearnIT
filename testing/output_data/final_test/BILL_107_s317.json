The Attorney General can provide grants to State or local prosecutors for drug treatment alternative to prison programs. The funds can be used for program operation expenses and payments to substance abuse treatment providers. The grant program includes aftercare supervision, vocational training, education, and job placement. Payments are made to public and nonprofit entities for providing treatment to offenders in the program. The Federal share of the grant cannot exceed 75% of the program cost.

Payments are made to public and nonprofit entities for providing treatment to offenders in the program. The Federal share of the grant cannot exceed 75% of the program cost. Grant amounts should supplement, not supplant, non-Federal funds for program activities. SEC. 2702 outlines program requirements. A drug treatment program funded by a grant must be administered by a State or local prosecutor. Eligible offenders can only participate with the prosecutor's consent and will be sentenced to a long-term, drug-free residential treatment facility instead of prison. Failure to complete treatment will result in imprisonment for the underlying crime. The residential substance abuse provider must report the progress of treatment to the prosecutor and court. An enforcement unit of law enforcement officers will ensure compliance with the program. The duties of the local prosecutor in the program include verifying offender's information, locating and apprehending absconded offenders, and returning them to court for sentencing. To apply for a grant under this part, a State or local prosecutor must submit an application to the Attorney General with required information. The Attorney General will ensure equitable distribution of grant awards to prosecutors in all states and jurisdictions. Additionally, reports and evaluations are required for the program. Each recipient of a grant under this part must submit a report to the Attorney General each fiscal year evaluating the effectiveness of activities funded by the grant. The report must contain information specified by the Attorney General, and submission dates will be specified. \"In this part, an eligible offender is defined as an individual who has not completed a required sentence of imprisonment, has no felony convictions for violent crimes or major drug offenses, and has been identified as needing substance abuse treatment by a professional screener.\" The curr_chunk discusses the definitions of terms related to criminal conduct, felony crimes of violence, major drug offenses, and state or local prosecutors. It also amends the authorization of appropriations for the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Street Act of 1968. The Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Street Act of 1968 is amended to authorize appropriations for fiscal years 2002 to 2006, with increasing amounts allocated each year."
