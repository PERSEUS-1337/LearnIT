College counselors report that 8.5 percent of students sought counseling in the past year, totaling 1,600,000 students. Over 90 percent of counseling directors note an increase in students with severe psychological problems, leading to concerns about growing demand without additional resources. A 2008 survey found that 43% of college students felt depressed, with 1 in 11 considering suicide. Research from 1989 to 2002 showed a significant increase in students seeking help for anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts. Many students in need of help do not receive it, as only 22% of those who committed suicide were counseling center clients. A survey by the University of Idaho Student Counseling Center in 2000 revealed that 77% of students credited counseling for helping them stay in school and maintain their academic performance. Additionally, a 6-year study on college students found that personal and emotional adjustment played a crucial role in retention and predicted attrition better than academic adjustment.
