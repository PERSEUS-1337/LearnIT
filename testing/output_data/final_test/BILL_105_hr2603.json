    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Alternative Dispute Resolution and Settlement Encouragement Act\". Arbitration in District Courts is addressed in the Act. The \"Alternative Dispute Resolution and Settlement Encouragement Act\" amends Section 905 of the Judicial Improvements and Access to Justice Act to remove specific fiscal year references. It also mandates that each United States district court must authorize arbitration in civil actions and bankruptcy proceedings through local rules. The text chunk discusses amendments to various sections of title 28, United States Code, related to arbitration. It includes changes to monetary amounts and certification requirements for arbitrators. Additionally, a conforming amendment is made to the Judicial Improvements and Access to Justice Act. The Judicial Improvements and Access to Justice Act (28 U.S.C. 652 note) is amended by striking subsection (c). SEC. 3. AWARD OF REASONABLE COSTS AND ATTORNEY'S FEES IN FEDERAL CIVIL DIVERSITY LITIGATION AFTER AN OFFER OF SETTLEMENT. Section 1332 of title 28, United States Code, allows parties in a court action to make written settlement offers at least 10 days before trial. If the offer is accepted, either party can file a notice of acceptance with the court. The court allows parties to make settlement offers under Section 1332 of title 28, United States Code. If an offer is not accepted, a subsequent offer can be made. The court may exempt claims that are novel and important from this rule. If offers are not accepted, they have no effect on the final judgment. If a settlement offer under Section 1332 of title 28, United States Code is not accepted and the final judgment is not more favorable to the offeree than the last offer, the offeror can petition for payment of costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees. The court may order the offeree to pay the offeror's costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees, if the final judgment is not more favorable than the last offer, unless it would be manifestly unjust. Attorney's fees should be reasonable and based on the attorney's qualifications, experience, and the complexity of the case. The offeree may be required to pay the offeror's costs and attorneys' fees if the final judgment is not better than the last offer. Attorney's fees must be reasonable and based on qualifications, experience, and case complexity. The offeree's attorney's fees for services related to the claim must be either the actual cost incurred or a reasonable noncontingent fee. This provision does not apply to claims seeking equitable remedies. Section 2 amendments take effect upon enactment. Section 3 amendments take effect 180 days after enactment for civil actions commenced after that date."
