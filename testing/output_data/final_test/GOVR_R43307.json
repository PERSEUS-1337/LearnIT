    "content": "Native Americans on reservations face poor housing conditions due to low income and unique challenges like trust land issues. Federal housing programs were created in the 1960s to address these specific needs. In 1996, Congress passed the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act (NAHASDA), reorganizing federal housing assistance programs for Native Americans into a single block grant program. This law focused on self-determination for tribes, giving them authority to choose how to use affordable housing funds. The block grant program provides funding for affordable housing activities benefiting low-income Native Americans in tribal areas. Another block grant program, established later, offers funding for housing for low-income Native Hawaiians eligible to live on the Hawaiian Home. The Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act (NAHASDA) provides housing assistance for low-income Native Americans and Native Hawaiians. It includes programs such as the Native American Housing Block Grant, Title VI Loan Guarantee Program, and Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grant, as well as funding for training and technical assistance. The act aims to empower tribes and Alaska Native villages to access financing for affordable housing activities. Many tribes and Alaska Native villages in the United States vary in size, population, geography, and culture. Reservations range from very large to quite small, with some tribes not having reservations at all. Over 5 million individuals identified as American Indian or Alaska Natives in 2010, with nearly 3 million identifying solely as such. Some reservations are in remote rural areas, while others are closer to urban areas. Not all who identify as AIAN are members of federally recognized tribes. This report focuses on the federal housing program for members of federally recognized tribes and Alaska Native villages living on tribal lands or nearby areas. Not all individuals who identify as AIAN are enrolled members of any tribe, and some may belong to state or other unrecognized tribes. About one-third of AIAN individuals lived in tribal areas in 2010, while those not in tribal areas may still be eligible for federal housing programs. The federal government's unique relationship with federally recognized tribes has implications for Native American housing programs. Tribal lands' restricted legal status affects housing financing in these areas. Housing conditions in tribal areas are generally worse than in other areas, with varying economic conditions and housing quality by tribe. The federal government has a trust responsibility to provide for the needs of federally recognized Native American tribes, established through treaties and affirmed through laws, court decisions, and executive orders. This responsibility has led to federal programs that offer funds and services specifically for Native American tribal members. The federal government's responsibility to provide services to tribes and tribes' right to govern their own affairs can conflict. Tribal leaders are concerned that federal agencies administering funding undermines tribal sovereignty. In the 1970s, federal policy shifted towards self-determination, recognizing tribes' sovereignty and giving them authority over their affairs. The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975 allows tribes to contract for services and administer their own education. The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975 allowed tribes to provide services previously offered by the federal government and manage their education programs, marking a significant move towards self-determination in federal programs for Native Americans. Tribal land, held in trust by the government, presents challenges for housing due to restrictions on alienation and encumbrance. Trust land, whether held in trust or restricted fee status, cannot be transferred, leased, or used as collateral for a mortgage without approval from the Bureau of Indian Affairs. This poses challenges for mortgage lending on tribal lands, leading to loans often involving long-term leases as collateral instead. Obtaining a mortgage on tribal lands can be challenging due to the need for Bureau of Indian Affairs approval for long-term leases as collateral. Tribal laws, not state or federal laws, govern these lands, impacting foreclosure and eviction procedures. This can deter banks from offering loans on tribal lands. Housing conditions on tribal lands vary widely, with Native Americans facing severe challenges such as overcrowding and substandard housing. Limited private financing, due to banks' concerns about tribal laws and foreclosure procedures, hinders access to capital for home purchases and development. Economic factors also contribute to poor housing conditions in tribal areas. The economic challenges faced by Native Americans on tribal lands contribute to substandard housing conditions. Limited access to capital for home purchases and development, along with the remoteness of some reservations, raises the cost of housing construction. Prior to the enactment of NAHASDA, studies highlighted the persistent need for decent housing on tribal lands. Since NAHASDA was enacted in 1996, there has been a positive impact on addressing housing needs in tribal areas, although poor housing conditions still prevail. A study found that 28% of Native Americans in tribal areas lacked adequate housing, with 40% experiencing inadequate conditions overall. Despite improvements, some tribes still face severe housing challenges. According to a 2010 Census analysis by the Housing Assistance Council, housing conditions on tribal lands are particularly severe, with 5% lacking plumbing and kitchen facilities, and 8% being overcrowded. Tribal officials and policymakers often highlight the extremely poor housing conditions experienced by many tribes. The federal government has established programs targeting housing on Native American lands due to the special trust relationship between the government and tribes. The federal government has a long-standing policy of promoting access to decent and affordable housing for all Americans. However, Native Americans living on reservations had little access to affordable housing programs until the early 1960s when the government began to provide funding specifically for Native Americans. Tribal governments were first recognized as eligible to receive housing assistance in 1961. In 1961, tribal governments were recognized as eligible for housing funding under the public housing program. This allowed tribes to establish Indian housing authorities to administer federal housing assistance programs. The Mutual Help Homeownership Opportunity Program was established in 1962 to help Native Americans achieve home ownership. These programs, administered by HUD, provided the bulk of housing assistance until NAHASDA reorganized federal housing programs. In 1965, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) established the Housing Improvement Program (HIP) to assist the least well-off Native Americans with repairing severely inadequate housing. The BIA was authorized to establish various assistance programs for Native Americans by the Snyder Act of 1921, but it did not create a specific housing program until HIP. In the mid-1970s, the government recognized the need for unique housing programs for tribal areas due to the ineffectiveness of extending existing programs. Despite the availability of affordable housing programs in tribal areas, poor housing conditions persisted. In 1978, a report from the General Accounting Office (GAO) highlighted the inefficiency of existing programs in providing an adequate number of housing units for Native Americans. Federal agencies started tailoring housing programs to better suit the specific needs of Native Americans living in tribal areas, leading to the creation of HUD's Office of Indian Housing. In 1976, HUD established the Office of Indian Housing to manage Native American housing programs separately from public housing. Federal efforts to improve housing conditions in tribal areas continued in the 1980s and 1990s, including the authorization of a program by Congress in 1983 to insure home mortgages on tribal lands. The Indian Housing Act of 1988 further separated Native American housing assistance from public housing programs. In the early 1990s, Congress authorized the Section 184 program to encourage mortgage lending on tribal lands. Tribes were eligible for funding through various HUD programs, including Mutual Help and the Indian public housing program. In the early 1990s, Congress authorized the Section 184 program to promote mortgage lending on tribal lands. Tribes were eligible for funding through HUD programs, but these were considered inadequate. In 1996, the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act (NAHASDA) was enacted to consolidate federal housing funding into a block grant for eligible tribes based on a formula, recognizing tribal self-determination. President Clinton signed NAHASDA into law in 1996. The Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act (NAHASDA) reorganized federal housing assistance for Native Americans into a block grant program, the Native American Housing Block Grant (NAHBG). This grant allowed tribes to receive funds for affordable housing activities, removing their ability to access funds from other HUD programs like public housing and Section 8. The Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act (NAHASDA) reorganized federal housing assistance for Native Americans into a block grant program, providing flexibility for tribes to use funds for housing needs. NAHASDA also established a loan guarantee program and authorized funding for technical assistance. It has been amended and reauthorized twice since its enactment. The Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act (NAHASDA) was reauthorized in 2002 and 2008. The most recent authorization expired in FY2013, with the exception of the Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grant in FY2005. Reauthorization efforts were made in the 113th and 114th Congress, with bills H.R. 360 and S. 710 being considered. Regulations for NAHASDA must be developed through a negotiated rulemaking process. Negotiated rulemaking for NAHASDA involves groups and individuals with a stake in the regulations, including tribal representatives and HUD. Amendments require regulations to be developed through this process. HUD must establish a committee within 180 days of reauthorization to develop proposed regulations. The Native American Housing Block Grant program is the main source of federal funding for Native American housing. The Native American Housing Block Grant (NAHBG) program provides funding to federally recognized Indian tribes, Alaska Native villages, and some state recognized tribes. Congress appropriates funding for NAHBG to HUD annually, which then distributes formula grants to eligible tribes, Alaska Native villages, or tribally designated housing entities (TDHEs) for administration. Native Hawaiians are not eligible for NAHBG funds but have a separate housing program authorized by an amendment to NAHASDA. TDHEs can be IHAs that administered previous housing programs for tribes, or they can be tribal departments or nonprofit entities. A single TDHE can be designated to administer the NAHBG for one or more tribes. Tribes and TDHEs that receive NAHBG funds are referred to as recipients. To receive NAHBG funds, a tribe or its TDHE must submit an annual Indian Housing Plan (IHP) and have it approved by HUD. The IHP describes the tribe's affordable housing needs and planned activities for the next year, including funding estimates and requests for waivers. The IHP must be submitted to HUD at least 75 days before the tribal program year begins. HUD requires tribes to submit an Annual Performance Report (APR) detailing activities funded with NAHBG funds after the program year. The IHP and APR were combined, with tribes submitting the IHP before the program year and the APR after. NAHASDA directs HUD to distribute NAHBG funds based on factors like housing unit development, poverty measures, and tribal population. The NAHASDA formula for distributing funds to tribes is based on the tribe's current assisted housing stock and housing need, adjusted for local area costs. It also considers fair market rents, operating subsidies, and total development costs. The NAHASDA formula for distributing funds to tribes is based on the tribe's current assisted housing stock and housing need, adjusted for local area costs. Tribes receive NAHBG funds based on the FCAS and need within their formula area, which includes reservations, trust land, and other tribal areas. Tribes can request additional areas to be added to their formula area by showing an agreement with the governing entity to provide housing services. The formula area for NAHBG may differ from a tribe's service area for other programs. Prior to NAHASDA, tribes received federal housing assistance through HUD programs authorized under the Housing Act of 1937, including Mutual Help and public housing assistance. Tribes still maintain units built under the 1937 Housing Act, and NAHBG funding is distributed based on the number of units owned or operated by the tribe. Section 8 units are also considered if rental assistance is provided. The number of housing units assisted by tribes under programs like Section 8 is known as formula current assisted stock (FCAS). Tribes are responsible for operating and maintaining these units until they are conveyed to occupants. FCAS provides funds for operating subsidies and modernization. Tribes report changes to their FCAS to HUD annually. About half of eligible tribes have FCAS. The need portion of NAHASDA formula considers factors like overcrowded households, housing cost burden, and housing shortage based on income levels. The NAHASDA formula allocates funding to tribes based on factors like income levels of American Indian or Alaska Native households. Tribes can challenge HUD's data used in determining allocations. The NAHASDA formula allocates funding to tribes based on factors like income levels of American Indian or Alaska Native households. Tribes can challenge the data used by submitting alternative data that aligns with their housing needs, as specified by HUD regulations. This data must be collected uniformly and can include administrative data or surveys conducted by the tribe. Initially, U.S. Census data is used for calculations. Some tribes argue that U.S. Census data used to calculate NAHASDA funding is not accurate as it includes all who identify as American Indian or Alaska Native, not just federally recognized tribe members. Others believe Census data is reliable and should be used uniformly. Disagreements also arise over using \"single-race\" or \"multi-race\" Census data since 2000. HUD has been directed to calculate funding based on these data since FY2006. Since FY2006, HUD has been directed to calculate NAHBG funding for tribes using Census data, considering both single-race and multi-race identification. Tribes can use the funds for various affordable housing activities, with a focus on benefiting low-income members of federally recognized tribes. Preference can be given to their own tribal members over members of other recognized tribes in the formula areas. NAHBG funds can be used for developing, operating, maintaining, or supporting affordable housing, including rental and homeownership housing, as well as providing infrastructure and services. The funds can be used for activities such as Indian Housing Assistance, Development, and Housing Services to benefit low-income members of federally recognized tribes. Funds from the Native American Housing Block Grant (NAHBG) can be used for various services related to affordable housing management, crime prevention, safety, and model activities. Administrative expenses are limited to 20% of the grant amount, with approval needed from HUD for exceeding this limit. The Native American Housing Block Grant (NAHBG) allows tribes to use funds for program administration, data collection, staff and overhead costs, and reserve accounts. Expenditures between FY2008 and FY2013 show that the largest percentages were for Indian housing assistance, housing development, and administrative expenses. Other eligible activities each represented less than 10% of expenditures. The NAHBG funds are intended to provide affordable housing to low-income tribal members, with housing benefiting low-income Native American households living on reservations or tribal areas. Low-income is defined as having an income no higher than 80% of the area median income. Tribes can use NAHBG funds to assist non-low-income Native American households under specific conditions if there is a housing need that cannot otherwise be met. Tribes can use NAHBG funds to provide housing assistance to non-low-income households if there is a housing need that cannot be met otherwise. Monthly rents or homebuyer payments in NAHBG-assisted housing cannot exceed 30% of a household's monthly adjusted income. Tribes are responsible for setting written policies related to rents and homebuyer payments. The NAHBG funds must ensure long-term affordability for housing, with binding commitments to maintain affordability. Affordability period applies regardless of the amount of funds spent, except for homeownership units. Tribes can set shorter affordability periods for units with minimal NAHBG investments. NAHASDA requires recipients to submit annual performance reports to HUD detailing the use of NAHBG funds and their alignment with housing needs. HUD can take action if a recipient fails to comply with program requirements, including terminating assistance or reducing payments. The Secretary has the authority to take various actions in cases of noncompliance with NAHASDA requirements, such as terminating assistance, reducing payments, or providing technical assistance. HUD can recapture funds not spent properly and add them to NAHBG funds for distribution to tribes the following year. Recipients must ensure funds are used in compliance with program requirements and have enforceable agreements with housing owners. The Title VI Loan Guarantee Program under NAHASDA helps tribes obtain financing for affordable housing activities by guaranteeing loans made by private lenders to NAHBG recipients. Trust lands' legal status can hinder traditional financing for housing in tribal areas, impacting individuals and tribes seeking loan funds for housing or other buildings. Compliance with NAHASDA requirements is ensured through enforceable agreements with housing owners and annual reviews, including onsite inspections. The Title VI Loan Guarantee Program under NAHASDA allows tribes to secure loans for affordable housing activities by guaranteeing loans from private lenders to NAHBG recipients. Tribes can pledge future NAHBG amounts as collateral for the loan, with HUD repaying 95% of the remaining principal and interest if the tribe defaults. Congress appropriates about $2 million annually for these loan guarantees, with a limit on the dollar amount of loans insured each year. In FY2015, HUD was authorized to guarantee up to $16.5 million in loans under the Title VI Loan Guarantee Program. By the end of FY2014, HUD had guaranteed 80 loans totaling over $200 million. Funding for training and technical assistance is also authorized under NAHASDA, with Congress providing support to organizations like the National American Indian Housing Council. In recent years, HUD has awarded funding to national or regional organizations representing Native American housing interests, including the NAIHC. Congress provided $3.5 million in FY2015 for training and technical assistance, with $2 million directed to a national organization as per NAHASDA statute. Additional funding within the NAHBG account was set aside for training and technical assistance related to NAHASDA-assisted housing. Congress also added Title VIII to NAHASDA in 2000, providing housing assistance for Native Hawaiians. Title VIII of NAHASDA adds housing assistance for Native Hawaiians through the Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grant program. The Department of Hawaiian Home Lands is the sole recipient of funds, which can be used for affordable housing activities benefiting low-income Native Hawaiians eligible to live on Hawaiian home lands. Native Hawaiians are defined as descendants of the aboriginal Hawaiian people. The Hawaiian Home Lands, established under the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920, provide 99-year homestead leases to eligible Native Hawaiians for building or purchasing homes. Native Hawaiians face severe housing needs, with high poverty and overcrowding rates. High housing costs and rural locations of the lands contribute to a shortage of affordable housing for Native Hawaiians. Approximately 9,000 Native Hawaiian households currently hold homestead leases on the Hawaiian home lands. Over 26,000 households are on the waiting list for homestead leases on Hawaiian home lands, with over 32,000 households eligible to apply. DHHL estimates that there are over 34,000 eligible low-income Native Hawaiian households. Eligible activities include affordable housing development, infrastructure, support services, crime prevention, community facilities, and model activities approved by HUD. DHHL can use up to 20% of funds for these activities. The NHHBG funding provided by HUD allows the DHHL to use up to 20% for administrative expenses. Housing funded through NHHBG must remain affordable, with monthly payments not exceeding 30% of a household's income. DHHL primarily uses NHHBG for owner-occupied housing due to the high demand for homestead leases on Hawaiian home lands. The DHHL has traditionally used NHHBG funding to assist with constructing or rehabilitating single-family homes on Hawaiian home lands. NHHBG funds have been used to build, acquire, or rehabilitate homes for 570 households and provide services to over 1,500 households. The DHHL aims to assist about 65 families per year with home construction or rehabilitation using NHHBG funds. Funding for NAHASDA programs is appropriated by Congress annually to HUD, with separate accounts for Native American and Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grants. The Native American Housing Block Grant account receives funding for various programs, including the Title VI Loan Guarantee Program and training. Total funding has ranged from $600 million to $700 million annually. Funding levels for each program within the account are detailed in Table 1 for FY2003 to FY2015. The Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grant program has received annual funding since FY2002, with $9 million appropriated in FY2015. Funds can be used for affordable housing activities benefiting low-income tribal members, with a focus on rehabilitating units. Tribes prioritize owner-occupied housing over rental housing and have used funds for training and technical assistance. Between FY2008 and FY2014, over 44,000 housing units were built, acquired, or rehabilitated using NAHBG funds, with tribes focusing more on owner-occupied housing. On average, tribes utilized NAHBG funds to construct, acquire, or rehabilitate 5,000 to 8,000 units annually. Rehabilitation of housing units is more common than building or acquiring units, with about 4,000 units rehabilitated in FY2014 compared to nearly 1,000 units built or acquired. HUD estimates that over 100,000 housing units have benefited from NAHBG funds since the program's inception, with over 35,000 units built or acquired and over 70,000 substantially rehabilitated. HUD did not systematically collect information on units benefiting from NAHBG funds through means other than construction, acquisition, or rehabilitation until recently. HUD has started collecting more data on other eligible activities with the revised IHP/APR form since FY2012. A 2009 evaluation estimated that NAHBG funds assisted about 1,000 households with down payment assistance, 8,500 households with rental assistance, and 5,000 households with emergency assistance in a single year. Tribes also provided ongoing maintenance or operating assistance. During the most recent program year, tribes provided ongoing maintenance or operating assistance to about 5,000 rental units developed using NAHBG funds. They also maintain approximately 31,000 existing low-rent public housing units and close to 12,000 Mutual Help units. Tribes tend to use NAHASDA funds to develop more owner-occupied units rather than rental units, with a significant focus on homeownership units. Between FY2003 and FY2008, tribes assisted 40,000 homeownership units compared to just over 10,000 rental units using NAHBG funds. Tribes prioritize assisting homeownership units over rental units due to the high ongoing maintenance costs associated with rental units built with NAHASDA funds. Each federally recognized tribe and five state recognized tribes eligible for NAHBG funds receive a formula allocation determined by HUD annually. The actual grants made may differ from these formula allocations for various reasons. In FY2015, the number and size of formula allocations may differ from grants made due to tribes selecting the same TDHE to administer funds, resulting in combined allocations. Some eligible tribes may not receive a grant for reasons like not submitting an Indian Housing Plan. HUD announced formula allocations totaling over $650 million in FY2015. In FY2015, HUD allocated over $650 million in NAHBG funds to 586 tribes and Alaska Native villages. The Navajo Housing Authority received the largest allocation of nearly $84 million, three times more than the next highest allocation to the Cherokee Nation. The mean allocation was about $1.1 million, with over 370 tribes receiving less than $500,000 and 140 recipients receiving more than $1 million. In FY2015, HUD allocated over $650 million in NAHBG funds to 586 tribes and Alaska Native villages. Tribes can leverage their NAHBG funds to attract additional funds from other sources, such as the Title VI program. However, HUD has suggested that some tribes' ability to leverage funds using Title VI is limited. Tribes receiving small NAHBG grants may need to combine funds from multiple sources for larger housing projects. Smaller tribes may struggle to access additional funding, which can come from federal, state, local, tribal, or private sources. Sources of funding for housing for tribes may include HUD programs, the low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) from the Department of the Treasury, and housing programs from the USDA. Tribes can also access funding for infrastructure projects from agencies like BIA, USDA, or IHS. Combining funds from multiple sources can help address various housing needs but also leads to compliance challenges. Data from the decennial Census are crucial for the NAHBG formula. Some tribes have raised concerns about using Census data for NAHBG formula allocations, suggesting tribal enrollment or survey data may be more accurate. Questions have also arisen regarding whether the formula should consider individuals who identify as multiple races. Tribes prefer to resolve these issues through negotiated rulemaking rather than having HUD or Congress decide. Some tribes have raised concerns about using Census data for NAHBG formula allocations, preferring to resolve issues through negotiated rulemaking rather than having HUD or Congress make decisions. The NAHASDA regulations specify that Census data is used to calculate the need portion of the formula grant amounts for AIAN households, but there is disagreement among tribes on whether this is the best data source. Some tribes disagree on using Census data for NAHBG funding allocation, with concerns about its accuracy in representing the population served by NAHASDA. Census counts include individuals who identify as AIAN, regardless of tribal enrollment, leading to potential discrepancies in funding distribution among tribes. Some tribes argue that Census data may not accurately represent the tribal population eligible for NAHASDA funding, suggesting alternative data sources like tribal enrollment data or tribal censuses for a more precise count. This discrepancy in data could lead to NAHBG funds being distributed based on racial identification rather than tribal membership status. Some tribes argue for using alternative data sources to accurately reflect tribal populations for NAHASDA funding, citing sovereignty in choosing membership conditions. Others oppose this, stating Census data is the only uniform and verifiable data available across tribes, with concerns about the cost and burden of adopting a new data source. The 2008 reauthorization of NAHASDA included a provision for a study on data sources for Native American housing needs, but no funds have been allocated for it yet. Census data allows for \"Single-Race\" and \"Multi-Race\" identification since 2000, but it's unclear if HUD should only use data related to a single race. The NAHASDA statute and regulations do not specify whether HUD should use single-race or multi-race data for formula allocations. HUD chose to use total number of individuals identifying as American Indian or Alaska Native for FY2004 allocations. Tribes disagreed with this decision and lack of consultation. Annual appropriations acts since FY2006 direct HUD to calculate the formula both ways for each tribe. Many tribes have not agreed on using single-race or multi-race data for NAHASDA funding allocations. Tribes argue that single-race data better represent the tribal population intended to benefit from NAHASDA. Concerns include potential funding shifts away from traditional reservations towards tribes with more urban areas in their formula areas. HUD has been directed to calculate grants using both data sets and award tribes the larger amount. Some tribes prefer using multi-race data for NAHASDA funding allocations to include members identifying with multiple races, arguing it better reflects the total population they serve."
