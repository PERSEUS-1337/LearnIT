    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Raising Enrollment with a Government Initiated System for Timely Electoral Registration (REGISTER) Act of 2015\". Transmission of information to state or local election officials is required. Each State must designate source agencies to provide voter registration information for Federal elections. Source agencies include the State motor vehicle authority and offices designated as voter registration agencies under the National Voter Registration Act of 1993. Additional agencies may also be designated. A State can designate agencies that collect voter eligibility information as source agencies for Federal elections. These source agencies must transfer basic information to election officials every 14 days in a format compatible with the statewide voter registration database. During the 14-day period before the voter registration deadline for a general election, source agencies must transfer voter eligibility information daily to the statewide database. Individuals disclosing information for voter registration must be notified of the transfer and given the option to opt out of automatic voter registration. SEC. 3. ADMINISTRATION OF VOTER REGISTRATION. SEC. 3 outlines the administration of voter registration. If an individual is not on the voter registration list but meets the qualifications to vote in a Federal election, the State must register them and add them to the list. State election officials must notify eligible voters accordingly. State election officials must notify eligible voters of their registration and provide information on adopting a political party affiliation. If updated information reflects changes in a voter's name or address, the state must update their records. Individuals who previously declined voter registration can still register. This section does not affect the application of the NVRA. Each State must maintain obligations to register voters upon receipt of a valid application, as required by the National Voter Registration Act of 1993. SEC. 4 of the Act clarifies that it does not change voter qualifications or interfere with election officials' authority to determine voter eligibility and conduct list maintenance. SEC. 5 provides protections against liability for individuals. SEC. 5 of the Act offers protections against liability for individuals who register to vote but are not eligible, as long as they do not falsely claim citizenship or commit acts of moral turpitude. The State must enforce a privacy and security policy for the statewide voter registration list, specifying authorized user access and safeguards to protect personal information. The policy prohibits public disclosure of certain voter information, protects against disclosure of sensitive data like Social Security numbers, and prohibits disclosure of an individual's decision not to register to vote. The State must establish policies to prevent unauthorized access to voter registration databases and maintain security during inter-agency transfers of information. This includes prohibiting the disclosure of certain voter information and protecting sensitive data. The State must establish standards for maintaining election records, including those for determining voter eligibility and retaining records of ineligible voters. Source agencies involved in inter-agency data transfers must comply with policies to protect confidentiality and integrity. Additional security measures can be implemented by source agencies. The State must establish standards for maintaining election records, including determining voter eligibility and retaining records of ineligible voters until the second general election after identification. PROTECTIONS AGAINST MISUSE OF INFORMATION. Restrictions are in place to prevent the use of voter registration records for determining citizenship status or disclosing information about individuals' absence from the voter list. Discrimination based on voter registration status is also prohibited. The individual's absence from the voter registration list or refusal to provide information is protected, except for election administration or law enforcement purposes. SEC. 8. SPECIAL PROCEDURES RELATING TO TRANSITION.\n\n(a) Within 180 days of this Act's enactment, each State must send information on automatic voter registration to eligible individuals who have not opted out within 21 days will be registered to vote."
