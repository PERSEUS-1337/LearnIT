    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Child Product Safety Notification Act\". Congress finds that unintentional injuries are the leading cause of death among children, with a significant number requiring hospitalization or emergency department treatment. Nursery products, particularly cribs and strollers, are associated with a high number of injuries and deaths among children under the age of 5. In fiscal year 2005, 28% of the 397 recalls issued by the Consumer Product Safety Commission were for children's products, totaling 19,635,627 individual units. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Commission\" refers to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. A \"durable infant or toddler product\" is a durable item intended for children under 5 years old, including cribs, toddler beds, high chairs, bath seats, gates, play yards, and child carriers. Durable infant or toddler products include child carriers, strollers, walkers, swings, bassinets, cradles, and children's folding chairs. SEC. 4. CONSUMER PRODUCT REGISTRATION FORMS. The Commission must create a consumer product safety standard within 270 days of the Act's enactment. Manufacturers of infant or toddler products must provide a registration form, maintain consumer contact information, and display product details permanently. The registration form for durable infant or toddler products must include spaces for consumer information, be attached to the product surface, and include manufacturer details. The regulations require durable infant or toddler product manufacturers to provide a registration form with options for consumers to register online and ensure consumer information is only used for recall purposes. Manufacturers must maintain records of registrants and notify them in case of a recall. The regulations mandate manufacturers of durable infant or toddler products to provide a registration form for consumers to register online. Consumer information collected can only be used for recall purposes. The Commission will conduct a study on the effectiveness of consumer registration forms in facilitating product recalls and report findings to Congress."
