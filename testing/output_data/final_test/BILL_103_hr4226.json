Section 320 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to establish a Pollution Prevention Demonstration Program for national estuaries to promote modernizing industrial source reduction practices. The Pollution Prevention Demonstration Program aims to promote modernizing toxic use and waste reduction technologies in national estuaries through a registry maintained by the Administrator. Any person with a permit to discharge into an estuary with an approved conservation and management plan can participate in the program by implementing source reduction practices from the registry. The Pollution Prevention Demonstration Program allows participants to implement innovative source reduction practices identified in a conservation and management plan without paying fees for developing revised effluent guidelines. The Pollution Prevention Demonstration Program allows participants to implement innovative source reduction practices without paying fees for developing revised effluent guidelines. Additionally, an extension may be granted for compliance with new standards if deemed necessary by the Administrator. A pollution prevention extension service will be established to advise and encourage pollution prevention by industrial discharges to estuaries with approved conservation and management plans. The Administrator will establish a national estuary pollution prevention clearinghouse to provide information on source reduction methods to municipal and industrial dischargers. Additionally, a Pollution Prevention for Cities Program will be implemented. The Pollution Prevention for Cities Program offers technical and financial assistance to municipalities in estuaries to implement source reduction of toxic pollutants in urban runoff, wastewater, and stormwater. This includes addressing issues from underground septic system failures and studying the impacts of separating combined sanitary/stormwater systems. The Pollution Prevention for Cities Program provides assistance to municipalities for reducing toxic pollutants in urban runoff, wastewater, and stormwater. Eligible municipalities must apply with pollutant reduction goals and stakeholder interest. The Administrator offers technical assistance and authorizes state expenditure for approved municipalities. The State revolving fund can be used for implementing an approved source reduction plan. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to allow funding from the State Revolving Loan Fund Program for activities related to estuaries, including implementing approved source reduction plans. Authorization of appropriations is also included. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to authorize necessary sums for each fiscal year starting after September 30, 1994."
