    "content": "The Forest Fire and Pest Emergency Act, also known as the Short Title, includes a Table of Contents with sections such as Findings and Purpose, Definitions, Declaration of Emergency, and Strategic Fire Plan and Budget. Congress accepts the findings of the National Commission on Wildlife Disasters, which identified high wildfire risks in millions of acres of forest, grassland, and desert in the US, especially on public lands in western states. The commission highlighted altered species composition, excessive fuel buildup, and increased ignition opportunities as key factors contributing to the severity of wildfires in these areas. The Southern California firestorm of 1993 burned nearly 200,000 acres, destroyed over 1,100 structures, killed three people, and cost an estimated $1 billion in suppression efforts, damages, and restoration. Soil erosion, mudslides, wildlife habitat loss, and other damage resulted from the fire. Fuel reduction through salvage logging, thinning, or other means may be necessary before prescribed fire can be safely used in forest situations. In California, wildlife destroyed over 4,200 homes between 1990-93. In 1992, a firestorm in the Sierra forest caused $245 million in losses, $16.5 million in suppression costs, and claimed 2 lives. Congress finds that wildfires on public lands in the west are not uncontrollable acts of nature but rather the result of negligence in land management. This negligence can be traced to a long-standing aversion to fire. The estimated value loss after a salvage recovery is $5,670 per acre, while the cost for prevention fuels treatment averages less than $200 per acre. Major reductions in wildfire extent, damage, and cost are possible through effective prevention actions such as preventive land treatments, improving building standards, and creating defensible spaces. The risk of losing outstanding late-successional forest areas to catastrophic wildfires is high due to fire suppression altering the structure of once open stands. Efforts to reduce catastrophic fire risk to late-successional forest stands in the Sierra Nevada will likely require active management. Activities that reduce forest fuels can provide employment and resources for fire suppression. The purpose of this Act is to immediately reduce the risk of wildfires on federal forest lands in California by addressing dead and dying trees. To reduce the risk of wildfires in federal forest lands in California, access to Emergency Firefighting Funds and Forest Service Emergency Pest Suppression Fund is needed. A Strategic fire protection plan with a budget is also required for Congressional consideration. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines natural fuels, extreme fire risk, and Secretaries as the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior. The United States Congress declares an emergency action to reduce natural fuels on Federal lands in California identified as extreme fire risk during the drought. Federal agencies are directed to work with State agencies to identify and reduce fire risk areas. Emergency fire suppression funds can be used for fuel reduction in Sierra forests, following California Spotted Owl guidelines. Additional treatments may be needed for drought or pest-infested National forest lands. In case of drought or pest infestation on National forest lands, the Forest Service must prepare a budget request for an emergency declaration under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. The Federal agencies are directed to prepare a strategic fire plan and budget in consultation with other federal agencies and California. The plan and budget must be submitted to Congress by March 1, 1995 for inclusion in the 1996 appropriations request, with a supplemental request if necessary for 1995 funding of natural fuels treatment."
