    "content": "The \"Comprehensive Fentanyl Control Act\" includes provisions on controlled substance analogues, enhanced penalties, endangering human life during illegal manufacturing, temporary scheduling of synthetic opioid analgesics, and regulation of tableting machines and encapsulating machines. The Act also includes findings and a sense of Congress statement. The Congress finds that fentanyl, a potent synthetic opioid, poses a significant danger due to its high potency and potential for accidental exposure. This threat extends beyond users to include law enforcement, customs officials, and other workers. Drug seizures testing positive for fentanyl have seen a significant increase in recent years. Illicitly manufactured fentanyl, pill press machines, and other supplies needed for counterfeit pills are primarily sourced from China. Traffickers can buy fentanyl powder for $2,000, make thousands of pills, and sell them for millions in profit. Over 700 overdose deaths are related to fentanyl, but the actual number is believed to be much higher due to variations in testing and reporting techniques. In 2015, the DEA and CDC issued alerts about fentanyl as a threat to public health, warning about counterfeit pills containing fentanyl in the illicit drug market leading to more opioid-dependent individuals, overdoses, and deaths. The DEA faces challenges in prosecuting fentanyl violations due to the Controlled Substances Analogue Enforcement Act's requirement for a similar chemical structure to a controlled substance. Illicit fentanyl manufacturers are altering chemical structures of analogues to evade law enforcement, making prosecution difficult. The speed of these alterations surpasses the DOJ's ability to schedule new compounds under the Controlled Substances Act. The Congress acknowledges the public health emergency posed by trafficking in fentanyl and synthetic opioids in the US. They recommend comprehensive legislative measures to reduce availability of illicit fentanyl and provide grants for screening in regions with increased fentanyl-related incidents. The Congress recommends prioritizing testing of drug samples from overdose scenes and sharing data on fentanyl seizures. Grants for the opioid epidemic should improve surveillance of fentanyl-related deaths and expand naloxone access. The US Government officials should utilize diplomatic and law enforcement measures to address the fentanyl trafficking crisis. The Control Policy should utilize diplomatic and law enforcement resources to stop illicit fentanyl trafficking into the United States, in partnership with Mexico and China. SEC. 3 amends clauses of the Controlled Substances Act by removing \"substantially\" and clarifies that a substance only needs to meet one clause to be considered a controlled substance analogue. SEC. 4 addresses the treatment of controlled substance analogues. SEC. 4 of the Controlled Substances Act is amended to specify that controlled substance analogues intended for human consumption should be treated as schedule I substances under Federal law. The Controlled Substances Act is amended to adjust the quantities for drug offenses, reducing the thresholds for certain substances. The Controlled Substances Act is amended to adjust quantities for drug offenses, reducing thresholds for certain substances. If a mixture contains N-phenyl-[1-(2-phenylethyl)-4-piperidinyl] propanamide and another controlled substance, the court must not impose probation, may impose up to 5 years of imprisonment, and the sentence cannot run concurrently with any other imprisonment term. If a mixture contains N-phenyl-[1-(2-phenylethyl)-4-piperidinyl] propanamide or its analogues misrepresented as another controlled substance, the court must not allow probation, can sentence up to 5 years in prison, and the term cannot overlap with any other imprisonment. Section 1010(b) of the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act is amended to include harsher penalties for violations involving N-phenyl-[1-(2-phenylethyl)-4-piperidinyl] propanamide or its analogues mixed with other controlled substances. This includes a maximum 5-year prison term without probation, and the sentence cannot run concurrently with any other imprisonment. In cases where a substance containing N-phenyl-[1-(2-phenylethyl)-4-piperidinyl] propanamide is misrepresented as another controlled substance, harsh penalties apply. This includes a maximum 5-year prison term without probation, and the sentence cannot run concurrently with any other imprisonment. SEC. 6. Amends Section 417 of the Controlled Substances Act to address endangering human life while illegally manufacturing controlled substances. SEC. 7. TEMPORARY SCHEDULING OF SYNTHETIC OPIOID ANALGESICS. This section addresses the temporary scheduling of synthetic opioid analgesics to combat the risks associated with their illegal manufacturing and transportation. The Controlled Substances Act is amended to allow the Attorney General to temporarily place synthetic opioid analgesics in schedule I without the usual requirements if certain conditions are met. The Attorney General can issue an order to temporarily place a synthetic opioid analgesic in schedule I if it is involved in clandestine activities and poses a threat to public health. The order takes effect 5 days after publication and expires within 6 months, with a possible extension of another 6 months. An order issued by the Attorney General to temporarily place a substance in schedule I expires after 6 months, with a possible extension, and is not subject to judicial review. SEC. 8. TABLETING MACHINES, ENCAPSULATING MACHINES, AND CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE COUNTERFEITING MATERIALS. Nonmailable tableting machines, encapsulating machines, and controlled substance counterfeiting materials are prohibited from being sent through the mail unless mailed to specific regulated or registered individuals. The Controlled Substances Act defines terms like 'controlled substance counterfeiting material', 'encapsulating machine', and 'tableting machine'. Title 39, United States Code, is amended by adding a new item after section 3002a. Title 39, United States Code, is amended by adding a new item after section 3002a. A new section 1716F is added to Chapter 83 of title 18, which prohibits the mailing of tableting machines, encapsulating machines, and controlled substance counterfeiting materials. Violators can face fines or imprisonment for up to 1 year. The table of sections for chapter 83 of title 18, United States Code, is amended to include a new item after section 1716E, prohibiting the mailing of certain machines and materials related to controlled substance counterfeiting. Nonmailability of tableting machines, encapsulating machines, and controlled substance counterfeiting materials."
