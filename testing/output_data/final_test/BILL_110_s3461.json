Congress finds that various entities in the US have created skills certification programs based on local and regional needs, while some national groups have also done so. Limited information about existing programs may lead to the development of duplicative certifications. These programs offer quick recognition for employers and employees, and nationally recognized standards can provide the greatest benefit. Certification allows for flexibility, portability, and meaningful recognition for both highly skilled workers and those with less specialized skills. Widely recognized standards help quantify and categorize the workforce, addressing the skills gap in industries like manufacturing where employers struggle to find qualified workers. In 2005, 90% of manufacturing employers cited a shortage of qualified production workers as their top workforce issue. The Act aims to evaluate skills certification programs to determine the most desired certifications by employers and employees. It also aims to provide information about these programs to entities offering job training. The Act defines terms like \"local board,\" \"skills certification program,\" and \"State board\" in relation to evaluating industry-led programs for necessary skill sets. The term \"State board\" refers to a State workforce investment board established under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998. SEC. 5. EVALUATION.
