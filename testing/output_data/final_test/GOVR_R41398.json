    "content": "The Dodd-Frank Act was implemented in response to the 2007 financial crisis, aiming to regulate the OTC derivatives market. It requires major financial institutions to back their risk exposures with capital to prevent a systemic shock in case of failure. Regulators will have more information about the size and distribution of derivatives exposures to avoid panic and uncertainty in the financial system. Derivative contracts are financial instruments linked to changes in underlying variables like commodity prices or interest rates. Firms use derivatives to manage risk, such as protecting against price increases. Southwest Airlines used derivatives to buy jet fuel at a low fixed price in 2008. Derivatives are used to hedge risk and seek profits by betting on price movements. Speculators provide liquidity to the market and aid in price discovery. Most derivatives today are linked to financial variables like interest rates, foreign exchange, and stock prices. The derivatives market involves stock prices, indices, and creditworthiness of bond issuers. It is worth hundreds of trillions of dollars with billions of contracts traded annually. Derivatives are used to create complex financial instruments like bonds backed by pools of assets and synthetic securities. Financial engineering involves sophisticated mathematical models to understand market movements and interactions of financial variables. Growth in derivatives markets has been explosive since 2000. Since 2000, derivatives markets have seen explosive growth, with a significant increase in the volume of contracts traded on exchanges and the notional value of contracts in the OTC market. Despite a slight decline after the 2008 financial crisis, the total notional value of OTC derivatives globally has since rebounded. The various types of derivatives are used for hedging and managing business risk. Prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, derivatives were traded on different markets - futures contracts on CFTC-regulated exchanges, stock options on SEC-regulated exchanges, and swaps over-the-counter. Exchanges are centralized markets where buying and selling interests meet, while OTC contracts are bilateral between a dealer and end user. There were no regulations in the OTC market regarding price, terms, or existence. Derivatives trading prior to the Dodd-Frank Act involved no disclosure requirements to regulators or the public. Market integrity was a concern due to the risk of traders meeting their obligations. The Dodd-Frank Act implemented reforms to manage counterparty risk, with exchanges using clearinghouses to address credit risk. The clearinghouse guarantees payment to traders by requiring margin deposits to cover potential losses and posting additional margin if prices move against them. In futures trading, traders must post additional margin to cover losses before the next session, known as a margin call. This prevents large paper losses that could harm the clearinghouse in case of default. In the OTC market, dealers take long or short positions and make money on spreads and fees, absorbing credit risk from customers. In the OTC market, large financial institutions like JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and Citigroup dominate. These firms were once considered too big to fail but their fallibility was exposed in 2008. The government's stance on their status is now in question. The market lacked standard practices, with negotiable contract terms and varying collateral requirements. Compliance with best practice standards from ISDA was not universal. The OTC market lacked universal mandatory margin requirements, leading to large uncollateralized losses. AIG, with $1.8 trillion in credit default swaps, faced margin calls it couldn't meet during the subprime crisis, requiring a bailout from the Federal Reserve and Treasury. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates clearing and trading of many OTC swaps on exchanges, with margin requirements. Some derivatives contracts will still be traded in the OTC market, but regulators have broader powers to impose margin and capital requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates clearing and trading of OTC swaps on exchanges with margin requirements. The CFTC and SEC are working on regulations to implement these provisions for swaps and security-based swaps. Title VII of the Act establishes clearing and exchange trading requirements for swaps and security-based swaps. If required to be cleared, it is unlawful to enter into these transactions without clearing. There are specific requirements for swaps under CFTC jurisdiction and security-based swaps under SEC authority. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates clearing and trading of OTC swaps on exchanges with margin requirements. Title VII establishes clearing and exchange trading requirements for swaps and security-based swaps. A swap or security-based swap may become subject to the clearing requirement through ongoing review by the agency of jurisdiction or submission to the CFTC or SEC for public interpretation. Upon acceptance of a swap or security-based swap for clearing, the organization must submit the transactions to the relevant commission for a determination on whether they should be cleared. The Dodd-Frank Act required all swaps and security-based swaps listed for clearing to be submitted to the SEC and CFTC for a clearing requirement determination within 90 days. Factors considered include notional exposures and trading liquidity. The SEC and CFTC must consider various factors when determining whether a swap or security-based swap should be cleared, including notional exposures, trading liquidity, operational expertise, systemic risk mitigation, competition, and legal certainty in case of insolvency. Public comments are also allowed in this process. The CFTC or SEC may require swaps or security-based swaps to be cleared, with counterparties able to apply for a stay until a review is completed. The relevant agency can then decide to clear the transaction unconditionally or with conditions, or determine it does not need to be cleared. Counterparties must execute cleared transactions on exchanges or specialized facilities, with exceptions for end-user exemptions. The clearing requirement for swaps is not yet in effect. The CFTC and SEC are implementing clearing requirements for swaps and security-based swaps. Rules have been proposed and finalized, with a focus on promoting pre-trade price transparency in the market. Transactions must be executed on regulated exchanges or trading platforms to allow multiple market participants to trade. This aims to address the opacity of the old OTC market where price information was limited to dealers. The new trading facilities, SEFs and SBSEFs, must comply with core principles to ensure transparency and prevent trading abuses. They are expected to provide price information to promote competition and narrow spreads, unlike the opaque OTC market. Regulatory responsibilities include preventing manipulation, setting position limits, and maintaining market integrity. The new trading facilities, SEFs and SBSEFs, must comply with core principles to ensure transparency and prevent trading abuses. Regulatory responsibilities include preventing manipulation, setting position limits, maintaining market integrity, and publishing timely data on prices and trading volume. Concerns during Dodd-Frank debate included accommodating existing OTC derivatives trading platforms under the new regulatory regime and avoiding monopolization by existing futures and securities exchanges. The Senate Banking Committee defined SEF as an electronic trading system with transparency. The final legislation did not include the explicit reference to \"pre-trade\" transparency due to concerns about compatibility with certain business models. Dodd-Frank provides exceptions to the exchange-trading mandate, allowing swaps to be traded OTC if not available on an exchange or SEF. Swaps meeting the end-user clearing exemption are also exempt from the exchange trading requirement. The CFTC proposed rules in 2011 to define swap execution facilities (SEFs) as platforms where multiple participants can post bids and offers. SEFs exclude one-to-one and one-to-many systems for impartial access. SEFs provide pre-trade price transparency for cleared trades, swaps available for trading, and trades below block trade size. The SEC issued a proposed rule on security-based swap execution facilities on February 2, 2011, similar to the CFTC's SEF proposal. The rule requires a security-based SEF to allow multiple participants to interact with each other's trading interest. Exceptions to the clearing requirement for swaps and security-based swaps are provided in Sections 723 and 763 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The end-user exemption applies to transactions where at least one counterparty is not a financial entity. A financial entity is defined as a swap dealer, security-based swap dealer, major swap participant, major security-based swap participant, commodity pool, private fund, employee benefit plan, or a person engaged in banking or financial activities. An example of a non-financial entity engaging in swaps trading could be an airline trading in fuel derivatives. The end-user exemption allows eligible counterparties to use affiliates to engage in swaps or security-based swaps to hedge commercial risks. Financial entities controlled by the end-user and primarily engaged in hedging may also qualify for the exemption. Regulators can exclude certain institutions with $10 billion or less in assets from the exemption. The end-user exemption allows small financial entities like small banks to qualify for the exemption from the clearing requirement by engaging in swaps to hedge commercial risks. The swaps must be for the purpose of hedging or mitigating commercial risk, meeting specific criteria outlined by the CFTC's final rule. The end-user exemption allows small financial entities like small banks to qualify for the exemption from the clearing requirement by engaging in swaps to hedge commercial risks. The swaps must meet specific criteria outlined by the CFTC's final rule, including not being used for speculation or to hedge another swap position. The clearing exemption provided by the Dodd-Frank Act is at the discretion of the qualifying counterparty. Eligible counterparties may choose to clear the transaction through a designated clearing organization or agency. The end-user exemption allows small financial entities to qualify for exemption from the clearing requirement by engaging in swaps to hedge commercial risks. The exemption applies on a swap by swap basis, and if swaps do not meet the requirements for a legitimate hedge, they will be required to be cleared. The CFTC rules for this exemption were issued in September 2012 but will not officially apply until the clearing requirement takes effect. The CFTC has not yet issued final rules implementing the clearing requirement, while the SEC has proposed rules for the end-user exemption in security-based swaps. Dodd-Frank emphasizes that financial institutions should maintain capital cushions to mitigate risks to the financial system. Major participants in derivatives markets will be subject to prudential regulation, including swap dealers and major swap participants. The OTC dealer market is highly concentrated, leading to the proposal for swap dealers. The proposal for swap dealers to be subject to additional prudential regulation was not controversial due to the highly concentrated OTC dealer market. The definition of major swap participant (MSP) was contentious, with debates on how many non-dealer and non-bank firms should be included. The version of H.R. 4173 passed in December 2009 defined an MSP as a non-dealer with a \"substantial net position\" in swaps, excluding positions for hedging commercial risk, or with counterparties at risk of \"significant credit losses\" in case of default. The bill provided guidance on defining major swap participants (MSPs) as entities that can impact the financial system through counterparty credit risk. The House definition aimed to prevent imposing prudential regulation on firms using derivatives for risk hedging, with concerns about the cost of clearing swap contracts for MSPs. There were debates on the narrowness of the MSP definition, potentially affecting only a few large entities like Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, non-dealer banks, insurance companies, and hedge funds. The MSP definition in the Senate bill was broad, while the House bill was narrow. Concerns were raised about OTC trading escaping regulation if the definition was too narrow. The Senate Banking Committee approved S. 3217 with a broad MSP definition, giving regulators discretion to designate firms as MSPs. The Senate Agriculture Committee produced a broad definition of MSPs, giving regulators discretion to designate firms as systemically important. The definition included new criteria such as substantial positions in major swap categories and high leverage, potentially bringing more financial entities under regulation. This approach aimed to capture a significant portion of swaps trading, especially between dealers and financial institutions. The Senate-passed bill eliminated the clearing exemption for financial entities, aiming to regulate nearly all swaps trading under the new regulatory framework. The final version of the legislation made changes to the MSP definition and clearing requirement, addressing concerns about equity in regulation. Regulators were given discretion to exempt certain financial institutions with less than $10 billion in assets from mandatory clearing. The goal was to regulate a significant portion of swaps trading under the new regulatory regime. The CFTC and SEC released a final rule defining \"swap dealer\" and \"major swap participant\" on May 23, 2012. The rule establishes criteria for determining a \"substantial\" position in swaps, including tests based on current and future exposure levels. The final rule defines a \"swap dealer\" as any person who holds himself out as a dealer in swaps, makes a market in swaps, regularly enters into swaps with counterparties, or engages in activity causing himself to be commonly known as a dealer in swaps. The rule also sets criteria for determining a \"substantial\" position in swaps based on exposure levels. The final rule defines a \"swap dealer\" as a person known as a dealer or market maker in swaps. It excludes certain swaps used for hedging or between majority-owned affiliates. To be considered a swap dealer, the person must have entered into swaps exceeding $8 billion in the prior 12 months during a phase-in period. Swaps must be reported to registered swap data repositories or the CFTC. The Dodd-Frank Act requires all swaps and security-based swaps to be reported to registered repositories or the CFTC/SEC. Transactions entered into before the Act's enactment are exempt from clearing requirements if reported accordingly. Section 727 of Dodd-Frank addresses the public availability of swap transaction data, with the CFTC mandated to establish rules for data disclosure. Real-time reporting is required for swaps not subject to clearing requirements but cleared at registered derivatives clearing organizations. This reporting includes data on swap transactions like price and volume, to be done as soon as technologically practicable after execution. For swaps not cleared and reported before the clearing requirement, real-time reporting must be done without disclosing business transactions. Swaps required to be cleared but not cleared also need real-time public reporting. The act mandates real-time public reporting for swaps not subject to clearing requirements but cleared at registered derivatives clearing organizations. Reporting obligations are also created for uncleared swaps and security-based swaps, including those that qualify for the end-user exemption. Swaps entered into before the act's enactment will be subject to reporting and recordkeeping requirements. The purpose is to provide relevant commissions with a comprehensive view of the derivatives market. The SEC proposed a rule on reporting requirements for security-based swaps, known as Regulation SBSR. Regulation SBSR requires security-based swap data repositories to register with the SEC as securities information processors. Data received will be categorized into public and non-public information. Public information includes asset class, underlying security, price, notional amount, execution time, and effective/expiration dates. Non-public information includes swap counterparty identity, broker/trading desk, up-front payments, master agreement title, valuation methods, and reporting counterparty details. Market participants have concerns about \"real-time\" reporting. The SEC proposed a narrow definition of \"real-time\" reporting for security-based swaps, aiming for disclosure as soon as technologically practicable after execution. Exceptions include contracts not required to be cleared, where public reporting should not disclose business transactions or market positions. Block trades reporting rules are yet to be addressed by the SEC. The CFTC issued a final rule on reporting, recordkeeping, and daily trading records obligations for swap dealers and MSPs, requiring electronic reporting to a swap data repository. The rule aims to create an electronic audit trail of all stages of a swap, with records to be maintained regardless of prudential regulator requirements. The SEC plans to propose a rule for reporting block trades at a later date. The CFTC and SEC have rulemaking authority under the Dodd-Frank Act to prevent evasions of mandatory clearing requirements for swaps and security-based swaps. They can apply clearing requirements based on submissions from clearing organizations or through independent reviews of transactions under their jurisdiction. The CFTC and SEC have the authority to determine if swaps and security-based swaps should be subject to mandatory clearing requirements. They can investigate and take necessary actions if no clearing organization accepts them for clearing. Neither agency can require clearing organizations to list these swaps. The SEC may adopt rules requiring a derivatives clearing organization to list certain swaps for clearing if it threatens financial integrity. The CFTC has not fully implemented this rule yet but has proposed rules to prevent evasion of the clearing requirement. The SEC has already issued rules implementing Dodd-Frank's clearing requirement, including provisions to prevent evasion. The SEC has issued a rule requiring market participants to submit security-based swaps to clearing agencies functioning as CCPs. In 2008, speculation in derivatives was blamed for price volatility and unjustified price levels. The 110th Congress considered legislation to insulate commodity prices from excessive speculation and manipulation, implementing provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act to enhance the CFTC's authority. The Dodd-Frank Act enhanced the CFTC's authority to set margin and position limits, and to prohibit manipulation in commodity and swaps markets. Section 736 granted the CFTC the power to set margin requirements for futures exchanges to protect traders and ensure fair dealing. The Dodd-Frank Act granted the CFTC authority to set margin and position limits, and prevent manipulation in commodity and swaps markets. Section 737 directed the CFTC to establish position limits for swaps and futures, leading to the approval of rules in 2011. Industry groups challenged these regulations in court. The CFTC was directed by the Dodd-Frank Act to establish position limits for swaps and futures in 2011. Industry groups challenged these regulations in court, arguing that the CFTC violated the Commodity Exchange Act by not conducting the necessary analysis before issuing the rules. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia vacated and remanded the CFTC's position limit rules in September 2012. The court vacated the CFTC's position limit rules due to an ambiguity in the statute. The agency must now determine if position limits are required before issuing new rules. Dodd-Frank broadened the CFTC's anti-manipulation authority and added prohibitions against false reporting. The CFTC has authority to prevent fraudulent practices in commodity trading, similar to SEC regulations for securities. The agency interprets CEA Section 6(c)(1) as a catchall clause to deter deceptive practices. The CFTC interprets violations of Section 6(c)(1) similarly to SEC regulations for securities fraud, implementing its new anti-manipulation authority flexibly. This case-by-case approach, similar to the SEC's, has led to settlements with market participants, including the largest fine in CFTC history imposed on Barclays Bank, PLC in 2012 for submitting false borrowing rate reports. Barclays bank submitted false borrowing rates to the BBA for the LIBOR, at times knowingly at the request of traders to improve their investments. During the financial crisis, Barclays suspected other banks were understating their borrowing costs and reported lower costs to manage public perception. The CFTC found Barclays likely violated regulations. Barclays was found likely guilty of violating the CEA by the CFTC and agreed to pay a $200 million fine. The Dodd-Frank Act gives the CFTC broader authority to prevent fraudulent activity, leading to more enforcement actions like Barclays' fine in the future. Section 716 of the Act prohibits federal assistance to swap entities. Section 716 of the Dodd-Frank Act prohibits federal assistance to swap entities, including swap dealers, major swap participants, securities and futures exchanges, SEFs, and clearing organizations. The provision aims to prevent taxpayer funds from being used to cover obligations of financial institutions engaged in risky derivatives trading, ensuring that such activities are not under the federal safety net. Senator Lincoln emphasized the need for banks to focus on traditional banking activities, stating that risky derivatives trading has led to the excessive growth of large banks. Section 716 of the Dodd-Frank Act aims to prevent taxpayer bailouts of financial institutions engaged in risky derivatives trading by prohibiting federal assistance to swap entities. Supporters believe it compels banks to spin off swap dealings, while opponents argue it may have unintended consequences, such as limiting access to the safety net for banks engaging in hedging activities. The conference committee modified Section 716 of the Dodd-Frank Act, narrowing the definitions of swap entities and allowing banks to act as swap dealers under certain circumstances. The final legislation clarified that exchanges, SEFs, and clearing organizations are not considered swap entities. Additionally, the prohibition on aid does not prevent a bank from creating an affiliate that is a swaps entity, as long as it complies with relevant regulations. Banks can act as swaps dealers for certain contracts under regulations from the Federal Reserve Act, SEC, and CFTC. They can deal in swaps related to interest rates, currencies, government securities, and precious metals, but not other commodities or equities. Credit default swaps must be cleared by a regulated organization to be dealt with by banks. Taxpayer funds cannot be used to prevent the liquidation of a swaps entity, with any expenses covered by assessments on the financial sector. Section 716, which pertains to the recoupment of expenses from a swaps entity through assessments on the financial sector, has not yet taken effect. Guidance from regulatory bodies states that Section 716 will not be enforced until July 16, 2013."
