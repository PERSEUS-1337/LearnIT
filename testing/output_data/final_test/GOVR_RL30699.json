    "content": "In the mid-1990s, the threat of NBC weapons to the United States shifted from a U.S.-Russian strategic exchange to more numerous and unpredictable threats. The dissolution of the Soviet Union led to concerns about \"loose nukes\" and the need to secure Russian WMD infrastructure. U.N. inspections revealed Iraq's NBC weapons programs and a crisis emerged over North Korea's nuclear program. Secretary of Defense William Cohen noted that American military superiority increased the risk of nuclear, biological, and chemical attacks by incentivizing adversaries. Congress is concerned about countries and groups with NBC weapons and missile delivery systems. The connection between terrorism and WMD has been highlighted since 9/11, with reports of al Qaeda pursuing research on these weapons. President Bush emphasized the threat of terror armed with NBC weapons. The unpredictability of terrorist efforts to acquire these weapons poses a serious challenge to global stability. The Bush Administration has identified state sponsors of terrorism with NBC weapons programs as security threats. There is ongoing debate about the WMD threat, with some analysts noting a decrease in stockpiles due to progress in arms control. However, concerns remain about nuclear tests by India, Pakistan, and North Korea, missile tests by various countries, and the transfer of dangerous technology by states like China, Russia, and North Korea. This report focuses on the current threat and trends in nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons and missiles, including activities of clandestine procurement networks and growing interest in NBC weapons among terrorists. Potential NBC weapons threats to U.S. security interests impact national security and foreign policy decisions, such as military force structure, weapons acquisition, doctrine and strategy for defense and military operations, training for NBC environments, foreign policy, and economic policy towards countries of proliferation concern. The status and trends of these weapons are crucial in national and international debates on the threat posed by nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons delivered by terrorists or states. The U.S. government has taken steps to address NBC weapons proliferation, including releasing the \"National Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction\" in December 2002. Key considerations include assessing the capability and intent of countries and terrorist groups to use NBC weapons, evaluating intelligence resources, and determining the appropriate mix of defense strategies and approaches. The U.S. government's strategy to combat weapons of mass destruction is divided into three pillars: counterproliferation, strengthened nonproliferation, and consequence management. Counterproliferation involves interdicting WMD materials, deterrence, defense, and preemptive actions. Strengthened nonproliferation includes diplomacy, multilateral regimes, and threat reduction assistance. Consequence management focuses on homeland defense against WMD threats and factors that facilitate the spread of dangerous technology. The factors that increase the likelihood of NBC weapons being used include technological developments, free flow of information, growing disparities in military capabilities, prestige of nuclear and missile capabilities, perceived utility of NBC threats, and disdain for arms control agreements. Threat assessments are subjective and debateable due to the need to assess both technical capabilities and intentions of states or groups possessing the weapons. The risk of using weapons of mass destruction is influenced by factors like stockpiles, technology diffusion, and global tensions. Reduction of tension, economic integration, and strong deterrent capabilities can decrease the incentive for proliferation. The debate over the effectiveness of a National Missile Defense system in deterring WMD proliferation continues. Assessing the NBC threat from terrorist groups is complex and often argued. The connection between the spread of NBC capabilities to states and the potential availability of technology to terrorists is a significant concern. President Bush warned that terrorist groups are eager to acquire weapons of mass destruction and would use them without hesitation. This poses a threat of blackmail, genocide, and chaos. The debate over the effectiveness of deterring WMD proliferation with a National Missile Defense system continues. The spread of nuclear weapons to additional states increases the risk of nuclear war among nations and nuclear terrorism. Analysts debate whether rogue states plan to use WMD against the United States. Nations seeking nuclear weapons and harboring terrorists pose a severe threat to the civilized world. The United States works to decrease the risk of WMD use and spread, with leadership in various international efforts and bilateral agreements to discourage weapons technology proliferation. The United States faces criticism for actions that may weaken norms against WMD proliferation, such as developing missile defense systems and refusing to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Critics fear that short-term goals in the war on terrorism could overshadow broader nonproliferation objectives. Observers abroad worry that the U.S. is abandoning its arms control leadership, leading other states to seek similar freedom of action. Missile defense advocates argue that missile defense strengthens deterrence and prevents rogue states from blackmailing the United States or its allies with a missile attack. Around twenty-five countries are suspected of having NBC weapons programs or stockpiles, with capabilities developed covertly. Most countries suspected of having NBC weapons programs or stockpiles have developed capabilities covertly. U.S. intelligence on foreign WMD programs varies, with nuclear and ballistic missile programs being more easily detectable than biological and chemical weapons programs. Intent and ultimate objectives of countries pursuing NBC weapons capability are not portrayed in Table 1, impacting threat assessments. While proliferation has been offset by reductions in weapons by some countries, others are actively building NBC weapon stockpiles. Some countries are actively building NBC weapon stockpiles and improving delivery capabilities, taking advantage of available missile technology. These states have indigenous production capabilities and may support terrorism. Concerns have grown about additional countries or terrorist groups producing NBC weapons. Five states are nuclear weapon states under the NPT, while four others have nuclear capabilities. China is one of the five nuclear weapon states under the NPT. It has between 90-112 nuclear warheads deployed on land-based ballistic missiles, including CSS-4 ICBMs with the capability to reach the continental United States. China's nuclear arsenal is not publicly disclosed, but it is estimated to have more than 100 warheads according to Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lieutenant General Michael Maples. China's nuclear arsenal includes CSS-3 ICBMs with a range of 5,470+ km, CSS-2 IRBMs with a range of 2,790+ km, and CSS-5 MRBMs with a range of 1,770+ km. The DF-31 ICBM achieved initial threat availability in 2006 with an estimated range of 7,250 km. China also has a XIA-class ballistic-missile submarine with 12 launch tubes capable of holding JL-1 SLBMs with a range of 1,700 km. The XIA-class submarine with JL-1 SLBMs has uncertain operational status, with ONI stating it likely plays a limited role in China's nuclear deterrent force. The JL-1's range limits its effectiveness, but it can still target regions from Chinese Navy operating areas. Beijing may have around 40 nuclear bombs for aircraft delivery, but they may not be deployed. The NRDC report to Congress states that China's Air Force does not have dedicated units for nuclear bomb delivery, but some units may have that as a contingency mission. Beijing is estimated to have around 70 nuclear warheads. France has approximately 350 nuclear warheads deployed on submarines and aircraft. Paris has four ballistic missile submarines, each capable of carrying 16 4,000 km-range missiles with six warheads each. France is developing a new 6,000 km-range missile to replace the current one. France also has nuclear warheads on Air-Sol-Moyenne Port\u00e9e cruise missiles carried by Mirage 2000N and Super. France has 50 Air-Sol-Moyenne Port\u00e9e (ASMP) cruise missiles on Mirage 2000N and 10 on Super \u00c9tendard aircraft. They are developing a new ALCM (ASMP-A) for Mirage and Rafale aircraft. Russia has various ICBMs, SLBMs, and bombers, totaling around 2,000-3,000 operational tactical warheads and 8,000-10,000 stockpiled warheads. Russia has approximately 2,000-3,000 operational tactical warheads and 8,000-10,000 stockpiled strategic and tactical warheads. Moscow's strategic forces are designed to deter aggression, with the ability to conduct limited nuclear strikes if needed. The United Kingdom has fewer than 160 nuclear warheads deployed on Vanguard-class submarines, with each carrying up to 48 warheads. The UK normally has one submarine on deterrent patrol at any given time. The United Kingdom plans to reduce its nuclear reserve stockpile by 20% and develop a new class of replacement submarines. They may deploy only three submarines and participate in the U.S. Life Extension Program for the Trident missile. Israel is believed to possess between 75 and 200 nuclear weapons. India, Pakistan, and North Korea have developed nuclear weapons. Pakistan has around 60 warheads, India has between 36 and 100 warheads, and North Korea has produced enough plutonium for at least six weapons. North Korea tested a nuclear weapon in 2006 and shut down its plutonium-based facilities in 2007. The CIA assessed that North Korea started a uranium enrichment program in 2000. Iran has long been suspected of pursuing a nuclear weapons program, with concerns increasing after an IAEA investigation in 2002 revealed undisclosed nuclear activities. In 2003, Iran agreed to suspend uranium enrichment activities in exchange for technical assistance under an agreement with the EU-3 (Germany, France, and the UK). In 2004, Iran expanded its pledge to include all enrichment and processing activities, but little progress was made in negotiations. In 2005, Iran was found in noncompliance with its IAEA safeguards agreement, leading to UN Security Council referral in 2006. Two resolutions imposed sanctions on Iran. A 2007 NIE report stated Iran had a past nuclear weapons program but halted it in 2003, with moderate confidence that it had not restarted by mid-2007. Iran is keeping open the option to develop nuclear weapons. U.S. officials also mention Syria. According to a report, Pakistani investigators confirmed allegations that A.Q. Khan offered nuclear technology to Syria. Concerns remain about the transfer of expertise or technology. The IAEA is investigating a nuclear technology procurement network involving Syria. Former National Security Council officials believe a Syrian nuclear weapons program is unlikely. Other countries have given up nuclear weapons or dismantled them. The Nuclear Suppliers Group has controlled sensitive nuclear technology exports since the mid-1970s, but nuclear technology availability has increased. The exposure of the Khan network in 2004 has prompted calls for further controls on nuclear exports, including bans on certain technologies and international management of reprocessing and enrichment. The total number of nuclear warheads worldwide is expected to decrease as the United States and Russia reduce their arsenals. The nuclear inventories of China, India, and Pakistan are expected to expand, while Israel's arsenal is unlikely to change significantly. North Korea has halted plutonium production at its known nuclear facilities. The United States projects that China will modernize its nuclear arsenal by moving towards more survivable ballistic missiles. China's nuclear forces are projected to include enhanced CSS-3s, CSS-4s, and CSS-5s by 2010. China's nuclear forces are expected to include enhanced CSS-3s, CSS-4s, and CSS-5s, DF-31s, and the DF-31A by 2010. Beijing could increase its number of ICBM warheads capable of reaching the United States to well over 100. China may develop warheads with multiple reentry vehicles for some of its ICBMs. New air- and ground-launched cruise missiles will improve the survivability and flexibility of China's nuclear forces. China is also expected to deploy a new SLBM, the JL-2, on a new JIN-class nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine. China is expected to build a fleet of five submarines, with the first one potentially operational by 2008. The JL-2 submarine with a range of over 8,000 km is set to be operational between 2007 and 2010. Russia's nuclear arsenal will remain capable of striking the US, but its strategic forces are expected to decline in the next decade. Moscow may deploy new missiles with multiple warheads. According to NASIC, Moscow is developing a new missile with a range of over 5,500 km that could be deployed on land and sea. Russia is also testing a new SLBM to replace existing inventory. The Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty limits Russia and the United States to 1700-2200 strategic warheads, with the treaty expiring on December 31, 2012. India and Pakistan intensified their nuclear rivalry in 1998, with both countries establishing doctrine, tactics, and contingency plans for nuclear weapons use. India's pursuit of nuclear weapons is primarily driven by its desire for power. In 2001, concerns grew over the safety of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal due to riots, ties to the Taliban, and U.S. efforts for assurances. Tensions escalated in 2002 with military deployments in Kashmir, raising fears of a nuclear exchange. Terrorist groups seeking nuclear material added to the threat of a possible nuclear attack. The erosion of barriers to obtaining low-grade nuclear material for \"dirty bombs\" has raised concerns. Terrorist groups have attempted to acquire radioactive materials for use in terrorist devices. While most attempts are scams, the possibility of terrorists learning from these incidents is worrisome. Several nations are believed to have some biological weapons capability, although none publicly acknowledge it. Several nations, including China, Cuba, Egypt, Iran, Israel, North Korea, Russia, Syria, and Taiwan, are believed to have biological weapons capability. Iraq and Libya had programs in the past but ended them. Al-Qa'ida also had a program. Concern has shifted to the prospect of terrorist acquisition due to the ease of producing biological weapons covertly. Terrorist groups may face challenges in obtaining materials and knowledge for large-scale biological attacks, but with advancing biotechnology and state support, successful efforts could increase. Even a small amount of biological agent dispersed in a densely populated area could cause significant casualties, making even small-scale attacks politically impactful. The covert development of biological weapons in non-member states is hard to detect and defend against, posing a significant threat of potentially enormous casualties. International trade in BW material, equipment, and technology remains a concern, with the threat of biological warfare increasing as biotechnology advances. Member countries under the Chemical Weapons Convention are required to destroy their stockpiles by April 2007. In 1997, member countries were required to destroy their chemical weapons stockpiles by April 2007. Albania was the first country to confirm destruction of its declared CWs in July 2007. India, Libya, Russia, South Korea, and the United States also declared possession of such weapons and pledged to destroy them by April 29, 2012. Some doubts exist regarding all countries meeting the deadline due to technical and legal challenges. Twelve countries reported CW production facilities and have committed to destroying or converting them. The OPCW has confirmed the destruction of all declared CW production facilities. The Chemical Weapons Convention has likely reduced the number of parties with chemical weapons and the likelihood of their use. The Chemical Weapons Convention has likely reduced the number of countries with chemical weapons. Some countries may still be developing or producing chemical weapons, with delivery methods including aircraft, drones, artillery, rockets, and missiles. Technology and materials for lethal chemical agents are available. The availability of technology and materials for lethal chemical agents internationally may lead to the development of chemical weapons by additional countries and subnational groups. Terrorist groups are expected to continue efforts to obtain chemical weapons, potentially with assistance from state sponsors of terrorism. The intelligence community assessed that al-Qaida had a chemical weapons program before the 2001 U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan, but the accuracy of this assessment is unclear. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) is expected to limit large-scale production and stockpiles of chemical weapons among member states. The effectiveness of the CWC implementation will play a key role in reducing the worldwide chemical weapons threat. The Central Intelligence Agency has identified concerning trends in chemical and biological weapons proliferation, including advancements in biotechnology and the development of new chemical weapons agents. Some countries are becoming self-sufficient in producing these weapons and are using civilian applications to conceal their production. Controlling exports of dual-use technology is becoming increasingly challenging. Countries with CW and BW capabilities are acquiring sophisticated delivery systems, including cruise and ballistic missiles. Scientists with experience in CW and BW production are leaving countries of the former Soviet Union. Terrorist groups have sought CW, BW, and nuclear material, with some countries sponsoring terrorists. Most countries seeking nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons also possess ballistic missiles, with exceptions like Cuba, Sudan, Myanmar, and Thailand. North Korea demonstrated potential ICBM capability with the Taepo-dong 1 test in 1998. North Korea demonstrated potential ICBM capability with the Taepo-dong 1 test in 1998, but the third stage failed to separate. They also had a failed test of the Taep'o-dong 2 in 2006. North Korea has around 500 Scuds and 100 Nodong missiles, and has exported missiles to the Middle East. Several countries like Israel, India, Pakistan, and Iran have medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs) and may be developing intermediate range ballistic missiles and ICBMs. Other countries have short-range ballistic missiles. Russia, China, and North Korea have exported missiles and technology to other countries. The spread of cruise missiles is a concerning trend, with 81 countries possessing them and 18 able to manufacture. Most are used for anti-ship missions with ranges below 300 km. Russia, Ukraine, and France have long-range cruise missiles capable of carrying nuclear weapons. The UK, Germany, and possibly China are developing missiles at the MTCR limit, while Italy and the UK are working on shorter-range missiles. North Korea, China, and groups in Russia have helped other countries develop their own missiles. Pakistan and Iran tested medium-range ballistic missiles with their assistance in 1998. Iran and Russia tested medium-range ballistic missiles in April and July 1998. The spread of missile technology is a global concern, with countries like Iran, Libya, and Egypt identified as sources. Cruise missile production technology is widespread, with 18 countries producing them and 22 others developing capabilities. Commercially available technologies like sensors and GPS have improved missile accuracy. The use of unmanned aerial vehicles in the war on terrorism has showcased advancements in remotely piloted vehicle technology. The sophistication of commercially available remotely piloted vehicle technology is growing rapidly, despite control guidelines for cruise missiles under MTCR. Political and economic factors influence states' decisions on acquiring NBC weapons and missiles. Reductions in nuclear weapons and international control regimes have contributed to a decrease in the risk of massive nuclear, biological, or chemical attacks in the last decade. The reduction of nuclear weapons under START and the Moscow Treaty, along with improved safeguarding of nuclear materials, decreases the risk of nuclear war in Europe and North America. The United States has established initiatives to enhance cooperation with allies in controlling sensitive technologies to prevent terrorist acquisition of NBC weapons. However, nuclear threats persist, with Russia possessing thousands of nuclear weapons and a military doctrine that includes the use of nuclear weapons to prevent defeat on the battlefield. Several Russian organizations have provided WMD technology to Iran, North Korea, and other potentially hostile countries. Russian scientists have aided other states' WMD programs. The START Treaty expires in December 2009, and there may be no U.S.-Russian strategic nuclear arms control agreements in the near future. China has joined international agreements on nuclear non-proliferation but is modernizing its nuclear missile capabilities. China is modernizing its nuclear missile force and maintains CW and possibly BW stocks. It provides missile technology to Iran, Pakistan, North Korea, and Syria, and has a threatening posture toward Taiwan. States have adopted export controls and strengthened multilateral control regimes in the areas of nuclear weapons, missile technology, and chemical weapons. Key developments include the indefinite extension of the NPT in 1995, the Additional Protocol for strengthened nuclear safeguards in 1998, and the signing of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty by many countries. The MTCR was created in 1987 to control missile technology, and the Chemical Weapons Convention entered into force in 1997, decreasing the likelihood of large-scale chemical weapons use. The Chemical Weapons Convention entered into force in 1997, reducing the likelihood of large-scale chemical weapons production and use. However, there are concerns about the future of multilateral arms control, with no plans for the US to ratify the CTBT or create a verification protocol under the BWC. Former Director of National Intelligence, John Negroponte, highlighted the challenges in tracking efforts to acquire dual-use technologies and materials for nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. Production technologies and materials for NBC weapons can be obtained by terrorist organizations and criminal groups through suppliers in countries like North Korea, China, and Russia. US intelligence officials are concerned about a second tier of suppliers facilitating the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Director of National Intelligence, John Negroponte, emphasized the challenges in tracking the acquisition of dual-use technologies for weapons. Non-state actors are increasingly capable of providing WMD materials and technology, complicating monitoring efforts. The Khan network may have been damaged, but similar networks could emerge. The risk of nuclear weapons use remains a concern in this new world of proliferation. The risk of nuclear weapons use can be estimated based on factors like the existence of nuclear weapons in various countries, readiness for use, conflict levels, and frustration with long confrontations. As more countries acquire nuclear weapons, the likelihood of their use may increase, especially if control systems are inadequate. The acquisition of nuclear weapons by countries with inadequate command and control systems, vague strategic doctrine, and poor intelligence could increase the risk of nuclear warfare. Key events since the development of nuclear weapons are used to assess this risk, with tensions peaking during the Cuban Missile Crisis in the early 1950s. Risks of confrontation remained high in the 1960s and 1980s, but declined with Gorbachev's opening of the USSR. New risks have emerged in the Middle East, South Asia, and on the Korean Peninsula with the addition of new nuclear weapon states. The threat of nuclear war has diminished over the past decade, but tensions in Kargil and between India and Pakistan pose a significant risk. Concerns exist about the potential tactical use of nuclear weapons in regional conflicts, raising the probability of nuclear war through miscalculation or desperation. The possession of nuclear weapons in regional conflicts raises the risk of nuclear war through miscalculation or desperation. The tense situation in Kashmir has sparked concerns about triggers for a nuclear war in South Asia. Some believe that advancements in nuclear technology, such as smaller yields, could make nuclear weapons more usable and potentially destabilizing. Recent criticism of leaks surrounding the new U.S. Nuclear Posture Review suggests that a resumption of nuclear testing could be viewed as destabilizing by some observers."
