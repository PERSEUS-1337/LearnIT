    "content": "The \"America Rx Act of 2005\" aims to establish an America Rx program using manufacturer rebates and pharmacy discounts to lower prescription drug prices for residents without access to discounted prices. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish the America Rx program to provide discounted prices for outpatient prescription drugs to qualified residents, ensuring that Medicaid beneficiaries, low-income individuals, senior citizens, and the disabled are not disadvantaged. Pharmacies participating in the program will receive timely payment for the discounts they provide. The America Rx program will fully reimburse States for costs incurred, screen individuals for eligibility, provide outreach efforts, and simplify eligibility procedures for qualified residents. The America Rx program will negotiate rebate agreements with manufacturers of outpatient prescription drugs for qualified residents who are not covered by other programs providing substantial benefits towards drug purchases. The America Rx program will negotiate rebates with drug manufacturers for qualified residents based on factors like Medicaid rebates and drug prices to ensure comparable average rebates to those under the Social Security Act. Rebates will be paid to the Secretary on a negotiated schedule. The America Rx program will negotiate rebates with drug manufacturers for qualified residents, paid directly to participating pharmacies. To incentivize manufacturers, the Secretary may deny a deduction for advertising and marketing expenses for manufacturers not entering rebate agreements. Under the America Rx program, rebates received by the Secretary will fund discounts and administrative costs for participating pharmacies. Arrangements are made with pharmacies to provide discounted prescription drugs to qualified residents. Each participating pharmacy in the America Rx program must provide discounts on outpatient prescription drugs for qualified residents, not charge them more than non-qualified residents, and report information on discounts and fees to the Secretary. The America Rx program requires participating pharmacies to promptly reimburse discounted prices to qualified residents and not impose additional fees. The discounts provided to residents must consider rebates obtained and administrative costs, as specified by the Secretary. The America Rx program requires participating pharmacies to reimburse discounted prices to qualified residents without extra fees. The Secretary specifies the method for computing discounts and may arrange with States for program administration, covering reasonable expenses. Administrative functions include determining eligibility, coordinating with pharmacies, and other necessary tasks. In carrying out responsibilities under this section, the Secretary and States may enter into agreements with pharmacy benefit managers and other third parties. Definitions for terms like \"manufacturer,\" \"medicaid program,\" and \"outpatient prescription drug\" are provided. The curr_chunk provides definitions for terms such as \"Secretary\" and \"State\" as used in the Social Security Act."
