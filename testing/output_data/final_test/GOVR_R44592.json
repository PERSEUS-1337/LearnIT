    "content": "The controversy over listing sage-grouse under the Endangered Species Act has been ongoing for over 25 years. Loss of habitat, primarily due to energy development, infrastructure, agriculture, wildfires, and invasive plants, is a significant factor in the decline of sage-grouse populations. Fragmentation of sagebrush lands poses a threat to sage-grouse, as they require large, unfragmented areas for nesting and breeding to avoid avian predators. Human activities like fences, roads, and drilling rigs can drastically alter available sagebrush habitat. The sage-grouse, found in 11 western states, has been a candidate for listing under the Endangered Species Act since 1991. Despite multiple petitions, on September 22, 2015, the Fish and Wildlife Service decided not to list the sage-grouse, citing existing regulatory mechanisms for protection. This decision has received both praise and opposition. The sage-grouse, a bird found in 11 western states, was considered for listing under the Endangered Species Act since 1991. On September 22, 2015, the Fish and Wildlife Service chose not to list it, citing existing regulatory mechanisms. Conservation efforts have been a point of contention, particularly regarding the protection of male sage-grouse gathering areas called leks. These areas are crucial for the bird's reproduction due to its low reproductive rate. The sage-grouse males display at leks to attract females for mating. Females choose mates and then leave to nest alone. Conservation of lek areas is crucial for species preservation. Changes in habitat, like road construction, can impact sage-grouse behavior and reproduction. The presence of roads can have diverse effects on sage-grouse habitat, including providing ingress for invasive species like cheatgrass. Cheatgrass, disliked by grazing mammals and sage-grouse, spreads quickly and increases the risk of fires, which is exacerbated by drought and climate change. Development activities like coal-bed methane production introduce standing water pools that create mosquito habitats. These threats highlight the interconnected challenges facing sage-grouse conservation. The West Nile Virus poses a fatal threat to sage-grouse, with reported cases in all states except Washington. Habitat fragmentation due to various threats like invasive species and development activities is a major concern for sage-grouse conservation, leading to genetic isolation and breeding challenges. Fragmentation severely affects sage-grouse viability, with only two areas providing necessary intact habitat. Population declines and extirpations have occurred, with future fragmentation expected to lead to isolated populations at risk of extinction. Sage-grouse once abundant in 16 states, now found in 11 states. The sage-grouse population has severely declined in 11 states, with estimates ranging from 69% to 99% from historic times. This decline led to eight proposals to list the species under the Endangered Species Act. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) aims to protect plants and animals from extinction by listing species as endangered or threatened. The decision not to list the sage-grouse is discussed, with the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) managing most species under ESA. The Secretary of the Interior, through FWS, decides whether to list a species based on specific criteria. The decision to list a species under the Endangered Species Act is based on five criteria: habitat destruction, overutilization, disease, regulatory inadequacy, and other factors. The Fish and Wildlife Service relies on scientific data and citizen petitions to make listing determinations within specific deadlines. The Fish and Wildlife Service must publish a notice on whether listing a species is warranted, with a final decision to be made within one year. If resources are limited, a listing may be \"warranted but precluded.\" Existing regulatory mechanisms must meet certain criteria to justify not listing a species. A candidate conservation agreement with assurances provides incentives for voluntary conservation measures to potentially avoid listing. Property owners under CCAA receive assurances that no additional obligations will be imposed if the species is listed. Courts have specific criteria for determining the adequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms in the CCAA. Voluntary actions are not considered regulatory unless enforceable. Adequate measures must maintain populations at a level where listing is unnecessary, and plans must be in place, not speculative. No court has deemed voluntary state actions sufficient to avoid federal listing, even if they were effective in the Ninth Circuit's decision on the grizzly bear. The adequacy of regulatory measures in the CCAA is determined based on whether they are sufficient to prevent the need for listing species. Courts consider the types of measures and the size of areas being protected to assess adequacy. In a case involving steelhead trout, state protection plans were deemed voluntary and inadequate, while a federal plan only covered 64% of habitat, leading to the conclusion that the regulatory measures were not adequate to prevent listing. The Ninth Circuit held that a plan for grizzly bears, which was voluntary on some lands but had the force of law on federal lands, was adequate due to federal lands making up 98% of the grizzly's primary conservation area. Regulatory mechanisms must be existing, not future or speculative, with one court requiring a conservation agreement to have a two-year record. The chronology of sage-grouse protection actions from 1999 to 2015 is outlined, including petitions for ESA protection and the decision not to list the species in 2015. Between 1999 and 2005, eight petitions were filed to protect sage-grouse in all or portions of the species' range. In 2004, FWS found three petitions to be substantive, but in 2005, listing was deemed unwarranted. A court decision in 2007 criticized FWS for not using the best science in their decision. This led to a status review in 2008 and a subsequent finding in 2010. In 2010, FWS found that the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms is a significant threat to the greater sage-grouse and announced that listing the species is warranted but precluded by higher priority actions. FWS assigned the sage-grouse a listing priority number of 8. In 2011, FWS agreed to make a decision on listing the sage-grouse by the end of FY2015 after a court settlement. The court held that the FWS decision process was troubling but not arbitrary or capricious. FWS committed to either propose listing the sage-grouse or find it unwarranted by September 30, 2015. The President signed a provision to prohibit funding for a proposed rule before that date. FWS decided not to list the sage-grouse under ESA due to existing regulatory mechanisms. In response to the 2010 FWS finding that sage-grouse warranted ESA listing, collaborative efforts by federal, state, and private landowners were undertaken to conserve the species. These efforts were deemed the most comprehensive conservation effort in the nation's history by Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell. In September 2015, FWS concluded that sage-grouse had adequate existing regulatory mechanisms, thanks to the collaborative actions at various levels. Multiple agencies and landowners were involved in these efforts, including the signing of a memorandum of understanding in 2011 to manage sage-grouse habitat. Wyoming Governor Matt Mead and then-Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar led a meeting to protect sage-grouse across multiple states. Two entities were established: a Sage-Grouse Task Force and a Conservation Objectives Team (COT). The COT issued a report outlining conservation objectives for the sage-grouse, which would guide federal land management agencies and state teams. Concerns were raised by western states about the potential impact of listing the sage-grouse on land use. States were concerned about potential restrictions on land use if the sage-grouse was listed, affecting economic activities like energy development, grazing, and outdoor recreation. To avoid adverse impacts, states implemented conservation measures and developed guidelines with federal agencies. California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, and Wyoming issued conservation plans to protect the sage-grouse and its habitat. Montana, Nevada, and Wyoming issued conservation plans with measures like bag limits, hunting regulations, control of predators, and habitat restoration. The NRCS led voluntary efforts through the Sage-Grouse Initiative, using federal programs to assist farmers and ranchers with conservation practices. The Sage-Grouse Initiative (SGI) aims to improve habitat for birds by implementing grazing systems, removing invasive conifers, and adjusting fences near breeding sites. NRCS has invested over $296 million through 1,289 contracts on 5 million acres between FY2010 and FY2015. SGI 2.0, launched in August 2015, has committed $211 million through FY2018 to conserve over 8 million acres. SGI is part of the Working Lands for Wildlife (WLFW) initiative at NRCS, providing financial and technical assistance to producers for conservation practices benefiting targeted species. The BLM and FS are working on a joint conservation strategy to protect sage-grouse habitat and avoid ESA listing. They manage over half of the sage-grouse habitat, with 45% under BLM and 6% under FS. Efforts include preparing environmental impact statements to incorporate conservation measures into land management plans. The final COT report, along with other research efforts and state conservation plans, contributed to the development of the federal conservation strategy for sage-grouse habitat. In 2013, draft EISs were released by BLM and FS to amend 98 land and resource management plans covering sage-grouse range in 10 states. The final EISs were published in May 2015, with records of decision signed in September 2015. These plans establish management goals and direction for sage-grouse habitat on FS and BLM lands, requiring compliance for any on-the-ground activities within these areas. The land allocations for sage-grouse habitat include Priority Habitat Management Areas (PHMAs) with the highest habitat value, Sagebrush Focal Areas (SFAs) with the highest sage-grouse densities, and General Habitat Management Areas (GHMAs) for seasonal or year-round habitat outside of PHMAs. These areas have varying levels of protection and management prescriptions based on habitat conditions. The FS and BLM plans aim to sustain sage-grouse populations by improving habitat condition, minimizing surface disturbance, and reducing the threat of rangeland fire. Strategies include mitigation measures for development impacts, considering habitat management during livestock grazing permits, monitoring population changes and habitat condition, and adjusting plans to address declines in population or habitat. The plans aim to sustain sage-grouse populations by minimizing surface disturbances in habitat areas, including capping disturbances at different levels. One strategy involves withdrawing approximately 10 million acres of land in specified sage-grouse habitat from mining laws to reduce surface disturbances. During the segregation period, new mining claims in these areas are prohibited. During the segregation period, new mining claims in sage-grouse habitat areas are prohibited. The BLM and FS plans address threats like fire and invasive grasses, with strategies for wildland fire management and post-fire restoration. Supporters praise the collaborative process and safeguards for sage-grouse recovery, while some have expressed opposition. Some environmental organizations object to federal plans for sage-grouse conservation, calling for more protection of habitat. States, industries, and others argue that the plans could restrict land use. Questions arise about federal vs. state conservation efforts and the scientific basis of the plans. Overall concerns persist about the effectiveness of federal, state, and local conservation efforts. The controversy over sage-grouse conservation revolves around the FWS decision not to list the species under the ESA, leading to debates on the impacts of avoiding strong conservation measures. Issues include the efficacy of state management and the validity of federal, state, and local efforts in protecting the species. The controversy over sage-grouse conservation revolves around debates on state vs. federal management, protection measures, grazing restrictions, and economic development impacts on the FWS decision not to list the species under the ESA. Various lawsuits and bills in the 114th Congress address sage-grouse conservation, including preventing delays in listing the species, exempting certain management practices from NEPA, allowing states to develop their own management plans, and reversing prior land withdrawals."
