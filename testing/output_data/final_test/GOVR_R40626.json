    "content": "Based on legislative and postal history, it appears that six-day mail delivery was not legally required until FY1981 when Congress included language in USPS's appropriation. Prior to 1863, postage payments did not include home or office delivery, with an extra two-cent fee for letter delivery to private homes and businesses. By 1888, mail carriers were instructed to deliver letters frequently and promptly, up to four times a day to businesses. The second residential delivery was discontinued in 1950. USPS policies now limit deliveries to one per day. Rural home delivery began in 1896 in West Virginia, leading to the growth of the Post Office Department. In 1976, USPS started studying the effects of reducing delivery days per week. In 1976, USPS conducted a study on reducing delivery days per week. In 1977, the Commission on Postal Service discussed transitioning to five-day delivery, with most members reluctantly recommending the reduction to avoid increased costs or rates causing volume declines. No formal proposal was drafted, but the possibility of eliminating a delivery day was considered. The Commission does not favor increasing public service appropriation for six-day delivery, as it is not considered essential by most citizens. In 1976, USPS had already been reducing services to cut costs, but a resolution in 1977 called for maintaining service delivery days. The House Committee recommended maintaining six-day delivery service, which was criticized for potentially impacting rural customers and employment. Congressional hearings were held from November 1977 to March 1978 in response to USPS's proposal. Patricia Schroeder opened hearings prompted by USPS proposing a cut back in delivery service. Congress held 12 hearings in 12 cities with over 500 testimonies. Most testifiers opposed reducing Postal Service deliveries, citing potential delays in receiving essential mail like welfare and pension checks. The debate over six-day mail delivery raised concerns about USPS's mission as a profit-driven organization or a public service. Representative Timothy E. Wirth emphasized the social value of six-day service, warning that cutting a day would worsen disillusionment with government. In the 95th Congress, 13 bills were introduced affecting Postal Service delivery, but none advanced. In 1980, a proposed $836 million reduction in Postal Service appropriations for FY1981 was discussed. The reduction in appropriations for the Postal Service in 1980 would have eliminated public service appropriations and subsidies, potentially leading to the elimination of 15,000 to 20,000 jobs. Postmaster General William F. Bolger suggested cutting Saturday delivery to save $588 million. This was seen as the only viable option due to anticipated cuts in federal subsidies, prompting USPS employees to form a coalition with affected companies. In response to potential job cuts and service reductions at the Postal Service in 1980, employees and affected companies formed a coalition to lobby Congress. Legislation was introduced to maintain USPS delivery-day standards, including a requirement for six-day delivery in the Omnibus Reconciliation Act (P.L. 96-499). Despite efforts in the 96th and 97th Congress, no bills related to Postal Service delivery were enacted. The Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1981 (P.L. 97-35) mandated six-day mail delivery by the Postal Service during fiscal years 1982 through 1984. This was the only instance where Congress included such a requirement in authorizing legislation. Since 1984, Congress has annually required the Postal Service to maintain six-day delivery at 1983 levels, although the reason for choosing 1983 as the benchmark year is unclear. The Postal Regulatory Commission has noted that the interpretation of this mandate is problematic due to multiple possible meanings. Interpretations of the mandate regarding six-day delivery are varied. One interpretation suggests that areas receiving 6-day delivery in 1983 must continue to receive it, while another suggests the same percentage of customers should receive it today. The Postal Service has flexibility in determining mail delivery, leading to potential differences in addresses receiving 6-day service now compared to 1983. USPS wants Congress to remove the six-day mail delivery requirement for flexibility due to financial burden caused by declining mail volume. USPS is seeking legislative action to remove the six-day mail delivery requirement to reduce operational costs by approximately $3 billion. Moving to a five-day delivery schedule would increase the average daily mail delivery to five pieces, ensuring financial viability. Delivery and collections would be discontinued on Saturdays under the plan. Under the plan to reduce operational costs, USPS would discontinue mail delivery and collections on Saturdays. However, post offices open on Saturdays would remain open, Post Office Boxes would still receive mail, Express Mail would be delivered seven days a week, and online services would be available 24/7. Bulk mail acceptance and drop shipping would continue on weekends, and alternate contract locations could remain open seven days a week. USPS customers will be given at least six months' notice before any change in delivery days occurs, with no change before mid-2011. USPS took the first step towards five-day delivery on March 30, 2010, by submitting testimony to the PRC. The submission detailed anticipated savings, including fuel and vehicle repair costs. The USPS submitted a plan to the PRC on March 30, 2010, detailing the anticipated savings of $3 billion per year from moving to five-day delivery. The savings would mainly come from labor and fuel costs, with additional savings from processing, transportation, maintenance, and reduced employee benefit obligations. However, there is an expected $0.2 billion loss due to a slight impact on sales volume. The USPS plan to move to five-day delivery was submitted to the PRC on March 30, 2010, with anticipated savings of $3 billion per year. The PRC held field hearings in various locations to gather public comments on the proposal, receiving a total of 21,711 comments by December 1, 2010. The PRC received 21,711 comments regarding the USPS's proposal to transition to five-day delivery. Out of these, 3,332 were in favor of the move while 16,449 were against it. The PRC's advisory opinion highlighted discrepancies in USPS's cost savings estimates if Saturday delivery were eliminated. The USPS estimated a potential loss of $0.4 billion if Saturday delivery were eliminated, with concerns raised about a 25% delay in processing and delivery of mail. The impact on customers in rural or remote areas was not evaluated. Various bills in Congress address maintaining six-day delivery or transitioning to five-day delivery. On March 2, 2011, Representative Sam Graves introduced H.Res. 137 to express the House's support for continuing six-day mail delivery. The resolution highlighted the importance of timely delivery for Social Security recipients and raised concerns about potential delays and increased costs if delivery was reduced to five days a week. The House of Representatives supports the continuation of 6-day mail delivery by the United States Postal Service. H.Res. 137 was introduced by Representative Sam Graves on March 2, 2011, but no further action has been taken. A related bill, H.R. 2309, introduced by Representative Darrell Issa, proposes moving to five-day delivery. H.R. 2309, introduced by Representative Darrell Issa, proposes a reduction in mail delivery days. The bill was referred to various committees and eventually reported with an amendment giving the Postmaster General authority to cut 12 delivery days per year. The amendment to H.R. 2309 allows USPS to designate up to 12 non-delivery days, excluding Sundays and holidays. USPS employees would be compensated for these days as if they were delivery days. After six months, USPS could request an advisory opinion to move to five-day delivery, and 90 days after the PRC's opinion, Saturday delivery could be eliminated. This is similar to a previous bill introduced by Representative Chaffetz in the 111th Congress. Senator Carper introduced S. 1010 in the 111th Congress, giving USPS authority for five-day delivery. Senator McCain introduced a companion bill, S. 1625, for the same purpose. Another bill, S. 1789, by Senators Lieberman and Collins, would also allow USPS to make changes. The bill introduced by Senator Carper in the 111th Congress, along with companion bills by Senator McCain and Senators Lieberman and Collins, would allow USPS to eliminate Saturday delivery after meeting specific preconditions, including a 24-month waiting period and developing a plan to mitigate negative impacts on disadvantaged customers. The bill introduced by Senator Carper in the 111th Congress, along with companion bills by Senator McCain and Senators Lieberman and Collins, would allow USPS to eliminate Saturday delivery after meeting specific preconditions, including a 24-month waiting period and developing a plan to mitigate negative impacts on disadvantaged customers. S. 1789 would prohibit a move to six-day delivery without the GAO's determination, which would be required to support USPS's assertion that eliminating a delivery day was necessary. The bill S. 1789 prohibits USPS from moving to six-day delivery without GAO's determination. It was passed in the Senate on April 25, 2012, and sent to the House. H.R. 3591 and S. 1853 are companion bills with new authorities for USPS and language against five-day delivery. H.R. 3744, the Rural Service Protection Act, mandates USPS to maintain current delivery levels in rural areas for five years. The bill H.R. 3744, known as the Rural Service Protection Act, defines a \"rural\" post office and mandates USPS to maintain current delivery levels in rural areas for five years. No further action has been taken on the bill since it was referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on December 20, 2011. Since 1976, studies have shown that USPS could save money by reducing delivery to five days. In 1976, an act created a commission to address USPS economic issues. The commission found that rising labor costs were a challenge for the Postal Service. Freeman suggested four possible actions to help USPS remain financially stable: increase efficiency, raise postal rates, increase appropriations, or reduce service levels. He criticized six-day delivery as an \"extravagance\" and suggested that if recipients had to pay for mail delivery, they might not want the current elaborate system. Eliminating six-day service in rural areas could save USPS over $400 million annually. Chairman James Rademacher disagreed with the commission's recommendation to eliminate six-day delivery, citing potential negative impacts on senior citizens and farmers. He expressed concerns about job security for Postal Service employees. A task force was established by Postmaster General William F. Bolger to study the effects of moving to a five-day delivery schedule. The task force studied the potential savings of moving to five-day delivery, estimating $588 million in the first year and over $1 billion annually in the future. Despite the cost savings, concerns were raised about potential negative impacts on service levels and postal revenues. The task force recommended a 12- to 18-month planning period before any action, but no such period occurred. If five-day delivery were to be implemented, Saturday was suggested as the day to be eliminated. The task force recommended eliminating Saturday delivery to save costs, but the President's Commission on the USPS rejected immediate action. While cutting one delivery day could save $1.9 billion, it could harm the postal service's value to the economy. The President's Commission on the USPS rejected the task force's recommendation to eliminate Saturday delivery, citing concerns about the impact on business mailers and logistics. The commission acknowledged the decreasing demand for mail services due to electronic mail but advised maintaining six-day service for now. USPS studies suggested that cutting a delivery day could save $3.5 billion annually. The USPS study found that eliminating a delivery day could save $3.5 billion per year, while the PRC study estimated savings at $1.93 billion. The PRC study noted a lower total savings due to an expected loss in sales volume. USPS did not endorse continuing six-day delivery, but the PRC study emphasized the need for flexibility in delivery obligations. Congress should balance the public interest in a universal standard of delivery with the Postal Service's need for flexibility to control costs. On March 30, 2010, USPS released a report estimating $3 billion in annual savings by eliminating Saturday mail delivery due to declining mail volume. The report also highlighted reductions in energy use and carbon emissions. Other countries like the UK's Royal Mail have considered similar cost-saving measures. Royal Mail considered eliminating Saturday delivery in 2008 due to economic concerns but maintained six-day delivery, generating \u00a3211 million in profit in 2012. All pension liabilities were transferred to the UK Government in 2012. Canada Post offers letter carrier services five days a week and does not deliver mail or parcels on most Saturdays. Canada Post, unlike USPS, contracts out much of its rural delivery service and experienced its first operating deficit in 16 years in FY2011. A joint hearing in 1996 discussed mail delivery services worldwide, with Canada Post being a topic of discussion. The Government Accountability Office compared Canada Post to USPS due to similarities in size and economic systems. Despite differences in mail volume and employees, issues regarding universal mail service could arise in the US. USPS remains crucial for communication across the country. USPS is a vital asset for communication in the US, delivering mail to millions of homes six days a week. Economic hardships and reduced mail volume have put a strain on USPS financially. One proposed solution is to reduce service delivery to five days a week. While most of USPS funding comes from sources other than congressional appropriations, using legislation to restrict funding could be challenged. Failure to comply with such restrictions could have consequences. Until a forum in 2010, USPS officials had not considered reducing delivery days. USPS officials initially did not consider reducing delivery days as a solution to their revenue shortage. However, they are now considering eliminating Saturday delivery as a cost-cutting option. Other cost-cutting measures include paying less into the fund for future retiree benefits, raising stamp prices, and closing less-used post offices. Moving to five-day delivery could save USPS between $1.7 and $3.5 billion annually, depending on mail volume reduction. Even the highest estimated savings of $3.5 billion is significantly less than the $11.5 billion budget shortfall in FY2012. Moving to five-day delivery could save USPS between $1.7 and $3.5 billion annually, depending on mail volume reduction. Representative Chaffetz introduced an amendment to H.R. 2309 that would give the Postmaster General the authority to cut 12 delivery days, with USPS employees receiving pay for those days. It is unclear how much money closing USPS for 12 additional days per year would save, as most costs are labor-related. H.R. 2309 also allows USPS to request an advisory opinion on a move to five-day delivery six months after enactment. The USPS is considering a move to five-day delivery to save money due to declining mail volume. The President's Commission on Postal Service did not endorse this move in 1977, but it may be revisited. Concerns include maintaining service quality on a reduced schedule. USPS projects further declines in mail volume due to economic factors and electronic alternatives. Potter suggested in his congressional testimony that reducing mail volume could lead to fewer mail pieces delivered on each of the six current delivery days. Congress may consider removing the six-day delivery provision to allow USPS to save money on employee pay and fuel costs. However, this could result in fewer people using USPS services and relying on private companies for mail delivery. Some customers depend on six-day delivery for essential items like baby formula, prescription drugs, and social security checks, which could cause additional stress if delivery is slowed down. The American Postal Workers Union opposes reducing delivery days, citing potential delays in essential mail and increased reliance on private carriers. The Postal Regulatory Commission found that eliminating Saturday delivery would delay 25% of First Class Mail and Priority Mail by two days. USPS's proposal includes ending Saturday home and business delivery. USPS's recent proposal involves eliminating Saturday home and business delivery while maintaining Saturday window service at post offices. This could lead to increased workload for employees at post office locations on Saturdays, potentially causing slower service and longer lines for customers. USPS suggested to the PRC that customers who want Saturday mail delivery services could rent a Post Office Box or use Express Mail. USPS may extend post office hours on Saturdays for box holders to retrieve mail, with no immediate plans to raise Saturday delivery costs for Express Mail. Congress could decide which day to eliminate if reducing USPS delivery days, with past studies recommending Saturday delivery cut due to cost-effectiveness. The USPS proposed eliminating Saturday delivery as a cost-effective option, with the possibility of also eliminating Wednesday delivery. The rationale behind eliminating Saturday delivery is that it has the lowest daily volume and many businesses are closed on Saturdays. Congress may decide to maintain all six delivery days or allow USPS to cut Saturday delivery. Congress may permit USPS to eliminate Saturday delivery due to low mail volume. They could also suggest ending Wednesday delivery to avoid three consecutive days without mail. Congress may consider adopting Canada Post's six-day delivery during peak times only. Another option is to delegate USPS the authority to switch between six and five-day delivery based on mail volume fluctuations. This flexibility may cause confusion for customers. USPS could also be allowed to charge more for Saturday delivery services. Congress could potentially grant USPS the flexibility to charge more for Saturday delivery services, similar to New Zealand. This could help USPS operate with a streamlined weekend delivery staff, reducing work hours and saving costs. However, this option may negatively impact individuals who rely on Saturday delivery for essential items. Implementing methods used by foreign countries to improve mail services, such as contracting out carrier service, may be challenging in the unique economic situation of USPS due to union contracts and geographic factors."
