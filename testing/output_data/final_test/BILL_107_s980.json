    "content": "The Act titled \"Anton's Law\" aims to improve the safety of child restraints in passenger motor vehicles. The Secretary of Transportation will establish performance requirements for child restraints, including booster seats, for children over 50 pounds within 12 months of the Act's enactment. Criteria for injury performance and seat belt fit with booster seats will be considered in the rulemaking process. The Secretary of Transportation will establish performance requirements for child restraints, including booster seats, for children over 50 pounds within 12 months of the Act's enactment. The rulemaking process will consider criteria for injury performance, seat belt fit with booster seats, and potential solutions for children over 40 pounds with only lap belts available. The definition of \"booster seat\" in Federal motor vehicle safety standard No. 213 will also be reviewed to ensure comprehensiveness. The rulemaking proceeding must be completed within 30 months of the Act's enactment. The Secretary of Transportation will provide a report on the development of a crash test dummy simulating a 10-year-old child for testing child restraints in passenger vehicles. Additionally, there are requirements for the installation of lap and shoulder belts. The Secretary of Transportation will amend Federal motor vehicle safety standard No. 208 to require lap and shoulder belt assemblies for rear designated seating positions in passenger vehicles with a gross weight rating of 10,000 pounds or less. Exclusions may apply if installation is not feasible. The requirement for lap and shoulder belt assemblies in passenger motor vehicles will be phased in on a production year basis, starting within 12 months after the regulations are prescribed. The final rule applies to vehicles with a gross weight rating of 10,000 pounds or less in the third production year. If it is deemed impractical to install these belts in a specific seating position, exclusions may be considered. The Secretary must report to the Senate and House committees on reasons for determining the position in a motor vehicle, with a deadline of 30 days after issuing a final rule. SEC. 5 amends the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century to extend the Child Passenger Protection Education Grants Program through 2003. SEC. 6 establishes grants for improving child passenger safety programs. The Secretary will establish criteria for child restraint laws by October 1, 2002, for grants under this section. Grants will be given to States and Indian tribes with child restraint laws by September 30, 2004, with a limit of one grant per recipient. The requirement for child restraint laws will commence on October 1, 2004. States or Indian tribes will receive a grant amount equal to five times the amount provided in fiscal year 2003 under the Transportation Equity Act. The grant must be used for child passenger protection programs, including educating the public on proper child restraint use. The grant provided under the child restraint laws must be used for programs such as training professionals, providing child restraint systems to families in need, and supporting enforcement of the law. The Federal share of the program cost cannot exceed 80 percent. The administrative expenses for the child restraint law grant program cannot exceed five percent of the available grant amount. The provisions of section 402(d) apply to funds for this program as if they were highway safety funds.
