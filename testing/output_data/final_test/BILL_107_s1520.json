    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"State Bioterrorism Preparedness Act\". Congress finds that state governments are crucial partners in national security, especially in combating domestic terrorism. Information sharing is vital for terrorism preparedness. Coordination with various healthcare providers is essential to prevent biological terrorist attacks. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have a solid structure to combat terrorism but require more resources for expansion. There are numerous infectious agents and toxins, but only a small subset pose physical and biological threats. Most biological weapons programs focus on 10 to 15 agents with characteristics like ease of production, infectivity, and ability to cause illness. A comprehensive strategy is crucial to prevent and prepare for a biological attack, involving federal, state, local, and private sectors. The intelligence community needs to enhance its use for better prevention. The intelligence community should collaborate with biomedical, medical, public health, and human service communities for bioterrorism preparedness. Enhancing domestic preparedness includes developing surveillance, diagnostic capabilities, surge capacity for healthcare, pharmaceutical stockpiling, and research for new pharmaceuticals. Developing a clear strategy for working with the media is also important. The Administration of President Clinton strengthened public health infrastructure by creating a pharmaceutical stockpile, awarding contracts for new vaccines, and investing in new technologies for detecting biological agents. The effort to accelerate technologies for detecting biological agents requires more funding and energy to address today's threats. SEC. 3. GRANTS TO IMPROVE STATE PREPAREDNESS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will award grants to States for bioterrorism preparedness and response through the Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Initiative. States must submit an application with a plan for detecting and responding to bioterrorism to be eligible for the grant. The State will manage detection and response efforts, coordinate with national efforts, work with emergency responders, healthcare providers, and governmental agencies, build local infrastructures, stockpile medications and supplies, assess the threat of attacks, and have a communication plan for public information dissemination. The curr_chunk discusses the dissemination of information to the public regarding biological or chemical threats, training initiatives for local emergency personnel, cleanup and contamination prevention efforts, coordination with organizations for necessary supplies, and State mechanisms for bioterrorism efforts. The curr_chunk outlines State mechanisms for improving health care infrastructure, conducting practice drills for biological or chemical attacks, assessing public health laws related to bioterrorism, designating a State official as a liaison to Homeland Security, and stating general goals and needs for bioterrorism. The curr_chunk outlines the use of funds received under a grant to carry out activities related to preparing for and preventing biological or chemical attacks, surveillance and detection, improving communication and coordination efforts, enhancing emergency response capabilities, and making public health infrastructure improvements. The curr_chunk details activities funded by a grant for rapid disease detection, improving laboratories, public health response, information technology, training healthcare workers, developing electronic reporting systems, and collaborating with states. The grant funds cooperative efforts with hospitals, providing $5,000,000 plus additional funding based on state population. Small states receive a minimum of 1 percent of the total appropriation. The Secretary reserves 1 percent of the appropriation for grants to Indian tribes and tribal organizations. Guidelines will determine eligibility. The General Accounting Office must submit annual reports on state progress in preparing for biological or chemical attacks, with recommendations for improvement. Authorization of Appropriations: $250,000,000 for base allocations and $200,000,000 for allocations based on State population for fiscal years 2002 through 2006. Definition of \"State\" includes several States, the District of Columbia, and other U.S. territories. SEC. 4. PROVISION OF INFORMATION BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. The Federal Government must provide states with information on probable agents, bioterrorism plans, best practices for biological or chemical attacks, emergency health information, training, and emergency response information. The Secretary will provide states with bioterrorism-related emergency information, resources for training data, and critical health and safety information during times of war or heightened threat. Coordination to avoid duplication of efforts is required. $50,000,000 is authorized annually for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to develop best practices for biological or chemical attacks. A State Security Coordinator position will be established. The Assistant Director for State Coordination position will be established within the Office of Homeland Security to act as a liaison between the Office and the States. Development of communications systems will be a focus under Section 5. The Secretary will establish a national communications system for exchanging emergency health information, develop a national emergency communication plan for biological or chemical terrorism events, and create a website with training and emergency information by December 31, 2002. The Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must complete the system, plan, and website by December 31, 2002, as authorized by the Secretary. Authorization of appropriations is provided for this purpose. SEC. 6. SIMULATIONS. The Secretary will award grants to States for biological or chemical attack simulations. The Director of the CDC will provide exercises for these simulations within 6 months. States must complete at least one simulation by December 31, 2002. The Secretary will conduct simulations in three States after providing notice. Authorization of appropriations is included. Authorization of appropriations is provided for carrying out this section."
