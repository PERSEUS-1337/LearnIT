    "content": "The \"Dietary Supplement Access and Awareness Act\" is cited as the short title. It amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act by adding provisions for product listing, reporting, postmarket surveillance, and safety measures regarding dietary supplements. The Dietary Supplement Access and Awareness Act excludes certain dietary supplements from its regulations if they contain vitamins, minerals, or combinations of these ingredients, but not herbs, amino acids, or other dietary substances. Every person manufacturing or processing a dietary supplement must report to the Secretary twice a year with a list of products, their labeling, and major ingredients. The Secretary may require a quantitative listing of all ingredients in a supplement if necessary. If a person discontinues manufacturing a reported supplement, they must provide notice, date of discontinuance, and supplement identity. Additional information may be required by the Secretary. Each manufacturer or distributor of a dietary supplement must report serious adverse experiences to the Secretary within 15 days of receiving the information. They are also required to promptly investigate and report any additional information on the adverse experience within the same timeframe. The Secretary may establish additional requirements for reporting adverse experiences related to dietary supplements to protect public health, including waivers for certain information if deemed unnecessary for public health protection. The term 'adverse experience regarding a dietary supplement' refers to any associated adverse event. The term 'serious' in relation to adverse experiences with dietary supplements includes events such as death, life-threatening conditions, hospitalization, disability, birth defects, and pregnancy complications. The Secretary may require postmarket surveillance for a dietary supplement if serious adverse health consequences are possible. If a supplement is believed to be adulterated, the manufacturer may be ordered to demonstrate its safety. \"A dietary supplement may not be considered adulterated during the demonstration process by the manufacturer and review by the Secretary. The timeframe for the demonstration is specified in the order.\" The manufacturer must complete the demonstration within 180 days of the order issuance, with a possible extension granted by the Secretary. Any information submitted after this period may not be considered unless requested by the Secretary. The manufacturer's demonstration under paragraph (1) must be completed within 180 days, with a possible extension granted by the Secretary. The Secretary will review all relevant information received for the demonstration once completed. The Secretary will review the manufacturer's demonstration within 180 days to determine if the dietary supplement is adulterated under section 402(f)(1). Requirements for demonstrations may be established by the Secretary. This does not prevent the Secretary from taking action under section 402(f)(1) for supplements without a demonstration. The Secretary will establish criteria for determining if a dietary supplement poses a significant risk to minors within two years of the enactment of the Dietary Supplement Access and Awareness Act. This determination can be made even if a supplement has been previously deemed not adulterated under section 402(f)(1). The Secretary may make a determination regarding the sale of a dietary supplement to minors, which would result in the supplement being deemed misbranded. Manufacturers of dietary supplements will be required to maintain records on safety issues. Manufacturers of dietary supplements must keep records of serious adverse experiences and compliance with regulations. Retention periods for these records will be specified, with a minimum of one year after the expiration date of supplements. Additionally, the amendment prohibits certain acts related to the sale of dietary supplements to minors. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to address non-compliance with requirements for dietary supplements and court procedures related to adulterated supplements. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to address non-compliance with requirements for dietary supplements, including inspection authority and trade secrets. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to address non-compliance with requirements for dietary supplements, including inspection authority and trade secrets. The act is further amended to address adulteration under section 402(f)(1) and make adjustments to paragraph (2). SEC. 3. EDUCATION PROGRAMS REGARDING DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS.
