    "content": "Routing models have shown promising results in recent works, but have lacked architectural diversity and large numbers of routing decisions. Adding architectural diversity significantly improves performance, cutting error rates by 35%. However, scaling up routing depth poses challenges in optimization. Neural networks with input-dependent processing offer potential for improved performance through specialized processing, unlike static neural networks. This approach remains underexplored compared to static networks, with potential benefits in parameter efficiency and reduced computation. Input-dependent processing involves utilizing different subnetworks for processing different categories of objects, which could lead to better optimization and future research directions. Input-dependent processing in neural networks involves per-example routing within a network, where different examples are processed by different experts in a larger model. This allows experts to specialize to subsets of the input domain, with routing learned jointly with expert parameters. Routing models have typically used small, homogeneous networks with the same architectural unit for each expert, differing only in parameters. The diversity of input examples could benefit from a diversity of architectural units with varying parameters. In this work, the authors address deficiencies in routing models by introducing a simple trick to reduce overfitting and by showing how architectural diversity in routing models can represent a broad family of models. They discuss the limitations of using homogeneous experts and the benefits of increasing the number of routing decisions to improve representational power. Scaling up the number of routing decisions can lead to better performance and generalization of powerful models. In this study, the authors explore the impact of architectural diversity in routing models on performance. They demonstrate that diverse routing models outperform baselines by 35% on an Omniglot setup. Scaling up the number of routing decisions on CIFAR-10 shows competitive performance but decreased accuracy due to optimization challenges. The findings highlight the importance of diversity in achieving strong performance and suggest future research directions for routing models. The text discusses the need to automatically infer architectures for each example by defining a single large model with numerous subnetworks. This framework allows for example-dependent routing through a supernetwork, encouraging expert specialization and critical learning to route examples to well-matched experts. The text discusses the importance of learning to route examples to well-matched experts through a small neural network called a router in a supernetwork framework. The router uses intermediate representations to determine the next expert to use, and can be trained using reinforcement learning techniques like noisy top-k gating. The text discusses the use of noisy top-k gating in a routing model to control the number of routes taken by examples, with the hyperparameter k playing a crucial role in balancing weight sharing and specialization. To prevent overfitting, a technique called k-annealing is introduced, where the value of k decreases gradually across the layers of the routing model. In practice, k-annealing is used in the routing model to balance weight sharing and specialization. Noisy top-k gating can lead to the model collapsing to using only a few experts, so additional losses like importance loss are used to balance expert utilization. In our models, we use importance loss and load loss as defined in BID44. Previous routing works typically use a homogeneous set of experts with the same architecture but different parameter values. We introduce architectural diversity in routing models to address the need for different architectural units for processing different examples. This diversity allows experts to have different architectures and parameters to better handle varying input requirements. In routing models, architectural diversity is introduced to allow experts to have different architectures and parameters for handling varying input requirements. This can be seen in models like feedforward networks with multiple layers. Introducing diversity in routing models can be viewed as a way to generalize different computational models, such as conv-7x7 for large receptive fields or skip connections for identity operations. This approach can be seen as a way to generalize recently proposed models like one-shot neural architecture search models. Routing models with diversity can implement complex architectures with powerful representational capacity. For example, a neural architecture search cell can be implemented using a one-shot architecture search model. This model consists of stacking the same cell structure multiple times. The inputs to each cell are routed through the same path, similar to task-based routing models like Pathnet. The model in BID2 stacks the same cell structure multiple times, with inputs from previous cells. Choice blocks within each cell make decisions on inputs and convolutional operations. A router selects between different operations like convolution and pooling. This architecture can be implemented as a diverse routing model, where each example is routed differently. This differs from BID2, which uses a single path for all examples. Adding diversity improves representational power in one respect, but another important dimension is routing depth. As networks have gotten deeper, their modeling performance has improved. Routing models need to be able to scale to large depths, which is feasible on modern hardware due to block-sparse structure. Most routing works have focused on small scale models, but BID44 was the first to build models with hundreds of billions of parameters. In contrast to the focus on parameters in BID44, this study examines the impact of routing depth on representational power. Routing depth, defined as the number of internal routing decisions made, plays a crucial role in the path count and model optimization. The experiment aims to evaluate the tradeoff between routing depth and ease of optimization by focusing on noisy top-k gating. The goal is to determine the feasibility of scaling up the routing depth n with modern hardware. Our study focuses on the impact of routing depth on model capacity and optimization. We explore the feasibility of scaling up routing depth n using conditional computation techniques, which allow for increased model capacity without a proportional increase in computational cost. Our approach differs from previous methods by utilizing diverse experts and benchmarking with a larger routing depth. The paper emphasizes the importance of using diverse experts and explores routing models with a small routing depth. It builds on the mixture of experts field and utilizes noisy top-k gating for selecting architectural components. Diverse routing networks generalize many neural architecture search methods and have shown improvements in automated search techniques like neural architecture search. The techniques used in neural network architecture search focus on improving training efficiency by sharing parameters between candidate architectures. Unlike static models, routing models vary per example, offering input-dependent solutions. Other input-dependent models include tree-structured recursive neural networks and parameter prediction models. In parameter prediction works, each example passes through the same architecture, but the parameters differ. Diverse routing models have a changing architecture while parameters remain static. Future work aims to combine these ideas for an extremely flexible model. Experts can capture dataset structure with noisy top-k gating before testing diversity and increasing routing depth. A routing model on MNIST has 3 shared layers and an expert layer with 5 experts and k = 2. Examples from the same class tend to be routed through the same pair of experts. Experts in a particular class tend to focus on specific classes, as shown by routing examples through the same pair of experts. Normalization is used to stabilize results in experiments. Routing models with architectural diversity are benchmarked on an Omniglot multi-task learning setup with 50 distinct alphabets. Each alphabet is treated as a separate task for predicting character identity. The dataset used for benchmarking consists of 6680 training examples split into training/validation/test sets with 20 alphabets. The baseline technique, CMTR, utilizes automated architecture search on multiple tasks but has limitations in scalability. In contrast, the diverse routing model can easily scale to many tasks using a convolutional neural network with shared and expert layers. Each task has a separate linear readout layer and task-specific embeddings for improved performance. The diverse routing model utilizes different types of experts and k-annealing technique to prevent overfitting. It outperforms the previous state-of-the-art with a 35% error reduction. The routing models have fewer parameters compared to the best models, demonstrating the effectiveness of the CMTR method in modifying parameter count for improved performance. The diverse routing model, with proper regularization, succeeds in low-resource tasks and outperforms CMTR. It takes less than an hour to train on a single GPU and effectively performs architecture search. An ablation study on Omniglot shows the importance of architectural diversity for achieving good results. The ablation study explores the impact of using different sets of experts in routing models. Results show that models with diverse architectural components outperform those with less diversity. Using a variety of convolutions, pooling, and identity operations simplifies modeling and improves performance in routing models. In a study comparing homogeneous and diverse models in routing models, a modified ResNet-50 was used with different types of experts. The all-experts model was compared to a homogeneous model, with similar parameter counts. Doubling the number of training steps improved results for both models. The study involved tuning a final model with the best hyperparameter setting on the whole training set and evaluating it on the test set. Results showed that the performance of diverse models compared to homogeneous models is dataset dependent. Adding diversity of operations to models can create routing models that work well for different datasets without requiring much tuning. Future routing works should combine operation diversity with operation cloning and scale up the routing depth to evaluate the performance of noisy top-k gating in making a large number of decisions. The experiment involves routing models making 48 or 96 decisions, significantly more than prior works, on the CIFAR-10 dataset to ensure routing decisions play a significant role in model performance. The neural architecture search cell of BID2 is used to maximize performance by tuning operations. Two models with 6 and 12 cells are experimented with, each having a different number of internal decisions. The routing models perform competitively but have more parameters compared to one-shot and all-on models. The routing models in the study perform competitively but have more parameters compared to one-shot and all-on models. The 12-cell model slightly underperforms both 6-cell models, indicating that the complicated optimization of routing models may hurt performance. In this work, diversity was introduced to routing models and the impact of increasing routing depth was explored. Architectural diversity was found to significantly improve performance, but the effect of routing depth remains uncertain due to optimization challenges. While routing models show promise, practitioners still prefer static models for their simplicity and reliability. Successful application of routing models on large scale problems could lead to wider adoption. Routing models benefit from architectural diversity to enhance performance on large scale tasks. However, the optimization challenge of routing depth hinders their success. Researchers are urged to develop methods for scaling routing models effectively. Despite obstacles, routing models are expected to be crucial in future neural networks."
