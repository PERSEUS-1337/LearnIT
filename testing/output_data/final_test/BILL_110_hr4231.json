    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Rural Veterans Health Care Access Act of 2007\". The findings are also included in the Act. Congress finds that a significant number of veterans returning from Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. There is a shortage of mental health professionals in the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense. The healthcare system for veterans is overwhelmed, especially in rural areas where access to facilities is limited. Veterans often require long-term and personalized care for mental ailments acquired during deployment. The Veterans Health Administration system for long-term mental health care is stressful and needs improvement to better serve veterans' needs. The pilot program aims to provide mental health services to certain veterans of contingency operations. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will establish a pilot program to offer mental health counseling to eligible veterans who served in support of a contingency operation and reside at least 30 miles from a VA medical facility. Eligible veterans must be diagnosed with a mental health condition recommended for counseling by a certified provider. The Department of Veterans Affairs will issue six-month supply vouchers for counseling services to eligible veterans under a pilot program. Veterans can request additional vouchers after five months. The Department of Veterans Affairs will issue six-month supply vouchers for counseling services to eligible veterans. Veterans can request additional vouchers, and the Secretary will issue them within 30 days. A list of service providers accepting the vouchers as payment will be maintained. Compliance with department protocols is required for mental health counseling. The Department of Veterans Affairs requires mental health care providers on the list to comply with department protocols before providing services under the pilot program. Eligible veterans can use vouchers for family counseling services, and the Secretary will reimburse providers at a specified rate. The Department of Veterans Affairs will reimburse mental health providers at TRICARE rates or Medicare rates for services provided to veterans using vouchers. The pilot program will be implemented in specific Veterans Integrated Service Networks. The Secretary's authority to conduct a pilot program for veterans' mental health services will end five years after enactment. A study on the program's effectiveness will be conducted within four years, with a recommendation on whether to extend or expand the program. If recommended, the Secretary may extend or expand the program."
