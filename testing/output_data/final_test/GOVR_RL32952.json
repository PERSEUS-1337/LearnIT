    "content": "The Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies (L-HHS-ED) Appropriations Act, 2006, was signed into law on December 30, 2005, providing $143.0 billion in discretionary appropriations. The Senate and House had differing versions of the bill, with the Senate proposing $153.7 billion and the House proposing $143.0 billion. The President's FY2006 budget request was for $141.7 billion in discretionary funds for L-HHS-ED programs. The FY2006 L-HHS-ED appropriations request was for $141.7 billion in discretionary funds. Data on FY2005 appropriations and FY2006 proposals are based on the H.R. 3010 conference agreement, signed into law as P.L. 109-149. FY2006 amounts are pre-rescission and exclude supplemental funding for hurricane relief and pandemic influenza preparedness. FY2005 enacted amounts are post-reduction, accounting for cuts required by P.L. 108-447. The report compares the President's FY2006 proposal for L-HHS-ED programs to the FY2005 amounts. It tracks legislative action and congressional issues related to the appropriations. The report summarizes legislative action and congressional issues related to the L-HHS-ED appropriations bill, focusing on discretionary programs. It does not cover mandatory programs like Medicare or Social Security. The L-HHS-ED bill is known for controversy due to its size. The L-HHS-ED appropriations bill is controversial due to its size and scope, providing discretionary funds for federal departments and agencies. It is the largest single source of discretionary funds for domestic federal programs, accounting for $142.4 billion in FY2005. The L-HHS-ED appropriations bill is the largest single source of discretionary funds for domestic federal programs, totaling $822.7 billion in FY2005. The proposed funding changes for FY2006 include discretionary and mandatory appropriations, advance appropriations, and earmarks for specific projects. Program level appropriations reflect total discretionary appropriations in a given bill, including advance funding for future years. The report specifies appropriations levels, including current year discretionary appropriations, advance appropriations, and scorekeeping adjustments. Program level appropriations and current year appropriations are used as summary measures due to appropriations being a mix of budget authority enacted in different years. The report specifies appropriations levels, including current year discretionary appropriations, advance appropriations, and scorekeeping adjustments. Program level funding equals current year plus advances for future years, minus advances from prior years, and minus scorekeeping adjustments. The President's FY2006 budget request was submitted to Congress after the FY2005 appropriations were signed into law. Congressional consideration of appropriations requests focuses on proposed funding changes for FY2006 discretionary budget authority. The FY2006 budget request for L-HHS-ED included a decrease of $1.8 billion (1.3%) compared to FY2005, totaling $141.7 billion in discretionary appropriations.

Overall, $56.7 billion in discretionary funds would be provided for the Department of Education, with $6.4 billion for SSA Administrative Expenses. Additionally, $400 million would be allocated for the CPB for FY2008, with a rescission of $100 million from FY2006 CPB funds. The House bill proposed $11.5 billion in discretionary funds for related agencies, with no rescission of FY2006 CPB funds. The Senate version of the bill allocated $153.7 billion for L-HHS-ED programs for FY2006, higher than the House and President's requests. The Senate bill proposed $11.9 billion in discretionary appropriations for DOL programs, $0.2 billion more than the House and $0.3 billion more than the request, but $0.2 billion less than in FY2005.

The bill H.R. 3010 was passed by the House on December 14, 2005, and approved by the Senate on December 21, 2005. It was signed into law on December 30, 2005, as P.L. 109 - 148, which required a 1% cut of most FY2006 discretionary amounts. The FY2006 L-HHS-ED discretionary funding total was $143.0 billion, compared to $143.5 billion in FY2005. In FY2006, discretionary funding for major departments like DOL, HHS, and ED was reduced compared to FY2005 levels. Mandatory L-HHS-ED spending was projected to increase by over $100 billion. DOL's WIA program received $225 million less than in FY2005, with reductions in funding for the Community College program and Unemployment Compensation. Overall, DOL received $11.6 billion in discretionary funding, $0.5 billion less than in FY2005. In FY2006, DOL received $11.6 billion in discretionary funding, $0.5 billion less than in FY2005.

Section 108 mandates DOL to submit an operating plan outlining fund allocations for the Pilots, Demonstrations, and Research program under WIA by July 1, 2006. Conferees noted DOL's failure to respond to a similar request in FY2005. The conferees direct DOL to submit quarterly reports on \u00a7171 projects for FY2006, including details on status, amount, recipients, and award methods. Section 209 allows NIH to transfer funds for HIV research. Section 222 delays power wheelchair regulations until April 1, 2006. Sections 225 and 226 rescind unobligated balances from Health Professions and Nursing Student Loans. Section 227 makes aircraft available to the Secretary of HHS. Section 305 appropriates $4.3 billion for Pell Grants funding shortfall. Section 306 amends ESEA Title V to include federally recognized Indian tribe in Mississippi and the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians for internship programs. Section 518 relaxes residency requirements under the Immigration and Nationality Act. Section 518 relaxed residency requirements under the Immigration and Nationality Act, but the modification was repealed on January 1, 2006. The purpose was to reduce the residency requirement for naturalization of aliens with extraordinary ability. Section 519 protected candidates for federal scientific advisory committees from unauthorized disclosure of their political affiliation or voting history. Several general provisions were considered during the appropriations process but were not included in the final FY2006 L-HHS-ED conference agreement. The House and Senate proposed various measures related to healthcare, education, and disaster assistance in FY2006. This included plans to convert ID cards, remove inaccurate medical information from abstinence education programs, prohibit funds for drugs treating erectile dysfunction, and require certain provisions to be included in the conference report. Additionally, there were emergency appropriations for hurricane disaster assistance and avian flu preparedness, offset by an across-the-board rescission. The House Committee on Appropriations proposed a 1% cut from most FY2006 discretionary appropriations for each program, project, or activity, excluding emergency appropriations and advance appropriations for FY2007 and beyond. The cut is estimated to reduce total federal spending by approximately $8.5 billion, with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and individual agencies determining the specific reductions. OMB is required to report back to Committees on Appropriations within 30 days, specifying each account and amount of the reduction resulting from the 1% rescission. The FY2006 conference data in this report are based on funding levels stated in P.L. 109-149 (H.Rept. 109-337) and have not been adjusted by the rescission procedures required by P.L. 109. Earmarking of funds for specific projects in appropriations bills has become a contentious issue for Congress and the Administration, extending to L-HHS-ED projects. Earmarks designate specific amounts for specific recipients, bypassing competitive distribution but requiring standard federal procedures. The President has pushed to eliminate congressional earmarks in appropriations, but Congress has mostly continued the practice. However, in FY2006, earmarks in L-HHS-ED appropriations were largely eliminated. In FY2005, there were over 3,000 earmarks totaling $1.2 billion, compared to eight earmarks for $28.5 million in FY2006. This marked a significant decrease in earmarks for L-HHS-ED programs. The maximum budget authority for annual L-HHS-ED appropriations is determined through a two-stage congressional budget process. Congress establishes the 302(a) allocations as the maximum spending totals for a fiscal year. This is done through the concurrent resolution on the budget, where spending totals are specified. In FY2006, the concurrent resolution on the budget was H.Con.Res. 95. The resolution on the budget, H.Con.Res. 95, was agreed upon by the House and Senate on April 28, 2005. It established $843.0 billion as the 302(a) allocation ceiling for the total discretionary budget authority for FY2006, an increase of $3.0 billion from FY2005. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees then separately set the 302(b) allocations for each subcommittee, ensuring they do not exceed the 302(a) total to enforce budget discipline. The 302(b) allocations for FY2006 L-HHS-ED appropriations are subject to adjustment as appropriations bills progress. Advance appropriations, like the $400 million for CPB in FY2007 from FY2005 funds, serve various purposes. The contentious aspect of advance appropriations involves how they are counted in budget ceilings. They avoid current year allocation ceilings but must be counted when available for obligation. In FY2002, the President proposed eliminating advance appropriations for federal discretionary programs, but Congress rejected it. Advance appropriations impact program administration, as seen in the \"Department of Education.\" The FY1999 and FY2000 L-HHS-ED appropriations bills provided significant increases in advance appropriations for discretionary programs, stabilizing at approximately $19 billion in FY2000. The amounts increased to $21.5 billion in FY2003, then returned to $19.3 billion in FY2004 and FY2005. In FY2006, the President requested $18.8 billion in advance appropriations, but P.L. 109 - 149 provided $19.3 billion. From FY1998 to present, advance appropriations enacted in L-HHS-ED bills have varied. In FY2006, the President's budget request was $18.8 billion, the House bill allocated $19.3 billion, the Senate bill also allocated $19.3 billion, and P.L. 109-149 (pre-rescission) provided $19.3 billion. The L-HHS-ED appropriations bills include both mandatory and discretionary funds, with discretionary funds growing from $109.4 billion in FY2001 to an estimated $142.4 billion in FY2005, an increase of $33.0 billion or 30.2%. In FY2005, L-HHS-ED discretionary funds grew to $142.4 billion, a 30.2% increase from FY2001. The share of L-HHS-ED discretionary funds as a percent of total federal discretionary funds decreased slightly. For FY2006, the budget request for the Department of Labor was $11.6 billion, slightly less than the previous year. The House and Senate bills proposed $11.7 billion and $11.8 billion, respectively, for DOL discretionary programs in FY2006. The enacted FY2006 conference agreement allocated $11.6 billion in discretionary funding before a 1% cut. Mandatory DOL programs in the FY2005 bill were funded at $3.3 billion, including various programs like Federal Unemployment Benefits and Allowances, Black Lung Disability Trust Fund, and others. The President's FY2006 budget requested changes in funding for discretionary activities, with proposed changes of at least $100 million. The President's FY2006 budget proposed changes in funding for DOL programs, including decreases in the Workforce Investment Act and Employment Service budgets. The House bill differed by providing more funding for WIA Dislocated Worker Assistance State Grants and the WIA Community College program. The WIA Community College program in the Senate bill would have received $125 million less than requested, with a proposed net increase of $1 million in FY2006. The Senate bill differed from the House bill by at least $100 million for DOL programs, with WIA programs receiving $5.3 billion, $122 million more than the House amount. The WIA Community Colleges would have received $125 million indirectly through the WIA National Reserve. The bill did not rescind FY2005 funds for the WIA Community College program, but the House bill would have rescinded $125 million. Unemployment Compensation received $2.5 billion, $148 million less than the House amount. The conference agreement changed discretionary spending for several DOL programs compared to FY2005 levels. WIA programs received $5.1 billion in total, $52 million more than requested but $225 million less than FY2005. The WIA Community College program indirectly received $125 million from the WIA National Reserve. The conference agreement rescinded $125 million from the FY2005 appropriation for the Community College program and funded Unemployment Compensation at $2.5 billion, $100 million less than requested. The Department of Labor's appropriations details are shown in Table 7. The FY2005 discretionary appropriations for the Department of Health and Human Services were $63.8 billion. The FY2006 budget request for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) was $62.7 billion, $1.1 billion less than FY2005. The House bill proposed $63.2 billion, the Senate bill proposed $73.4 billion. The enacted FY2006 conference agreement provided $63.4 billion in discretionary funding. Mandatory HHS programs in FY2005 were funded at $315.4 billion, including Medicaid Grants to States, Payments to Medicare Trust Funds, Foster Care and Adoption, Family Support Payments to States, and the Social Services Block Grant. The President's FY2006 budget proposed increased support for Health. The President's FY2006 budget request for HHS proposed increased support primarily for Health Centers, Medicare, and Medicaid. It also included reduced funding for other health and human resources programs. Discretionary spending increases were requested for Community Health Centers, National Institutes of Health (NIH), and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Program Management. The President's FY2006 budget proposed increased funding for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Program Management and the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund (PHSSEF) for bioterrorism activities. However, funding for Health Professions programs, Children's Hospital Graduate Medical Education (CHGME), and the CDC would have been decreased or terminated. The House bill proposed significant cuts to various health and social service programs, including the elimination of the Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grant and a reduction in funding for Building and Facilities. The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program would have seen a decrease in funding, while Health Care-Related Facilities and Activities would have been eliminated. The Community Services Block Grant would also have been eliminated, and funding for Community Health Centers and Children's Hospital Graduate Medical Education would have been reduced. In FY2005, funding for various health and social service programs was proposed in the House bill. Children's Hospital Graduate Medical Education would have received $300 million, Bioterrorism Hospital Grants $500 million, CDC Terrorism Preparedness and Response $1.6 billion, and other CDC activities $4.3 billion. AHRQ would have received $319 million, CSBG $320 million. The House bill proposed funding for various health and social service programs in FY2005. The CSBG would have received $320 million, while the PHSSEF would have received $184 million, $2.4 billion less than the request. The House bill also included direct appropriations of $2.1 billion for bioterrorism activities at HRSA and the CDC. The Senate bill differed by at least $100 million for several programs, with Health Professions other than nursing receiving $298 million. Health Care-Related Facilities and Activities would have received $393 million. In FY2005, CDC activities other than Terrorism Preparedness and Response would have received $4.5 billion, NIH would have been funded at $29.4 billion, AHRQ would not have been funded directly but would have been provided $324 million of program level support, LIHEAP would have been funded at $2.2 billion, and CSBG would have been funded at $320 million. The CSBG funding request was $637 million, $317 million more than the House amount, with no funds requested in FY2005. The PHSSEF funding request was $2.6 billion, $2.4 billion provided in FY2005. The Senate proposed $8.1 billion in emergency funds for pandemic flu activities. Community Health Centers received $1.9 billion, $149 million less than requested but $155 million more than FY2005. Health Professions other than nursing received $146 million, $135 million more than requested but $153 million less than FY2005. Health Care-Related Facilities and Activities received no funds. In FY2005, funding for Health Care-Related Facilities and Activities remained the same as requested at $483 million. Bioterrorism Hospital Grants received $500 million, while CDC Terrorism Preparedness and Response received $1.6 billion. Other CDC activities were funded at $4.3 billion, NIH received $28.6 billion, and CMS Program Management received $3.2 billion. PHSSEF received $66 million, significantly less than requested and the FY2005 amount. In FY2006, PHSSEF received $66 million, $2.5 billion less than requested and $2.3 billion less than FY2005. The account funded terrorism-related activities in HRSA, CDC, and NIH, including $0.5 billion for Bioterrorism Hospital Grants and $1.6 billion for Terrorism Preparedness and Response. Restrictions on federal funds for abortions, known as \"Hyde Amendments,\" apply to L-HHS-ED appropriations. These provisions may be revisited annually due to the volatility of the issue. The 103rd Congress modified provisions to allow federal funding of abortions in cases of rape or incest. The Hyde provisions in FY1998 and FY1999 appropriations extended restrictions on federal funds for abortion coverage, with added provisions for trust fund programs and Medicare + Choice plans. No changes were made from FY2000 to FY2004. The FY2005 appropriations added the \"Weldon Amendment\" to prevent federal programs or governments from providing abortion services. The \"Weldon Amendment\" in the FY2005 appropriations prevents discrimination against health care entities that do not provide or pay for abortions. President Bush allowed federal funds for research on human embryonic stem cells limited to existing stem cell lines, with potential medical benefits. The NIH developed a registry of 78 embryonic stem cell lines eligible for federally funded research, but only 22 are currently available. Scientists are concerned about the quality and availability of these stem cell lines, and some believe new lines, possibly from cloned embryos, are needed. Ethical issues arise due to the destruction of embryos for stem cell research. The issue may be revisited annually during appropriations considerations. An FY1996 appropriations resolution prohibited NIH funds for creating human embryos for research. The prohibition on using NIH funds for creating human embryos for research purposes has been extended to all L-HHS-ED funds since FY1997. The restriction, originally introduced by Representative Jay Dickey, remains unchanged and was continued in the FY2006 appropriations without significant alterations. The current provision can be found in \u00a7509 of P.L. 109 - 149. Legislative Response includes various CRS reports on federal government programs such as AIDS funding, the Ryan White CARE Act, Child Care and Development Block Grant, Community Services Block Grants, Federal Health Centers Program, Federal Research and Development Funding, Head Start, Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, and Maternal and Child Health Block Grant. The curr_chunk discusses various CRS reports on public health topics such as stem cell research, human cloning, and pandemic influenza preparedness. The Department of Health and Human Services' appropriations details for FY2005 and FY2006 were discussed, with a focus on the Department of Education's budget. The House and Senate bills proposed similar funding amounts for education, with the final conference agreement providing $56.5 billion in discretionary funding. The Vocational Rehabilitation State Grants program received $2.6 billion in FY2005. In FY2006, federal support for education was a priority, with funding for several programs proposed to increase. However, the President's request also included the elimination of funding for 48 existing programs and a reduction in total discretionary funding for ED programs. The President requested discretionary spending increases of at least $100 million for various programs, including the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) programs and the Striving Readers program. In FY2005, funding for various education programs would have been increased significantly. For example, the Pell Grants program would have seen an increase of $834 million, while the Special Education Part B Grants to States program would have been increased by $508 million. Additionally, a High School Intervention initiative was proposed with initial funding of $1.2 billion. The President's FY2006 budget proposed funding increases for various education initiatives, including a High School Assessments initiative with $250 million, a Teacher Incentive Fund with $500 million, and a Fund for the Improvement of Education reduced by $258 million. Additionally, several programs faced funding cuts or elimination in FY2006. In FY2006, various education programs faced significant funding reductions.

The ESEA authorizations of appropriations, as amended by NCLBA, represent a funding commitment promised for new administrative requirements in education. The FY2005 appropriation was $9.1 billion less than authorized, and for FY2006, funding was $12.0 billion below the authorized level. Some argue that authorized funding levels are just ceilings, while others see them as necessary for implementing new requirements. The authorization amount is a maximum amount, with actual funding levels determined during annual appropriations. Education programs with specified authorizations are often funded at lower levels. The IDEA Part B Grants to States program has never been funded at the 40% level authorized. Congress addressed the authorization issue in 2004 with specified ceilings for Part B Grants to States for FY2005. For more information, refer to CRS Report RL33058. The Part B Grants to States authorization under P.L. 108-446 was $12.4 billion for FY2005 and $14.6 billion for FY2006, but actual appropriations were lower. Some view these differences as funding shortfalls, while others see them as appropriation ceilings. Pell Grants funding levels have also been a recurring issue, providing assistance to eligible undergraduate students based on financial need. The Pell Grant program provides financial assistance to eligible undergraduate students based on financial need. Program costs depend on the maximum award and number of recipients, which are determined before the start of the program year. Appropriations for Pell Grants cover two fiscal years to manage shortfalls and surpluses. Shortfalls are covered by funds from the next fiscal year, while surpluses can be carried forward. The ED Budget Service estimated a $4.3 billion shortfall for FY2005, with a proposal to use proceeds from the Perkins Loan program to eliminate the Pell Grant shortfall in FY2006. P.L. 109-149 allocated $4.3 billion to address the shortfall. Appropriations are typically available for obligation during the federal fiscal year of the appropriations bill. Several L-HHS-ED programs have funding flexibility for program years that differ from the federal fiscal year, with appropriations becoming available on July 1 and remaining available for 15 months. This \"forward\" or \"multi-year\" funding is popular for elementary and secondary education programs. The case of elementary and secondary education programs allows additional time for budget development before the school year. Pell Grants for undergraduates have uncertain costs for individual students, with appropriations from one fiscal year supporting grants for the following academic year. Unlike elementary and secondary education programs, Pell Grant funds are available for two fiscal years. Advance appropriations provide funding for a fiscal year beyond the enacted year, with FY2006 funds becoming available on October 1, 2005. In FY2006 appropriations, funds are delayed until July 1, 2006, due to forward funding provisions. If this date is postponed to October 1, 2006, the appropriation would be an advance appropriation for FY2007. For example, Title I, Part A Grants to LEAs had a budget request of $13.3 billion, including $5.9 billion for forward funding and $7.4 billion for advance appropriation. These changes impact the availability of funds in subsequent fiscal years. The impact of changes in funding provisions from forward funding to advance appropriations is mainly seen at the scorekeeping level. While at the program or service level, there is relatively little difference due to the three-month delay in fund availability. Forward funding is counted in the current fiscal year's allocation, while advance appropriations are counted in the following year's allocation. This shift allows for a one-time move of funds from the current year to the next year. The appropriation for a program allows a one-time shift from the current year to the next year in discretionary appropriations scoring.

The curr_chunk discusses various education programs and reports under the No Child Left Behind Act, Elementary and Secondary Education Act, Higher Education Act, and Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The curr_chunk provides a list of CRS reports on various education programs and funding, including K-12 education, Pell Grants, Reading First, Safe and Drug-Free Schools Act, Trio and GEAR UP programs, 21st Century Community Learning Centers, and Advance Appropriations. The Department of Education's budget details for FY2005 and FY2006 are outlined, with discretionary appropriations for related agencies increasing slightly from $11.1 billion to $11.2 billion. The House and Senate bills proposed higher funding amounts, but the enacted FY2006 conference agreement provided $11.5 billion before a 1% cut. Mandatory programs for related agencies in FY2005 were funded at $36.6 billion, mainly for the Supplemental Security Income program. The President's FY2006 budget proposed changes in discretionary spending for various programs, including a $748 million increase in Social Security Administration Administrative Expenses. The SSA Medicare Reform Fund would have been eliminated, and funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting was not requested for FY2008. The House bill for FY2007 allocated $400 million for SSA Administrative Expenses, $400 million for CPB two-year advance appropriation for FY2008, and made no changes to the FY2006 CPB appropriation. The Senate bill differed in funding amounts for related agencies. The FY2006 rescission was $100 million, with differences between the Senate and House bills for two programs. Supplemental Security Income (SSI) received $2.7 billion, $187 million less than the House amount. SSA Administrative Expenses received $6.6 billion, $236 million more than the House amount. The FY2006 conference agreement changed discretionary spending for SSI and SSA Administrative Expenses compared to FY2005 levels. SSI received $2.7 billion, $164 million less than requested and $254 million less than FY2005. SSA Administrative Expenses received $6.5 billion, $25 million less than requested but $723 million more than FY2005. In FY2006, the SSA Administrative Expenses received $6.5 billion, which was $25 million less than requested but $723 million more than the FY2005 amount of $5.7 billion. The curr_chunk provides a list of various government agencies and their budget information. The curr_chunk discusses appropriations details for L-HHS-ED related agencies considered by the 109th Congress, including FY2006 continuing resolutions and FY2005 supplemental appropriations. The FY2006 continuing resolution provided temporary appropriations for L-HHS-ED activities from October 1 to December 30, 2005. Funding levels were set not to exceed the current rate or the House-passed version of the FY2006 appropriations. New initiatives were prohibited, and special restrictions were placed on high spend-out programs. Special restrictions were in place early in the fiscal year to prevent spending levels that would affect final FY2006 funding decisions. Obligations for mandatory payments were allowed for specific dates, and special provisions were made for funding appeals for Medicare and Social Security. The Senate-passed version of L-HHS-ED appropriations was excluded from funding calculations under the continuing resolution. The 1st Continuing Resolution, P.L. 109-77, provided temporary appropriations from October 1, 2005, through November 18, 2005, if regular appropriations were not enacted sooner. The 2nd Continuing Resolution, P.L. 109-105, extended the provisions of P.L. 109-77 through December 17, 2005. The 3rd Continuing Resolution, P.L. 109-128, further extended the provisions of P.L. 109-77 through December 31, 2005. FY2006 supplemental appropriations were included in P.L. 109-148. H.R. 2863, the Department of Defense, Emergency Supplemental Appropriations to Address Hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, and Pandemic Influenza Act, 2006, includes disaster assistance for areas damaged by 2005 hurricanes and avian and pandemic influenza preparedness. Division B of P.L. 109-148 covers these provisions along with various rescissions, including the 1% rescission applicable to most FY2006 discretionary appropriations. For more information on emergency assistance, refer to CRS Report RL33053, Federal Stafford Act Disaster Assistance, and for pandemic influenza, see CRS Report RL33145, Pandemic Influenza: Domestic Preparedness Efforts. P.L. 109-148 allocated $2.5 billion for hurricane disaster assistance and $3.3 billion for influenza preparedness. The FY2006 L-HHS-ED supplemental appropriations were classified as emergency funding and not subject to the 1% rescission. Funds were allocated for various programs including Training and Employment Services, Social Services Block Grant, Children and Family Services, Elementary and Secondary Education, and Homeless Education. The supplemental appropriations include assistance for school operations, homeless education, grants for displaced students, college students and institutions, influenza preparedness and response, expenses related to 9/11 terrorist attacks, and international public health and social services emergency fund. The Health and Social Services Emergency Fund receives $246 million for influenza preparedness and response in international activities and foreign countries, including $150 million for the CDC. The FY2006 budget resolution proposes a total discretionary budget authority of $843 billion, with $391 billion allocated for programs other than defense and homeland security. This represents a 2.1% increase from FY2005, with a 0.8% reduction for non-defense and homeland security programs. The FY2006 budget resolution does not specify discretionary funding totals for L-HHS-ED programs, with specific amounts determined through appropriations. Table 14 outlines assumed levels of discretionary budget authority for relevant functions. Reserve funds are included for various purposes such as Medicaid coverage for disabled children and Pell Grants shortfall elimination. The FY2006 budget resolution includes provisions for health information technology, safe imports of prescription drugs, and restoration of SCHIP funds. It also establishes a reserve fund for Pell Grants with $4.3 billion in new budget authority for FY2006. Authorizing committees are instructed to report legislation to reduce mandatory spending for FY2006 through FY2010, with reductions allocated to different committees. The House Committee on Ways and Means and the Senate Committee on Finance are responsible for reductions in funding for L-HHS-ED programs. H.Con.Res. 95 and S.Con.Res. 18 were passed by the House and Senate, with a conference report filed and passed by both chambers on April 28, 2005. For more details, refer to CRS Report RL32812, The Budget for. Regular FY2005 funding for L-HHS-ED activities was enacted late in the second session of the 108th Congress, more than two months after the start of FY2005 on October 1, 2004. Eight of the 13 regular FY2005 appropriations bills were combined into a single omnibus bill, H.R. 4818; Division F of the omnibus provided appropriations for L-HHS-ED programs. A series of three continuing resolutions, P.L. 108-309 (H.J.Res. 107), plus two amendments to it, provided temporary FY2005 funding for most L-HHS-ED programs until regular funding was enacted. The H.R. 4818 conference report, H.Rept. 108-792, was passed by the House and Senate on April 28, 2005. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 (P.L. 108-447) was signed into law on December 8, 2005, after being passed by the House and Senate. It included a provision for a 0.80% decrease in FY2005 discretionary appropriations for each program, project, or activity. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 (P.L. 108-447) included a provision for a 0.80% decrease in FY2005 discretionary appropriations for various programs. Excluded were funds from Defense, Military Construction, Homeland Security appropriations, FY2005 supplemental appropriations, and advance appropriations for FY2006 or beyond. The rescission was estimated to save approximately $3.5 billion. Additionally, there were other reductions required by P.L. 108-447, including a $18 million reduction in L-HHS-ED administrative expenses. Congress did not specify the actual amounts of these reductions but provided the process for their calculation. The FY2005 supplemental appropriations of $75.9 billion were enacted in response to the President's request for additional funds for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, Tsunami relief, and other activities. The bill, H.R. 1268 (H.Rept. 109-72), provided funding for domestically produced vaccines and influenza purchases under the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund (PHSSEF) of HHS. The FY2005 supplemental appropriations of $75.9 billion were enacted in response to the President's request for additional funds for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, Tsunami relief, and other activities. The bill, H.R. 1268 (H.Rept. 109-72), provided funding for domestically produced vaccines and influenza purchases under the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund (PHSSEF) of HHS, along with a $58 million allocation for influenza countermeasures for the Strategic National Stockpile under the CDC. Rescissions were made from FY2005 HHS funds and appropriations for the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 to offset the $10 million supplemental. For more details, refer to CRS Report RL32783, FY2005 Supplemental Appropriations for Iraq and Afghanistan, Tsunami Relief, and Other Activities. Terminology and web resources related to budget terms can be found in Appendix A of the report. The curr_chunk discusses the budget process, including advance appropriation, scorekeeping, appropriation, annual appropriations, and types of appropriations. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and make payments for specified purposes. Major types of appropriations include regular, supplemental, and continuing. Budget authority is the legal authority to incur financial obligations resulting in federal government fund outlays. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur financial obligations resulting in federal government fund outlays, including appropriations, borrowing authority, and contract authority. It also includes the subsidy cost of direct loans and loan guarantees. The budget resolution is a concurrent resolution passed by Congress setting forth the congressional budget for at least five fiscal years, with various budget totals and functional allocations. Discretionary spending is budget authority provided in annual appropriations acts, while entitlement authority represents a legally binding obligation on the federal government to make payments to eligible recipients. Entitlement authority is a legally binding obligation on the federal government, funded by annual or permanent appropriations acts. Forward funding provides budget authority that becomes available after the fiscal year begins and remains available into the next year. Mandatory spending includes budget authority from laws other than appropriations, entitlement authority, and the Food Stamp program. Rescission cancels previously enacted budget authority, while scorekeeping tracks congressional budgetary actions. Supplemental appropriations provide funds in addition to regular appropriations. General information on budget and appropriations can be found on various websites including House and Senate Committees, Congressional Budget Office (CBO), Congressional Research Service (CRS), Government Accountability Office (GAO), Government Printing Office (GPO), and Office of Management & Budget (OMB). Relevant agency sites for L-HHS-ED are listed in the report. The L-HHS-ED appropriations budget for FY2005 is estimated at $1,264.9 billion, accounting for 51.1% of the federal total. The discretionary funding provided by L-HHS-ED appropriations is $142.7 billion, representing 5.8% of the federal total. The appropriations subcommittees have control over the discretionary funds, while mandatory programs make up the majority of the remaining L-HHS-ED funds. The L-HHS-ED bill for FY2005 is $1,264.9 billion, with discretionary funding at $142.7 billion. Mandatory programs, totaling $354.2 billion, cover program obligations and entitlements. Changes in funding levels for these programs are made through amendments to authorizing legislation. Federal administrative costs for these programs are subject to annual discretionary appropriations. The L-HHS-ED bill for FY2005 includes funding for various agencies and programs, with some being partially funded by other appropriations bills. For example, the HHS Food and Drug Administration is funded by the Agriculture appropriations, the HHS Indian Health Service is funded by the Interior appropriations, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention received funds from the Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development appropriations. For FY2006, Interior appropriations will provide funding for the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS). The Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) activities will be funded by the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education (L-HHS-ED) bill. The L-HHS-ED bill funds CNCS activities and other programs like Unemployment Compensation, Medicare, and Social Security benefits. These funds are received automatically without congressional intervention from permanent appropriations and trust funds."
