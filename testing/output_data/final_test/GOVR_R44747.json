    "content": "The United States, Canada, and Mexico form an integrated energy market. Canada is the largest foreign supplier of crude oil to the US, while the US is Canada's main crude oil customer. Trade in natural gas and other energy commodities among the three countries is significant. The energy trade between the US and its North American neighbors exceeded $140 billion in 2015, with $100 billion in imports and over $40 billion in exports. This trade has promoted economic growth and job creation in the energy industry. Increased energy trade between the United States, Canada, and Mexico has promoted economic growth and job creation in the energy industry. However, it has also raised concerns about environmental impacts, energy infrastructure expansion, domestic energy prices, and market issues. The relationships are complex and undergoing changes due to technological advancements, creating new competition for energy supplies. The cross-cutting effects of energy policies in one country on the others are difficult to predict. The United States' energy trade with Canada and Mexico faces challenges in ensuring a mutually beneficial partnership. Congress is addressing policy questions on cross-border pipelines, oil sands, natural gas production, renewable energy, and greenhouse gas emissions. Legislative proposals in the 115th Congress could impact these developments. The report provides estimates of resource potential, recent energy production, and future production for principal energy commodities in the U.S. It also analyzes current trends in energy trade, potential for future trade, and factors affecting trade, especially energy transportation infrastructure. The analysis is based on the most recent data available, but should be viewed as an estimate due to data lag and revisions. The report is linked to various energy policy considerations such as environmental policy, infrastructure regulation, trade agreements, and economic factors. The report focuses on energy commodities in the U.S., analyzing trends in energy trade and potential for future trade. It highlights the importance of crude oil in linking the Canadian, Mexican, and U.S. economies, with recent reforms in Mexico potentially opening up the oil industry to private firms. The emerging North American market is expected to increase cross-border trade and energy independence for the continent. The most recognized measure of oil resources is \"proved\" reserves, which include identified, undeveloped resources in the ground. The definition of oil reserves includes identified, undeveloped resources that are technically and economically recoverable. Reserve totals can increase due to new discoveries, technological innovation, or higher prices. Factors like government regulations, low oil prices, and manipulation of reserve values can impact proved reserves. Crude oil reserve estimates are rough approximations of a country's resource base at a specific time. According to Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates, North American crude oil reserves are dominated by Canada with 173 billion barrels at the end of 2015, mainly in Alberta oil sands. US and Mexico have smaller reserves at around 35 billion and 10 billion barrels respectively. US reserves doubled between 2008 and 2014 due to new technologies for shale oil production. Global crude oil reserves were estimated at 1,698 billion barrels in 2015, showing a decline from 2014 but an increase from 2005. The North American portion of the 2015 world total crude oil reserves was 238 billion barrels, with the United States holding 23%, Canada holding 72%, and Mexico holding 5%. The reserve to production ratio (R/P) for the United States was 11.9 years, for Canada was 108 years, and for Mexico was 11.5 years in 2015. These ratios compare favorably to those in 2006. The data suggests that the United States, Canada, Mexico, and the rest of the world are at least as well off, if not better, in terms of oil reserves after 10 years of cumulative oil production. U.S. oil reserves have increased since 2008, but the pace may slow due to declining global crude oil prices. Despite a 12% downward adjustment in U.S. oil reserves in 2015, new reserves are likely to be discovered, such as the 20 billion barrels of shale oil resources in the Texas Permian basin announced in November 2016. The Texas Permian basin has newly identified oil resources that may impact future proven reserve estimates. Unlike the United States, Canada and Mexico have not seen growth in shale oil production and are not expected to experience rapid growth in reserves. Global oil prices heavily influence these expectations, with higher prices leading to more exploration. Forecasting oil prices and the emergence of new cost-reducing technologies is challenging. The United States has seen rapid growth in shale oil production, leading to a significant increase in oil production. Despite Canada having the largest crude oil reserves in North America, the United States is a much larger crude oil producer and has been growing much faster. U.S. oil production increased by over 4.3 million barrels per day from 2006 to 2015, making it the world's 3rd largest oil producer. The United States is the world's 3rd largest oil producer, behind Russia and Saudi Arabia. Canada is the 6th largest producer, while Mexico ranks 13th. Production in the US and Canada has increased due to new technologies and high oil prices, but Mexico's production has declined. Oil prices play a key role in production growth, with a time lag in field development and production. In 2016, U.S. oil production decreased to 9.1 mmb/d, causing transportation and refinery issues. Price discounts occurred until new transportation options were available. Surplus production for export is influenced by various factors like high prices and changing behaviors. Between 2006 and 2015, U.S. and Mexican petroleum consumption decreased due to improved fuel efficiency and changing behaviors. Mexican production declined even faster than consumption, leading to a decrease in crude export potential. Canada's excess crude production increased significantly during this period, despite growth in domestic consumption. The United States saw a reduction in its production deficit thanks to growth in shale oil production, but still heavily relies on imports to supplement domestic production. Canada is expected to continue using extra production for the export market. Canada will continue to use extra production for the export market, with more Canadian oil likely going to the United States or entering the world market, particularly Asia. Future net production in Mexico is uncertain, depending on domestic demand and potential changes in crude oil production. U.S. crude oil production is expected to keep increasing, reducing import requirements. Imports of crude oil from Canada to the United States have been steadily increasing, making Canada the largest provider of imported crude oil to the U.S. Exports of crude oil from the United States to Canada have significantly increased from 25 mb/d in 2006 to 427 mb/d in 2015, a 1,700% rise. Meanwhile, imports of crude oil from Mexico to the United States decreased by 57% over the same period. The United States' net draw on crude oil from the global market decreased by 37% between 2006 and 2015, with Canada and Mexico supplying about 50% of this total. This has contributed to U.S. energy independence from countries outside North America. The total commodity value of U.S. crude oil exports to Canada in 2015 was $7.2 billion, while imports from Canada were worth approximately $47.0 billion. The value of crude oil imported to the United States from Mexico in 2015 was $12.5 billion. U.S. crude oil trade with both Canada and Mexico is expected to expand in the future. If the United States cannot continue to import the entire Canadian exportable oil surplus, Canada would need to build new pipeline infrastructure to deliver oil to the world petroleum market. The U.S. trade position in petroleum products differs from crude oil, as it has become a net exporter of petroleum products. Canada remains a small net exporter of petroleum products to the U.S., while Mexico has been a net importer. U.S. imports of petroleum products from Canada have averaged about 544 mb/d, with exports to Canada rising by about 300%, bringing the U.S. net import position close to balance. The United States has become a net exporter of petroleum products, with exports to Mexico rising by 170% and imports from Mexico falling by 40% over the 2006-2015 period. The U.S. is also a net exporter to Canada, with a total commodity value of $10.2 billion in exports and $12.0 billion in imports in 2015. Additionally, the U.S. has a net export balance in petroleum products to the world as a whole, thanks to the efficiency and capacity of the petroleum refining industry. The oil pipeline infrastructure in Canada and the United States is fully integrated, with pipelines dominating crude oil movements between the two countries. No crude oil pipeline capacity currently exists or is proposed between the United States and Mexico. Major systems link producing regions, refineries, and transportation hubs in both countries. During the period between 2010 and 2015, there was rapid growth in pipeline capacity from Canada to the United States. Pipelines in Canada were expanded to accommodate increased crude oil production from the oil sands. Six pipeline systems with a total capacity of 4.22 mmb/d connect western Canada to US markets. Three main systems (Enbridge, Express, Keystone) have been crucial for cross-border oil movements. Two proposed projects could add 1.2 mmb/d capacity, including the Keystone XL Pipeline, which was approved by Canada but denied a permit by the Obama Administration in 2015. The Trump Administration later invited the developer to reapply for the permit in 2017. The Trump Administration invited the developer to resubmit its permit application for the Keystone XL pipeline, with TransCanada planning to pursue development. The Enbridge Line 3 project, approved by Canadian regulators, aims to restore the pipeline to its original capacity without needing a new Presidential Permit. Existing cross-border pipeline capacity between the US and Canada is 4.22 mmb/d, potentially increasing to 5.42 mmb/d with planned additions. Canada supplied the US with 2.8 mmb/d on average in 2015. Canada supplied the United States with 2.8 mmb/d on average in 2015, with potential for larger volumes in 2016. Despite the capacity for increased crude oil trade via pipeline, constraints such as bottlenecks and service outages have limited actual import capacity. Efforts are being made to enhance pipeline infrastructure to facilitate the movement of Canadian crude to key U.S. market hubs. The recent expansion of crude oil pipelines from Canada has sparked controversy in the United States and Canada. Proponents argue for diversifying the U.S. petroleum supply and economic benefits, while opponents raise concerns about negative environmental impacts and continued dependency on fossil fuels. These issues are highlighted in the context of the Keystone XL pipeline. The Keystone XL pipeline proposal, along with Canadian developers pursuing export pipelines within Canada, has sparked public interest and debate. The Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion and TransCanada's Energy East pipeline are key projects facing approvals and legal challenges, aiming to increase crude oil export capacity to Asian and Atlantic markets. The Energy East pipeline and Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion are facing challenges in Canada, potentially reducing pipeline export capacity to the United States. Some Canadian crude oil shippers have turned to railroads for transportation to refineries, but crude-by-rail volumes have decreased due to pipeline projects and oil price changes. Rail-loading terminals in western Canada and Williston Basin, ND have capacities of 0.75 mmb/d and 1.52 mmb/d respectively. Three expansion projects in western Canada are on hold. Rail-loading from Williston Basin has decreased to 0.3 mmb/d, with pipelines now moving 61% of crude oil compared to rail's 29%. Rail carriers have not invested in crude-by-rail terminals, leaving it to oil shippers. Rail carriers have spare capacity in their crude-by-rail infrastructure, with crude oil loadings representing less than 2% of total rail car loadings at the peak in 2014. Rail car loadings of all commodities in 2016 are trailing their peak by about 10%, providing railroads ample opportunity to increase capacity by adding sidings, parallel tracks, and upgrading signal systems. Rail congestion remains a challenge at major rail hubs like Chicago and Minneapolis, hindering the efficient movement of freight. Efforts to improve infrastructure, such as adding parallel tracks and upgrading signal systems, are underway to alleviate congestion. However, bottlenecks can still occur at bridges, tunnels, and in canyons. Despite ongoing projects to speed up trains, rail congestion is likely to persist if freight volumes increase significantly. Railroads have the autonomy to enhance their existing infrastructure without federal approval. Vessels are a key mode of crude oil export from Mexico and the United States, with Texas ports like Houston, Corpus Christi, and Port Arthur being major hubs. Texas harbors are expanding shipping channels primarily for overseas trading ships, not specifically for North American vessel trade. The federal role in harbor infrastructure is mainly focused on shipping channels and navigation aids, overseen by the Army Corps of Engineers and the Coast Guard. Private industry and local port authorities handle terminal infrastructure like piers, wharfs, and storage tanks. Ports on the West Coast that handle tanker ships are naturally deep and do not require much dredging. The Coast Guard maintains channel marking buoys and may develop navigation rules as needed. The primary means of refined products movement between Mexico, Canada, and the United States is via marine vessel, accounting for over 75% of overall trade. Pipelines are a significant secondary mode for U.S. exports to Canada, while rail carries a substantial share as well. Pipelines are also becoming more important for U.S. exports to Mexico, with three pipelines currently shipping refined products from Texas. The proposed Borrego Pipeline would significantly increase export capacity to Mexico. The United States, Mexico, and Canada have significant natural gas reserves and production, with the US leading in both aspects. Despite limited reserves in Canada and Mexico, there is potential for future production. The US has experienced a major transformation in natural gas supply, mainly due to shale production. The EIA projects continued growth in U.S. natural gas production, while Canada and Mexico have seen declines due to production costs and market issues. Canada is working to reverse the trend with increased investment, especially in shale gas, tight gas, and coalbed methane. Increased investment in Canada's natural gas sector is driven by advancements in drilling and fracking, particularly for oil sands production. Mexico's energy reforms aim to attract foreign investment, but interest has been limited due to low global oil and gas prices. Prices worldwide have been depressed, impacting Mexico's natural gas resources. Despite ongoing auctions, the effects on reserves and production remain uncertain. The United States, Canada, and Mexico have long traded natural gas, with preferential treatment for U.S. exports under free trade agreements. Expedited permitting processes have facilitated North American continental integration. The expedited permitting process has facilitated the integration of the North American natural gas sector, particularly between the U.S. and Canadian markets. U.S. shale gas supplies have led to increased exports and decreased imports, with most exports going to Mexico and imports coming from Canada. Mexico heavily relies on natural gas imports, with the United States being its largest supplier. The U.S. has shifted from being a growing importer to a potential long-term exporter of natural gas. Mexico's demand for imports continues to rise due to its insufficient domestic production, mainly driven by the growth of natural gas-fired electricity generation. In 2015, Mexico imported 1,307 BCF of natural gas, with 81% coming from the United States, valued at $3.8 billion. The U.S. has a surplus in natural gas trade with Mexico, which is expected to widen due to supply and demand trends. However, competition from other energy sources and potential growth in Mexican natural gas production create uncertainty about future demand. Mexico also started importing LNG at high costs from other countries as an alternative to U.S. pipeline gas supplies. In 2015, U.S. natural gas imports from Canada were valued at $6.8 billion, down 46% from 2014. Canadian natural gas imports from the United States were valued at $2.2 billion, down almost 50% from the prior year. These declines reflect lower trade volumes and prices, leading to fundamental changes in the North American natural gas industry. TransCanada had to restructure pipeline tariffs due to declining volumes, and shale gas production has impacted Arctic natural gas development in Alaska and Arctic Canada. The decline in U.S. imports of Canadian natural gas has impacted Arctic natural gas development in Alaska and Arctic Canada. Low natural gas prices benefit oil sands production, which requires large volumes of natural gas. Canada is pursuing natural gas exports to overseas markets in the form of LNG, as the United States is projected to become a net exporter of natural gas in 2018. The Department of Energy has approved almost 15 billion cubic feet per day of LNG exports to countries without free trade agreements with the US. US LNG export projects may face competition from Canadian projects, highlighting the integration between the two markets. Transportation of natural gas among the US, Canada, and Mexico is mainly by pipeline, with over 50 pipelines linking the US to its neighbors. Over the last five years, natural gas pipeline capacity between the United States and Mexico has nearly doubled, with most of the capacity and recent additions coming from pipelines in Texas. Cross-border pipeline capacity to Mexico is projected to double again by 2018, primarily from the Eagle Ford production basin in Texas. Mexico is also expanding its domestic pipeline network to accommodate U.S. imports and facilitate gas movement within the country. Over 3,300 miles of new gas pipeline are under construction or planned in Mexico to support the electric power sector. New pipeline investments on both sides of the border could lead to a significant increase in cross-border natural gas trade, dependent on sufficient supply and infrastructure from Texas. U.S. LNG exports from terminals along the Gulf of Mexico may impact regional gas supplies for Mexico. Cross-border natural gas pipeline capacity between the United States and Canada has remained stable, but some pipelines have reversed direction to move U.S. production north into Canada. The United States is increasing production and exports of natural gas to Canada, with new pipeline projects in the Appalachian Basin. Natural gas liquids (NGLs) are gaining importance in energy trade, with ethane, propane, butane, and pentanes being separated from natural gas. NGLs have different markets and values based on their applications. The natural gas industry focuses on producing more wet gas to increase value when dry gas prices drop. High global oil prices drove growth in U.S. wet gas production, leading to increased NGL availability for export. Data on NGL reserves are limited and tied to natural gas reserves. NGL production in the United States has grown rapidly since 2006 and is projected to continue its upward trajectory. Between 2006 and 2015, NGL production increased by 90%, with a projected 40% rise from 2015 to 2020. The growth in NGLs is directly linked to the growth in U.S. natural gas production, impacting overall trends in the market. Mexico's NGL production declined by 16% between 2006 and 2013, mainly producing liquefied petroleum gases. Canada's NGL production increased by 5% during the same period, with most production in the form of ethane. U.S. NGL production increased significantly between 2006 and 2013, accounting for 15% of the country's production in 2013. NGL exports from the U.S. rose by over 1,300% between 2006 and 2015, with propane being the most prominent export. Mexico mainly imports propane, with 99% of its imports coming from the U.S. In 2015, U.S. propane exports to Mexico increased by 31% to approximately $1.0 billion. Canada exported around 50 million barrels of propane and butane to the U.S. in 2015, with a total value of over $1.4 billion. The U.S. Midwest, East Coast, and West Coast were the main destinations for Canadian propane exports, while butane also went to the Midwest and East Coast. Canada has increased NGL imports from the United States to supply its petrochemical facilities, with U.S. NGL exports to Canada valued at $238 million in 2015. Future expansion of Canada's petrochemical industry is likely to further boost NGL imports from the U.S. NGL exports between the two countries primarily occur by rail, with some deliveries from Ontario via an Enbridge cross-border pipeline. Ethane, in high demand in Canada, has driven up exports on other cross-border pipelines. Two new pipelines for ethane export to Canada have been recently constructed, linking the Bakken region in North Dakota to markets in Alberta and shipping NGLs from Michigan to Ontario. Canadian regulators report that these pipelines have been operating at medium to high utilization, with a total NGL pipeline export capacity to Canada exceeding 200,000 barrels per day. Additionally, five existing pipelines between Mexico and the United States in Texas currently ship, or are capable of shipping, NGLs between the two countries. The proposed New Burgos pipeline would add 108,000 bpd of NGL export capacity to Mexico. The U.S. and Canadian power systems are interconnected, with over 30 major transmission connections. Conversely, there are only a few cross-border interconnections with Mexico, with only connections to California fully synchronized with the U.S. grid. The degree of grid integration between the United States, Canada, and Mexico has influenced historical and potential electricity trade. A 2016 agreement aims to increase carbon-free electricity sources to at least 50% in North America. The growing role of renewable resources in power production and potential export is of interest. The electricity generation profiles of Mexico, the United States, and Canada differ significantly in terms of size and capacity. Mexico has 68 GW, Canada has 133 GW, and the United States has over 1,100 GW of generating capacity. Annual generation reflects installed capacity, with Mexico at 310 TWh, Canada at 629 TWh, and the United States at 4,100 TWh. The three countries also vary in the generation fuels they rely on. In Mexico, natural gas is the dominant generation fuel (59%), while hydro is dominant in Canada (60%). The United States has no dominant fuel type, but coal is the heaviest used (33%). Natural gas and coal each account for 33% of generation, with natural gas surpassing coal. Mexico's electricity demand has grown by 3% annually since 2010, driven by residential and industrial customers, as well as self-supply. Mexico's electricity sector is undergoing regulatory restructuring, allowing private participation in generation. The pricing structure and regulatory changes create uncertainty in future projections. Reforms aim to address low prices that deter investment in new capacity. Mexico's electricity sector is undergoing regulatory restructuring to allow private participation in generation. The pricing structure and regulatory changes create uncertainty in future projections. Industry in Mexico pays significantly higher electricity prices compared to the U.S., hindering investment in new capacity. Mexico has authorized over 100 GW of new generation supplies since 2011, with a focus on natural gas and renewable energy sources to meet the non-fossil energy generation target of 35%. Mexico's national energy policy aims for 35% non-fossil energy generation by 2024. Canada's NEB projects steady growth in electricity production until 2040, with hydropower remaining dominant. Nuclear energy is expected to decline, while coal-fired generation is decreasing due to emission reduction initiatives. Major hydroelectric projects are underway in various Canadian provinces. The NEB expects natural gas-fired power generation to play a larger role in Canada due to low prices, lower GHG emissions compared to coal, and faster construction times. Natural gas capacity can be built in smaller increments to match load growth and has advantages in fast start-ups and load changes throughout the day. Electric power production depends on factors like end-use demand, regulations, system efficiencies, and technologies used. Different regions in the US historically used varying fuel mixes for power generation. Different regions in the United States historically used different fuel mixes for electricity generation based on local resources. Regulatory regimes also influence the types of resources used. Growth in electric power sales was previously linked to economic growth, but energy efficiency in homes is changing this trend. The decoupling of growth in electricity demand from GDP in the U.S. is a recent trend, with new technologies like electric vehicles and regulations potentially increasing electricity demand. The price of natural gas will play a key role in future fuel mixes for electricity generation, with low natural gas prices displacing coal. The EIA projects changes in U.S. electricity generation to 2050, influenced by the Clean Power Plan. Wind and solar power are expected to increase due to lower costs and tax credits, while coal-fired units will retire. New generation after 2030 will be mostly natural gas-fired or solar. Older fossil fuel plants will face retirement decisions, leading to new generating additions. After 2030, new U.S. electricity generation will mainly be natural gas-fired or solar. The country has seen a rise in net electricity imports from Canada and Mexico, with Canada being the primary trade partner. U.S. electricity imports have increased since 2006, while exports to Canada and Mexico have decreased. Electricity imports from Canada to the U.S. increased from $1.9 billion in 2011 to $2.95 billion in 2015, while U.S. exports to Canada were valued at $300 million in 2015. Electricity trade with Mexico is lower due to limited grid integration, with total U.S. electricity imports from Mexico in 2015 at approximately 7.31 Terawatt-hours. In 2015, U.S. electricity imports from Mexico were 7.31 Terawatt-hours, valued at $810 million, while exports to Mexico were 0.4 TWh, valued at $46.1 million. Trade between the United States and Mexico has been limited to specific border areas for emergency purposes, with most interconnections not used for regular trade. Overall, U.S. electricity trade with Mexico is minimal compared to trade with Canada. The U.S. benefits from system reliability through transmission connections with Mexico. U.S. imports of electricity from Canada have increased significantly, with the northeastern U.S. being the largest recipient of Canadian exports. These imports account for less than 1.5% of total U.S. electric power generation in 2015. In 2015, Canadian net exports represented nearly 10% of total Canadian power generation, with U.S. markets being an important outlet for Canadian generators in eastern Canada. The heavy integration of the U.S. and Canadian grids improves grid reliability in both countries. The Power Coordinating Council (NPCC), Midwest Reliability Organization (MRO), and Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) ensure stability of North American power grids through cross-border transmission lines. Future electricity trade depends on generation capacity and transmission infrastructure availability, influenced by various commercial and government policies. In the U.S., challenges in renewable power development, transmission expansion, and permitting make long-distance projects difficult. FERC Order 1000 aims to facilitate electric grid improvements. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued FERC Order 1000 to facilitate electric transmission planning for projects with public policy benefits, impacting Canada and Mexico due to grid connections. EIA projects a decline in U.S. imports of electricity from Canada and Mexico by 2050, while U.S. exports are expected to grow modestly. The following sections provide a detailed look at electricity trade prospects with Canada and Mexico. The prospects for electricity trade with Canada and Mexico are intertwined with natural gas supplies, renewable energy development, and transmission planning. Canadian regulators project moderate growth in net exports of Canadian electricity, reaching 48 TWh in 2040. Both countries have policies for increased use of renewable power, and collaboration under the Clean Energy Dialogue includes modernizing the North American transmission grid and advancing smart grid technology. The need for greater cross-border electricity trade with Canada has been questioned due to declining U.S. natural gas prices, impacting the value of low-cost hydropower from Canada. The development of additional natural gas pipeline capacity in the Northeast will be crucial for Canadian electricity exports. Factors such as construction costs, environmental regulations, and government policies will also affect new initiatives. Transmission planning and construction in the United States and Canada face challenges such as permitting, funding, and multiple jurisdictional approvals. New projects could increase electricity trade across the U.S.-Canada border, like the Montana-Alberta Tie Line completed in 2013. DOE issued a permit for the New England project in December 2016. The DOE issued a Presidential Permit (No. PP-400) for the New England Clean Power Link, a 320 kV transmission line to access Canadian hydropower. Other projects in the permit application phase include the Great Northern Transmission line and Champlain Hudson Power Express, aiming to support wind resources and relieve transmission congestion in New York City. There are 11 pending applications for cross-border transmission lines to Canada, with four pending at the DOE. Prospects for future electricity trade with Mexico are tied to Mexico's economic growth. Mexico accounts for a significant portion of energy use in Latin America, with energy demand expected to increase. Generation capacity in Mexico could double by 2030. Reforms in Mexico's energy sector may create opportunities for electricity trading with the United States. The United States and Mexico are working on increasing electricity trade through cross-border transmission projects. A recent agreement supports grid integration for future trade, with new transmission lines being developed. The DOE has issued permits for projects like a 230 kV line from a Mexican wind farm to California. Multiple applications are pending for export authority to Mexico. Renewable energy is expected to play a significant role in this trade expansion. Renewable generation is expected to play a significant role in increasing electricity trade between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The three countries have abundant renewable resources that could be used for domestic demand or cross-border trade. While the U.S. has a larger renewable capacity compared to Mexico, there are opportunities for future trade across borders. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) highlights the potential for renewable electricity generation in North America. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) estimates that the United States has the potential to generate 481,800 Terawatt-hours of electricity annually from renewable sources, which is nearly 100 times the total electricity generation in Canada, Mexico, and the United States combined. Resource estimates for each country are available from different sources, making it difficult to compare, but they indicate differences in resources and potential for renewable energy generation. Solar, wind, and hydropower resources are discussed for their contribution to current capacity and potential generation. Solar energy is a significant source of non-nuclear zero-carbon electricity globally, with varying resources based on location. Solar projects can range from residential to utility scale. The type of solar project depends on factors like solar resource, available land, financial policies, and electricity prices. Wind generation potential varies in North America, with high-quality resources in the Great Plains and coastal areas. Hydroelectric generation in Canada is a potential source of renewable electricity for cross-border energy trade. U.S. imports from Canada are mainly from hydroelectric facilities. According to the Canadian Hydropower Association, there is potential to triple hydroelectric generation in Canada, mainly in southern provinces. Renewable electricity generation growth rates vary among the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Hydroelectric capacity has remained stable since 2006, while wind and solar have seen significant growth and are the main contributors to renewable electricity capacity growth. The United States and Canada have similar hydro generation capacity, but the deployment of wind and solar has been higher in the United States since 2006. The deployment of wind and solar in the United States since 2006 has resulted in U.S. renewable capacity being more than double that of Canada in 2015. Most of the North American cross-border renewable electricity trade is Canadian hydroelectricity exports to the United States, originating from Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec provinces. There may be additional opportunities for cross-border Canadian hydroelectricity trade in the future if low-carbon electricity policies incentivize its use in the United States. Hydro-Quebec aims to increase sales to the U.S. Northeast to support carbon emission policies. Wind and solar trade potential exists between Canada and the U.S., with shared solar resources across the U.S./Mexico border. A 50% clean power target by 2025 could lead to renewable electricity trade opportunities through U.S. imports from Canada and Mexico. The United States has significant coal reserves, with 55% located in the West. Canada generates over 50% of its power from clean sources, limiting export opportunities. Mexico has limited coal reserves. Trade opportunities may arise through U.S. imports from Canada and Mexico, dependent on transmission infrastructure. U.S. coal production peaked in 2008 at 1.17 billion tons before sharply declining in 2015. Current projections show production below 800 million tons in 2016 and 2017 due to decreased demand from utilities switching to natural gas and renewable energy. Factors like a warm winter in 2015 and lower U.S. coal exports have also contributed to the decline. Canada has consistently produced over 70 million tons of coal annually, accounting for 1%-1.5% of world production since 2006. Since 2006, Canada and Mexico have accounted for 1%-1.5% of world coal production. Most of Canada's coal comes from Alberta and British Columbia, while Mexico's production fluctuates between 11-18 million tons. Intra-North American coal trade is limited, with the US exporting $490 million worth of coal to Canada in 2015 and $298 million worth to Mexico. US coal exports peaked at 125.7 million tons in 2012, declining to 74 million tons in 2015, with projections of 57 million tons in 2016. The EIA projects U.S. coal exports to decrease to around 57 million tons in 2016, a significant drop from 2012 peak of 125.7 million tons. In 2015, U.S. coal exports to Canada and Mexico accounted for 5.5% and 4.8% of the total, respectively. By the first three quarters of 2016, the share of coal exports to Canada and Mexico increased to 8.2% and 6% of U.S. total coal exports, respectively. The United States received about 10% of its coal imports from Canada and under 1,000 tons from Mexico annually over the past five years. Canada has maintained over 40% of its coal production as exports. In 2015, Canada exported about 33 million tons of coal, with two-thirds going to Asia and 4% to the United States. Canada also imported 8 million tons of coal, with 75% coming from the United States. Mexico's coal exports rose from nearly zero in 2006 to 267,000 tons in 2011, making Mexico a net importer of coal. Limited coal trade within North America does not require new infrastructure, as Canada has invested $1.4 billion (CAD) in port expansion for exports to Asia. The coal rail transport network and export facilities in Canada are well established with sufficient capacity. The Canadian and U.S. rail system can easily move coal between the two countries and into Mexico. Any additional port capacity in the region would likely focus on shipping coal to the Asian market. The main issue in North America is reducing carbon emissions and exploring low-cost alternative energy sources. The focus in North America is on reducing carbon emissions and transitioning to low-cost alternative energy sources. Canada and Mexico are already experiencing a decline in coal consumption, with provinces like Ontario and Manitoba phasing out coal use. Alberta plans to phase out coal power by 2030. Mexico has invested in renewable energy projects, particularly in hydropower. The United States may continue to meet Canadian coal import needs, but the amount of coal imported is expected to decrease. In Mexico, energy projects have focused on hydropower and nuclear power investments. Natural gas consumption has increased while coal and fuel oil usage for electricity generation has declined. There may be a slight growth in coal demand as Mexico adopts other energy sources. U.S. coal exports to Mexico may see short-term increases but are not expected to rise in the long run."
