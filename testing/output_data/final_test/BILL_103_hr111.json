The \"Fair Practices in Automotive Products Act\" defines \"automotive products\" as motor vehicles and parts for new vehicles. \"Added domestic value\" for a vehicle manufacturer includes production costs of products sold in the US and export value of products manufactured in the US and exported. The \"Fair Practices in Automotive Products Act\" defines \"automotive products\" as motor vehicles and parts for new vehicles. The term \"domestic content ratio\" for a vehicle manufacturer in any model year is the percentage of added domestic value, which includes production costs of products sold in the US and export value of products manufactured in the US and exported, reduced by the aggregate appraised value of automotive products entered during that model year. The term \"entered\" means entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, within the customs territory of the United States. The term \"export value\" means the free-on-board price for which the vehicle manufacturer sells the product for exportation from the United States. The term \"model year\" refers to a vehicle manufacturer's annual production period, designated by the year in which January 1 occurs. The term \"motor vehicle\" refers to a vehicle primarily for public road use, excluding motorcycles and certain off-highway capable automobiles. \"Production cost\" is the wholesale price of an automotive product in the US at the time of sale. The term \"vehicle manufacturer\" refers to any person producing motor vehicles for retail sale in the US, including entities under common control. SEC. 4. DETERMINATION OF ADDED DOMESTIC VALUE. Two or more vehicle manufacturers cannot include the value of the same automotive product for determining their added domestic values. They can apportion the value among them under prescribed rules. SEC. 5. DOMESTIC CONTENT RATIOS FOR MODEL YEAR 1994 AND THEREAFTER. The minimum domestic content ratio for a vehicle manufacturer for each model year after January 1, 1993, shall not be less than the higher of the domestic content ratio achieved in model year 1994 reduced by 10%, or the applicable minimum content ratio specified in a table. The number of motor vehicles produced and sold in the United States each year must meet a minimum domestic content ratio. For model year 1994, the ratio is 0 percent for vehicles under 100,000 and a calculated percentage for vehicles between 100,000 and 900,000. For model year 1995, vehicles sold under 100,000 have a 0 percent ratio, while vehicles between 100,000 and 900,000 have a ratio determined by dividing the number of vehicles sold by 15,000. Vehicles sold over 900,000 have a 60 percent ratio. For model year 1995, vehicles sold under 100,000 have a 0 percent ratio, while vehicles between 100,000 and 900,000 have a ratio determined by dividing the number of vehicles sold by 10,000. Vehicles sold over 900,000 have a 90 percent ratio. The Secretary will allocate automotive products among manufacturers based on specific cases like selling products to another manufacturer, joint ventures, and producing vehicles for retail sale in the US. This is in line with the purpose of the Act. Vehicle manufacturers producing over 100,000 vehicles in the US must maintain records and provide information as required by the Secretary for regulatory purposes. The Secretary has the authority to obtain necessary information for enforcing relevant laws. The Secretary has the authority to obtain necessary information and data for regulatory purposes and enforcement of relevant laws. Information obtained will be disclosed to the public in accordance with specific regulations. The Secretary has the authority to obtain necessary information for regulatory purposes and enforcement of laws. Information disclosed to the public will not include matters that could result in competitive damage. Annual reports on domestic content ratios of vehicle manufacturers will be made public after each model year. SEC. 7. ENFORCEMENT. Penalty for Failure To Meet Domestic Content Ratios: It is unlawful for a vehicle manufacturer to fail to meet the minimum domestic content ratio required under section 5(a). If a violation is found, the Secretary can issue an order prohibiting the manufacturer from entering a quantity of motor vehicles exceeding the total entered in the 12-month period following the finding. Penalty for Failure To Meet Domestic Content Ratios: The penalty includes limiting the quantity of motor vehicles a manufacturer can enter in the following year and reducing the value of parts entered based on the domestic content ratio violation. The order issued for failing to meet domestic content ratios specifies the number of vehicles and appraised value of parts that can be entered in a 12-month period. Judicial review can be sought within 60 days of the order. The court has jurisdiction to affirm, modify, or set aside the Secretary's order. Any violation of the Act or regulations may result in a civil penalty of up to $10,000 per day. Notice and opportunity for a hearing are required before assessing penalties. Before issuing a civil penalty, the Secretary must provide written notice to the person. The penalty is assessed promptly after the notice, and if not paid within 60 days, the Secretary can take legal action in court to affirm the penalty. The court has the authority to review de novo the law and facts involved in affirming a civil penalty assessment. If the penalty is not paid after a final judgment in favor of the Secretary, an action to recover the penalty amount will be initiated in a district court without the assessment order being subject to review. The Secretary has the authority to compromise, modify, or remit any penalty imposed under this subsection without review. Within one year of this Act's enactment, the Secretary and the Federal Trade Commission will investigate and report to Congress on discriminatory practices by vehicle manufacturers favoring foreign-made parts over domestically produced parts in the selection of replacement parts for motor vehicles. The report will include recommendations for actions to ensure fair access to the U.S. market for domestic producers of replacement parts."
