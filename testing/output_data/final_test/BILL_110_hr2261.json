The Conservation Reserve Program is amended to prioritize protection of environmentally sensitive acres and ensure replacement of lands with the most environmentally sensitive acres as contracts expire. This aims to protect highly erodible lands while increasing acreage available for crop production for biofuel. TRANSITIONAL ASSISTANCE FOR FARMERS PLANTING ENERGY CROPS FOR LOCAL CELLULOSIC REFINERY. The Secretary provides transitional assistance payments to agricultural producers in their first year of growing qualified cellulosic crops, which are trees or grasses grown for biofuel production or energy generation. Definitions include cellulosic crop, refiner, and refinery. The Secretary provides transitional assistance payments to agricultural producers growing qualified cellulosic crops, defined as crops sold to a refiner within 70 miles of a cellulosic refinery. The Secretary will devise a formula to calculate payment amounts.
