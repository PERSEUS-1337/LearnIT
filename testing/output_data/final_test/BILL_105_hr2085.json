    "content": "EXPORT-IMPORT BANK assistance for exports to China is conditioned on adherence to a code of conduct. The Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 is amended to include a provision that prohibits assistance for exports to China unless the entity adheres to a code of conduct. Failure to comply will result in the withdrawal of any guarantees, insurance, or credit provided by the Bank. The Bank will withdraw credit for exports to China if the entity does not adhere to a code of conduct, including providing a safe workplace and fair employment practices. The code of conduct for entities exporting to China includes respecting freedom of association, paying minimum wage, providing mandated benefits, obeying environmental laws, and complying with laws promoting good business practices. Maintaining a corporate culture that respects free expression is also required. The code of conduct for entities exporting to China requires respecting free expression, promoting good corporate citizenship, and upholding ethical conduct among employees. Compliance with these standards is also expected from partners, suppliers, and subcontractors. The code of conduct for entities exporting to China includes standards for ethical conduct, monitoring compliance, reporting noncompliance, and selecting qualified individuals to enforce compliance. The code of conduct includes procedures for monitoring compliance, disciplinary action for noncompliance, corrective measures, and communication of standards to employees and suppliers. The code of conduct requires employees and suppliers to participate in training programs or be informed orally and in writing about standards and procedures. Small businesses are exempt from this requirement. The Export-Import Bank of the United States is required to include actions taken to comply with subsection (f) in its annual report. Congress suggests collaboration between the Bank and the Clearinghouse on Corporate Responsibility to help businesses access resources for developing global codes of corporate conduct."
