    "content": "The increasing number of bid protests of federal government contracts, including high-profile protests against contracts for cloud services, security background checks, and crew space transportation capability, have raised concerns about the impact on agency operations. Congressional scrutiny has led to proposed requirements for a report on the GAO bid protest process in the FY2016 National Defense Authorization Act. The GAO bid protest process is analyzed in a report providing Congress with background on trends, reasons for protests, impact on acquisitions, common grounds for sustaining protests, and trends in protests against DOD. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) guides the federal government in acquiring goods and services. The FAR promotes competition for government contracts and provides mechanisms for contractors to protest contract awards. GAO has been resolving protests for 90 years, while COFC is the judicial forum for such protests. Companies can also file protests with the agency awarding the contract. The GAO is the primary location for resolving government contract protests, allowing for protests alleging illegalities or improprieties in solicitations, awards, or proposed contracts. Procedures are designed for inexpensive and expeditious resolution, with protests required to be resolved within 100 calendar days. Filing a GAO protest can result in an automatic stay of contract award or performance. In FY2014, GAO received 2,561 cases, an increase of 5% over the previous year and almost 125% since FY2001. GAO may dismiss, deny, or sustain a protest, with a sustained decision generally disrupting the procurement process. Agencies must notify GAO if they do not fully implement GAO's recommendations, which are usually complied with. Protesters can seek reconsideration or appeal GAO's decision by filing a protest with the Court of Federal Claims. In FY2014, GAO received 2,561 cases, a 5% increase from the previous year and almost 125% since FY2001. Congress expanded GAO's jurisdiction in FY2007 to include protests of certain contracts. The number of protests has remained relatively constant in recent years. GAO issues opinions on 22% of cases, with protests sustained 20% of the time. Approximately 4% of all protests filed from FY2001 to FY2014 were sustained. In addition to GAO sustaining protests, agencies can voluntarily correct allegations charged in protests. This trend of agencies taking corrective action is seen as significant in bid protests, indicating potential merit in the protest. However, agencies may also take corrective action even if they believe the procurement was done properly. The effectiveness rate of GAO protests increased from 33% to 43% from FY2001 to FY2014, remaining stable at an average of 42% in the last five fiscal years. Observers attribute this rise to the predictable nature of GAO opinions, leading agencies to take corrective action voluntarily. This rate serves as a rough measure of protests with actual or potential merit. The data does not support the belief that agencies usually take corrective action when GAO intends to sustain a protest. The majority of agency corrective actions occur before agencies submit their reports on the merits of the protest. This self-initiated corrective action by agencies may be due to risk-averse efforts to avoid the potential of a protest being sustained. The high likelihood of protests being resolved through voluntary agency corrective actions encourages companies to file protests. Bid protest data reported to Congress over-represents the number of procurements protested, as each protest is counted separately. Adjusting for cost claims, the data shows that agencies' risk-averse efforts may lead to self-initiated corrective actions to avoid sustained protests. In FY2014, GAO's workload consisted of 2,269 filings, with 2,135 procurements protested. The number of procurements protested tripled from FY2001-FY2014, indicating an increase in protests filed. The number of bid protests sustained by GAO has also increased, but the percentage of overall protests sustained has trended lower. This suggests that the increase in sustained protests is due to more protests filed, not an increase in government error rates. The trend in bid protest trends over the last six years shows a shift in the rate of government spending and protests filed. From FY2001-FY2008, government spending increased faster than protests filed, but from FY2008-FY2014, spending decreased while protests increased. The rate of GAO sustaining protests also decreased from FY2001-FY2008 to FY2009-FY2014, indicating that while more protests are being filed, winning a bid protest has become less likely. Even when GAO sustains a bid protest, the protesting company is not guaranteed to win the contract. Out of 1,500 procurements protested in FY2010, GAO sustained a protest in 45 cases, with only 8 resulting in the protesting party winning the contract. Accounting for agency corrective action, one observer estimated a 12% chance of winning a contract award as a result of a protest. Despite an increase in protests in recent years, the number of protests filed in FY2014 was not very high. The number of bid protests has increased in recent years, with common errors cited including poorly written requirements and failure to follow the bidding process. This rise in protests has sparked debate over the reasons behind it. The increase in bid protests is attributed to poor communication between government and industry, leading to confusion among contractors. Inadequate debriefing of losing bidders after contract awards can result in protests. Improving agency communication and debriefs could reduce the number of protests. The increase in bid protests is driven by factors such as the value of contracts, longer contract periods, insourcing trends, and decreased defense spending. Contractors are more desperate to win contracts and may protest to trigger a stay of award or influence future competitions. Protests can also demonstrate efforts to win contracts to shareholders and delay awards to hurt competition. As defense spending stabilizes, the number of protests may decrease. The increase in bid protests is driven by factors such as contract value, longer periods, insourcing trends, and decreased defense spending. Fear of protests influences agency behavior, leading to more rigorous market research and fair competitions. Government officials spend significant time avoiding protests, resulting in more complex and costly procurements. The fear of bid protests drives agencies to make procurements more complex and costly. Stringent rules restrict procurement preparation, discussions are limited, and post-selection debriefings are simplified to avoid protests. Various tactics, such as using Lowest Price Technically Acceptable contracts and re-competing sole source providers, are employed to prevent protests. Improving the contracting process could help reduce the number of protests filed and sustained. Improving the contracting process could reduce protests by addressing common grounds for sustaining protests, such as agencies not adhering to evaluation criteria or maintaining adequate documentation. GAO emphasizes the importance of documented records in determining the reasonableness of decisions. Under the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA), filing a bid protest with GAO can result in an automatic stay of contract award or performance. This stay ensures that agencies have the opportunity to remedy any violations found by GAO in procurement law or regulation. Congress mandated this stay in 1984 to address shortcomings in the bid protest process. In 1984, Congress identified a key issue in bid protest process - GAO lacks power to halt contract award or performance during a protest. Agencies often proceed with contracts, knowing delays in protests will prevent relief. CICA allows agency overrides of bid-protest stays for \"urgent and compelling circumstances\" that benefit the US. GAO must resolve protests within 100 days, which has always been met. In FY2014, protests were resolved on average within 39 days, with more than half resolved before an agency filed a report. The impact of a protest on a program's schedule can occur outside the protest period. Agency actions in response to a protest can cause delays. The number of bid protest cases against DOD has increased significantly, with delays in contract awards costing millions of dollars and impacting delivery of goods and services. GAO sustained a protest for the Next-Generation Jammer technology development contract, leading to a six-month delay. GAO issued opinions on 23% of protests, with a sustain rate of 11%. The number of protests filed against DOD has increased, along with the value of contract actions signed by DOD. The percentage of protests sustained against DOD has decreased in recent years. DOD procurements are less likely to be protested compared to the rest of the government. Protests against DOD are sustained at a lower rate than the rest of the government. From FY2008-FY2014, 2.5% of all protests against DOD were sustained by GAO, compared to over 5.0% of all protests against federal civilian agencies. The number of DOD procurements protested increased 170% from FY2001-FY2014, compared to a 260% increase for civilian agencies."
