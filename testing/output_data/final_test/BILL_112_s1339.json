Participants in rulemaking processes can represent economic, non-economic, or citizen interests. Before a final rule is published in the Federal Register, the agency must submit a list of non-Federal Government participants who provided public comments, including their name, address, and organizational affiliation. The General Services Administration compiles participant information from rulemaking agencies into a searchable database available online. They also provide quarterly trend statistics publicly. The General Services Administration Office compiles data from rulemaking agencies into a searchable database and provides quarterly trend statistics publicly. They also submit annual reports to Congress summarizing the data with an emphasis on participation in the regulatory process by economic, non-economic, and citizen interests.

The Administrator of General Services must create regulations within 90 days to implement this section. The Act will take effect 180 days after enactment."
