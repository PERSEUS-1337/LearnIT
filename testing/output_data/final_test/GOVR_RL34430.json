    "content": "Prior to the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, state-by-state standards for drivers' licenses and personal identification cards were in place without national standards. Legislation before September 11, 2001, aimed at discouraging national ID standards had bipartisan support. Congressional action on national standards for state-issued IDs before 9/11 was controversial. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 provided federal standards for state IDs used for federal purposes. States had the option to include Social Security numbers on licenses. Prior to the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, state-by-state standards for drivers' licenses and personal identification cards were in place without national standards. Legislation aimed at discouraging national ID standards had bipartisan support before September 11, 2001. The section requiring Social Security numbers on licenses faced public criticism and was later repealed in 2000. Congress prohibited funding for implementing regulations related to this requirement. The events of September 11, 2001, led to discussions on national standards for \"breeder documents,\" including drivers' licenses. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 established federal standards for the issuance of birth certificates, drivers' licenses, and personal identification cards in response to the 9/11 Commission's recommendations. The Act delegated authority to the Secretary of Transportation to set minimum standards for federal acceptance of these documents within 18 months of enactment. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 set federal standards for driver's licenses and identification cards, requiring specific information and security features to prevent fraud. States were mandated to confiscate compromised cards and follow regulations for issuance. The regulations for driver's licenses and identification cards set by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 included minimum standards for documentation, verification procedures, and application processing. States were prohibited from interfering with their own criteria for eligibility, especially regarding categories of individuals allowed to obtain licenses. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 set regulations for driver's licenses and identification cards, ensuring minimum standards for documentation and verification. States were not to be restricted in their eligibility criteria. The REAL ID Act of 2005 further addressed national standards for licenses and ID cards, requiring negotiated rulemaking involving various stakeholders. The REAL ID Act of 2005 established improved security measures for driver's licenses and personal identification cards, requiring states to comply with federal standards to have their documents recognized for official purposes. It also defined \"official purpose\" to include accessing federal facilities, boarding commercial aircraft, and entering nuclear power plants. The REAL ID Act of 2005 set federal standards for driver's licenses and ID cards for official purposes like accessing federal facilities, boarding aircraft, and entering nuclear power plants. It repealed previous laws and established minimum issuance standards for federal recognition. The REAL ID Act of 2005 established federal standards for driver's licenses and ID cards, including verifying an applicant's legal status in the United States before issuance. This provision preempts state verification standards and replaces them with new federal requirements. The REAL ID Act of 2005 requires states to verify the legal status of applicants and establishes a system for issuing temporary licenses and identification cards. Temporary cards must have expiration dates based on the applicant's authorized stay in the US, with renewals requiring valid evidence of status extension by the Secretary of Homeland Security. Any previous state provisions regarding temporary cards are preempted by REAL ID. Prior to the enactment of REAL ID, state laws regarding driver's licenses and identification cards are preempted by the act. States must adopt procedures to capture digital images of identity documents, retain copies for several years, conduct facial image captures, verify applicant information, confirm Social Security numbers, and ensure security in card production locations. REAL ID imposes strict security measures for the production and issuance of driver's licenses and identification cards, including physical security of production locations, security clearance for authorized personnel, fraudulent document recognition training, and an eight-year validity limit. States must use unique identifiers for non-compliant documents. The REAL ID Act requires states to clearly mark documents as not for official purposes, maintain a comprehensive motor vehicle database, and provide electronic access to other states. It preempts state laws in favor of federal standards. Section 203 of REAL ID also amends a federal crime statute related to transportation of fraudulent documents. The REAL ID Act broadens the scope of federal crimes related to identification features, requiring the Secretary of Homeland Security to enter personal information of offenders into an aviation-screening database. It also authorizes grants to states for conforming to new national standards. The REAL ID Act authorizes grants to states for conforming to new national standards and gives the Secretary of Homeland Security the authority to promulgate regulations and issue grants. The Secretary must consult with the Secretary of Transportation and states, and can extend deadlines for compliance with adequate justification. The Department of Homeland Security published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for REAL ID in 2007, proposing requirements to meet minimum standards. The REAL ID Act proposed requirements for information and security features on cards, application information for identity verification, and security standards for card production facilities. DHS received over 21,000 comments on the proposal before final regulations were issued in January 2008. Constitutional concerns were raised, including violations of states' rights under the Tenth Amendment. The REAL ID Act raises constitutional concerns regarding violations of states' rights under the Tenth Amendment, encroachment on the right to travel, potential violations of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, and infringement on the right to freely assemble, associate, and petition the government. Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce is not unlimited and has been constrained by the Court's interpretation of the Tenth Amendment. The Court's decision in Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority emphasized that disputes over federal commerce power legislation's impact on state sovereignty are political questions. The Tenth Amendment is seen as a tool to protect states' sovereign interests, as shown in New York v. United States where the Court ruled that a federal statute commandeered the state lawmaking process. The Court in Printz v. United States extended the anti-commandeering principle to include a state's legislative process, emphasizing that state sovereignty includes control over their legislative process and that states are not mere political subdivisions of the United States. The \"take title\" provision was deemed a threat to state sovereignty as it could cause confusion among citizens regarding government responsibilities. In Printz v. United States, the Court extended the anti-commandeering principle to include a state's executive functions, such as law enforcement. The case involved the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which required state officials to conduct federal background checks on handgun purchasers. The Court ruled the Brady provisions unconstitutional, emphasizing state sovereignty and the potential confusion between state and federal government responsibilities. In 2000, the Supreme Court upheld provisions of the Driver's Privacy Protection Act (DPPA), regulating states' ability to disclose information from motor vehicle departments. The Court distinguished the DPPA from previous cases, stating it does not require states to regulate their citizens or enforce federal statutes. The Supreme Court upheld the Driver's Privacy Protection Act (DPPA) in 2000, stating that it was \"generally applicable\" and did not require states to enforce federal statutes on their citizens. The question of whether federal acceptance standards could still raise federalism concerns remains unanswered, as no cases challenging the law's constitutionality have been filed yet. The Supreme Court has affirmed the right to travel as a privilege of national citizenship under the Constitution, protecting various aspects such as entering and leaving states, being treated as a welcome visitor, and the rights of permanent residents. Precedents on the right to travel have developed along two main strands. The right to travel is considered a fundamental right under the Constitution, with precedents developed along two primary strands. The first strand involves burdens imposed by state governments under the Fourteenth Amendment, while the second strand involves federally imposed burdens on international travel under the Fifth Amendment's due process clause. Strict scrutiny is applied, requiring the government to provide a compelling state interest for the burden and show that the means utilized are narrowly tailored to the goal. The Court has upheld burdens on travel as long as they are uniformly applied and support safety and integrity of travel facilities. Highway tolls and airport fees have been upheld, but a general tax on individuals leaving a state may impermissibly restrict travel. Federally imposed burdens on interstate travel are subject to a rational basis test, requiring laws to be rationally related to a legitimate government interest. The government may not need to show a compelling interest for travel-related restrictions. REAL ID could impose an additional burden on travelers, but ensuring security and validity of identification documents is likely a compelling governmental interest. The government may argue that the identification requirements are justifiable and increase passenger safety and transportation facility security. The REAL ID requirements are justifiable and impose minimal burden on the right to travel. Not having a REAL ID will not prevent boarding aircraft, but alternative identification or additional security screening will be required. Some opponents argue that the digital photograph requirement violates religious beliefs. The Supreme Court has affirmed that the Free Exercise Clause protects religious beliefs, but the protection for religiously motivated conduct has varied. In recent years, the Court has developed a balancing test to determine when government requirements must allow exceptions for citizens with religious objections, such as the photo requirement in REAL ID. In Sherbert v. Verner, a religious exemption was required from a secular economic regulation for a Seventh Day Adventist who refused Saturday work. The Court held that denial of benefits to a Seventh Day Adventist for refusing Saturday work could be justified under the Free Exercise Clause if it did not infringe on her constitutional rights. The \"compelling state interest\" test was applied in cases like Wisconsin v. Yoder, where a state law requiring Amish children to attend public school violated the Free Exercise Clause. The Court ruled that government actions must have a \"compelling interest\" to justify infringing on religious beliefs, such as in cases involving Social Security participation and tax exemptions for discriminatory practices. In Employment Division v. Smith, the Court determined that the \"compelling interest test\" does not apply to exempt individuals from generally applicable criminal laws, even if based on religious beliefs. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) was enacted in 1993 to supersede the Court's ruling in Smith, stating that laws must further a compelling governmental interest and be the least restrictive means to substantially burden the free exercise of religion. The purpose of RFRA was to restore the compelling interest test for free exercise cases. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) was enacted in 1993 to restore the compelling interest test for free exercise cases, as declared by Congress. In the case of Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao Do Vegetal, the Supreme Court affirmed a preliminary injunction preventing the government from prosecuting practitioners of a religious sect for using a prohibited hallucinogen in their communion tea. The government must demonstrate a compelling interest to restrict religious practices involving controlled substances. The Court ruled in favor of plaintiffs in a case involving the religious use of a drug, stating that the government must show a compelling interest for restricting religious practices. The government's argument for uniform application of the law under REAL ID may conflict with religious exemptions required by the First Amendment. Some argue that REAL ID violates the First Amendment by restricting citizens' rights to freely assemble, associate, and petition the government. This is because linking enhanced identification to air travel limits individuals' liberties protected by the First Amendment, hindering their ability to move freely throughout the country. The Supreme Court has indicated that anonymity is protected by the First Amendment, citing precedents such as Thomas v. Collins where a Texas statute requiring labor organizers to register was invalidated. The Court has upheld citizens' right to anonymity, especially when not suspected of a crime, suggesting that the identification requirement may violate the First Amendment right to be anonymous. The Supreme Court has upheld the right of citizens to be anonymous, especially when not suspected of a crime. Claims regarding the rights of association and petition of the government do not receive the same support. The regulations of REAL ID are aimed at preventing fraudulent identification documents for federal purposes, with an indirect effect on First Amendment rights. The Court scrutinizes regulations only when conduct with a significant expressive element draws legal remedy. The REAL ID regulations have been criticized for imposing an unconstitutional \"unfunded mandate\" on states, with some arguing that it infringes on First Amendment rights. The regulations aim to prevent fraudulent identification documents for federal purposes, potentially impacting the right to associate or petition the government. The federal government has imposed REAL ID requirements on states without adequate funding, leading to arguments about unconstitutional \"unfunded mandates\" and the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) provisions to limit such mandates. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) establishes requirements for committees and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to study and report on the impact of mandates in proposed legislation. It includes point-of-order procedures to enforce requirements and block measures with unfunded intergovernmental mandates. UMRA also mandates federal agencies to prepare written statements identifying costs and benefits of any federal mandate exceeding $100 million annually. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) requires assessments to include estimates of the effect on the national economy, consultations with non-federal government officials, and a summary of comments received. Federal agencies must consider multiple policy options and choose the most cost-effective alternative. Judicial review is limited to ensuring procedural compliance, and failure to comply does not invalidate a rule. UMRA may exempt certain regulations, like REAL ID, from its requirements. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) exempts regulations necessary for national security and those incorporating requirements set forth in law. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) justified REAL ID not being an unfunded mandate by citing these provisions. DHS complied with UMRA by analyzing costs, considering alternatives, and seeking input from state and local governments. Non-compliant states' drivers' licenses and IDs will not be accepted for federal purposes starting May 11, 2008. The REAL ID Act deadline of May 11, 2008, can be extended by states if they notify DHS by March 31, 2008. Extensions will be valid until December 31, 2009. 49 states and the District of Columbia have been granted extensions, except for Maine. Some states have requested extensions due to existing state laws or concerns about REAL ID requirements. States can request extensions for the REAL ID Act deadline, with the possibility of a second extension until May 10, 2011, if they demonstrate \"material compliance\" with the requirements. The decision to grant extensions is at the discretion of the Secretary or his designee. States can request extensions for the REAL ID Act deadline, with the possibility of a second extension until May 10, 2011, if they demonstrate \"material compliance\" with the requirements. The decision to grant a second extension is solely at the discretion of the Secretary or his designee. States must meet all REAL ID requirements by specific deadlines based on birth dates. Since its adoption in 2005, REAL ID has been a contentious issue among state legislatures and governors, leading to increased state responses to its requirements. Only six states\u2014Indiana, Nevada, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia, and Wisconsin\u2014have enacted legislation adopting or requiring federal minimum standards of REAL ID. The statutes vary in type and effectiveness, with some needing reaffirmation during the next appropriations cycle. Twelve states have pending language to comply with REAL ID, while nine states like Georgia and Idaho have not taken action yet. Nine states, including Georgia and Idaho, have adopted statutes indicating a refusal to comply with REAL ID requirements. Montana has the strongest non-compliance law, directing state agencies not to participate in REAL ID and report any attempts by DHS to implement it. Other states have varying levels of non-compliance measures, such as Idaho appropriating $0 for implementation and Georgia allowing the governor to delay unless certain conditions are met. Additionally, 15 states have adopted non-binding resolutions urging compliance. In 15 states, legislative chambers have adopted resolutions urging Congress to amend or repeal REAL ID, with a total of 24 states passing legislation against state compliance. Some states have bills pending to prohibit compliance, while others have non-binding resolutions awaiting action. The implications of states not complying with REAL ID are uncertain as the act is voluntary for states and binding only on federal agencies. The REAL ID Act is voluntary for states and binding only on federal agencies. There is no penalty for non-compliance, but citizens of non-compliant states may face consequences such as being unable to use their state-issued IDs for official purposes like boarding a federally regulated aircraft or entering a federal building. The REAL ID Act is voluntary for states and binding only on federal agencies. Non-compliant states may create holes in the state-to-state data sharing system of REAL ID, potentially causing conflicts among compliant states during verification processes. The existence of non-compliant states under the REAL ID Act may lead to conflicts among states and with the federal government. Questions arise about the validity of non-compliant IDs in compliant states and vice versa. Some non-compliant states have requested extensions from DHS, including Georgia, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Washington. The DHS has received extension requests from Georgia, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Washington regarding compliance with the REAL ID Act. Despite the distinction between extension requests and non-compliance, DHS's response suggests flexibility in interpreting the statutory language. The final regulations issued by DHS in January 2008 addressed various elements of REAL ID, including the requirement for the name on the card to match the source documents used for identity verification. The name on a REAL ID-compliant card must match the name on the identity document presented during the application. Exceptions are allowed for name variations due to marriage, adoption, court order, or other legal mechanisms. Critics argue that this requirement can be burdensome due to the lack of uniform naming conventions on federal and foreign documents. The REAL ID standard's lack of uniform naming requirements makes implementation burdensome. Some name variations may not be covered by state laws, leading to potential application rejections. Applicants may need to reconcile name variations on their documents. DHS allows variations accepted by state laws and regulations. The final REAL ID regulations have been modified to align with naming conventions used by various agencies. Two provisions address the applicant's principal address, defining it as the current domicile. Applicants must provide two documents showing their principal residence. The principal residence must appear on the face and machine-readable portion of the REAL ID. Exceptions to displaying the principal residence on the REAL ID include State address confidentiality programs for victims of violence, address suppression under State or Federal law, and protection from disclosure under the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. Several concerns have been raised about the provision in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 regarding the display of principal residence on REAL IDs. One concern is the impact on homeless and low-income individuals without permanent residences. Another concern is the effect on individuals who need to keep their address confidential for safety reasons but reside in states without procedures to accommodate this. The Department of Homeland Security has stated that states have the authority to issue REAL IDs to individuals, including the homeless, with properly documented exceptions. The Department of Homeland Security allows states to issue REAL IDs to individuals, including the homeless, with documented exceptions. Concerns remain about personal security and confidentiality issues, as only 24 jurisdictions have formal programs in place to protect address confidentiality. It is unclear how individuals at risk will be protected in states without these programs. The REAL ID program allows states to create confidential programs for issuing driver's licenses and identification cards. States must verify the validity of supporting documents presented by applicants, with specific standards outlined in the regulations. Verification can be done electronically or through alternative methods approved by DHS. The regulations for the REAL ID program outline verification methods for different types of documents presented by applicants, including those issued by DHS, Social Security numbers, and birth certificates. Verification can be done through SAVE for DHS documents, the Social Security Administration or approved methods for SSNs, and the EVVE system or other electronic systems for birth certificates. The final rule for the REAL ID program outlines verification methods for different types of documents, including DHS documents, Social Security numbers, and birth certificates. While verification methods are specified for DHS and SSNs, there is uncertainty about how states will comply with birth certificate verification due to the unavailability of the EVVE system. Verification of documents issued by the Department of State and REAL IDs from other states also lack specific electronic systems or preferred methods in the final rule. The final rule for the REAL ID program outlines verification methods for different types of documents, including DHS documents, Social Security numbers, and birth certificates. Verification methods are specified for DHS and SSNs, but uncertainty remains about how states will comply with birth certificate verification due to the unavailability of the EVVE system. Regarding REAL IDs issued by other states, verification will be required with the state of issuance, but no specific system is mentioned. Concerns were raised about verifying an applicant's \"principal residence\" as no electronic means currently exist for this verification at the state or federal level. The final regulation for the REAL ID program requires states to use compatible machine-readable technology and specific data elements on the bar code, but it is unclear if states will be required to verify an individual's address of principal residence for full compliance. The final regulation for the REAL ID program mandates specific data elements on the bar code, including expiration date, full legal name, date of transaction, date of birth, gender, address, unique ID number, card design revision date, inventory control number, and state of issuance. 45 states and the District of Columbia already comply with the PDF417 standard, but some states may need to adjust the information stored in the bar code to meet the regulations. The REAL ID program regulations do not require biometric technology or RFID on compliant licenses. Security and privacy concerns regarding machine-readable requirements were addressed by DHS. Some states have provisions to prohibit third-party collection of data on bar codes, which DHS supports. The REAL ID program regulations require states to capture digital images of identity source documents and retain them for a minimum of 7 years. States can also retain key personal information instead of storing birth certificate images if permitted by state laws. Physical security of locations is also mandated by REAL ID. The REAL ID program mandates states to ensure physical security at facilities where driver's licenses and identification cards are produced. States must submit a security plan addressing facility security and protection of personally identifiable information. The REAL ID program requires states to have security plans for facilities involved in producing driver's licenses and identification cards, including physical security, document security features, access controls, training, emergency plans, audit controls, and confidentiality protection. Critics have noted a lack of defined standards and best practices in the regulations. The DHS is working with DOT, AAMVA, and states to develop recommended practices for REAL ID program. Concerns raised about protecting personally identifiable information in interconnected state databases. Regulations provide guidance but can be flexible for additional protections. Unclear if states are required to provide electronic access to databases. Section 37.33 outlines minimum data fields for state databases. The final regulations for the REAL ID program outline the minimum data fields required for state databases, including personal information, driver's history, and machine-readable zone details. There is uncertainty regarding interstate data exchange and access to state databases by other entities. The final regulations for the REAL ID program require background checks for state motor vehicle employees involved in producing driver's licenses. Checks include criminal history, employment eligibility verification, and reference checks for new employees. The REAL ID program requires background checks for state motor vehicle employees involved in producing driver's licenses. Employees and applicants can be disqualified for certain felony convictions or violations of immigration laws. Critics argue that REAL ID could lead to a national identification card. Opponents of the REAL ID program argue that it will turn state workers into immigration enforcement officials, increase federal government involvement in state-issued identification documents, and potentially expand the use of REAL ID-compliant licenses for various activities like voting and firearm registration. The DHS final rule on REAL ID limits its uses to accessing federal facilities, boarding aircraft, and entering nuclear power plants, aiming to prevent it from becoming a national ID. DHS also clarifies that it does not intend to create a database of all driver's license holders. The REAL ID program requires all cards to be identical and issued by the same federal entity, making it unlikely to become a national ID. Participation is voluntary, with restrictions on DHS's card design regulation. Issuance remains at the state level, with provisions for temporary IDs for non-citizens lawfully present in the US. Non-citizens in the US with lawful presence can apply for REAL IDs, limited in validity based on their lawful presence. Some states issue licenses to all, while others like New York and California do not permit undocumented individuals to receive IDs. The decision to issue drivers' licenses or personal identification cards to individuals regardless of their immigration status remains with the states, even with the implementation of REAL ID. States can choose to issue non-REAL ID-compliant documents with unique identifiers, allowing them to still be in compliance with the law. For example, New York proposed a three-tiered system for issuing documents. New York proposed a three-tiered system for issuing documents, including REAL IDs, enhanced drivers' licenses, and non-compliant licenses. This system was in compliance with REAL ID and other federal laws, such as the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative. The REAL ID requirements focus on ensuring accurate identity verification for state-issued licenses and identification cards, rather than denoting citizenship. Non-citizen residents can obtain licenses by demonstrating lawful presence in the US. The REAL ID requirements focus on accurate identity verification for state-issued licenses and ID cards, not citizenship. Driver's licenses or ID cards alone may not satisfy the standard for entry to the US. State-issued IDs are not included in the WHTI Land/Sea Rule, and alternative documents are being developed to meet Congress' standards. The WHTI requires documents to show both identity and citizenship. Initially, only passports met this requirement. Some states, like Washington, now issue enhanced driver's licenses (EDLs) that comply with WHTI by including citizenship information. Other states, such as New York, Vermont, and Arizona, have also shown interest in creating EDLs. New York, Vermont, and Arizona have signed Memoranda of Understanding with DHS for EDL pilot programs. EDLs require U.S. citizenship and use RFID technology, while REAL IDs use a bar code system. EDLs may qualify as REAL IDs, but not vice versa. Some EDLs may comply with REAL ID, but not all REAL IDs will qualify as WHTI-compliant EDLs. Determining eligibility requires a careful review of issuing requirements and document contents."
