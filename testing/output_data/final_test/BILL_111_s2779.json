    "content": "The Upper Mississippi River Basin Protection Act establishes a sediment and nutrient monitoring network, with responsibilities for data collection, storage, collaboration with other monitoring efforts, reporting requirements, and a National Research Council assessment. Additionally, it includes provisions for computer modeling and research. The Upper Mississippi River Basin Protection Act includes provisions for computer modeling and research of sediment and nutrient sources, use of electronic means for information distribution, and reporting requirements. Authorization of appropriations and cost-sharing requirements are also addressed in the act. The Upper Mississippi River Basin Protection Act defines key terms such as \"Upper Mississippi River Basin\" and \"Upper Mississippi River Stewardship Initiative\" related to monitoring nutrient and sediment loss in the watershed. The Act emphasizes the use of sound science to identify and quantify sources of nutrients. The Upper Mississippi River Basin Protection Act emphasizes the use of sound science to quantify nutrient and sediment sources, transport, and effects of treatment methods. Sound science requires documented protocols for data collection and analysis, and peer review of results and findings. Federal investments in the Upper Mississippi River Basin must be guided by sound science. Establishment of a monitoring network is emphasized in Title I. The Secretary of the Interior will establish a sediment and nutrient monitoring network for the Upper Mississippi River Basin to identify sources, quantify processes, record changes over time, provide data for computer modeling, and identify major sources of sediment and nutrients. The Secretary of the Interior will establish a sediment and nutrient monitoring network for the Upper Mississippi River Basin to identify major sources of sediment and nutrients. The United States Geological Survey will carry out this task. SEC. 102. DATA COLLECTION AND STORAGE RESPONSIBILITIES.\n\nThe Secretary of the Interior will set guidelines for sediment and nutrient monitoring data collection, ensuring consistent methods, reporting, storage, and archiving practices. Data from monitoring in the Upper Mississippi River Basin will be made public with generic identifiers and codes, respecting landowner privacy for stations on private lands.\n\nSEC. 103. RELATIONSHIP TO EXISTING SEDIMENT AND NUTRIENT MONITORING. The Secretary of the Interior will inventory existing sediment and nutrient monitoring efforts to identify overlaps, data gaps, and redundancies. They will integrate these efforts into the monitoring network required by section 101 and make maximum use of existing data and programs from various entities. The Secretary of the Interior will coordinate with the long-term estuary assessment project to develop the sediment and nutrient monitoring network required by section 101. The Secretary of the Interior will collaborate with other monitoring programs to establish the sediment and nutrient monitoring network. Reporting to Congress is required within 180 days of the enactment of this Act. The National Research Council will conduct a water resources assessment of the Upper Mississippi River Basin. SEC. 201. COMPUTER MODELING AND RESEARCH OF SEDIMENT AND NUTRIENT SOURCES. The Upper Mississippi River Stewardship Initiative requires the establishment of a modeling program by the Director of the United States Geological Survey to identify significant sources of sediment and nutrients in the Upper Mississippi River Basin. Computer modeling will be used to pinpoint subwatersheds contributing to sediment and nutrient loss for targeted reduction efforts. The program includes models to link nutrient and sediment loss to landscape, land use, and management practices, as well as models defining river channel nutrient transformation processes. Models will define river channel nutrient transformation processes and collect ancillary information in GIS format, including land use, soils, elevation, sediment and nutrient reduction actions, and remotely sensed data. The Director of the US Geological Survey will establish an Internet system within 90 days to provide information on programs, sediment/nutrient levels, and successful projects in the Upper Mississippi River Basin. SEC. 203. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.\n\nThe Director of the US Geological Survey will provide annual reports on monitoring activities in the Upper Mississippi River Basin to Congress and the public, starting one year after the Act's enactment. Additionally, progress reports on modeling activities will be provided every three years. SEC. 301 authorizes $6,250,000 annually for the US Geological Survey, with one-third for the Cooperative Water Program and the rest for the Hydrologic Networks and Analysis Program. $650,000 is allocated for the National Research Council's assessment under section 106. SEC. 302 outlines cost-sharing requirements. SEC. 302 states that funds for the US Geological Survey Cooperative Water Program must adhere to the same cost-sharing requirements as specified in the Department of the Interior Appropriations Act of 2006."
