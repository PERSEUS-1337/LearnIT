    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Promotion and Expansion of Private Employee Ownership Act of 2011\". It includes findings related to private employee ownership. Congress finds that employees were first allowed to be owners of subchapter S corporations in 1998, leading to incentives for businesses to become ESOP-owned S corporations. Since then, thousands of companies have become ESOP-owned S corporations, providing ownership opportunities for millions of Americans across various industries in every state. Recent studies have shown that employees of ESOP-owned S corporations enjoy greater job stability and have amassed meaningful retirement savings through their ESOP accounts, providing them with the means to retire with dignity. The Small Business Administration denies small business status to a company after an ESOP acquires over 49% of the business, even if other eligibility criteria remain the same. Congress aims to support employee ownership of S corporations through ESOPs. SEC. 3 amends the definition of qualified securities for employee stock ownership plans sponsored by S corporations. The amendment applies to sales after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 4 establishes a Department of Treasury Technical Assistance Office. SEC. 4 establishes the S Corporation Employee Ownership Assistance Office to promote employee ownership of S corporations by providing education, outreach, and technical assistance. SEC. 5 amends the Small Business Act to support employee stock ownership. SEC. 45 addresses employee stock ownership plans. The section defines ESOP and ESOP business concern, stating that for eligibility purposes, each ESOP participant is considered to directly own their share of the stock in the ESOP business concern. The amendments made by this section will take effect on January 1 of the first calendar year after the enactment of this Act."
