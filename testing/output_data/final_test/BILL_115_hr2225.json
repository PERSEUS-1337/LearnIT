    "content": "The \"Veterans Dog Training Therapy Act\" may be cited as the short title. The Department of Veterans Affairs will implement a pilot program on dog training therapy. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will conduct a pilot program to assess the effectiveness of using service dogs to address mental health issues in veterans with disabilities. The program will be carried out through the Center for Compassionate Innovation and will last for five years. The pilot program aims to contract with non-government entities certified in service dog training near three to five VA medical centers. These entities will be provided access to suitable training areas for educating veterans on service dog training, including grooming and wheelchair accessibility. The pilot program requires contracted non-government entities to have indoor and outdoor training spaces, wheelchair accessibility, classroom and office space, storage for equipment, access to other training areas, and transportation for field trips. Additionally, they must employ a person with clinical mental health experience and ensure veterans receive training from certified service dog instructors. The pilot program for service dog training requires certified instructors to teach essential commands, provide hands-on training, maximize therapeutic benefits for veterans, and give preference to hiring instructors who are veterans themselves. The pilot program for service dog training is administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs through the Center for Compassionate Innovation in collaboration with the Recreation Therapy Service. A director of therapeutic service dog training is established with specific qualifications and experience requirements. The pilot program for service dog training is overseen by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs in collaboration with the Recreation Therapy Service. Veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder can volunteer to participate if resources are available. Data will be collected to assess the program's effectiveness for participants. The program aims to assist veterans by reducing stigma related to mental health conditions, improving emotional regulation, patience, and sense of purpose. It also helps in reintegration, socialization, relationship building, relaxation, improving sleep patterns, and reducing pain medication use. The pilot program aims to assist veterans in reducing pain medication use and improving symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and post-deployment adjustment difficulties. Reports to Congress will include the number of participants, services provided, and effects on various aspects of veterans' well-being. The curr_chunk discusses potential physiological markers related to interactions with service dogs, family dynamics, insomnia and pain management, overall well-being, and recommendations for the pilot program. The term \"service dog training instructor\" is defined as an instructor who trains veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder in service dog handling."
