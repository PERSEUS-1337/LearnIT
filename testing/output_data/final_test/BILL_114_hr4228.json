    "content": "The \"Transportation Megaprojects Accountability and Oversight Act of 2015\" requires additional requirements for certain transportation projects. The \"Transportation Megaprojects Accountability and Oversight Act of 2015\" mandates that projects with a cost of $2,500,000,000 or more must submit a comprehensive risk management plan to the Secretary for authorization. The \"Transportation Megaprojects Accountability and Oversight Act of 2015\" requires megaproject recipients to submit a risk management plan to track and control risks, provide updated cost estimates, and maintain financial reserves for addressing risks. Additionally, recipients must establish a peer review group for oversight. The \"Transportation Megaprojects Accountability and Oversight Act of 2015\" mandates that recipients of assistance for megaprojects establish a peer review group within 90 days of project authorization. The group must consist of at least 5 individuals, including one with project management experience, to provide expert advice on scientific, technical, and project management aspects. Membership guidelines must be established within 180 days of the enactment of the Act. The peer review group for a megaproject must be selected based on publicly available criteria, with no conflicts of interest allowed. The group must meet annually until project completion. The peer review group for a megaproject must review the scope, schedule, and budget, and submit findings to the Secretary, Congress, and the recipient. The amendment requires recipients of Federal financial assistance for megaprojects to publish information about supervising engineers and project reports on their website. This applies to projects authorized for construction one year after the enactment of the Act."
