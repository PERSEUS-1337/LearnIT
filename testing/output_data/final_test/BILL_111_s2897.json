    "content": "The Energy Efficiency Modernization Act of 2009 may be cited as the \"Energy Efficiency Modernization Act.\" Congressional findings are also included in the Act. Congress finds that federally assisted housing programs offer opportunities for energy efficiency improvements, leading to long-term cost savings, job creation, and industry best practices. A Government Accountability Office study revealed that HUD spends around $5 billion annually on energy costs for 6 million assisted housing units. Harvard University Graduate School of Design reports that over 80% of federally assisted housing could benefit from energy efficiency upgrades. Increasing the energy efficiency of federally-assisted housing by 25-40% could save HUD $1-1.5 billion annually, benefiting taxpayers in the long run. SEC. 3. GREEN DIVIDEND PROGRAM FOR FEDERALLY ASSISTED RENTAL HOUSING. The Secretary will establish a program to provide green dividends to owners of federally assisted housing projects who make utility cost-saving measures, resulting in annual distributions of surplus project funds equal to 50% of the savings plus reasonable costs incurred by the owner. The program will provide green dividends to owners of federally assisted housing projects for implementing utility cost-saving measures. The dividends will be in addition to standard distributions authorized by regulations. The Secretary will establish standardized methods for measurement and monitoring. Methods for accurately measuring baseline utility use, monitoring reductions in utility use, and tracking utility cost savings in federally assisted housing projects. These methods will account for changes in utility costs and other relevant factors. The Secretary will establish requirements for owners of federally assisted housing projects to apply for the program and select applications based on criteria. Guidelines will ensure cost-effective utility measures and energy performance contracts. The Secretary will establish guidelines for the use of energy performance contracting and financing costs for utility cost-saving measures in federally assisted housing projects. Owners must report to the Secretary if they receive a green dividend under the program. The Secretary will establish guidelines for energy performance contracting and financing costs for utility cost-saving measures in federally assisted housing projects. Owners must report to the Secretary regarding the project, cost-saving measures, and savings in accordance with requirements. The Secretary will submit reports to Congress on the implementation and operation of the program, including an initial report within 180 days of the enactment of the Act. The Secretary will submit annual reports on the program's operation. States are prohibited from enforcing laws that restrict the amount of funding for energy-saving measures in federally assisted housing projects. The section discusses the distribution of surplus project funds from federally assisted housing projects, with exceptions for state-financed projects or projects where the owner waives the distribution. Definitions for \"covered federally assisted housing project\" are also provided. The curr_chunk discusses multifamily rental housing projects that receive financial assistance from the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and are subject to limitations on fund distributions. The term \"surplus project funds\" refers to the net revenue of the project after expenses have been paid. The curr_chunk explains utility cost savings and cost-saving measures for federally assisted housing projects. Utility cost savings refer to the difference in energy or water costs before and after implementing measures, while cost-saving measures include rehabilitation and renovation. The curr_chunk discusses regulations for energy and water conservation measures in federally assisted housing projects, including renovations and improvements. The Secretary must issue necessary regulations within 180 days of the enactment of the Act. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development will review regulations on residual receipts accounts in federally assisted rental housing to clarify the use of funds for energy efficiency. Policies on reserve for replacement funds will be revised to encourage their use for energy efficiency items. Study on exemption from building codes for distributive energy generation and water efficiency measures. The Comptroller General will conduct a study to analyze the benefits of establishing a statutory exemption from State and local building codes for distributive energy generation and water efficiency measures in multifamily housing assisted by HUD. Information collected will be provided to the Secretary of Energy. A report is due within 6 months. The Comptroller General will submit a report to Congress and the Secretary of Energy within 6 months of the enactment of this Act, detailing the results and conclusions of the study on exempting multifamily housing assisted by HUD from State and local building codes for distributive energy generation and water efficiency measures. SEC. 6. REPORTS ON UTILITY CONSUMPTION FOR HUD-ASSISTED MULTIFAMILY PROJECTS. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development requires owners of assisted multifamily housing projects to report utility consumption regularly. The Secretary compiles this information and submits an annual report to Congress and the Energy Information Administration. The report includes non-aggregated data on total utility consumption by these projects. Assisted multifamily housing projects receive project-based assistance under various housing acts or are financed through insured loans. Assisted multifamily housing projects can receive assistance under different housing acts or through insured loans as determined by specific sections of the National Housing Act."
