    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Palestinian and United Nations Anti-Terrorism Act of 2014\". Congress found that a unity government was formed in Palestine in 2014, including Hamas, a designated terrorist organization. The US law requires certifications to provide assistance to any Palestinian government with Hamas members or influence, but the President has not made these certifications for the current government. The Palestinian Authority leadership has failed to denounce Hamas' terrorism against Israel and President Abbas has refused to dissolve the power-sharing agreement with Hamas despite ongoing rocket attacks. The Israeli Defense Forces have made efforts to limit civilian casualties, while the UN Human Rights Council criticized Israel's military operations in Gaza. The United Nations Human Rights Council has a history of anti-Israel actions, ignoring human rights violations in other countries. UNRWA found rockets in one of its schools in Gaza, returned them to Palestinian officials. Hamas used UNRWA facilities to store weapons and conduct attacks during the Gaza conflict. SEC. 3. DECLARATION OF POLICY. The United States will deny assistance to entities collaborating with Hamas until they recognize Israel, renounce violence, disarm, and accept prior agreements. Negotiated settlements require Hamas and other terrorist groups to disarm. Security assistance will be provided to Israel for defense against threats. SEC. 4. RESTRICTIONS ON AID TO THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY. Any power-sharing government formed in connection with the 2014 agreement between the Palestinian Liberation Organization and Hamas is considered a \"Hamas-controlled Palestinian Authority\". SEC. 5. REFORM OF UNITED NATIONS HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL. Until the Secretary of State certifies to Congress that the United Nations Human Rights Council's agenda meets certain requirements, the US will reduce its contribution to the UN budget, refrain from voluntary contributions to the Council, and not run for a seat on the Council. The US will reduce its contribution to the UN budget and refrain from voluntary contributions to the Human Rights Council until the Council's agenda meets certain requirements. Any withheld funds will revert to the US Treasury and not be considered arrears to be repaid to the UN. The US will reduce its contribution to the UN budget and refrain from voluntary contributions to the Human Rights Council until certain requirements are met. Any withheld funds will revert to the US Treasury and not be considered arrears to be repaid to the UN. Additionally, the United States contributions to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) will be affected. Section 301(c) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended regarding US contributions to UNRWA for programs in the West Bank and Gaza. No funds will be provided until the Secretary certifies that no UNRWA official is affiliated with Hamas. UNRWA must ensure that its members do not have ties to terrorist groups or promote anti-Israel or anti-Semitic rhetoric. Additionally, UNRWA facilities must not be used by Hamas or its affiliates for any illicit activities. Financial audits by independent firms are also required. UNRWA has implemented oversight to prevent resources from being used by terrorist groups. Congressional committees defined as appropriate for oversight. The House of Representatives oversees appropriations and government reform. Israeli security assistance is authorized to receive the equivalent amount of US contributions withheld from Palestinian entities for missile defense systems, underground warfare training, and technology to deter tunneling from Palestinian-controlled territories into Israel."
