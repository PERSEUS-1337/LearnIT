    "content": "The Act titled \"Preventive Medicine for a Healthier America Act of 2006\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 contains findings related to the Act. The Congress finds that improving population health and reducing medical costs requires preventive methods. There is a need for more public health professionals, as there are only around 6,000 board-certified preventive medicine physicians. Many healthcare costs are spent on preventable chronic conditions. The number of preventive medicine residency programs and professionals in the field has decreased. Preventive medicine physicians play a unique role in serving patients and communities, and a strong public health system relies on a strong preventive medicine workforce. Loan payment assistance is provided for preventive medicine physicians. Loan payment assistance is available for eligible preventive medicine physicians who receive board certification in preventive medicine between fiscal years 2007 and 2011. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may pay up to $20,000 of their medical education loans. Physicians must submit an application containing required information to receive this payment. Authorization of Appropriations is granted for the loan payment assistance program for preventive medicine physicians who achieve board certification between fiscal years 2007 and 2011. The term \"school of medicine\" and \"Secretary\" are defined in the Public Health Service Act. SEC. 4. WELLNESS PROGRAM CREDIT. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to include a new section for a wellness program credit. The wellness program credit under section 38 allows eligible employers to receive $200 per qualified employee for implementing a qualified wellness program. The credit is limited to 25% of the employer's regular tax liability. Eligible employers must develop and maintain records of employee participation in preventive health screenings and programs. A qualified wellness program for eligible employers includes preventive health screenings, counseling, seminars, and resources related to smoking, obesity, stress management, and physical fitness. It must be developed with a board-certified physician in preventive medicine. A qualified wellness program for eligible employers covers various health aspects such as physical fitness, nutrition, substance abuse, depression, mental health, heart disease, and maternal and infant health. Qualified employees must be full-time employees participating in the program. The text discusses the definition of a qualified participant in a wellness program for eligible employers, requiring participation in at least 2 preventive health screenings or programs. The section mentioned will not apply after December 31, 2011. Additionally, a conforming amendment is made to Section 38(b) of the Code to include the wellness program credit. The text introduces a new wellness program credit under section 45N(a) and amends the table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct a national education campaign to promote preventive health screenings. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2007 through 2011."
