    "content": "The tax code contains temporary tax provisions, often extended by Congress in \"tax extender\" packages. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 made some provisions permanent, reducing the number of expiring \"tax extender\" provisions in 2016. Enacting temporary tax provisions allows Congress to evaluate effectiveness before extension or expiration, provide relief during economic weakness or disasters, and for budgetary reasons. Evaluating the reasons for temporary provisions is crucial in determining whether they should be extended. In practice, temporary tax provisions are regularly extended without systematic review, undermining the rationale for their enactment. Despite the theory that expiration dates force policymakers to consider costs and benefits, no real systematic review occurs. Instead, expiring tax provisions are typically passed as a package without careful analysis. While most provisions are extended, there have been exceptions such as tax incentives for alcohol fuels. Tax incentives for alcohol fuels, like ethanol, were not extended beyond 2011 due to duplicative benefits and no increase in consumption. Congress evaluates provisions based on cost-benefit analysis, leading to some provisions expiring as scheduled. The American Taxpayer Relief Act did not include several previously extended provisions. The Tax Increase Prevention Act extended most expiring provisions in 2014. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made permanent extensions and extended others for five or two years. Tax policy can address temporary needs like economic stimulus or disaster relief through measures like bonus depreciation or enhanced casualty loss deductions. Relief policies, such as enhanced casualty loss deductions and net operating loss carrybacks, are temporary provisions enacted to address special economic circumstances. These provisions, like forgiven mortgage debt exclusion and payroll tax cuts during the housing crisis, may expire once the situation is resolved. Temporary tax policies may be enacted for budgetary reasons, as short-term extensions are easier to offset than long-term ones. The Congressional Budget Office assumes this approach for revenue-reducing legislation. The Congressional Budget Office assumes that temporary tax cuts expire as scheduled in the current law baseline. This could lead to an overestimation of projected revenues if these temporary provisions are routinely extended. Temporary tax benefits influence economic behavior and resource allocation, but their impact on efficiency, equity, and simplicity can be evaluated. Extenders can impact economic efficiency, equity, and simplicity. They may provide subsidies to encourage certain activities. Market failures may justify tax distortions for improved economic welfare. Tax extenders reduce efficiency if not addressing specific issues. Tax extenders can impact economic efficiency and fairness in taxation. They may stimulate desired activities better than direct subsidies but can lead to differential tax treatment for individuals or businesses. This can deviate from the principles of horizontal equity, where people in equal positions should be treated equally. Vertical equity in taxation requires fair distribution of tax burdens among people. Vertical equity in taxation ensures fair distribution of tax burdens among individuals based on their ability to pay. Tax extenders can be seen as inequitable if they primarily benefit those with higher incomes, reducing the progressivity of the tax system. For example, two students claiming a deduction for education expenses may face different tax implications based on their income levels. Tax extenders can impact vertical equity in taxation by benefiting higher-income individuals more than lower-income individuals. This can lead to a less progressive tax system. The complexity of extenders also adds to the cost of administering the tax system and increases the burden on individual taxpayers. Individual taxpayers spend more time on tax preparation and may hire paid preparers due to complex incentives. Thirty-four temporary tax provisions expired in 2016, primarily affecting individuals, businesses, or energy. Four individual tax provisions expired, including deductions for higher education expenses and mortgage insurance premiums. The provision allowing homeowners to deduct mortgage insurance premiums and qualified canceled mortgage debt income associated with a primary residence were first enacted in 2006 and 2007, respectively. These provisions have been extended as part of tax extenders in recent years. Another individual provision that expired in 2016 allows taxpayers over age 65 to deduct medical expenses in excess of 7.5% of adjusted gross income. The threshold for unreimbursed medical expense deduction was increased from 7.5% to 10% in 2013 for most taxpayers. The PATH Act made three individual provisions permanent, while fourteen business tax provisions expired at the end of 2016. The largest provisions included empowerment zone tax incentives and the credit for railroad track maintenance. The cost of extending expiring business-related provisions is less than in recent tax extenders packages. Several business-related extender provisions, particularly higher-cost ones, were made permanent as part of the PATH Act. Most of these provisions have been in the tax code for close to a decade or longer, with some dating back to the 1990s and mid-2000s. The tax extender legislation includes provisions for activities in Puerto Rico, mine rescue team training credit, expensing for mine-safety equipment, and special expensing rules for film and television production. One business provision expiring in 2016, not extended in past legislation, was enacted in 2015, subjecting corporate qualified timber gains to a 23.8% alternative tax rate for 2016. Twelve business provisions were made permanent under the PATH Act, while five were extended through 2019. Sixteen energy tax provisions expired in 2016. The energy tax provisions that expired at the end of 2016 were extended in the PATH Act, including incentives for biodiesel and renewable diesel, production tax credit for nonwind technologies, and credit for energy efficiency improvements to existing homes. Certain solar property business credit rates and residential energy investment credits were also extended through 2021. The energy tax provisions, including incentives for biodiesel and renewable diesel, production tax credit for nonwind technologies, and credit for energy efficiency improvements, were extended through 2016 in the PATH Act. The Section 48 business and Section 25D residential energy investment credits were also extended through 2021, with reduced rates in 2020 and 2021. The PATH Act extended energy tax provisions through 2016, but did not include permanent extensions. It made many temporary provisions permanent and provided long-term extensions for others through 2019. The PATH Act made several temporary tax provisions permanent, including deductions for teacher classroom expenses, state and local sales taxes, and employer-provided mass transit and parking benefits. Additionally, 12 business tax provisions were made permanent, with 5 extended until the end of 2019. The PATH Act made several temporary tax provisions permanent, including deductions for teacher classroom expenses, state and local sales taxes, and employer-provided mass transit and parking benefits. Additionally, 12 business tax provisions were made permanent, with 5 extended until the end of 2019. The research tax credit, for example, had been extended multiple times before being modified and made permanent in the PATH Act. The exception under Subpart F for active financing income, first enacted in 1997, was also made permanent in the PATH Act. The PATH Act made several temporary tax provisions permanent, including deductions for teacher classroom expenses, state and local sales taxes, and employer-provided mass transit and parking benefits. It also made permanent the research credit, active financing income exception, and increased expensing limits. The costs associated with these provisions were significant, with the research credit alone estimated to cost $113.2 billion over 10 years. Additionally, the Act provided temporary extensions for energy-related provisions that expired in 2016. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 provided long-term extensions for certain tax benefits for wind and solar energy. The PATH Act did not include long-term or permanent extensions for energy-related provisions. Some provisions in the P.L. 114-113 included phaseouts, such as the 50% first-year bonus depreciation which will be reduced to 40% in 2018 and 30% in 2019. The tax credits for wind and solar also had phase downs, with the PTC for wind extended through 2019 but with reduced credit amounts for facilities beginning construction in 2017. The tax credits for solar energy were extended through 2021, with varying percentages based on the year of construction. The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 extended expired tax provisions to the 2014 tax year. The tax extenders package enacted as P.L. 113-295 included most expiring provisions, costing $41.6 billion over 10 years. The 113th Congress passed one-year retroactive extenders legislation, while the American Taxpayer Relief Act extended expired provisions at a cost of $73.6 billion over 10 years. The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) extended several provisions at a cost of $73.6 billion over 10 years. Lawmakers are considering extending expired tax provisions, with cost being a key factor. The extensions in P.L. 114-113 are estimated to reduce federal revenues by $628.8 billion between 2016 and 2025, with nearly one-third attributable to provisions scheduled to expire in 2017. The cost of extending the \"tax extender\" provisions in P.L. 114-113 was estimated at $426.8 billion between 2016 and 2025. 89% of the total cost was associated with permanent extensions, totaling $361.4 billion. Only a small portion, less than 3%, was for the two-year extension of provisions that had expired in 2014 through 2016. The cost of extending tax extender provisions in the PATH Act was estimated at $17.7 billion over 10 years. Making all temporary tax provisions permanent would reduce federal revenues by $158.0 billion over the same period. Making provisions permanent would eliminate the need for periodic reconsideration of extensions. Tax extenders legislation temporarily extends expired or expiring provisions. It has been addressed 17 times with provisions changing over time. Some key legislation includes the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014, and American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. The Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-343) and other tax relief acts have been passed over the years, including the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 and the Small Business and Job Protection Act of 1996."
