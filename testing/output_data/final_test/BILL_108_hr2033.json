SEC. 4. AVOIDING DUPLICATIVE STATE REGULATION. Amends Section 1856(b)(3) of the Social Security Act to supersede any State law or regulation with respect to Medicare+Choice plans, except for State licensing laws or laws relating to plan solvency. Effective upon enactment of this Act. SEC. 5. MEDICARE+CHOICE QUALITY PERFORMANCE PAYMENT INCENTIVE PROGRAM. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a program to provide financial incentive awards to Medicare+Choice organizations offering superior quality health care to enrollees under the plan. Awards will be made in 2005 and 2006 based on the most recent quality data. 75 percent of the allocated amounts will be for National Performance Quality Awards. The program provides financial incentive awards to Medicare+Choice organizations for offering quality healthcare. Awards are based on quality data, with 75% allocated for National Performance Quality Awards and 25% for State Performance Quality Awards. Organizations offering a Medicare+Choice plan cannot receive both a National and State award in the same year. The award amount is determined by the number of beneficiaries enrolled in the plan at the beginning of the award year. The award amount for State Performance Quality Awards is based on the day of the year and a uniform dollar amount set by the Secretary. The use of awards is limited to reducing beneficiary costs, premiums, disease management programs, health care quality programs, and enhancing beneficiary benefits. The comprehensive disease management program aims to enhance beneficiary benefits under the plan by utilizing a stabilization fund. It includes a population identification process, evidence-based practice guidelines, collaborative practice models, and patient self-management education. The Secretary determines components to improve health care outcomes, including process measurement, evaluation, and routine reporting. National Performance Quality Awards are given to Medicare+Choice organizations demonstrating superior quality in health care for enrollees. The Secretary awards State Performance Quality Awards to Medicare+Choice organizations with top-rated plans, based on quality of care provided to enrollees. Awards require a minimum of two organizations offering plans in a state and a high rating for eligibility. The Secretary awards State Performance Quality Awards to Medicare+Choice organizations with top-rated plans, based on quality of care provided to enrollees. Organizations offering plans in a State that rank in the 60th percentile or higher nationally may receive special consideration, especially if they serve rural areas or show significant quality care improvements. The Secretary uses a scoring and ranking system based on 2003 MCO standards and guidelines to determine eligibility for awards. The Secretary will incorporate three HEDIS outcome measures (cholesterol control after acute cardiovascular events, HbA1c control for comprehensive diabetes care, and cholesterol control for comprehensive diabetes care) and audit HEDIS outcomes, process measures, and CAHPS data. $500,000,000 will be transferred from the Medicare Trust Funds for the project in 2005 and 2006. The Institute of Medicine will report on payment incentives and performance under the Medicare+Choice program. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will arrange for a study by the Institute of Medicine on clinical outcomes, performance, and quality of care in the Medicare+Choice program. The study will evaluate public and private sector experiences with performance measures and payment incentives, including the use of incentives for plans and enrollees. The Institute of Medicine will identify options for providing incentives and rewarding performance in the Medicare+Choice program, including updates of performance measurements and varying payments by type of plan. The Institute of Medicine will submit a report to Congress and the Secretary on the study conducted regarding incentives and performance measures in the Medicare+Choice program, including varying payments by plan type."
