    "content": "The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-25) led to sequestration, which required agencies to cut spending by 5.3% in FY2013. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) started furloughing personnel, including air traffic controllers, on April 21, 2013. In response to concerns about flight delays, the Senate passed the Reducing Flight Delays Act of 2013 (RFDA) on April 25, 2013. The Senate passed the Reducing Flight Delays Act of 2013 on April 25, 2013, allowing the Secretary of Transportation to transfer funds to FAA's operations account. The House agreed to the identical H.R. 1765, which was enacted on May 1, 2013. FAA halted furlough actions before the bill was signed, impacting air traffic control operations and staff furloughs. Congressional response included potential impacts on FAA's Airport Improvement Program. The sequester cuts reduced FAA spending for FY2013 by about $636 million below the amount specified in the FY2013 continuing budget resolution. FAA's operations account is the most labor-intensive, with about 71% of outlays going to employee salaries and benefits. The facilities and equipment account is spent largely for facility construction and technology acquisition and maintenance, with only 15% of spending devoted to salaries and benefits. Grants-in-Aid for Airports, also known as the Airport Improvement Program (AIP), has roughly 3% of its total devoted to salaries and benefits. The research, engineering, and development account mainly functions through university research grants and industry contracts, with 23% of its budget going to salaries and benefits. FAA operations face a sequester reduction of roughly $486 million, with the authority to transfer up to $253 million to operations using available funds. The focus of legislative debate on P.L. 113-9 was the reduction or elimination of air traffic controller positions. The effects of P.L. 113-9 on FAA's budget will depend on specific actions taken by the agency. Sequestration did not impact FAA's grants for airport improvements, but other functions faced significant spending cuts. FAA implemented furloughs for employees, including air traffic controllers, due to budget reductions. Employees were required to take 11 furlough days in FY2013. FAA employs around 45,000 people in various roles. FAA implemented rolling furloughs for its 33,000 employees in the Air Traffic Organization to minimize staffing impacts. All air traffic controllers were required to take one unpaid furlough day in each two-week pay period. Measures were taken to mitigate impacts of reduced staffing, including increased aircraft spacing leading to delays. The FAA implemented rolling furloughs for its employees in the Air Traffic Organization to minimize staffing impacts, leading to delays in airports such as New York City, Dallas-Fort Worth, Las Vegas, Chicago, and Tampa. Delays affected about 3%-4% of flights, with acute impacts in congested airspace. Airlines warned of revenue impacts from prolonged furloughs but could benefit from lower fuel prices. Airline advocacy groups sought exemption from tarmac delay rules, and legislation was passed to transfer $253 million to address the issue. In 2013, the FAA suspended employee furloughs and resumed normal staffing levels after transferring $253 million to its operations account. However, there is uncertainty if this will prevent all furloughs in FY2013. The FAA may need to transfer funds from programs other than AIP to avoid reductions in airport entitlements. This could lead to spending reductions in other programs, potentially resulting in employee furloughs. The FAA had previously furloughed employees in 2011, with different impacts compared to the furlough actions in April 2013. The 2011 furloughs were caused by a temporary shutdown of the Airport Improvement Program and a lapse in revenue collection authority for the Airport and Airways Trust Fund. Employees funded under AIP and other accounts were furloughed when FAA authority expired in July 2011. Some employees were ordered to work without pay. About 4,000 FAA employees, roughly 9% of the workforce, were ordered to work without pay as they were deemed essential for air traffic safety. A short-term extension of expenditure authority and revenue collection ended the furloughs, and additional legislation for lost wages was deemed unnecessary. During the FAA's April 2013 implementation of the sequester, federal civil service employees, including air traffic controllers, were granted back pay for furloughed days under existing Department of Transportation authority. The term \"furlough\" refers to placing an employee in temporary non-duty, non-pay status due to lack of work or funds. Shutdown furloughs and administrative furloughs are two types, with the former occurring during a lapse in budget authority. During a lapse in annual appropriations or expiration of an authorizing act, certain employees may be excepted from a shutdown furlough, allowing them to work to ensure safety or property protection. Others not meeting this criterion may be placed on shutdown furlough and instructed not to work. The Antideficiency Act prohibits agencies from accepting voluntary services or employing personnel exceeding authorized limits, except for emergencies involving human life or property protection. Legal opinions from former Attorney General Benjamin R. Civiletti have influenced executive branch activities during shutdowns. The Antideficiency Act and exceptions are interpreted by OMB and OPM for agencies, determining which employees are exempt from shutdown furloughs. Employees involved in safety or property protection may be exempt, but not all. Excepted employees do not receive pay during a shutdown due to lack of budget authority. Historically, both excepted and nonexcepted personnel have been paid for work days during a shutdown period. Sequestration, like the one from the Budget Control Act of 2011, involves automatic spending cuts across various programs and activities. Sequestration involves automatic spending cuts across federal activities, allowing adjustments at the account and PPA levels. Agencies can transfer funds or reprogram them to mitigate reductions, but this may impact other areas. Administrative furloughs are one way agencies cope with budget cuts. Administrative furloughs are a method used by agencies to reduce personnel costs during budget cuts. Agencies have discretion in selecting which employees are subject to furlough based on budget conditions, funding sources, and mission priorities. OMB and OPM provide guidance to agencies on implementing sequestration-related reductions to minimize operational risks and negative impacts on core missions. Budget reductions may impact an agency's core mission, potentially leading to administrative furloughs. The RFDA grants FAA the authority to transfer up to $253 million from other funds to operations, primarily to counteract the effects of sequestration on the air traffic control system. Transfers can be made from the Airport Improvement Program and other FAA programs or accounts. The Airport Improvement Program provides federal grants to 3,355 airports for development and planning. Grant distribution includes entitlement funds based on formulas and discretionary funds distributed by FAA based on project priority and selection criteria. The Airport Improvement Program (AIP) provides federal grants to airports based on project priority and selection criteria. The federal share varies from 75% to 90% depending on the airport size. Entitlement funds are available for three or four years, and unobligated funds become discretionary. AIP spending authority is controlled through a limitation on obligations set in appropriations legislation. The Airport Improvement Program (AIP) provides federal grants to airports based on project priority and selection criteria. Entitlement funds can be obligated over three or four years, with unobligated funds becoming discretionary. The movement of funds from entitlement to discretionary status, known as \"protected entitlement funds,\" allows airports to use them in later years. This process helps in obligating the entire limitation level each year. In recent years, the balance of protected entitlement funds has grown at airports. This growth could be due to various reasons such as funds being saved for larger projects, construction schedule requirements, difficulty in raising local matching shares, and challenges with FAA funding extensions. As a result, some airports have deferred the obligation of their apportionments, leading to a reported carryover balance of approximately $700 million. The balance of protected entitlement funds at airports has reportedly grown to around $700 million. The transfer of these funds to other parts of FAA under RFDA will reduce eventual AIP discretionary outlays. Small airports rely more on AIP funds for improvements than large airports. The act appears to reduce the obligation limitation for FY2013. The act to transfer protected entitlement funds to other parts of FAA will reduce AIP discretionary outlays, potentially leading to reductions in airport improvements unless funding is restored in the future. If transfers authorized by RFDA reduce the available funds below $3.2 billion, airports' entitlements could be reduced for the remainder of FY2013. FAA may need to forgo transferring $100-110 million from AIP to avoid reductions in entitlements, unless Congress provides a different solution."
