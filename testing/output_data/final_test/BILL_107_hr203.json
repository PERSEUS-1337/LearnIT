The Act establishes a Small Business Regulatory Assistance Pilot Program under the Small Business Act to provide confidential assistance and improve access to regulatory compliance programs for small businesses. The definitions in this section clarify terms such as Administrator, Association, participating Small Business Development Center, pilot program, and regulatory compliance assistance. The Administrator will establish a pilot program to provide regulatory compliance assistance to small businesses through Small Business Development Centers, the Association, and Federal compliance partnership programs in various States and territories. The Administrator will establish a pilot program with Small Business Development Centers to provide access to information, training, and counseling for small business owners regarding Federal compliance. The Small Business Development Centers will offer counseling, technical assistance, and referrals to experts for compliance with Federal and State regulations. Each center must submit quarterly reports to the Administrator summarizing regulatory activities. The Small Business Development Centers provide regulatory compliance assistance under the pilot program. Reports must be transmitted electronically and may also include interim reports with relevant data or information. The Administrator of the Small Business Development Centers acts as a repository and clearinghouse for necessary data and information submitted under the pilot program. Disclosure requirements are limited, except in cases ordered by a court in enforcement actions. The Small Business Development Centers act as a repository for data and information submitted under the pilot program. An annual report is transmitted to the President and Committees on Small Business, including a description of assistance types provided, data on small businesses contacting the centers, and the number of businesses assisted. The Small Business Development Centers under the pilot program provide assistance to businesses, conduct outreach activities, and report on conflicting advice given to small businesses regarding compliance with regulations. The Small Business Development Centers under the pilot program must be certified to receive assistance and are tasked with providing recommendations for improving regulations that are burdensome to small businesses. The Administrator may waive certification requirements for Small Business Development Centers participating in the pilot program if they are making a good faith effort to obtain certification. The subsection will take effect on October 1, 2001. The Administrator, in consultation with the Association, will select two states from each group to participate in the program.

Each State program selected for a grant in a fiscal year will be eligible. In a fiscal year, a State program selected for a grant under subsection (f) can receive an amount based on the state's population compared to all states with selected programs.
