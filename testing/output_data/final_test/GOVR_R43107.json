The government has obtained court orders under Section 215 of the USA Patriot Act to acquire metadata from service providers like Verizon. The Director of National Intelligence has confirmed the existence of PRISM, an internal government system used to collect foreign intelligence information from electronic communication service providers. The Director of National Intelligence confirmed that Section 702 of FISA was used as the legal basis for the PRISM data collection program. While targeting procedures aim at non-U.S. persons, minimization procedures restrict dissemination of information about U.S. persons unless necessary for foreign intelligence, crime evidence, or threat assessment. Outrage over the program has led to potential lawsuits challenging its legality. The government's surveillance practices have sparked outrage and led to potential lawsuits challenging their legality. Recent filings have added to existing litigation, with renewed interest following a Supreme Court ruling in Clapper v. Amnesty International regarding standing to challenge FISA amendments. The Clapper plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the 2008 law due to speculative fears of government surveillance. Standing is crucial in federal court cases, determining if a party can pursue legal action. This report delves into the doctrine of standing, focusing on the Clapper decision and its implications for future litigation on government surveillance. The doctrine of standing in federal court cases is derived from Article III of the Constitution, which limits judicial powers to \"cases\" and \"controversies.\" This restricts federal courts to addressing actual or imminent injuries caused by violations of law. Standing is a fundamental requirement for invoking federal court powers, ensuring that cases involve truly adverse parties. The doctrine of standing in federal court cases is crucial for invoking the powers of a federal court. Standing requires the plaintiff to have suffered an injury in fact, a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of, and a likelihood of redress by a favorable decision. Mere allegations of past harm are insufficient for standing when seeking prospective equitable relief. In federal court cases, standing requires a plaintiff to show immediate danger of direct injury for declaratory or injunctive relief. The prudential standing doctrine sets limits on federal jurisdiction, including not raising others' rights, avoiding generalized grievances, and falling within the protected zone of interests. This doctrine is non-jurisdictional and goes beyond the three requirements of Article III standing. The standing doctrine in federal court cases requires a plaintiff to demonstrate immediate danger of direct injury for relief. It is closely related to the prudential standing doctrine, which sets limits on federal jurisdiction to avoid intruding on the powers of the executive and legislative branches. This ensures that legal questions are presented in a concrete factual context by individuals with a serious stake in the matter. The Clapper case was a constitutional challenge to Section 702 of the FISA, allowing eavesdropping for foreign intelligence, with restrictions on targeting U.S. persons. Section 702 of FISA allows for surveillance of individuals reasonably believed to be in the United States, targeting U.S. persons, or acquiring communications where all parties are in the U.S. The Attorney General and Director of National Intelligence must follow approved procedures by the FISC. Litigants challenged this law on First and Fourth Amendment grounds, including attorneys with terrorist-related clients, journalists with overseas sources, and human rights researchers seeking to speak with torture victims. The litigants challenged Section 702 of FISA, claiming future injury from monitoring and already incurred expenses to protect their confidential contacts. They lacked proof of their claims. In August 2009, a federal judge in New York City dismissed a case challenging Section 702 surveillance, ruling that the plaintiffs lacked standing to prove they would be targeted. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed, stating that a plaintiff must show an \"objectively reasonable likelihood\" of injury to challenge a federal law or policy. The Second Circuit ruled that plaintiffs challenging Section 702 of FISA must show an \"objectively reasonable likelihood\" of being overheard due to their professional activities. The Supreme Court, in February 2013, reversed the Second Circuit's decision and rejected the plaintiffs' standing theories. The Court emphasized the need for a rigorous inquiry into standing due to separation of powers concerns. The Supreme Court emphasized the need for a rigorous inquiry into standing due to separation of powers concerns, especially in cases involving actions of the political branches in intelligence gathering and foreign affairs. The Court held that future injury for constitutional standing must be \"certainly impending\" or \"imminent,\" not just possible, and found the plaintiffs' claims of being targeted by surveillance under Section 702 too speculative to establish standing. The Court found that the plaintiffs' claims of potential future injury from surveillance under Section 702 were too speculative to establish standing. The litigants' theory relied on a series of assumptions that all had to occur for them to have a traceable injury under the law. The Court found that the Clapper litigants' standing theory was based on speculative events that may never occur, making it difficult for them to establish standing. The government's burden to prove standing was rejected, as disclosing surveillance details could compromise national security. The Court rejected the plaintiffs' argument that they had already been injured by incurring expenses to avoid surveillance, stating that they could not \"manufacture standing\" by spending money based on hypothetical future harm. Justice Breyer filed a dissenting opinion. The dissenting opinion disagreed with the majority on the standard for evaluating standing based on future injury, arguing for a \"reasonable probability\" standard instead of \"certainly impending.\" They believed the challengers would have met this standard due to the government's motive and capacity for interception. Recent news stories have raised questions about government surveillance activities following the Supreme Court's ruling in Clapper. The ACLU's lawsuit against the government challenges the use of the Patriot Act to collect telephone metadata from Verizon customers. The ability for plaintiffs to establish standing may have been strengthened by these revelations. The ACLU lawsuit alleges that plaintiffs, including the ACLU and EPIC, are Verizon customers whose records are covered by a court order to provide telephony metadata to the government. Other legal challenges, including one by Larry Klayman, also make similar allegations regarding surveillance threats to confidential work. The new lawsuits by ACLU and EPIC challenge government surveillance that threatens confidential work, proving court approval and specific authority to acquire data. Unlike the Clapper case, these lawsuits address concrete past and future injuries, distinguishing them from previous litigation. The ACLU and EPIC lawsuits challenge government surveillance, focusing on potential future interception of communications. While plaintiffs like the ACLU and EPIC face a shared injury with other Verizon customers, this does not invalidate their claims. Recent press revelations may strengthen their standing arguments, but proving Article III standing remains challenging, similar to the Clapper case. Demonstrating the use of Verizon in communications and Verizon's data being subject to a FISC order may still rely on assumptions that troubled the Clapper court. The newly filed cases challenging government surveillance make assumptions about the government's targeting practices without actual knowledge. The ACLU's complaint speculates that information provided to the government could be used to identify individuals seeking legal assistance, but this does not establish standing as an injury must be \"certainly impending.\" The potential injury from government surveillance must be \"certainly impending\" to establish Article III standing. Simply fearing future detrimental actions based on surveillance is not enough for standing. The existence of a surveillance program causing a chilling effect may not be sufficient for standing, as a plaintiff must show a real and immediate injury. The injury from government surveillance must be \"real and immediate\" to establish constitutional standing. Claims of potential erosion of confidentiality may not be concrete enough for standing. In cases of abstract and shared grievances, the political process may be more appropriate for remedy. Plaintiffs must prove standing with specific facts, as attempts to obtain evidence may face obstacles like state secrets. Litigants challenging government surveillance programs may face obstacles in proving standing, as requests for evidence may be hindered by the state secrets doctrine. The Clapper court's rigorous stance on standing in cases involving intelligence gathering and foreign affairs suggests that establishing standing will remain difficult for such litigants. Litigants challenging government surveillance programs may struggle to prove standing due to obstacles posed by the state secrets doctrine. Recent news and government disclosures may not provide enough evidence for federal courts to assess the legality of certain surveillance efforts."
