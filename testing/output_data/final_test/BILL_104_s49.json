    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Alaska Wetlands Conservation Credit Procedures Act of 1994\". The Congress finds that Alaska had approximately 170.2 million acres of wetlands in the 1780s, with only a slight loss since then. In the contiguous United States, over 53% of wetlands have been lost since Colonial times. Alaska has more wetlands than any other state, with 88% of them publicly owned. Approximately 98% of Alaskan communities, including 200 remote villages, are located in or near wetlands. Alaska holds 62% of federally designated wilderness lands, 70% of Federal park lands, and 90% of Federal refuge lands, protecting around 60 million acres of wetlands. Over 60 million acres of wetlands are safeguarded by land designations, while 104 million acres were granted to Alaska for economic development at statehood. Approximately 43 million acres of land were granted to Native Alaskans for their use, with a significant portion categorized as wetlands. The development of basic community infrastructure in Alaska is often delayed by wetlands regulations, despite minimal environmental benefit. The 1899 Rivers and Harbors Act regulated dredge spoils in navigable waters, while the 1972 Clean Water Act laid the foundation for broader environmental protection measures. The 1972 Clean Water Act expanded Federal jurisdiction over wetlands by redefining \"navigable waters\" to include all \"waters of the United States.\" In 1975, a court ordered the Corps to revise regulations for the section 404 program, which now includes dredged and fill material discharge into wetlands. Regulatory actions further expanded the program to include isolated wetlands, leading to property rights issues in Alaska. Expansion of the wetlands regulatory program in Alaska has placed economic burdens on property owners, small businesses, and governments, hindering community growth and resource development. The wetlands regulatory program in Alaska is causing frustration for governments, Native organizations, and landowners due to constraints on community infrastructure development. Federal policies aim to prevent further wetlands loss, but Alaska has only experienced minimal wetlands loss compared to the south 48 states. Landowners in Alaska have seen significant property devaluations and communities have suffered from diminished tax bases as a result of wetlands regulations. AMENDMENT TO THE FEDERAL WATER POLLUTION CONTROL ACT. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include new paragraphs emphasizing the national policy to achieve a balance between wetlands conservation and economic interests, eliminate regulatory taking of private property, and encourage localized wetlands planning without mandating it. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to emphasize the national policy of achieving a balance between wetlands conservation and economic interests, encouraging localized wetlands planning without mandating it, and prohibiting compensatory mitigation on wetlands outside a state to offset impacts inside that state. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to emphasize achieving a balance between wetlands conservation and economic interests, encouraging localized wetlands planning, and prohibiting compensatory mitigation on wetlands outside a state to offset impacts inside that state. Guidelines for States with substantial conserved wetlands areas may include minimization of adverse impacts and avoidance of impacts if upland alternative sites are not available. The Secretary shall issue general permits at the request of such States. The Secretary will issue general permits for States with substantial conserved wetlands areas, with regulatory standards for discharge of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, including wetlands. Additionally, new subparagraphs are added for airport safety associated with wetlands conservation in States with conserved wetlands and when deemed advisable for public safety by the Secretary of Transportation. The Secretary deems it advisable for public safety reasons to allow construction of various facilities such as log transfer facilities, tailings impoundments, ice pads, and ice roads. New subsections are added for definitions, including \"conserved wetlands\" as wetlands located in specific areas. The curr_chunk defines 'conserved wetlands' as wetlands in federal and state conservation systems, 'economic base lands' as lands owned by Alaska Native entities, and 'State with substantial conserved wetlands areas'. The curr_chunk defines 'State with substantial conserved wetlands areas' as a state that has either a certain ratio of wetlands to converted land or has enough conserved wetlands to meet conservation standards. The Secretary issues permits for states with substantial conserved wetlands. For economic base lands, additional requirements include balancing Act standards with economic activity needs, considering Alaska Native lands, and accounting for regional differences. The Secretary issues general permits for critical infrastructure in rural Alaska villages without requiring a determination of minimal adverse environmental effects. The Secretary must consult with and assist Alaska Natives and the State of Alaska on policies and regulations under this section."
