    "content": "For over a decade, policymakers have discussed shifting freight from roads to rivers and coastal waterways to ease highway congestion. While waterways carry bulk commodities, they are rarely used for containerized cargo within the lower 48 states. Despite highways and railroads being congested, rivers and coastal waterways remain underutilized. Congress passed the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to promote marine transportation by identifying potential waterways for use. Maritime Administration (MARAD) identified potential waterways for \"short sea\" shipping routes. Congress authorized federal grants covering up to 80% of project costs for financially viable routes. MARAD implemented the program in 2010 due to limitations in road and rail infrastructure, particularly in urban areas. The term \"marine highways\" is used instead of \"short sea\" shipping. MARAD uses the term \"marine highways\" instead of \"short sea\" shipping to convey the purpose of the program, which is to mitigate landside freight bottlenecks. Projects relating to waterborne shipment of dry and liquid bulk products and oversize cargo are not eligible. Shipments to or from Mexico or Canada, except those across the Great Lakes, do not qualify. Project eligibility requires a demonstration of public benefits and long-term sustainability without future federal operational support. DOT has provided grants to domestic container shipping services under the Marine Highway initiative and the TIGER program. The funding for marine highways comes from the Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant program and the Congestion Mitigation Air Quality Improvement Program (CMAQ). The funding recipients are public entities who must find other funding sources to cover a share of the project's total cost and are encouraged to develop public/private partnerships. This represents a departure from the federal government's traditional role in domestic marine transportation. The lack of vessel operating grants for landside marine terminal infrastructure hinders the use of marine highways. Despite deterrents, specific conditions make barges an attractive option for container shippers in short-distance ferries, upriver inland container-on-barge services, and coastal feeder services. Ferries can be a convenient alternative for freight transportation, especially in congested areas. Examples include the ferry across Lake Michigan and Long Island Sound for trucks to avoid longer overland routes. Truck ferry services offer a seamless transition from land to water without separate cargo handling. Truck ferries provide a seamless transition for freight transportation, demonstrating the success of marine highways. Inland feeder ports located upriver from coastal hub ports, such as Albany, Richmond, Memphis, Sacramento, Stockton, and Lewiston, could serve as potential container staging areas. The marine highway concept aims to divert higher-value containerized cargo, appealing to shippers willing to pay more for faster transport. Railroads carry about 12 million truck trailers and containers annually, making intermodal rail more competitive for longer shipment distances. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey sought alternative methods for moving containerized cargo to and from its hinterland to avoid road congestion. In April 2003, Columbia Coastal Transport started the Albany Express Barge service to move containerized cargo up the Hudson River to the Port of Albany. The service received funding to undercut trucking rates by 10% but operated only once a week with longer transit times. By February 2006, the barge had transported 8,486 containers, mainly carrying bulk commodities upriver and empty containers downriver. The Columbia-Snake River System has a long-established container-on-barge service since 1975, with containers loaded at various points along the river and transferred to oceangoing ships in Portland for export to Asia. Three barge operators compete to provide frequent service, with a travel time of about 51 hours from Lewiston to Portland at a cost 25% less than truck transport. The container-on-barge services are profitable due to being included in tows alongside barges carrying various cargoes. A COB service operated between Memphis and New Orleans from 2004 to 2009, shipping baled cotton, lumber, and glucose. Barge transit took five days compared to truck transit of six hours. However, the service was discontinued due to lack of northbound cargo. Similar attempts to establish COB service between Memphis and Louisville also failed. These experiences highlight important considerations for evaluating marine highways on inland waterways. Considerations for the viability of marine highways on inland waterways include catering to shippers of lower value goods due to the U.S. containerized trade imbalance. Exporters benefit from repositioned empty containers, with 6% of U.S. grain exports to Asia moving in containers in 2009, boosting demand for container-on-barge services. Without the trade imbalance, shipping lower-value goods by container would likely be too expensive, reducing the need for inland COB services. Shippers of lower-value goods prefer container-on-barge services for their export shipments, trading faster transit times for lower rates. Heavy cargoes are often shipped due to weight limits, making container shipment more viable for shippers located near water. Multiple carriers increase overhead costs for each shipment. Container-on-barge services are preferred by shippers of lower-value goods for export shipments, trading faster transit times for lower rates. Access to backhaul traffic is crucial for economic viability, as shown in examples from Albany and Memphis. Shippers may be reluctant to arrange individual legs of a shipment themselves, preferring door-to-door service from a single carrier. Memphis service may struggle to capture northbound import loads due to shippers prioritizing rapid transportation for higher-value manufactured goods. The New Orleans-Memphis container route faces competition from the Houston-Memphis route due to Houston's proximity to the ocean and more frequent containership service. Albany COB service may have lacked southbound container traffic to New York. Shipment density is crucial for the viability of marine highways, requiring sufficient volume to compete with trucking's flexibility. The James River 64 Express barge service at the Port of Richmond, VA aims to expand its service to replace the recently lost transatlantic container line. Companies in Richmond, such as those in tobacco, paper, and quarry stone industries, have shown interest in using the barge service, providing a diverse customer base. The James River barge service in Richmond has attracted interest from various industries like quarry stone. It aims to alleviate congestion in Norfolk by transporting containers. The service carries 100 to 200 containers per week, taking 12 hours by river and 2 hours by truck. $30 million in federal funding is allocated to promote barge connections with the Port of Oakland. The business plan involves transferring cargo between international and domestic containers in Stockton and West Sacramento. The Port of Oakland serves as a crucial gateway for containerized exports to Asia, attracting shippers who opt for cross-docking to reduce costs and utilize larger domestic containers. This process involves trucking international containers to a warehouse for transloading before moving them to their final U.S. destination/origin. This strategy helps negate additional cargo handling operations and makes the inland transport leg more efficient for these shippers. The Port of Oakland is a key gateway for containerized exports to Asia with a balanced flow of import and export containers. It mainly handles temperature-controlled agricultural products like meat, which are transported by truck due to their high service demands. The Tenn-Tom COB project is a new service connecting the Port of Mobile to the Port of Itawamba in Mississippi, catering to industries like furniture manufacturing. The Tenn-Tom COB project aims to connect the Port of Mobile to industries in northeast Mississippi, such as furniture manufacturing. Potential customers include the furniture industry near the Port of Itawamba and Weyerhaeuser, which exports to Europe and Asia. However, one challenge is the more frequent sailings offered by the ports currently used by these customers. New ports on the Mississippi River are targeting all types of cargo, not just containerized cargo. The cross-Gulf COB service between Brownsville, TX, and Port Manatee, FL, received federal funding and carries overweight cargo from Monterrey, Mexico. It offers savings of up to $1,000 per container shipment compared to trucking and has found backhaul cargo. Osprey Lines used to provide weekly service between Houston and Tampa, converting an offshore supply vessel for container carriage. Osprey Lines converted an offshore supply vessel, the Sea Trader, for container carriage to capitalize on poor rail service between Texas and Florida. However, scheduled coastwise service proved unviable due to a lack of westbound cargo. Matson Navigation provided weekly container shuttle service between Los Angeles, Oakland, and Vancouver, Canada, using a containership. Matson replaced a containership in its Hawaii service with a shuttle vessel to save costs. Columbia Coastal Transport offers feeder service between Norfolk and Baltimore for international containerships, carrying almost 2,000 containers per week. This suggests a potential market for marine highways between hub ports and nearby ports that containerships tend to skip. The feeder service between Norfolk and Baltimore for international containerships carries almost 2,000 containers per week. The Panama Canal expansion will allow larger containerships from 2015, potentially creating more opportunities for feeder services along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Marine highway services primarily cater to the domestic portion of international containerized freight shipments. The potential for marine highways to divert truck traffic is limited due to factors such as the inefficiency of carrying truck trailers on barges and the majority of trucks serving routes not suitable for short-sea transport. International shipments make up a small fraction of total truck tonnage, further restricting the impact of marine highways on highway congestion. Technological advancements in the maritime sector, such as fast ferries, could potentially reduce the cost of short-sea shipping. However, the high fuel costs of these vessels may be a deterrent. Shippers prioritize service frequency over vessel speed on short-sea routes, as waiting for scheduled departures can negate any time saved by faster vessels. Funding technological developments could promote marine highways as a viable transportation option. Technological advancements like fast ferries aim to reduce short-sea shipping costs, but high fuel expenses may hinder their effectiveness. Emphasizing roll-on/roll-off (Ro/Ro) vessels, which allow trucks to drive on and off, can expedite loading and unloading. However, Ro/Ro vessels are less space efficient as containers/truck trailers cannot be stacked. Matson's experience on the West Coast highlights the challenge of capital costs for dedicated ships in the U.S. coastal container market. In the U.S. coastal container market, tug-and-barge combinations offer crewing cost savings compared to self-propelled vessels. Reach stackers are commonly used for loading and unloading container barges instead of gantry cranes, reducing cargo handling costs at ports. This is crucial for marine highway development. Handling costs at ports are crucial for marine highway development. Congress is concerned about whether federal investment in marine highways will outweigh the costs. While marine highways may be viable in some cases, they often only capture a small share of container shipments. Questions remain about whether marine highways can divert enough trucks to justify their costs. For example, the Albany Express Barge only diverted 10 trucks a day, compared to the Port of New York and New Jersey's average of 10,000 containers per day. Most marine highway services receiving federal grants carry only a few thousand containers annually. The federal cost of diversion for marine highways carrying a few thousand containers annually is estimated to be several hundred dollars per truck. Federal funding for projects like the Albany Express Barge doubled the nation's freight bill for container movements. Repealing the harbor maintenance tax for domestic container shipments could further promote short-sea shipping. The harbor maintenance tax, enacted in 1986, is a federal port use charge to recover costs incurred by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for operating and maintaining coastal and Great Lakes ports. It is assessed at 0.125% of shipment value on imported waterborne and domestic cargo, but not on waterborne exports. Some claim the administrative burden on shippers is high. The harbor maintenance tax is seen as burdensome for shippers, especially domestic ones, as they have to pay it quarterly. If imported goods are shipped to different U.S. ports, the tax is assessed at both ports, discouraging domestic water shipment of containers. The harbor maintenance tax is burdensome for domestic vessel operators carrying containers of mixed cargo. Bills were introduced in the 111th Congress to exempt containerized domestic shipments from the tax, but only about 10% of what is owed is being collected from domestic shippers. Waterborne shippers pay about 10% of the federal cost of navigation infrastructure. The Jones Act (46 U.S.C. \u00a7 55102) requires American-built, -owned, and -crewed vessels for operations between U.S. ports to support national and economic security. Without it, domestic containers could be shipped on international carriers between U.S. coastal ports. Foreign containerships already sail between U.S. ports, reducing the financial burden on waterway users. The Jones Act prohibits foreign vessels from picking up shipments in one U.S. port and unloading them at another, which hinders domestic shipping in oceangoing vessels. There are 42 active Jones Act-compliant ships for deepwater marine highway service, but most were built before 1984 and are nearing the end of their useful lives. The United States is the only industrialized nation with a domestic build requirement for domestic shipping, unlike other U.S. freight modes. Barges in marine highway services are also subject to Jones Act requirements, with less significant additional costs compared to oceangoing ships."
