    "content": "The recent unrest in the Middle East and North Africa has led to calls for releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to ease soaring oil prices. Some House and Senate members have advocated for this move to prevent price speculation. Despite considerable spare capacity and reserves worldwide, the United States is considering releasing SPR oil due to consumer fears over rising gasoline prices. However, auctioning SPR oil may have limited influence on crude oil prices. The United States has faced significant spikes in crude oil prices since the mid-1970s due to supply disruptions and international conflicts. Elevated petroleum prices impact trade balance and disposable income. The U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was established in response to the 1973 Arab-Israeli War oil embargo. The price of imported crude oil rose significantly from $4/barrel in late 1973 to $12.50/barrel in 1974. Strategic stocks can help lessen the market's reaction to a crisis. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve was established in response to the 1973 Arab-Israeli War oil embargo to mitigate economic impacts of oil shortages. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve was authorized by Congress in response to the Arab oil embargo to prevent economic dislocation. It was designed to calm markets, mitigate price spikes, and provide time for diplomacy in the event of an oil interruption. Initially planned for 500 million barrels, it was later expanded to 1 billion barrels. The George W. Bush Administration had plans to further expand it to 1.5 billion barrels. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was authorized by Congress in response to the Arab oil embargo to prevent economic dislocation. Initially planned for 500 million barrels, it was later expanded to 1 billion barrels. The George W. Bush Administration aimed to expand it to 1.5 billion barrels. The DOE currently manages the program, which comprises five underground storage facilities in Texas and Louisiana. The caverns were hollowed out from salt domes and oil is stored by displacing it with water injection to maintain structural integrity. The storage capacity reached 727 million barrels by 2005, with nearly 700 million barrels in inventory before Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. Some crude was loaned to refiners and some was sold after the storms. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) has been filled to its 727 million barrel capacity through royalty-in-kind acquisition. SPR oil is sold competitively through a notice of sale, with bids reviewed by the Department of Energy. Oil could enter the market roughly two weeks after the sale notice. The SPR could be drawn down initially at a rate of roughly 4.4 million barrels per day for up to 90 days. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) facilities were upgraded in the 1990s to ensure readiness until 2025. The International Energy Agency (IEA) was established after the Arab oil embargo to develop emergency response plans, including maintaining 90 days of net imports in emergency reserves. The United States has more than 100 days' cushion in net imports for emergencies, but only about 20% of privately held stocks would be available. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve could provide roughly 70 days of protection, depending on the economy's recovery pace. This assumes a total cessation of oil supply, which is unlikely, especially for the US with Canada as its main crude oil source. Canada is the main source of crude oil for the US. Two-thirds of IEA stocks are held by the oil industry, while one-third is held by governments. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act authorizes the President to drawdown the Reserve in case of a severe energy supply interruption. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act Amendments of 1990 provided additional drawdown authority for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) after the Exxon Valdez oil spill. This allowed the President to use the SPR without declaring a severe energy supply interruption. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 made these authorities permanent, enabling U.S. participation in emergency-sharing activities of the International Energy Agency. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 granted additional drawdown authority for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in cases of energy supply shortages. This authority allowed for the sale of up to 30 million barrels over 60 days, contingent on the SPR level being above 500 million barrels. This authority was used by the Bush Administration in 2005 and may have been the basis for a swap ordered by President Clinton in 2000. In 2000, President Clinton ordered a plan to replenish the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) by accepting oil royalties from Gulf of Mexico leases \"in kind\" instead of as revenues. This proposal generated debate due to the reduction in the federal budget deficit and drop in oil prices. The plan to replenish the Strategic Petroleum Reserve by accepting oil royalties in kind was announced in 1999. Producers supported the plan due to flaws in the valuation system at the wellhead. President Bush ordered the fill of the SPR to 700 million barrels in 2001, mainly through oil acquired as royalty-in-kind. The plan initially received positive feedback but became controversial later on. The plan to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to its capacity of 727 million barrels using royalty-in-kind oil became controversial as crude prices rose sharply in 2002. Some argued that diverting RIK oil to the SPR was driving up prices, but the Administration disagreed. Legislative attempts to suspend RIK fill began in 2004, leading to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 requiring the Secretary of Energy to develop procedures for filling the SPR taking various factors into account. The DOE issued a final rule on acquiring petroleum for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, considering parameters required by P.L. 109-58. In 2007, the DOE resumed filling the SPR with RIK oil. In 2008, Congress passed P.L. 110-232 as gasoline prices rose, but the DOE decided not to accept bids for additional RIK oil. In FY2007, royalty-in-kind deliveries to the SPR totaled roughly 140 million barrels, costing the Department of the Interior an estimated $4.6 billion. DOE estimated deliveries of 19.1 million barrels of RIK oil in FY2008, with $1.170 billion in forgone revenues. Opponents of RIK fill in the 110th Congress objected to the government-owned strategic stock of petroleum, arguing it should be borne by the private sector. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) has impacted the level of stocks in the private sector. RIK fill resumed in 2009 but expansion of the SPR may not be a high priority. Legislation in 2008 forbade new RIK oil acquisitions for the SPR. Interest in filling the SPR increased after a sharp decline in oil prices. The Bush Administration announced plans to purchase oil for the SPR in 2009. The government resumed filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in 2009 by purchasing oil to replace what was sold after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, returning borrowed oil, and delivering deferred oil. The goal was to reach the SPR's capacity of 727 million barrels by early 2010. The RIK Program was phased out in September 2009. Salazar announced the phasing out of the RIK Program, leading to oil and gas properties reverting to in-value status. This decision would require purchasing oil through the market for an expansion of the SPR. The Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve (NHOR) was established due to a significant increase in home heating oil prices in the winter of 1999-2000. EPCA authorized the Secretary of Energy to establish regional reserves, with Congress specifically funding a regional heating oil reserve in the Northeast in FY2001. The FY2001 Interior Appropriations Act (P.L. 106-291) provided $8 million for the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve (NHOR), which was filled by October 2000. The NHOR aims to provide 10 days of Northeast home heating oil demand, with controversy over its use and potential impact on private sector inventories. The Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve (NHOR) was established to address regional supply shortages. The President could authorize a release if the price differential between crude oil and home heating oil increased by more than 60% over its five-year average. In December 2000, the 60% differential was breached due to a decline in crude prices, not a rise in home heating oil prices. During a general strike in Venezuela in late 2002, the United States faced a loss of 1.5 million barrels of daily crude supply, leading to lower refinery use and reliance on refined product inventories for home heating oil during a cold winter. Despite calls for the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve (NHOR) drawdown, the price of heating oil did not meet the criteria. In the 111th Congress, a bill was introduced to allow drawdown based on price and supply, releasing 20% of the Reserve if the average retail price for home heating oil in the Northeast exceeded $4.00 per gallon. The average retail price for home heating oil in the Northeast exceeded $4.00 per gallon on November 1 of the fiscal year. An additional 20% would be released in four installments if the price exceeded $4.00/gallon from December to March. S. 283 was discussed in a hearing before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Expansion of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to 1 billion barrels was required by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The FY2010 SPR budget included funds for cavern purchase and expansion activities. The Bayou Choctaw site has six storage caverns with a total capacity of 76 million barrels. Cavern 20 needs to be replaced due to its proximity to the salt dome edge. The oil stored in Cavern 20 has been reduced to 3.2 million barrels to limit risk, with the remaining oil temporarily stored in other caverns. DOE is acquiring a 10-million-barrel replacement cavern in the Bayou Choctaw salt dome. The Bayou Choctaw salt dome site has six storage caverns with a total capacity of 76 million barrels. Cavern 20 is being replaced to provide additional oil storage capacity, with plans to empty and abandon it. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 mandated SPR expansion to 1 billion barrels, with a potential site in Richton, MS for an additional 160 million barrels. However, the Obama Administration proposed redirecting funds from expansion to non-expansion operations and maintenance activities in its FY2011 budget request. The Administration reduced funding for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in FY2011 and FY2012. The SPR's projection is to increase to 90 days by 2025. The original intention of the SPR was to create a reserve of crude oil stocks for emergencies. Price was deliberately kept out of the President's SPR drawdown authority to avoid influencing market practices. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was created to provide a crude oil stockpile for emergencies. Debate over releasing SPR oil centered on defining a \"severe energy supply interruption.\" The Reagan Administration's 1982 SPR Drawdown Plan allowed for price-competitive sale of SPR oil, rejecting the idea of using triggers or formulas. This decision aimed to encourage private sector preparedness and investment in contingency inventories. Many analysts and Congress members agreed with the Administration that relying on the marketplace during shortages would have been less disruptive than regulations. Some argued that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) should be used to moderate price effects during shortages. The Reagan Administration changed its policy in 1984 to allow early drawdown of the SPR during disruptions, easing congressional discontent. In 1984, the International Energy Agency agreed to coordinate stock drawdowns globally during emergencies to prevent stock transfers between nations. The debate resurfaced in 1990 after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, with calls to use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to mitigate price increases. During the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990, there was a debate on whether to use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to lower oil prices. The George H. W. Bush Administration decided not to draw down the SPR unless there was a physical shortage. Some argued that a perceived shortage can cause immediate damage, and using the SPR to calm markets would be beneficial. It was realized that in a decontrolled market, shortages are more likely to result in higher prices rather than physical scarcity. During the Persian Gulf War in January 1991, the White House authorized a drawdown of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to secure oil supply. Despite criticism, over 30 million barrels of SPR oil was put out to bid, with 17.3 million barrels sold and delivered. This experience provided valuable insights on how to effectively deploy the SPR in times of crisis. The Persian Gulf War in January 1991 led to the authorization of a drawdown of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to secure oil supply. Legislation enacted by the 101st and 102nd Congress further broadened the drawdown authority of the SPR to prevent shortages and price spikes in the market. The Clinton Administration proposed selling 7 million barrels of SPR oil in FY1996 to finance the program, leading to opposition in Congress. Three sales of SPR oil occurred during that fiscal year. Three sales of SPR oil took place in FY1996 to fund decommissioning, reduce the budget deficit, and offset appropriations. A total of 28.1 million barrels were sold, generating $544.7 million in revenue. The SPR was refilled with RIK oil to replace the sold volume. Hurricanes in 2005 impacted U.S. refinery capacity, altering the correlation between crude and refined oil prices. The assumption that product prices follow crude prices was debated from the 1980s to the early 2000s. In the 1980s to early 2000s, debates arose over whether an SPR drawdown was necessary during crude price spikes. However, in the mid-2000s, disruptions in product supplies due to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita caused a disconnect between crude and product prices. The rise in crude prices in 2008 was driven by factors like increasing international demand and concerns about production capacity. In the mid-2000s, disruptions in product supplies due to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita caused a disconnect between crude and product prices. The rise in crude prices in 2008 was driven by increasing international demand and concerns about production capacity. Market conditions during this time were described as \"tight,\" with little spare production capacity to replace lost crude, leading to spikes in prices. Some argued that the market exaggerated bullish news while ignoring bearish news. Legislation in the 111th Congress proposed establishing a price basis for releasing oil from the SPR, but a release may not always lower prices. Despite calls to release oil during the 2008 price run-up, a review of that period shows that SPR releases may not necessarily reduce petroleum prices. By mid-July 2008, gasoline prices exceeded $4.00/gallon, diesel fuel averaged $4.75/gallon, and crude oil prices briefly surpassed $145/barrel before declining to less than $128/barrel. Oil prices had been rising in recent years even without severe energy supply interruptions. Oil prices surged in July 2008 due to factors like limited oil production capacity, inelastic demand, international tensions, and political unrest in Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya in 2011. Calls were made to release oil from the SPR to stabilize prices. Oil prices surged in early March 2011 due to political unrest, with WTI trading at over $100 per barrel and Brent crude exceeding $115 per barrel. Expectations of unrest spreading and Libyan exports being cut led to higher prices. Saudi Arabia planned to increase exports to offset Libyan losses. Releasing oil from the SPR could potentially impact market expectations and prices. The world is not currently experiencing a shortage of crude oil, but Libyan exports of light, sweet crude oil have fallen, causing European prices to rise more than U.S. prices. Saudi Arabia has expanded production to replace the Libyan shortfall, but their heavier, sour crude oil may not be a perfect substitute. Drawing light, sweet crude oil from the SPR in the U.S. could potentially moderate competing demands and have some effect on price. Drawing light, sweet crude oil from the SPR in the U.S. could potentially moderate competing demands and have some effect on price, especially in the European market. However, the volume of SPR draw required for a specified price reduction is unknown, and it's worth noting that less than half of the SPR's 727 million barrels is light, sweet crude. If political unrest spreads to major oil exporting countries like Kuwait or Saudi Arabia, a significant increase in the world oil price is likely. In such a scenario, additional available oil from reserve stocks may have little effect on futures markets, as price movements in those markets reflect future supply expectations rather than current conditions. Over the last 25 years, the API gravity of imported crude oils has been decreasing, while average sulfur content has been increasing. U.S. refineries have had to invest in processing upgrades to convert lower-priced heavier crude oils to high-value products. Currently, 124 U.S. refineries process crude oil into fuel, down from 158 a decade ago. The number of U.S. refineries has decreased from 158 to 124 over the past decade, but operable refining capacity has increased to over 18 million barrels per day. Most gasoline is refined in the Gulf Coast region, which has 45 refineries processing more than 8 million barrels per day. Legislation for a 10% drawdown of SPR oil failed in the House in 2008. The House passed H.R. 6899, requiring the sale of 70 million barrels of light grade petroleum from the SPR within six months. The bill aimed to replace the sold oil with \"sour\" crude to align with refinery trends. The trend of refineries is shifting towards handling heavier grades of crude oil, with 40% of U.S. refineries refining heavier crude than stored in the SPR. Running lighter crude in units designed for heavy crudes could result in significant penalties in gasoline and diesel production. Refineries processing heavy oil may have to shut down units if they run lighter oils, impacting normal capacity. The types of oil in the SPR may not be compatible with 36 vulnerable refineries, potentially decreasing U.S. refining throughput by 735,000 barrels per day. The effectiveness of the SPR during an oil disruption could decrease by 5% if refineries had to use SPR oil. It is uncertain how a 70 million barrel draw on the SPR would impact prices. Oil companies may not be interested in SPR oil unless they have spare refining capacity or want to build crude oil stocks. Bids on SPR oil must be fair to the U.S. government. The announcement of tapping the SPR may not lower prices, reducing interest from the oil industry in bidding on SPR supply. Prices might decline if more refined product is released into the market. In 2008, it was uncertain how a drawdown from the SPR would affect oil prices due to various factors. A unilateral draw on U.S. stocks would have less impact globally than a coordinated international drawdown like after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. Some argued against the U.S. drawing down its stocks while other nations held theirs. Producing nations could reduce production to offset any SPR oil released into the market. The Omnibus Appropriations Acts of 2009 allocated funds for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve facility development and operations, including $31.5 million for new site expansion activities. The Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve received $9.8 million for operation expenses, and $21.6 million was transferred from the SPR petroleum account for site maintenance activities. The Energy and Water Appropriations Act for 2010 allocated funds for development and operations at the Strategic Petroleum Reserve facility, including $21.6 million for site maintenance activities. Prohibitions were set in place regarding the use of SPR appropriations for activities related to Iran. Additionally, a bill was proposed to establish a National Strategic Gasoline Reserve similar to the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve. Arguments for establishing a refined product reserve include the efficiency of not having to refine SPR crude, the potential offset of price moderation if refineries or pipelines are compromised, and the prevention of overwhelming port facilities. Arguments against it include the possibility of increased gasoline supplies from abroad due to European diesel demand displacing gasoline consumption. The cost of storing refined products is higher than storing crude, with estimates of $3.50/barrel for crude in salt caverns and $15-$18/barrel for above-ground storage. Refined products deteriorate and need to be periodically replaced. Different gasoline blends add complexity to storage, but holding conventional gasoline in a reserve could simplify matters. H.R. 1017, introduced in 2011, proposes selling light grade petroleum from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and replacing it with refined products. H.R. 1017 proposes selling light grade petroleum from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and replacing it with refined products."
