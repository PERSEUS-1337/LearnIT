    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Witness Security and Protection Grant Program Act of 2015\" and establishes the Witness Protection Grant Program. The Witness Security and Protection Grant Program Act of 2015 establishes a program where the Attorney General provides competitive grants to State, tribal, and local governments for programs that protect or assist witnesses in court proceedings involving serious offenses or organized crime. Applicants are evaluated based on their infrastructure. The Attorney General evaluates applicants for the Witness Security and Protection Grant Program based on their lack of infrastructure, witness intimidation prevalence, cases not prosecuted due to intimidation, homicides per capita, serious violent felonies or drug offenses per capita, presence of organized crime, and other criteria deemed appropriate. Technical assistance is provided from allocated funds for program implementation. The Attorney General evaluates grant applicants based on various criteria. Recipients of grants can request technical assistance to establish or maintain witness protection programs. Recipients must submit reports evaluating their programs, and the Attorney General develops best practices based on these reports. The Attorney General develops best practice models for witness protection, including safety, relocation, financial assistance, and other related services. These models are disseminated to State, tribal, and local governments within a year. Congress encourages the use of these best practices by governments. Under this subsection, practice models are developed and disseminated to evaluate, improve, and develop witness protection or assistance programs. The Attorney General determines sensitive information that should only be disclosed within the law enforcement community or poses a threat to national security. The Federal share of program costs funded by grants under this section is limited to 75 percent. In-kind contributions are allowed, subject to certain conditions. The non-Federal share for a grant program may include in-kind contributions, not exceeding 50%. The Attorney General can allocate up to 5% for administrative costs. Geographic distribution is ensured in grant allocation. The Attorney General must ensure equitable distribution of witness protection programs across the US and consider applicants from urban and rural areas. They are required to report to Congress on program implementation and funding, with an authorization of $30,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2016 to 2020."
