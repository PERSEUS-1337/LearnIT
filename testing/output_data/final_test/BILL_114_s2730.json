The 23rd Headquarters Special Troops, known as the \"Ghost Army,\" was a secret unit in WWII that played a crucial role in Allied victories in Europe. Their deceptive tactics saved thousands of lives and had a significant impact on major military campaigns. Soldiers were specially selected from art schools and advertising backgrounds. The Ghost Army, recruited from creative and technical professions, used deceptive tactics in WWII. They landed on D-Day, camouflaged beach installations, and conducted 21 tactical deceptions with inflatable tanks and radio trickery near the front lines. During WWII, the Ghost Army used deceptive tactics like radio trickery to create illusions of American forces and feed false information to Axis spies. They impersonated larger Army units, created counterfeit radio traffic during the Battle of the Bulge, and deployed tactical deceptions in Operation Viersen to draw German units away. The Ghost Army, with 1,100 men, impersonated 40,000 American forces using deception tactics during WWII. They used fabricated radio networks, soundtracks, and inflatable vehicles to draw German units away, allowing the 9th Army to cross the Rhine into Germany. Three soldiers died, and many were injured in the mission, which remained classified for over forty years. The Ghost Army's extraordinary accomplishments deserve recognition. The Ghost Army's innovative tactics in WWII saved lives and helped defeat Nazi Germany, earning them eternal gratitude from the United States.
