    "content": "The \"Reducing Barriers to Veterans' Benefits Act\" acknowledges the prevalence of tinnitus and hearing loss as common service-connected disabilities among veterans, with significant increases in cases over the years. The Act aims to provide a presumption of service-connection for these conditions. The \"Reducing Barriers to Veterans' Benefits Act\" introduces a presumption of service connection for hearing loss and tinnitus related to specific military occupational specialties or combat service. This allows veterans with diagnosed hearing issues to be considered service-connected, even without documented evidence during their service. The Act introduces a presumption of service connection for hearing loss and tinnitus related to specific military occupational specialties or combat service, allowing veterans with diagnosed hearing issues to be considered service-connected without documented evidence. The Act defines the military occupational specialties or equivalents in which individuals are likely to be exposed to a high level of acoustic trauma resulting in permanent hearing loss or tinnitus. If warranted, the Secretary determines the presumption of service connection. The Secretary must issue proposed regulations within 60 days if a presumption of service connection is warranted for a military occupational specialty. If not warranted, the determination must be published in the Federal Register and a report submitted to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs. The beginning of chapter 11 is amended by inserting a new item after section 1118. Section 1119 of title 38, United States Code, establishes a presumption of service connection for hearing loss related to specific military occupational specialties or combat service. This presumption is rebuttable. The effective date for this section applies to claims made 60 days after the Secretary prescribes regulations. Additionally, an audiometric test is required before separation of members of the Armed Forces. Section 1179 of title 10, United States Code, mandates that members of the armed forces must undergo an audiometric test at the 8000 Hz frequency or another test determined by the Secretary of Defense to evaluate their hearing before discharge, separation, or retirement. Section 1179 of title 10, United States Code requires members of the armed forces to undergo an audiometric test before discharge, separation, or retirement. This section will apply to individuals leaving the Armed Forces 60 days after the enactment of this Act."
