    "content": "The estate tax is a tax on assets left by a decedent, with different exemption amounts and rates under current law, the 2012 law, and the Administration's proposal. Congress is expected to act on the federal estate tax soon, which will impact state governments. The proposal allows a deduction for state death taxes, impacting federal estate tax liability. Changes in federal estate tax laws have led to a decline in state estate tax revenue. The interaction between federal and state tax policies has drawn Congress's interest. The recent congressional hearing discussed bipartisan interest in greater tax coordination between federal and state governments. Senator Baucus emphasized the need for tax systems to work together and protect taxpayers from multiple taxes. Senator Hatch highlighted the constitutional implications of federal impact on state and local revenues. The bipartisan recognition of the impact of federal tax law on state taxes does not indicate agreement on the structure of the federal estate tax in 2013. Proposed bills in the 112th Congress suggest different approaches, with potential implications for the number of taxable estates in 2013 compared to previous years. The President's FY2013 budget proposal would tax fewer estates in 2013 compared to 2009. The impact on states will depend on the treatment of state death taxes and whether they \"count\" against federal estate taxes. Factors like exclusion amount and top rate will also be important. This report provides an overview of the federal estate tax. The report provides an overview of federal estate tax trends since 2001 and analyzes three policy options: revert to pre-2001 law, extend the 2012 law, or return to the 2009 law. These options are receiving the most attention and represent current trade-offs under consideration. The federal estate tax may be an issue for Congress in the near term. The federal estate tax could potentially be repealed, leading to the repeal of state estate taxes. Reverting to pre-2001 law in 2013 would result in more estates being subject to tax, with a $1 million exemption amount and a top rate of 55%. The federal estate tax is set to revert to pre-2001 law if no congressional action is taken. The delayed sunset of modifications from the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 gradually increased the estate tax exemption amount to $3.5 million by 2009 and decreased the top rate to 45%. This led to a decline in federal and state estate tax revenues. An example of a $7 million estate in Delaware under 2012 law is provided. In scenario A, $92,640 in state death taxes paid to Delaware are credited dollar-for-dollar toward federal estate tax liability. In scenario B (current law), state death taxes paid to Delaware are allowed as a federal deduction. Under current 2012 law with a deduction for state estate taxes, the estate pays $60,216 more in federal taxes compared to a credit method. The changes implemented by EGTRRA have significantly impacted federal and state tax revenues on transfers at death. Combined federal and state revenue from estate and inheritance taxes has declined, with a 48% drop for state taxes compared to a 27% drop for federal taxes. The changes implemented by EGTRRA significantly impacted federal and state tax revenues on transfers at death. State estate tax revenue dropped by 48% compared to a 27% drop for federal estate tax. Most state estate taxes are linked to federal law, resulting in automatic adjustments to filing thresholds. States had the option to decouple from federal law but most did not due to administrative or political reasons. EGTRRA changed the credit for state death taxes to a deduction in 2005, further affecting state tax revenue. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 reinstated the estate tax retroactively for 2010 and extended it through 2012, setting the top rate at 35% and the exemption at $5 million. This change had a significant impact on state estate tax revenue and structure, leading many states to adjust their death taxes in response to the federal changes. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 reinstated the estate tax with a top rate of 35% and a $5 million exemption. The exemption is currently set at $5.12 million for 2012, with a potential increase in taxable estates in 2013 if the law is extended. The President's FY2013 budget proposes a permanent return to 2009 estate tax parameters, with a 45% top rate and a $3.5 million exclusion amount. This proposal would result in a revenue loss of $312.3 billion over a 10-year period compared to current law. The President's proposal aims to change estate tax parameters, resulting in a revenue loss of $312.3 billion over 10 years. The proposal includes gift taxes and generation-skipping transfer taxes to prevent tax avoidance strategies. Transfer taxes, including generation-skipping transfers to grandchildren, aim to prevent tax avoidance strategies. These taxes are meant to offset any GST tax using the estate tax exemption amount. Capital gains tax on assets transferred at death is also significant, ensuring unrealized gains in estates are taxed to prevent income from escaping taxation. The estate tax aims to capture unrealized gains by replacing capital gains taxes. Assets transferred at death receive a \"stepped-up\" basis, leaving unrealized gains untaxed. Some states impose taxes on transfers at death, with proposals following the step-up in asset value. The estate tax aims to capture unrealized gains by replacing capital gains taxes. Some states impose taxes on transfers at death, with Delaware and Ohio scheduled to repeal their estate taxes in 2013. A recent report identified states with estate, inheritance, and gift taxes, with some states using the federal tax code for estate tax calculations. Three states have independent estate taxes. Three states - Connecticut, Ohio, and Washington - have independent estate taxes with varying exemption amounts and tax rates. State legislative action may be needed to reinstate estate taxes in \"decoupled\" states. Inheritance taxes, levied on heirs rather than the estate, are less common and have differential exemption amounts and tax rates based on the heir's relation to the decedent. The exemption amounts for estate taxes vary among states, ranging from $3,500 to $1 million. Tax policy economists evaluate taxes based on administrative simplicity, equity, economic efficiency, and revenue sufficiency. Consideration of these criteria is important for Congress during discussions on estate tax and tax reform. Administrative simplicity and compliance cost are crucial for revenue collectors and taxpayers, especially for taxes levied by different levels of government on a shared base like estate taxes. Intergovernmental coordination can improve tax administration. Intergovernmental coordination can improve tax administration for estate taxes. Vertical coordination is between federal government and states, while horizontal coordination is among states. Many states have abandoned estate tax or decoupled from federal tax since 2001. Fifteen states retained estate taxes, with twelve states and the District of Columbia still levying estate taxes. Several states, including New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, and Vermont, along with the District of Columbia, have decoupled from the federal estate tax law and continue to levy estate taxes similar to the earlier pick-up tax. Connecticut, Oregon, and Washington have replaced their pick-up taxes with estate taxes not tied to the federal tax. This divergence from past practice of maintaining separate state and federal estate taxes was initially controversial when the federal estate tax was first implemented in 1916. State tax authorities argued that estate taxation should be left to the states to decide. The federal government has imposed temporary levies on asset transfers at death in the past to fund wars or national defense. Various acts such as the Stamp Act of 1797, Revenue Act of 1862, and War Revenue Act of 1898 imposed taxes on estates, with the latter serving as the precursor to the federal estate tax. A revenue sharing arrangement was created between the federal government and states, where state taxes would be credited up to a specified tax rate on the estate. The federal government and states had a revenue sharing arrangement for estate taxes, with states structuring their taxes to match the federal credit. This coordination helped prevent competition among states for lower estate tax rates. Coordination between states and the federal government is crucial for the simplicity of the estate tax system. The estate tax system requires coordination between the federal government and states to prevent tax competition. Taxpayers would need to verify asset location and taxability, leading to complex compliance and administrative challenges. Vertical equity in estate taxes involves a progressive tax burden based on estate value, while horizontal equity compares tax burdens of individuals in similar economic situations. The estate tax system is highly progressive, with the top ten percent of income earners paying most of the tax. State estate taxes are also progressive but less concentrated in top wealth brackets. State estate taxes have lower exemption amounts, leading to more taxable estates. Federal and state taxes together impact vertical equity, with the deduction for state estate taxes making the tax slightly less progressive. The estate tax deduction treatment affects the tax's progressivity, with the pre-2001 law not being more progressive compared to the President's budget proposal. Horizontal equity is achieved when estates of similar size are taxed equally, although defining \"like\" estates is debated. The pre-2001 law had a lower exemption amount and a higher top rate, but overall, it is less progressive than the President's proposal. There is debate on defining \"like\" estates based on total asset value, with concerns about fairness for estates with less liquid assets. Special provisions exist for farms and small businesses to pay estate tax in installments over 10 years, adding complexity but potentially reducing compliance costs. Estate taxes are considered inefficient due to their influence on taxpayers' investment decisions and potential reduction in asset value at death. The estate tax is considered inefficient as it affects investment decisions and reduces asset value at death. Taxpayers spend resources to minimize tax liability, including fees for lawyers and accountants. Different tax rates and exemption levels determine the efficiency loss, with a return to pre-2001 law likely causing the greatest economic efficiency loss. Reinstating the credit for state death taxes instead of the deduction would mitigate economic efficiency loss. A deduction for state estate taxes, as proposed in the 2012 law extension and the Administration's budget based on the 2009 law, increases the tax burden and efficiency loss. State estate taxes can influence retirement residency choices, with states offering lower taxes being more attractive to wealthy retirees seeking to avoid taxes. Moves induced by tax preferences alone generate inefficiencies, but a tax credit for state estate taxes could eliminate the incentive to relocate based on tax effects. Data from the IRS and CB compare federal and state estate tax collections, showing changes from pre-EGTRRA laws to post-EGTRRA laws for each state. In 2001, estates generated significant revenue for both levels of government. In 2001, estate and gift tax collections totaled over $31 billion, with states collecting $7.5 billion and the federal government collecting $23.5 billion. By 2009, total collections declined to $25.3 billion, with the federal government collecting $20.6 billion and states collecting $4.7 billion. Adjusting for inflation, the 2001 data would have yielded $37.5 billion in total revenue, with states collecting $9.1 billion and the federal government collecting $28.5 billion. The decline in collections is attributed to tax policy changes and the 2007-2009 recession. The 2009 federal estate tax filings likely reflect deaths during the recession, with stock holdings, residences, and real estate accounting for 41.8% of taxable estate value. In 2001, these assets represented 51.6% of taxable estate value, mainly due to the drop in stock value from 36.0% in 2001 to 25.4% in 2009. The average estate subject to federal estate taxes was larger in 2009, as smaller estates were eliminated due to increased exemption amounts. In 2009, the average estate size increased, leading to a higher concentration of publicly traded stock in decedent portfolios. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 extended the deduction structure through 2012, with the credit set to return in 2013. Reverting to pre-2001 law would likely increase intergovernmental coordination and reduce compliance costs for medium to larger estates, but capture more estates with the lower exemption amount of $1 million. Reverting to pre-2001 law would capture more estates with a lower exemption amount of $1 million, leading to increased compliance costs for smaller estates. This change would reduce the progressivity of the federal estate tax compared to current laws, making the tax code more generally progressive. Achieving greater equity in taxation often comes at the cost of reduced efficiency, with the perception of equity being subjective. The estate tax impacts the economy broadly as saving and investment become less attractive with higher taxes. Lower estate tax burdens encourage more saving and investment, but reduce revenue. The 2012 law and FY2013 budget proposal with higher exemption amounts and lower rates are preferred. Coordination with states could reduce costs and increase efficiency of state estate taxes. Congress's course of action and the impact on states are uncertain."
