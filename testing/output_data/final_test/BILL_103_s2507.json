    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Stormwater Control Reform Act of 1994\" and pertains to stormwater management. Section 402(p) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include requirements for stormwater discharge permits, expanding to include commercial as well as industrial discharges. The Act is known as the \"Stormwater Control Reform Act of 1994.\" The Stormwater Control Reform Act of 1994 amended Section 402(p) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to include requirements for stormwater discharge permits, covering municipal storm sewer systems serving urbanized areas with populations under 100,000 individuals. A moratorium on permitting for remaining urbanized areas was established until October 1, 2001. The Stormwater Control Reform Act of 1994 amended the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to exempt stormwater discharges from municipal storm sewer systems serving urbanized areas with populations under 100,000 individuals from requiring permits until October 1, 2001. The Administrator must provide advance notice of proposed rulemaking within 2 years of the enactment of this provision. The Administrator will publish an advance notice of proposed rulemaking summarizing information on municipal storm sewer systems and outlining options for regulations. Regulations may be issued specifying permit application requirements for discharges covered by the clause before October 1, 1998. The Administrator must issue regulations for permits on discharges within 7 years of the enactment date. If regulations are not issued by October 1, 1998, discharges will be subject to section 301 requirements. Nonurbanized areas are exempt from permit requirements. The regulations for permits on discharges must be issued within 7 years of the enactment date. Nonurbanized areas are exempt from permit requirements. Stormwater from municipal sewer systems is not required to obtain a permit under this Act, except for specific discharges. The subsection does not modify the Act's requirements for stormwater combined with domestic or industrial wastewater. Industrial discharges now include commercial discharges. The regulations for permits on discharges must be issued within 7 years of the enactment date. Industrial discharges now include commercial discharges and must meet monitoring and reporting requirements for receiving water quality. The regulations for permits on discharges must be issued within 7 years of the enactment date. Industrial discharges now include commercial discharges and must meet monitoring and reporting requirements for receiving water quality. Implementation of management measures includes applying management measures for municipal stormwater discharges to the maximum extent practicable. The Administrator or a State authorized to issue permits must ensure stormwater discharges meet water quality standards. Guidance for specific management measures for municipal stormwater discharges must be established within 2 years. During a 10-year period, numeric effluent limitations are required for municipal stormwater discharges to meet water quality standards. Guidance must define 'maximum extent practicable' and may include performance standards for management measures. During a 10-year period, a permit for municipal storm sewers discharging stormwater does not need to comply with numeric effluent limitations or water quality standards. The Administrator can issue a consolidated permit for storm sewer systems owned by municipalities and stormwater discharges from industrial or commercial sources owned by the same municipality. The Administrator can issue a consolidated permit for municipal storm sewer systems and stormwater discharges from industrial or commercial sources owned by the same municipality. Amendments include changes to paragraph (4) regarding the deadline for submission of permit applications for municipal storm systems. The deadline for filing permit applications for combined storm and sanitary systems is 4 years after enactment. The requirement for a permit for municipal storm sewer systems begins after the expiration of a permit for a discharge in the same urbanized area. The Administrator shall establish permit application requirements for stormwater discharges from commercial and light industrial sources within 8 years of enactment, with exceptions allowed. Exceptions to the permit application requirements for stormwater discharges include sources exempted before 8 years post-enactment, as well as those owned or operated by a specific entity. The Administrator will publish proposed regulations for stormwater discharge requirements within 4 years of enactment and issue final regulations within 6 years. Commercial and light industrial discharges may be exempted by the Administrator. The Administrator may exempt commercial and light industrial stormwater discharges from permit requirements if they have minimal impact on water quality. The Administrator will issue regulations for exempt stormwater discharges, establishing priorities, state management program requirements, and compliance deadlines. Regulations may include performance standards and treatment requirements. The Administrator will establish an initiative to fund research on cost-effective ways to improve water quality nationwide. The Administrator will fund State and local demonstration programs and research to test innovative approaches for addressing hydrologic and hydraulic changes, source controls, water quality management practices, and controls for runoff from municipal storm sewers. The programs will consider episodic stormwater flows, varying pollutants, risks to beneficial uses, and the ability of natural ecosystems to handle stormwater events. The program funds for demonstration and research will be awarded, considering regional and population variations. $100,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 1995 through 2004. Municipalities with permits under this subsection can receive grants for citizen watershed monitoring training to support stormwater management programs."
