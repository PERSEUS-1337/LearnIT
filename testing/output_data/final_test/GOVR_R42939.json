These sanctions were issued between 1990 and 2012 in response to actions by Burma's ruling military junta. The sanctions include differing restrictions, waiver provisions, expiration conditions, and reporting requirements. The United States imposes sanctions on Burma through various laws and executive orders targeting unacceptable behavior related to issues like nuclear proliferation and human trafficking. These sanctions were issued between 1990 and 2012 in response to actions by Burma's ruling military junta. Specific laws include Section 138 of the Customs and Trade Act of 1990, Section 307 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, and Section 570 of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1997. The United States has imposed various sanctions on Burma through laws like the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003 and the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act of 2008. These laws require bans on imports from Burma, asset freezes on officials, visa bans, and financial restrictions. The United States has imposed sanctions on Burma through laws like the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003 and the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act of 2008. Six executive orders have also imposed sanctions on Burma, including bans on new investments, freezing of assets of Burmese officials, and prohibition of financial services to Burma. The United States has imposed sanctions on Burma through laws like the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003 and the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act of 2008. In addition, several executive orders have expanded the sanctions, including visa bans, asset freezing, import prohibitions on jadeite and rubies from Burma, and waivers on financial services for certain Burmese nationals. Various presidential determinations and documents have further refined or altered the scope of the sanctions. President Clinton issued Presidential Proclamation 6925 in 1996, denying entry into the US for individuals hindering Burma's transition to democracy. Secretary of State John Kerry terminated this proclamation in 2013, while other restrictions on Burmese nationals remained. President Bush provided a limited waiver of sanctions in 2009, citing national interest. President Obama waived restrictions on US assistance in 2012. In 2012, Determination No. 2012-15 waived restrictions on U.S. assistance to Burma under the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003, citing national interests. The sanctions on Burma were based on presidential authority from various laws including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the National Emergencies Act. The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) authorizes the President to declare a national emergency. The President can delegate authority to other government officials to carry out responsibilities. President Obama renewed the international emergency with respect to Burma in 2013, continuing the sanctions imposed by previous Executive Orders. The implementation of Burma-specific sanctions is governed by Part 537 of Title 31 of the Code of Federal Regulations. These regulations cover import bans, financial services prohibition, and new investment prohibition in Burma. Current U.S. policy towards Burma aims to balance bilateral engagement with political and economic sanctions to pressure the Union Government to release political prisoners and transition to a democratically elected civilian government. The Obama Administration's strategy towards Burma focuses on supporting the reform process and targeting sanctions towards regressive and corrupt elements. The goal is to pressure the Union Government to release political prisoners and transition to a democratically elected civilian government. The Obama Administration's approach to U.S. policy towards Burma focuses on supporting reform efforts, easing sanctions, and targeting those hindering the country's democratic transition. The Obama Administration has been easing sanctions on Burma since 2011 to support political and economic reforms. Secretary Clinton announced plans to ease certain sanctions during her trip to Burma in late 2011. More relaxations of sanctions were announced following Burma's April 2012 parliamentary by-elections. The Obama Administration has been easing sanctions on Burma since 2011 to support political and economic reforms. Secretary Clinton announced plans to ease certain sanctions during her trip to Burma in late 2011. More relaxations of sanctions were announced to coincide with the visits of President Thein Sein and Aung San Suu Kyi to the United States in September 2012. Subsequent changes in the sanctions regime were made in October and November 2012. Secretary Kerry terminated the visa ban in May 2013. Presidential waivers have been utilized to lift some sanctions, but they can be reimposed at any time. U.S. sanctions on Burma are the result of a general decline in U.S. relations with Burma. Sanctions on Burma were imposed due to the decline in U.S. relations with Burma and its military, the Tatmadaw, after World War II. The tensions were partly due to the Burmese military's disregard for human rights and civil liberties. Burma was used as a base by the U.S. during World War II, leading to cordial relations with its leadership. Burma gained independence in 1948 and became a member of the United Nations. After gaining independence in 1948, Burma became a member of the United Nations and established diplomatic relations with the United States. However, tensions arose between the two nations due to issues such as the presence of displaced Kuomintang soldiers in Burma and instability within Burma's civilian government. Economic assistance from the U.S. to Burma was temporarily halted in 1953 because of these issues. The military government in Burma, established after a 1962 coup, aligned closer with the PRC, leading to strained relations with the United States. Despite this, the U.S. maintained normal policies towards Burma, providing economic assistance and military training programs. The U.S. maintained normal policies towards Burma, providing economic assistance and military training programs until 1988 when sanctions were implemented after the Tatmadaw brutally suppressed the 8888 Uprising. The military crackdown led to the Senate passing S.Res. 464 condemning the killings and supporting a return to democracy in Burma. In response to the brutal suppression of the 8888 Uprising in Burma, the House of Representatives passed H.Res. 529 condemning the killings and calling for a review of assistance programs. The Reagan Administration suspended all U.S. aid to Burma, including counternarcotics programs and arms sales, initiating sanctions. President George H. W. Bush amended the Generalized System of Preferences program, and the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) announced plans for parliamentary elections in 1990. In May 1989, Burma issued new laws for political party registration and upcoming parliamentary elections. The National League for Democracy (NLD), led by Aung San Suu Kyi, won 59.9% of the votes and 382 seats, shocking SLORC. SLORC's party only won 10 seats and refused to allow the Union Assembly to meet, leading to arrests of opposition leaders and brutal suppression of protests. Congress responded with Burmese sanction language. Congress responded to the post-election crackdown in Burma by passing the Customs and Trade Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-382) on August 20, 1990. The law granted the President authority to impose economic sanctions on Burma, including those under the Narcotics Control Trade Act of 1986. President Bush had already suspended Burma's eligibility for the Generalized System of Preferences program and designated Burma as a drug-producing country. The act considered prohibiting all imports from Burma. After the passage of the Customs and Trade Act of 1990, the Bush Administration refused to renew the Bilateral Textile Agreement with Burma. Congress passed the Foreign Relations Authorization Act in 1994, withholding U.S. contributions to international organizations with programs for Burma. The Free Burma Act of 1995 proposed severe sanctions on Burma, leading to the release of Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest. Congress later approved additional sanctions in 1997, including a cessation of non-humanitarian assistance and visa bans for Burmese officials. President Clinton issued various sanctions against Burma, including visa bans for government officials and their families, as well as prohibiting new investments by U.S. persons. Additional bills in Congress sought to impose more sanctions, such as banning textile and apparel imports from Burma. In 2001, bills were introduced to ban textile and apparel imports from Burma, but new sanction legislation was not passed until 2003 after a crackdown on opposition parties. The Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act was passed in 2007 after the \"Saffron Revolution.\" The George W. Bush Administration did not take significant action. The George W. Bush Administration took action on Burma after attacks on the opposition in 2003 and the passage of the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003. Sanctions were imposed through various executive orders. Patterns in U.S. relations with Burma show sanctions were imposed after human rights violations by the military. Congress has also played a proactive role in imposing sanctions. The U.S. has imposed sanctions on Burma targeting government officials and their associates, with Congress being more proactive than the White House. The impact of these sanctions on the political situation in Burma is uncertain. The U.S. has imposed sanctions on Burma targeting government officials, their families, and business associates. These sanctions include freezing assets, import prohibitions, bans on new investments, and restrictions on assistance. Enforcement of some sanctions has been waived, but the legal authority remains in effect for potential future enforcement. The sanctions on Burma include restrictions on visas for certain Burmese nationals under various laws and executive orders. The Obama Administration has waived or eased some sanctions, leading to ambiguities in the situation. Secretary Clinton mentioned facilitating travel to the United States in 2012. The Obama Administration is prepared to facilitate travel to the United States for selected government officials and parliamentarians, allowing visits by reform-minded authorities. Existing sanctions laws authorize the President to waive restrictions on visas for Burmese officials, with the requirement to certify in writing to Congress that the waiver is in the national interest. President Obama released E.O. 13619 on July 11, 2012, \"Blocking Property of Persons Threatening.\" President Obama released E.O. 13619 on July 11, 2012, which prohibits entry into the United States for aliens meeting specific criteria. Secretary of State John Kerry terminated Presidential Proclamation 6925 on May 2, 2013, denying entry to individuals impeding Burma's transition to democracy. The State Department keeps a list of Burmese nationals subject to visa bans but has not made it public, making it unclear how many are affected by E.O. 13619 sanctions. Restrictions on financial services to Burma from the United States are outlined in various executive orders and the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act. The Act also prohibits financial transactions with designated Burmese nationals. President Obama issued E.O. 13651 to address these sanctions. President Obama waived restrictions on financial services in Burma with E.O. 13651, but not for individuals on the Treasury's list. Secretary Clinton announced steps to allow American investment and export of financial services to Burma, including access to credit markets. OFAC issued General License No. 16 in July 2012 for financial services exportation to Burma. The reexportation of financial services to Burma is allowed, except for blocked individuals under specific Executive Orders. E.O. 13310 prohibits financial services export to Burma, with exceptions for pre-existing investments. The President can waive this prohibition under IEEPA, but must report to Congress when doing so. The President must report to Congress when exercising IEEPA authority, detailing the circumstances, reasons for the action, authorities to be used, and countries affected. The freezing of assets of sanctioned Burmese officials is covered in multiple executive orders. The asset freeze on Burmese persons and entities was expanded through multiple executive orders and legislation, including the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act. Import restrictions on Burmese goods are governed by laws like the Customs and Trade Act of 1990 and executive orders, with waivers available to comply with international obligations. Congress extended the general import ban through H.R. 5986 (P.L. 112-163) in 2012. In 2012, Congress extended the general import ban on Burmese goods to July 25, 2013. Sanctions specified in the 2003 BFDA expired on July 26, 2013. Deputy Secretary of State William J. Burns waived import prohibitions on products from Burma, citing national interest. The State Department determined that certain products from Burma could be imported into the United States under General License No. 18 issued by OFAC. However, restrictions still apply to jadeite, rubies, and transactions with individuals blocked by specific executive orders. OFAC removed General License No. 18 after import sanctions were terminated in the 2003 BFDA and E.O. 13651 was issued. The 2003 BFDA and the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act have specific import restrictions, banning products and services from certain companies. The Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act adds Section 3A to the 2003 BFDA, prohibiting the importation of certain products. On July 26, 2013, import bans in Section 3(a)(2) and Section 3A of the BFDA were implemented. On July 26, 2013, import bans in Section 3(a)(2) and Section 3A of the BFDA were implemented. President Obama reinstated the ban on the importation of jadeite or rubies from Burma with E.O. 13651. Deputy Secretary Burns waived import restrictions in Section 3(a) of the BFDA on November 15, 2012. The import bans on goods from entities specified in E.O. 13448, E.O. 13464, or E.O. 13619, as well as 31 C.F.R. \u00a7537.201(a) were in effect, but General License No. 18 was removed after the termination of import sanctions in the 2003 BFDA. The ban on new investments in Burma is governed by Section 570 of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1997, and E.O. 13047. President Obama renewed the national emergency with respect to Burma on May 2, 2013. On April 4, 2012, Secretary Clinton mentioned the Obama Administration's consideration of easing the ban on new investments in Burma, focusing on sectors like agriculture, tourism, and telecommunications for the benefit of the average Burmese. The ban was later waived by the Obama Administration on July 11, 2012, with certain conditions on investment partners. General License No. 17 prohibits U.S. investments with Burma's Ministry of Defense, armed groups, entities majority-owned by the Ministry of Defense or armed groups, and individuals with blocked property. Restrictions on bilateral assistance to Burma are also outlined in specific sections of relevant legislation. The 2003 BFDA prohibits U.S. funding for international organizations with programs in Burma, and requires the U.S. executive director of IFIs to vote against providing assistance to Burma. The 112th Congress passed H.R. 6431 in 2012, allowing the President to waive U.S. opposition to IFI assistance to Burma if it is in the national interest. The 112th Congress passed H.R. 6431 in 2012, allowing the President to waive U.S. opposition to IFI assistance to Burma if it is in the national interest. President Obama delegated this authority to Secretary Clinton, who issued a determination on the matter. The 112th Congress passed H.R. 6431 in 2012, granting Secretary Clinton the authority to support IFI assistance for Burma if it is in the national interest. A memorandum justified this decision, mentioning a World Bank grant for community development in Burma. It is unclear if this approval applies to future assistance or just the specific grant. The Secretary of the Treasury must consult with congressional committees before determining the nature of assistance and national interests served. The Departments of State and Treasury did not clarify their understanding of a previous determination. Sanction laws may prevent the US from contributing funds to a UNDP program in Burma. Section 307 prohibits the use of U.S. funds for programs in Burma, North Korea, Syria, Iran, Cuba, or the Palestine Liberation Organization. The State Department has historically warned the UNDP about funding programs in Burma. An exemption is provided for the International Atomic Energy Agency. The FAA does not grant the President the authority to waive the funding restrictions in Section 307, preventing the United States from financially supporting a \"normal country program\" of the UNDP in Burma without Congress passing legislation. Past laws have included language tying U.S. contributions to UNDP to its programs and activities in Burma. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 does not mention U.S. contributions to UNDP in Burma but instructs against financial support to Burma. Burma is subject to various U.S. sanctions based on different issues. Burma is subject to various U.S. sanctions, including restrictions on receiving foreign assistance due to issues such as child soldiers and human trafficking. Burma was designated as a \"Tier 3\" country in the 2012 Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report, but was elevated to the Tier 2 Watch List in the 2013 TIP report. However, if a country remains on the Tier 2 Watch List for two consecutive years, it is automatically redesignated as a Tier 3 nation and subject to assistance restrictions. President Obama identified Burma as a major drug transit and/or illicit drug producing country in 2013. Despite this designation, assistance to Burma was deemed vital to the national interest of the United States due to the government's commitment to reform and efforts towards poppy eradication. Burma's Mayflower Bank and Asia Wealth Bank were implicated in money laundering and organized crime in 2004. Mayflower Bank and Asia Wealth Bank in Burma were designated as primary money laundering jurisdictions of concern under the USA PATRIOT Act due to the country's lack of money laundering regulations and connections to organized crime, leading to a prohibition on certain U.S. financial institutions from conducting business with Burmese banks. The Department of the Treasury repealed special measures against Myanmar banks effective October 1, 2012. Burma is designated as a \"country of particular concern for religious freedom\" since 1999. The existing arms embargo against Burma continues. The Trade Reform Act of 1974 grants the President authority to withdraw preferential trade treatment under the U.S. generalized system. President has the authority to withdraw preferential trade treatment under the U.S. generalized system of preferences (GSP) program if a country \"has not taken or is not taking steps to afford internationally recognized worker rights to workers in the country.\" President George H. W. Bush suspended Burma's preferential treatment under the GSP program in 1989. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative reviewed Burma's eligibility for the GSP program in 2013. The President also has the authority under the Arms Export Control Act of 1976 to prohibit arms exports to a country in furtherance of world peace and the security and foreign policy of the United States. Since the dissolution of the SPDC in 2011, Burma has seen political reforms and improved communication with the United States. President Thein Sein has issued prisoner amnesties on multiple occasions, resulting in the release of thousands of prisoners. The U.S. arms embargo on Burma remains in effect, prompting a reexamination of U.S. sanctions as a means of achieving policy goals in the country. The Union Parliament has enacted laws allowing opposition parties to participate in elections and the formation of labor unions. The Obama Administration has fostered closer ties with the Burmese government and eased restrictions on political and economic relations to encourage reforms in Burma. The Obama Administration has eased restrictions on political and economic relations with Burma, but further easing would require new legislation from Congress. Congressional action is needed to maintain the current status in bilateral relations, as certain provisions in the sanctions laws require annual renewal. It is uncertain when the White House may seek Congress's approval to remove or amend remaining sanctions on Burma, where serious human rights violations persist. Serious human rights violations persist in Burma, with over 180 political prisoners still detained. Ethnic-based political parties face registration refusal, labor unions struggle to register, and union organizers face harassment. Despite instructions to halt attacks on militias, the Tatmadaw continues assaults on civilians in conflict areas. The 112th Congress has maintained sanctions on Burma, passing legislation to extend import restrictions through July 2012. The 112th Congress extended import restrictions on Burma through July 2012, reaffirming existing sanctions and restrictions on military assistance and financial support. The 112th Congress allowed the Obama Administration to lead in easing sanctions on Burma. Congressional committees held hearings and delegations visited Burma to assess political reforms and discuss U.S. policy. During the 112th Congress, the Obama Administration consulted with key Members of Congress on Burma policy options. Members released statements on Burma, some supporting sanctions removal while others disapproved of \"pragmatic engagement.\" The 113th Congress may be asked to waive or extend sanctions waivers, or take legislative action to remove sanctions. It will also play a role in appropriating funds for assistance programs in Burma, including for the newly established USAID mission. The 113th Congress will consider funding for assistance programs in Burma, including the newly established USAID mission. There are concerns about the enforcement of existing laws and discussions on closer military relations with Burma. The 112th Congress held hearings on U.S. policy towards Burma. The 113th Congress did not renew the import ban on Burma, effectively terminating the sanctions. The Obama Administration waived the ban but reinstated trade restrictions through E.O. 13651. The Obama Administration reinstated trade restrictions on Burma through E.O. 13651 after the 113th Congress did not renew the import ban, effectively terminating the sanctions. The State Department supported extending the general import ban, but it is uncertain if the Obama Administration would support a renewal resolution. The complexity of removing existing sanctions is due to overlapping laws governing the current sanction regime, and repealing Burma-specific sanction laws may not eliminate certain restrictions. Congress would need to consider the importance of the sanctions in place. Congress may consider various approaches to remove sanctions on Burma, such as passing legislation to supersede existing laws or amending/repealing relevant sections. Special attention is needed to avoid unintended consequences and ensure all provisions are included. Another option is to provide the President with the authority to remove sanctions, subject to certain conditions. The balance of the sanction's importance and message to the Burmese government and people will heavily depend on future events in Burma. The Obama Administration has eased sanctions on Burma, with the President having the authority to revoke sanctions under certain conditions. Congress appropriates around $38 million per year for assistance programs in Burma, mainly through the State Department's Economic Support Fund. The President's proposed budget for FY2013 maintains this funding level. The President's proposed budget for FY2013 maintains funding for assistance programs in Burma at around $38 million per year. However, there is a shift of about $6 million from humanitarian assistance to health programs, and reductions of about $1 million each for civil society and education projects. The 113th Congress has restricted funding to Burma for FY2013, prohibiting the use of certain types of assistance unless permitted under specific legislation. Congress has the power to allocate funds for projects in Burma and set assistance priorities. Presidential waivers have changed the scope of sanctions, lifting global restrictions but keeping sanctions on specific individuals or entities. This selective process has made enforcing sanction laws more complex, especially regarding visa bans, asset freezes, and financial service restrictions. The Department of State and the Department of the Treasury may not have fully complied with sanctions laws regarding Burmese nationals entering the US and asset freezes. Compliance issues include visa waivers and notification to Congress, as well as freezing assets and restricting financial services for certain Burmese entities. The BFDA and the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act outline categories of persons affected by these sanctions. The Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act designates individuals ineligible for financial services by U.S. institutions. The SDN list enforces these laws, but some Burmese nationals meeting criteria are not listed. A review of the SDN list for Burmese sanctions is recommended. 15 names were added to the SDN list for Burma in 2012, while President Thein Sein and Speaker Shwe Mann were removed. The 112th Congress held hearings on U.S. policy in Burma, with President Thein Sein and Speaker Shwe Mann being removed from the SDN list. The 113th Congress may consider examining the enforcement of U.S. sanctions on Burma."
