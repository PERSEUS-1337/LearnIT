    "content": "Designating funds in appropriations legislation for specific projects or locations, known as earmarking, has been a way for Congress to provide funding for water infrastructure systems. The estimated future needs for wastewater treatment and public water systems in the US are significant, with $298 billion for wastewater treatment and $335 billion for public water systems. Federal funding to assist communities in meeting environmental laws is provided through programs in the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act. Congress annually appropriates block amounts for these core assistance programs. Since 1972, Congress has allocated over $100 billion for water infrastructure projects through state revolving funds (SRFs). These funds are used by states to provide loans to local communities for capital projects. In FY1989, Congress started supplementing SRF appropriations with project grants, which do not require repayment and have a federal-local cost sharing ratio of 55%-45%. Since 1989, Congress has awarded $7.4 billion in grants for water infrastructure projects, increasing as a portion of appropriated funds. Appropriators have awarded grants to more projects since FY2000, with more communities receiving assistance but in smaller amounts on average. This report discusses congressional special project designations for EPA water infrastructure programs, which some criticize. In FY2011, special project funds for EPA's water infrastructure and programs were banned, but there are calls to restore them. EPA's history in assisting wastewater treatment and drinking water projects is detailed in two appendixes. Funding for clean water and drinking water programs is included in the appropriations legislation for the Department of the Interior. The State and Tribal Assistance Grants (STAG) account within the EPA funds wastewater treatment and drinking water assistance, along with grants for air and water quality programs. Today, the STAG account includes appropriations for the primary Clean Water Act programs. In the 110th Congress, budget process reform proposals were debated, including changes to House and Senate rules affecting earmarking, leading to Congress banning the practice since FY2011. Earmarks generally involve allocating resources to specifically targeted beneficiaries, and can be proposed by the President or Congress. The focus of this report is funds set aside within the EPA STAG account during years when earmarking occurred to fund individual water infrastructure projects, locations, or organizations. Congress reserved up to 30% of funds in the account for specified communities, starting in FY1989. In FY1989, wastewater treatment and water quality projects began in EPA appropriations. The STAG account saw an increase in funds allocated, from 3% in FY1990 to 31% in FY1994, but decreased to 11% in FY2009 and 12% in FY2010. The number of projects funded also rose from four in FY1989 to 319 in FY2010. While more communities received grants after FY2000, the average grant size decreased significantly over the years. The appropriations bills provide brief descriptions of projects funded through congressionally designated project grants, reducing funds for state revolving loan programs. $7.4 billion of the $67 billion EPA water infrastructure funds since 1989 were directed to specified project grants with a 55%-45% federal-local cost sharing. The Boston Harbor project was a notable recipient of these grants from FY1989 to FY1995. Since FY1989, congressionally designated project grants have been allocated for water and wastewater facilities, with a focus on the U.S.-Mexico Border area. Over $815 million has been earmarked for these projects, with initial grants for wastewater treatment projects expanding to include drinking water projects in subsequent years. Since FY1989, congressionally designated project grants have been allocated for water and wastewater facilities, focusing on the U.S.-Mexico Border area. The number of designations for individual drinking water projects increased, with grants divided equally between wastewater treatment and drinking water projects since FY2005. Over one-third of grants were repeats for projects that had previously received funding. Special purpose grant funding was a point of contention between the House and Senate during appropriations bill conferences, but after FY1999, both chambers reached a consensus. Since FY1989, congressionally designated project grants have been allocated for water and wastewater facilities, focusing on the U.S.-Mexico Border area. The House-Senate conference on the appropriations bill determines the final total number of projects and dollar amounts. The desire to address special needs wastewater problems during the Clean Water Act reauthorization has increased, leading to pressure on House and Senate Members to use the appropriations process. The Clinton, Bush, and Obama Administrations proposed a limited number of grants in the President's annual budget submission but generally opposed the congressional practice of specifying a large number of projects. Since FY1989, congressionally designated project grants have been allocated for water and wastewater facilities, focusing on the U.S.-Mexico Border area. The House-Senate conference determines the final total number of projects and dollar amounts. The Clinton, Bush, and Obama Administrations proposed a limited number of grants in the President's annual budget submission but generally opposed the congressional practice of specifying a large number of projects in the STAG account. Appropriators supported most projects requested by the President, modifying funding amounts and adding additional projects not requested by the Administration. For example, in FY1992, the George H.W. Bush Administration sought $400 million for grants to coastal cities, with Congress agreeing to fund those six projects plus two others. This pattern continued in subsequent years, with Congress funding projects requested by the Administration and adding more projects. In FY2010, the Administration requested grants for two special needs projects; Congress funded both of them, plus 317 others. The four projects designated in FY1989 were projects authorized in the 1987 Water Quality Act (WQA). These projects included Boston for wastewater treatment, San Diego for sewage discharge remediation, Des Moines for a sewage treatment plant, and Oakwood Beach, New York for relocating natural gas facilities. Appropriators continued to designate WQA-authorized projects for the next two years, with some exceptions. From FY1989 to FY1999, Congress appropriated a total of $740 million for the Boston Harbor project, the largest amount received by a single community under EPA appropriations. Other communities like San Diego and New York City also received significant grants for infrastructure projects. San Diego received $235 million over seven years for a WQA-authorized project and $135 million for a wastewater reclamation facility. Los Angeles and Detroit also received substantial grants for unspecified projects. Since FY1992, Detroit has received $352 million in grants for the Rouge River Wet Weather Demonstration Project. Funding for projects along the U.S.-Mexico border has totaled $780 million since FY1996, and projects in Alaska Native and rural villages have been awarded $452 million since FY1995. The average value of water infrastructure designated project grants is $585,508, with individual grants averaging $494,565 excluding specific projects. In FY2007, Congress was unable to enact all appropriations bills before the fiscal year started on October 1, 2006. In October 2006, final action on appropriations for EPA and other domestic agencies was delayed until February 2007. Congress passed a resolution (P.L. 110-5) providing full-year funding through FY2007 without congressional special purpose grants. A moratorium on earmarks was put in place until a reformed process is established for transparency and accountability. Earmarks from 2007 bills may be considered in 2008 under new standards. The FY2007 appropriations bill for EPA included $200 million for 146 special project grants in the House and $210 million for 195 projects in the Senate. However, none of these projects received funding under P.L. 110-5. The moratorium on earmarks did not apply to special project grants requested by the Administration, which received funding for priorities at the same levels as enacted. In FY2007, the appropriations bill for EPA included funding for special project grants, but none of the projects received funding under P.L. 110-5. The moratorium on earmarks did not apply to special project grants requested by the Administration, which received funding for priorities at the same levels as enacted. In FY2011, Congress did not provide special project funding for congressional projects, and only limited action was taken on EPA funding before the start of the new fiscal year. President Obama signed a continuing resolution (CR) on September 30 (P.L. 111-242) due to the lack of FY2011 appropriations bills by October 1. This was followed by multiple short-term CRs until a final resolution was reached on April 14, 2011, providing funding for EPA and other federal agencies through September 30 (P.L. 112-10). The issue of congressional earmarks became controversial during FY2011 appropriations discussions, leading to a ban on earmarks by President Obama and the House, as well as increased oversight measures. The FY2011 appropriations bill (P.L. 112-10) did not include earmarks for water infrastructure projects in the EPA STAG account. However, funds were allocated for Alaska native and rural villages and U.S.-Mexico Border projects as requested by the President. This trend continued in FY2012, FY2013, and FY2014 appropriations acts. State water program managers and infrastructure financing administrators criticize congressional grants to designated communities, arguing it hampers state funds' purpose of nationwide environmental improvements. They prefer equitable fund allocation based on need, not political reasons, to maintain state control over spending priorities. Directed funding delays states' financial independence by reducing seed funding for revolving funds, potentially prolonging reliance on federal support. Special projects receive preferential treatment over other community projects. Designated projects receive favorable treatment with 55% federal grants, bypassing state priority determination and congressional review since FY1992. Congressional intervention may occur when communities fail to secure state funding. Since FY1992, designated projects have received 55% federal grants, bypassing state priority determination and congressional review. Some small and rural communities find state loans too costly, leading them to seek grants to avoid high repayment costs. Grants for \"needy cities\" are based on local economic conditions, with a 45% local cost-share requirement. EPA has flexibility in applying the cost-share based on a community's financial capability, but rarely modifies the general requirement. The CWA Title II grants program ended after FY1990, but special purpose grants continued to fund wastewater treatment construction and new drinking water system projects. Recipients must meet EPA requirements and comply with federal laws to receive and maintain grants. There are administrative costs associated with special purpose grants for water infrastructure projects. While some projects receive large grant awards, the majority receive relatively small amounts, with over 75% of projects receiving $2 million or less in total awards. The trend is towards providing smaller awards for projects. The trend towards smaller awards for water infrastructure projects raises concerns about the cost-benefit ratio and shifts decision-making power from state officials to Members of Congress. This practice also reduces funding for state revolving loan programs, potentially causing delays in infrastructure improvements. The practice of including special project grants in appropriations acts has been criticized for delaying states' financial self-sufficiency in administering capital programs. Despite new rules for transparency, earmarking continued until FY2011 when it was banned for EPA and other federal agencies. The Water Pollution Control Act of 1948 marked the beginning of federal involvement in clean water programs, providing grants and loans for municipal wastewater treatment authorities. Despite calls for relaxing the ban on earmarks, Congress has not made any changes so far. In 1972, the Clean Water Act (CWA) was enacted, strengthening federal clean water laws and establishing national standards for sewage treatment. The grant program for wastewater systems was expanded, with increased federal funding and the federal share raised to 75%. The program was reauthorized in 1977. The Clean Water Act grant program was reauthorized in 1977 and 1981, with a focus on projects with clear environmental benefits. Budgetary pressures in 1981 led to reductions in annual authorizations and federal share, along with limitations on project eligibilities. The 1987 amendments authorized $18 billion over nine years for wastewater treatment plant construction through a combination of grant programs and State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds. The federal Clean Water Act program provides capitalization grants for state-administered loans to build water quality projects. The program was phased in starting in FY1989 and fully replaced the grant program by FY1991, with the goal of giving states more flexibility in funding priorities. Local communities are now responsible for 100% of project costs under the new loan program, compared to 45% under the previous grant program. Congress enacted changes to the Clean Water Act in 2014, increasing loan repayment terms to 30 years and expanding eligible projects. Municipalities have made progress, but water quality reports show wastewater treatment plant discharges still impair water quality. The original authorizations expired in FY1994, prompting pressure to extend federal funding for the State Revolving Fund program. Since 1972, federal funding for wastewater treatment facilities has totaled $91.3 billion through FY2014. In contrast, funding for drinking water projects under the Safe Drinking Water Act only began in 1996. Congress has yet to shift full responsibility to states for funding these projects. The increase in drinking water regulations and the need for treatment technologies has only recently become more prevalent due to the growth of communities and the concentration of contaminants in water sources. This contrasts with the long-standing availability of good quality drinking water at low costs and the historical focus on sewage treatment facilities under the Clean Water Act. The 1996 SDWA Amendments addressed concerns about the growing number of drinking water contaminants and the financial capacity of small community water systems to comply with regulations. The amendments authorized a drinking water state revolving loan fund program to help finance projects and protect public health. The Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) program, modeled after the Clean Water Act SRF, allows EPA to grant funds to states for loans to public water systems. Authorized appropriations were $599 million for FY1994 and $1 billion annually for FY1995 through FY2003, with actual appropriations totaling $18.2 billion through FY2014."
