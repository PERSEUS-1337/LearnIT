    "content": "Section 1 introduces a new section, SEC. 1022, in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 for indexing certain assets to determine gain. For determining gain on the sale of an indexed asset held for over 1 year by an individual, the indexed basis is substituted for the adjusted basis. However, this rule does not apply to recapture gain, which increases the adjusted basis of the asset for calculating other gain on the sale. The term 'recapture gain' refers to gain treated as ordinary income under specific sections, and an 'indexed asset' includes stock in a corporation or tangible property used in a trade or business. The term 'indexed asset' excludes certain types of interests in property, such as creditor's interests, collectibles, options, net lease property, certain preferred stock, and stock in foreign corporations. Stock in a foreign corporation listed on major exchanges or authorized for trading on national market systems is exempt from certain regulations. Indexed basis for assets is determined by multiplying the adjusted basis by the applicable inflation ratio, which is calculated by dividing the CPI for the year before the disposition by the CPI for the year before the taxpayer's holding period began. The applicable inflation ratio for assets is rounded to the nearest one-hundredth and is only considered if greater than 1. When an asset is disposed of, it is treated as occurring on the last day of the calendar year, and the taxpayer's holding period begins in the same year as if the asset was disposed of on that day. For short sales of indexed assets with a holding period over 1 year, the amount realized is adjusted by the applicable inflation ratio. The holding period for the asset begins on the short sale date, and the closing date is considered the date of disposition. The short sale period for substantially identical property begins the day after the sale and ends on the closing date. Regulated Investment Companies and Real Estate Investment Trusts may have adjustments at the entity level for qualified investment entities. The regulations provide an exception for corporate shareholders regarding the determination of dividends and capital gain dividends from qualified investment entities. The regulations provide adjustments to ensure that the benefits of the section are not allowed to corporate shareholders of qualified investment entities, including deemed distributions and adjustments to net capital gains. The regulations provide adjustments to prevent corporate shareholders of qualified investment entities from benefiting, including treating certain income as capital gain dividends for S corporations. This section does not apply for qualification purposes under specific sections and excludes certain taxes imposed at the entity level. The section provides rules for taxing amounts subject to tax under specific sections, excluding certain taxes imposed at the entity level. The section outlines adjustments to interests held in a qualified investment entity based on the fair market value of indexed assets. If the ratio is 90 percent or more, it is considered 100 percent, and if it is 10 percent or less, specific rules apply. The section discusses adjustments to interests in a qualified investment entity based on asset valuation. Real estate investment trusts are not required to value assets more frequently than once every 36 months. Qualified investment entity refers to regulated investment companies under section 851. The section discusses adjustments to interests in partnerships for income determination purposes, particularly in cases involving section 754 elections. Adjustments made at the partnership level are passed through to individual partners. Adjustments to partnership interests under section 743(b)(1) are treated as a sale of partnership assets for the transferor partner and the partnership's holding period begins for the transferee partner. For S corporations, adjustments at the corporate level pass through to shareholders and do not apply to taxes under sections 1374 or 1375. In common trust funds, similar adjustments may apply. In common trust funds, adjustments made at the trust level are passed through to participants for income determination. Dispositions between related persons are exempt if the property is depreciable. Transfers made to increase indexing adjustments may be disallowed by the Secretary. Special rules apply for this section. Special rules apply for the treatment of assets under this section, including separate treatment for substantial improvements, contributions to capital, and other portions of an asset as necessary. The applicable inflation ratio is adjusted for periods when the asset was not an indexed asset. Net lease property is defined as leased property meeting specific criteria. The section defines 'property' as leased property meeting certain criteria, with regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary. The section discusses the indexing of assets acquired after 1991 for determining gain, with amendments applying to property dispositions after the enactment of the Act."
