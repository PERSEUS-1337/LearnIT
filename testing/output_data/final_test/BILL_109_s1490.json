    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Chesapeake Bay Program Reauthorization and Environmental Accountability Act of 2005.\" It includes requirements for environmental accountability and reporting related to the Chesapeake Bay. Section 117 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include environmental accountability measures related to the Chesapeake Bay Program. This includes the completion of a plan for achieving nutrient and sediment reduction goals within 180 days of enactment. The amended Section 117 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act requires the completion of a plan for achieving nutrient and sediment reduction goals related to the Chesapeake Bay Program by 2000. The plan must include a timeline with annual goals and estimated costs, as well as measures for assessing progress in each jurisdictional tributary strategy basin of the Chesapeake Bay. The amended Section 117 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act mandates a plan to achieve nutrient and sediment reduction goals for the Chesapeake Bay Program. This includes annual tributary health report cards to evaluate progress made each year. The amended Section 117 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act requires annual report cards to assess progress in achieving nutrient and sediment reduction goals for each major tributary of the Chesapeake Bay. The baseline for the report card is the tributary cap load allocation agreement dated December 2003. The annual report cards assess progress in achieving nutrient and sediment reduction goals for each jurisdictional tributary strategy basin of the Chesapeake Bay. This includes identifying total nutrient and sediment allocations, reporting on reductions achieved in the previous year, and ranking progress made by each basin. The annual report assesses progress in meeting nutrient and sediment reduction goals for each jurisdictional tributary strategy basin of the Chesapeake Bay, including identifying allocations and sources of pollutants. States are required to take actions based on monitoring data and consider weather conditions. Each year, states around the Chesapeake Bay must submit information on nutrient and sediment levels in tributary basins, including allocations and sources of pollutants. States around the Chesapeake Bay must provide details on pollutant reduction strategies, technologies used, funding sources, and undergo audits for accuracy by the EPA Inspector General. The Administrator will not grant funds to a State if they fail to submit required information. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget must report on the feasibility of combining certain funds into a single fund within 180 days of this subsection's enactment. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget must report annually on the distribution of funds for Chesapeake Bay restoration activities, prioritizing water quality improvement projects. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget must report annually on the distribution of funds for Chesapeake Bay restoration activities, including an interagency crosscut budget and a detailed accounting of all funds received and obligated by Federal and State governments for the Chesapeake Bay Program. The Administrator, with appropriate Federal agencies, submits an annual report to Senate and House committees on nutrient and sediment reduction in the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries, comparing estimated reductions to annual goals. The report also includes estimates of reductions based on budget and implementation plans of Federal and State agencies. The agency must provide estimates of pollutant reductions from their programs over 1-year and 5-year periods, including success/failure analysis and timelines for nutrient and sediment reduction. Additionally, they should estimate actual reductions based on trend data. The agency must provide estimates of pollutant reductions from their programs over 1-year and 5-year periods, including success/failure analysis, timelines for nutrient and sediment reduction, and the technical basis and reliability of each estimate. Authorization of Appropriations: $50,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated annually from 2006 to 2010 for the Federal Water Pollution Control Act."
