This care should meet the health needs of both the mother and child, with appropriate monitoring. SEC. 5 of the Act prohibits health plans from denying coverage to mothers and newborns based on compliance, offering incentives to request less coverage, penalizing providers for following the Act, or incentivizing providers to go against the Act. SEC. 6. NOTICE. Employee health benefit plans must provide notice to participants about coverage required under the Act within 120 days of enactment and in the summary plan description. Health plans must also notify policyholders in writing within 120 days of enactment and as part of any annual enrollment materials. SEC. 7. APPLICABILITY. Requirements or standards imposed on health plans under this Act shall be enforced by the State insurance commissioner or designated officials.

The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall not enforce the requirements of this Act on health plan issuers or health plans, except as provided in section 8(a)(2). States or the Secretary shall not enforce the Act on employee health benefit plans. The Act does not affect section 514 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. It also does not mandate that a mother covered under the Act give birth in a hospital or stay for a fixed period after childbirth. The Act does not mandate enforcement on health plan issuers or health plans, except as provided in section 8(a)(2). States or the Secretary shall not enforce the Act on employee health benefit plans. Each State must ensure that health plans issued by health plan issuers meet the standards of the Act. If a State fails to enforce these standards, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will step in to enforce them. The Act enforces sanctions similar to those in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 for employee health benefit plans.
