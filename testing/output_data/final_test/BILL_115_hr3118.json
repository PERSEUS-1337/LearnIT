Congress finds that individuals with ties to Hizballah have been indicted for drug trafficking and attempting to provide support to the organization in various countries, including Panama. Admiral Kurt Tidd testified to Congress about Iranian involvement in terrorism. Iranian involvement in the Western Hemisphere is a concern, especially with the easing of economic sanctions. In February 2017, the US imposed sanctions on Venezuelan Vice President Tareck El Aissami for drug trafficking linked to Hezbollah. In September 2016, Iranian President Rouhani visited Venezuela and Cuba, while Foreign Minister Zarif visited several other Latin American countries. In February 2016, a Federal prosecutor in Argentina alleged that Special Prosecutor Alberto Nisman's death was a homicide. Nisman had published reports on Iranian activities in the region and filed a complaint against former Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner for downplaying Iranian involvement in a terrorist attack. The U.S. DEA disrupted a Hizballah network as part of \"Project Cassandra\" in the same month. In 2015, Hizballah's External Security Organization Business Affairs Component had business relationships with South American drug cartels. The Department of State's 2015 Country Report on Terrorism stated that Hezbollah is active in the Western Hemisphere, building infrastructure and fundraising in South America through both legal and illegal means. Former Commander General Kelly testified that assessing terrorist financing in Latin America is challenging due to limited intelligence capabilities. In Latin America, Hizballah collaborated with a Brazilian prison gang to obtain weapons and sold C4 explosives stolen in Paraguay. In Peru, a Lebanese Hizballah operative was arrested for possessing explosive materials targeting Israelis and Jews. Hizballah has ties to transnational organized crime, drug trafficking, and money-laundering activities in the Western Hemisphere, including partnerships with criminal groups in Mexico, Colombia, and Brazil. The United States has sanctioned individuals and companies in the Tri-Border Area for their involvement with Hizballah's terror finance networks. Despite US sanctions, some individuals designated as Global Terrorists still access the global financial system. The United States aims to prevent Iran and Hizballah from expanding into the Western Hemisphere by engaging in diplomatic efforts to disrupt their illicit networks. Key definitions are provided in the policy statement. The Act defines key terms such as \"Western Hemisphere,\" \"relevant congressional committees,\" \"Hizballah,\" and \"hostile activities\" in relation to national security threats posed by Iran and Hizballah in the Western Hemisphere.

The strategy to prevent hostile activities by Iran and disrupt Hizballah's networks in the Western Hemisphere includes a review of relevant US sanctions, assessment of the rewards program effectiveness, and review of sanctions on financial institutions in Latin America and the Caribbean.

Amendments to the Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015 for multilateral engagement. \"SEC. 103. DIPLOMATIC INITIATIVES.\" The text chunk discusses the sense of Congress regarding the designation of Hizballah as a terrorist organization by the Gulf Cooperation Council and calls for the United States to provide support to enhance this designation.

The Secretary of State is required to submit reports every 180 days on efforts to combat terrorism financing by Hizballah in the Western Hemisphere. Additionally, there is a clerical amendment to the Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015. The Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015 is amended to include a new item after section 102. SEC. 7 requires the Secretary of State to provide annual briefings to congressional committees on efforts to prevent hostile activities by Iran and disrupt Hizballah's networks in the Western Hemisphere. SEC. 8 pertains to regulatory authority. SEC. 8 grants the President regulatory authority to implement the Act and its amendments within 120 days.
