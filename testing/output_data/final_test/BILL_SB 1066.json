    "title": "SB 1066",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The Legislature finds and declares that the FAST Act provides long-term funding certainty for surface transportation and requires NHTSA to award grants for impaired driving interventions, including 24/7 Sobriety programs. States meeting requirements can receive grants for these programs targeting high-risk offenders with abstinence, compliance testing, and consequences for noncompliance. NHTSA can award grants to states meeting two separate requirements under the FAST Act. California currently enforces a law for DUI offenders to receive a 30-day driving restriction. However, the state does not yet have a 24/7 Sobriety program in place, which would require offenders to abstain from alcohol and undergo regular testing. California aims to establish a statewide 24/7 Sobriety program to qualify for federal grant funding under the FAST Act and NHTSA highway safety programs. This program would require DUI offenders to abstain from alcohol and undergo regular testing. The new section added to the Vehicle Code (23582.5) mandates that certain funds be included in various transportation improvement programs as outlined in the Government Code. Section 23582.5 of the Vehicle Code allows the court to order individuals convicted of DUI offenses to participate in a 24/7 Sobriety program as a condition of probation, parole, sentence, or work permit if deemed appropriate. The court may require a person arrested for DUI to enroll in a 24/7 Sobriety program as a condition of release on bond if deemed appropriate and if the person has prior DUI convictions within 10 years. A person with a suspended or revoked driving privilege can enroll in a 24/7 Sobriety program to obtain a restricted driving privilege if charged with a violation within 10 years of previous DUI convictions. The restricted driving privilege lasts at least one year and may require participation in the 24/7 Sobriety program instead of or alongside an ignition interlock device program. A \"24/7 Sobriety program\" requires participants to abstain from alcohol or controlled substances, undergo frequent testing, and may use alternative monitoring methods in case of hardship. Immediate positive reinforcement and sanctions are preferred, with consideration for hardships like lack of proximity to testing locations. The program must be evidence-based. The 24/7 Sobriety program methodology must be evidence-based, meeting specific criteria. The 24/7 Sobriety program is evaluated through peer-reviewed research, showing positive results attributed to the program itself. It is endorsed by a federal agency and may require participation in other DUI programs. Testing methods should be timely for effective sanctions. The 24/7 Sobriety program requires participants to pay program costs based on their ability to pay. The court can impose a program of up to 180 days if the defendant tests positive for alcohol or drugs. The Office of Traffic Safety must include program details in its highway safety plan. The department will collect participant demographic information statewide. Participant demographic and case history information, testing details, and fees/payment information are collected for the 24/7 Sobriety program."
