    "content": "HybridNet is a neural network that combines WaveNet and LSTM models to improve raw audio waveform generation for speech synthesis. It generates multiple samples per time-step, utilizing LSTM's long-term memory. In text-to-speech evaluation, HybridNet outperforms WaveNet with a 3.83 mean opinion score for naturalness in US English. Recent work on neural TTS has shown significant advancements in speech synthesis, utilizing neural network architectures like LSTM to model long-term dependencies in audio data. These systems have outperformed traditional TTS methods, such as hidden Markov models, and have achieved state-of-the-art results in waveform synthesis. Recent advancements in neural TTS have shown that RNNs can outperform traditional HMM-based synthesizers. However, RNNs are not suitable for high sampling rates due to sequential processing. SampleRNN and WaveNet are proposed as solutions, utilizing hierarchical architectures and convolutional autoregressive models for waveform synthesis. WaveNet is efficiently trained on audio data with dilated convolution to model long-range dependencies, showing good performance in speech synthesis. Despite full parallelism at training, WaveNet poses computational challenges at inference due to its autoregressive nature. The deep layers with very long-range connections could lead to high variance in output sampling distribution, resulting in buzz noises in the audio. HybridNet combines convolutional autoregressive model and RNN for audio synthesis, reducing sample generation frequency of WaveNet. It offers a novel architecture for waveform synthesis and can speed up autoregressive models. When used in Deep Voice 2 BID1, a neural TTS system, HybridNet improves performance. HybridNet, a neural vocoder in Deep Voice 2 BID1, outperforms WaveNet in quality based on MOS evaluation. Increasing model layers from 10 to 40 improves HybridNet's MOS from 2.84 to 3.83, while WaveNet's MOS improves from 2.39 to 3.06. HybridNet reduces inference time by half compared to WaveNet with minimal impact on training time. It offers additional gains when combined with existing techniques. The paper discusses related work, introduces HybridNet, and presents experimental results comparing HybridNet to WaveNet. Section 4 discusses the experimental results of HybridNet compared to WaveNet in terms of validation error and mean opinion score (MOS). Various recent works on TTS systems with neural networks are mentioned, including WaveNet, SampleRNN, Deep Voice 1, Deep Voice 2, Tacotron, Char2Wav, and VoiceLoop. WaveNet and SampleRNN are neural vocoder models for waveform generation, while Deep Voice 1 and Deep Voice 2 use neural networks for all components of the TTS pipeline. Tacotron and Char2Wav utilize sequence-to-sequence architecture for neural TTS systems. Autoregressive models like WaveNet and SampleRNN have shown success in modeling dependencies in raw audio. Our HybridNet model utilizes LSTM to capture long-term dependencies in audio waveforms, improving sample quality and enabling real-time inference. Autoregressive models like WaveNet and SampleRNN generate audio samples sequentially, leading to slower inference times. Various techniques are proposed to speed up autoregressive models, such as caching intermediate results and using assembly kernels. The HybridNet model combines WaveNet with LSTMs to improve sample quality and enable real-time inference for autoregressive models. It offers a marginal speedup compared to other techniques but is versatile and applicable to any autoregressive model. The architecture includes a WaveNet component for generating output distributions and an LSTM component for capturing long-term context and predicting multiple samples at each time-step. HybridNet combines WaveNet and LSTMs to improve sample quality and enable real-time inference for autoregressive models. WaveNet produces output distributions, while LSTMs generate future samples using WaveNet's hidden state and conditioners. This approach reduces inference critical path and allows for high sampling rates in waveform generation. WaveNet models the conditional distribution of waveform samples based on previous samples. It is conditioned on acoustic features and consists of an upsampling network, convolution layers with residual connections, and gated tanh units. The convolution is broken into two matrix multiplications per time-step. All layers have residual connections with a specified number of channels. The hidden state of each layer is concatenated and projected to skip channels. HybridNet combines WaveNet and LSTM to efficiently generate audio samples by using WaveNet to capture audio context and LSTM to generate samples quickly based on that context. LSTMs generate additional samples using WaveNet's hidden state and conditioners, working at a coarser temporal resolution. During inference, WaveNet and LSTMs generate samples interleaved, reducing the total number of samples generated by WaveNet and improving efficiency. HybridNet combines WaveNet and LSTM to efficiently generate audio samples. WaveNet predicts the next sample using conditioners, while LSTM generates samples quickly based on that context. HybridNet concatenates WaveNet hidden state with input embedding to capture short-term and long-term features. Training WaveNet and LSTM separately with ground-truth audios is more effective than joint training. During training, the alignment of ground-truth audio and conditioners is crucial for HybridNet's performance. Shifts in time-steps are necessary for accurate predictions. Mean Opinion Score (MOS) ratings were obtained using the crowdMOS toolkit. The study compares WaveNet and HybridNet models as neural vocoders in the Deep Voice 2 system. Both models are trained with stochastic gradient descent and Adam optimizer. Hyperparameters are optimized for each model, with WaveNet using a learning rate of 1e-3 and HybridNet using 2e-3 with an annealing rate of 0.9886. Training is done on an English speech database with 20 hours of data. HybridNet uses a single-layer LSTM and WaveNet's number of layers is adjusted. The study compares WaveNet and HybridNet models in the Deep Voice 2 system. HybridNet with 2-sample prediction shows the best performance for a given inference time. The evaluation includes naturalness of generated samples, scaling of validation error by changing WaveNet layers, and standard deviation of output distribution. The study compares WaveNet and HybridNet models in the Deep Voice 2 system, evaluating MOS ratings and inference speed. A n-layer HybridNet outperforms a n-layer WaveNet in MOS, with only a slight increase in training time. HybridNet is also 2x faster at inference. Combining a variable-layer WaveNet with an n-step LSTM unit can match the performance of a higher-layer WaveNet at a lower cost in inference time. The study compares WaveNet and HybridNet models in the Deep Voice 2 system, evaluating MOS ratings and inference speed. A n-layer HybridNet outperforms a n-layer WaveNet in terms of validation error, with reduced variance in the output distribution. Increasing the number of layers reduces validation error but also increases inference time. HybridNet consistently outperforms WaveNet in validation error, even with the same inference time. HybridNet reduces output distribution variance, leading to confident waveform generation with fewer noises compared to WaveNet. It combines WaveNet and LSTM for faster autoregressive audio synthesis, outperforming WaveNet in naturalness and validation error while providing 2x-4x speed-up at inference. The technique used in HybridNet can be easily applied. HybridNet improves waveform generation quality compared to WaveNet and can be easily applied to other autoregressive models."
