    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Building Security Act of 2003\". Congress finds that the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, led to unprecedented death and destruction, highlighting the ongoing war on terror and substantial threats to American targets, including skyscrapers and large buildings. With approximately 500 skyscrapers regularly occupied by thousands of people in the US, there is a need for technological improvements in construction to enhance homeland security. To enhance homeland security, the Federal Government must ensure high building and construction standards and provide resources to building owners. The government is responsible for promoting research and development for improved building and fire codes. The National Institute of Standards and Technology has expertise to assist in responding to new challenges. The National Institute of Standards and Technology has a long history of working with the construction industry and influencing national standards. They were also involved in assessing the World Trade Center collapse. Efforts to promote innovation and provide guidance to building stakeholders are crucial for ensuring the widespread adoption of new materials and practices. Accelerating efforts to develop higher building standards is in the national interest to enhance the safety of Americans. As of January 2003, 2,000,000 private security officers nationwide are responsible for ensuring building security and responding to various threats and emergencies. Many of these officers are not adequately prepared for natural disasters or terrorism, leading to a high turnover rate in the industry. The private security industry faces challenges such as high turnover rates and lack of proper standards. A recent study shows that many states are failing to set training and screening standards for security officers, leading to inadequate oversight. Without guidelines, the industry struggles to provide necessary security in today's global environment. The Federal Government is urged to review and improve the industry for the protection of the American people. It is in the national interest for the Department of Homeland Security to establish a private security review task. Homeland Security is forming a private security review task force with industry, union, government, and law enforcement leaders to set guidelines and incentives for States, training, and workforce stability. SEC. 3. HOMELAND SECURITY BUILDING AND FIRE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology will establish a research program to improve building and fire codes, standards, and practices in the United States. This includes providing measurements, analysis, findings, and recommendations for higher construction standards. The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology will establish a research program to improve building and fire codes, standards, and practices in the United States. This program will involve collaboration with industry, trade associations, and professional societies to conduct scientific research on improved construction methods, progressive collapse mitigation, and building vulnerability reduction tools. The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology will establish a research program to improve building and fire codes, standards, and practices in the United States. This includes developing equipment standards for first responders and exploring ways to reduce the impact of extreme threats on building safety. Additionally, the Director will work on policy research to ensure full implementation of these standards through tax incentives, grants to states, and other means. The Director will oversee a dissemination and technical assistance program (DTAP) to implement practices, standards, and codes developed by the Institute. Results and recommendations will be promptly published for public and private sector use. Reports detailing proposed studies and results will be submitted to relevant committees, with annual progress reports required. The Director will provide annual progress reports summarizing the Institute's activities and determinations. Authorization of appropriations includes $13,000,000 for fiscal year 2004, $9,000,000 for fiscal year 2005, $9,000,000 for fiscal year 2006, and $9,000,000 for fiscal year 2007. SEC. 4. PRIVATE SECURITY INDUSTRY TASK FORCE. The Secretary of Homeland Security will establish a Private Security Industry Task Force to examine and improve training, standards, and oversight in the private security industry. The Task Force will consist of 25 members representing various sectors including private security employers, employees, insurance, and risk consulting industries. The Private Security Industry Task Force will include members from various sectors such as private security employers, risk consulting industry, institutional investors, public safety professionals, building owners, commercial tenants, trainers, police officers, firefighters, and government agencies. The Chair of the Task Force will be appointed by the Secretary of Homeland Security and will oversee all meetings. The Chair of the Private Security Industry Task Force will oversee all meetings and communications. The Task Force may conduct research, develop guidelines for the industry, and help States implement standards efficiently. The Chair of the Private Security Industry Task Force will submit semi-annual reports on the Task Force's activities to specific Senate and House committees. $500,000 is authorized for each of the fiscal years 2004 and 2005 for this purpose."
