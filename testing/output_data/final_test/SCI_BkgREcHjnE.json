    "content": "TuckER is a linear model based on Tucker decomposition for knowledge graph link prediction, outperforming previous models on standard datasets. Knowledge graphs store facts as triples (e s , r, e o ) but only contain a small subset of all possible facts. The need for algorithms to infer missing facts in knowledge graphs is highlighted, with the task of link prediction aiming to determine true facts from false or missing ones. While linear approaches have been common, recent advancements using non-linear convolutional models have shown promising results. However, the challenge with deep, non-linear models lies in their lack of transparency and understanding compared to more established tensor decomposition methods. In this paper, TuckER is introduced as a linear model for link prediction in knowledge graphs, based on Tucker decomposition of the binary tensor of triples. TuckER utilizes multi-task learning between different relations, with entity and relation embeddings stored in matrices and interactions determined by the core tensor. Unlike simpler models, TuckER does not learn parameters for each relation separately. TuckER is a linear model for link prediction in knowledge graphs, achieving state-of-the-art results. It differs from previous models like RESCAL, DistMult, and ComplEx by utilizing multi-task learning and complex embeddings. The TuckER model is a linear approach for link prediction in knowledge graphs, outperforming models like RESCAL, DistMult, and ComplEx. It uses multi-task learning and complex embeddings, with object entity embeddings being complex conjugates to model asymmetric relations. SimplE BID7 is based on Canonical Polyadic (CP) decomposition. Scoring functions and parameters of various models, including TuckER, are detailed in Table 1. The TuckER model is a linear approach for link prediction in knowledge graphs, using tensor factorization for scoring functions to determine the truth of triples in the graph. The model aims to correctly score all missing triples by learning a scoring function that assigns a score indicating the truth of a triple. The TuckER model uses Tucker decomposition for link prediction on a binary tensor representation of a knowledge graph. It decomposes a tensor into matrices and a core tensor, with elements of the core tensor showing the level of interaction between components. The model aims to correctly score missing triples in the graph. The TuckER model utilizes Tucker decomposition for link prediction on a binary tensor representation of a knowledge graph. It defines scoring function and applies logistic sigmoid to predict the probability of a triple being true. The number of parameters in TuckER increases with entity and relation embedding dimensionality. Visualization of the model architecture is provided in FIG1. TuckER model does not encode all knowledge into embeddings like simpler models. It uses multi-task learning and 1-N scoring for training. The model is trained to minimize negative samples and predict the probability of triples being true. TuckER model is trained using Bernoulli negative loglikelihood loss function on standard link prediction datasets like FB15k and WN18. The model is implemented in PyTorch and hyper-parameters are chosen based on validation set performance. The TuckER model is trained on datasets like FB15k and WN18 using specific hyperparameters based on validation set performance. Different combinations of learning rates and decay values are found to give the best results for each dataset. The model is trained using Adam with a batch size of 128. Evaluation is done by generating test triples for each given triple from the test set. In BID1, test triples are generated by varying the object entity and ranking the scores. Evaluation metrics include MRR and hits@k. TuckER outperforms previous models on all datasets in link prediction tasks. TuckER outperforms other models in link prediction tasks on various datasets, including WN18 and WN18RR, with fewer parameters and lower dropout values needed for better results. TuckER improves results on datasets with many relations, utilizing shared parameters for multi-task learning. It requires fewer parameters than ComplEx or SimplE for good results. Comparison with ComplEx and SimplE on FB15k-237 shows TuckER's effectiveness. Link prediction results for WN18RR and FB15k-237 are reported for different models. TuckER has fewer parameters compared to ComplEx and SimplE at certain embedding dimensionalities. The RotatE results are reported without self-adversarial negative sampling for fair comparison. The obtained MRR on the test set for each model is shown in Figure 2. TuckER is a linear model for link prediction in knowledge graphs with state-of-the-art results on standard datasets. It has fewer parameters than ComplEx and SimplE at certain embedding sizes, showing consistent performance across different dimensions. The TuckER model shows superior performance in link prediction for knowledge graphs, with scalability to large graphs. Future work may involve incorporating background knowledge on relation properties into the model."
