    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Leave Ethanol Volumes at Existing Levels Act\" or the \"LEVEL Act.\" It repeals the expansion of the renewable fuel program. The Clean Air Act defines cellulosic biomass ethanol as ethanol derived from renewable sources such as energy crops, wood, plants, grasses, agricultural residues, fibers, animal wastes, and municipal solid waste. The term 'renewable fuel' refers to motor vehicle fuel derived from animal wastes, poultry fats, poultry wastes, and municipal solid waste. Waste-derived ethanol is ethanol produced from animal wastes, poultry fats, poultry wastes, and municipal solid waste. The term 'renewable fuel' includes motor vehicle fuel produced from various organic materials like grains, oils, sugarcane, and natural gas from biogas sources. It is used to replace or reduce fossil fuel usage. The term 'renewable fuel' includes cellulosic biomass ethanol, waste-derived ethanol, biodiesel, and blending components derived from renewable fuel. Only the renewable fuel portion of blending components is considered part of the applicable volume. The term 'small refinery' refers to a refinery with an average daily crude oil throughput not exceeding 75,000 barrels. Amendments are made to the regulations and applicable volumes of renewable fuel under the Clean Air Act. Amendments are made to the regulations and applicable volumes of renewable fuel under the Clean Air Act, including changes to the applicable volume of renewable fuel for each calendar year and adjustments to the applicable percentages for gasoline. Amendments to the Clean Air Act include changes to the definition of cellulosic biomass ethanol, removal of a credit program clause, and modifications to waiver provisions. Amendments to the Clean Air Act involve changes to various sections, including the removal of certain subparagraphs related to cellulosic biofuel and biomass-based diesel, as well as the elimination of periodic reviews and savings clause provisions. Additionally, regulations under the Act are updated by striking a specific paragraph. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended by removing certain provisions related to environmental impacts and effective dates. The changes will take effect on January 1 of the first calendar year following the enactment of the Act. Prior to this date, estimates for the first calendar year will be provided by the Energy Information Administration to the Environmental Protection Agency. The Environmental Protection Agency will estimate the volumes of gasoline projected to be sold in the United States for a calendar year under the Clean Air Act. Based on this estimate, the Administrator will determine and publish the renewable fuel obligation for that year in the Federal Register. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. PROHIBITION OF AUTHORIZATION OF HIGHER ETHANOL BLENDS\" prohibits the authorization of higher ethanol blends. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency is prohibited from permitting the introduction of gasoline with over 10-volume-percent ethanol for general use in conventional vehicles. Existing waivers for higher ethanol blends are repealed. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency is prohibited from allowing gasoline with more than 10-volume-percent ethanol for general use in conventional vehicles. Existing waivers for higher ethanol blends are repealed. The Administrator is prohibited from allowing gasoline with more than 10-volume-percent ethanol for general use in conventional vehicles. Existing waivers for higher ethanol blends are repealed. Exceptions apply to waivers allowing the introduction of gasoline meeting specific criteria. The Administrator is required to conduct a study on the effects of introducing an ethanol-gasoline blend on consumer products, including vehicles and engines, within 2 years of the enactment of the Act. Ethanol-gasoline blends must be registered and lawfully sold in the United States. The study required by the Administrator will assess the impact of an ethanol-gasoline blend on engine performance, emissions, materials compatibility, and consumer safety. It will also evaluate the ability of gasoline distribution infrastructure to handle the blend. The study will assess the impact of an ethanol-gasoline blend on engine performance, emissions, materials compatibility, and consumer safety, as well as the ability of gasoline distribution infrastructure to handle the blend. Storage configurations and retail equipment must be certified for compatibility to prevent misfueling by consumers."
