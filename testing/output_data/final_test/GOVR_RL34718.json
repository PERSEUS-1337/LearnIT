President Bush expressed his support and signed the bill on September 26, 2006. Senator Tom Coburn, the bill's sponsor, noted endorsement from over 150 organizations. The bill S. 2590, endorsed by over 150 organizations with diverse political leanings, had support from various sectors including private enterprise, unions, media groups, and government watchdog organizations. The unusual alliance backing the bill included organizations like PETA, Gun Owners of America, National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, and Traditional Values Coalition. The bill required the implementation of a new website in two phases, with the first phase providing access to information on entities receiving federal funds by January 1, 2008. The bill S. 2590 required the implementation of a new website in two phases, with the first phase covering various entities receiving federal funds by January 1, 2008. The website was mandated to include information on subgrantees and subcontractors by January 1, 2009. The database aims to provide comprehensive information on federal financial assistance, including grants, contracts, subgrants, subcontracts, and loans. Individual transactions under $25,000 are exempt, and organizations with less than $300,000 in total income are not required to report on subawards. The bill S. 2590 mandated the creation of a new website in two phases to provide transparency on federal financial assistance. Individual transactions under $25,000 are exempt, and credit card transactions were excluded until October 1, 2008. The website must include details such as the recipient's name, amount, type of award, funding agency, NAICS code or CFDA number, program source, award title, location, unique identifiers, and other specified information. Users should be able to search federal funding using any of these data elements. The bill S. 2590 mandated the creation of a new website in two phases to provide transparency on federal financial assistance. Users can search federal funding by various data elements and determine the total amount awarded to an entity by fiscal year. The website must provide downloadable information from major financial assistance databases directly, not just through links. The bill S. 2590 mandated the creation of a new website in two phases to provide transparency on federal financial assistance. The act required OMB to implement a pilot program to test the feasibility of having primary recipients provide information on their subgrantees and subcontractors. Recipients and subrecipients could be reimbursed for costs associated with collecting data on subrecipients. Cost-effective requirements for collecting data on subawards by state and local governments were specified. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), no unfunded mandate would be placed on recipients. The bill S. 2590 mandated the creation of a new website for transparency on federal financial assistance. OMB was required to implement a pilot program for primary recipients to provide information on subgrantees and subcontractors. No unfunded mandate would be placed on recipients. The website's database quality depends on the information it contains from existing databases like FAADS, FPDS-NG, and Grants.gov. USAspending.gov uses data from FAADS and FPDS-NG, but it's unclear if Grants.gov data is included. Observers have expressed concerns about the reliability of information from FAADS and FPDS-NG databases due to incomplete and inaccurate data. GAO reported in 2005 that FPDS-NG users lacked confidence in the data accuracy. In 2006, a panel of experts found numerous errors in FPDS-NG data, leading to doubts about its reliability. The chairman declared that \"FPDS-NG is not a reliable database\" due to errors in the data caused by human error and inconsistent data entry by agencies. Users complained about the database failing to identify contracts related to Hurricane Katrina recovery efforts. Similar issues were found in FAADS, the government's grant award information source. In a 2006 report, GAO found that administering agencies provided inaccurate or incomplete data to FAADS, the government's grant award information source. Problems were attributed to lack of resources at the Census Bureau, lack of knowledge of reporting requirements by agency officials, and insufficient oversight. Data elements required by FFATA were not consistently captured, such as information on subrecipients and congressional districts where federal funds are spent. The FFATA requires agencies to update FAADS within 30 days of making an award, but some members of Congress have concerns about the accuracy of data in FPDS-NG and FAADS. OMB issued memoranda to improve data quality after the FFATA was enacted. After the FFATA was enacted, OMB issued memoranda to improve the quality of financial award data reporting. These memoranda required agencies to establish procedures for verifying and validating procurement data submitted to FPDS-NG, identify specific data elements to report, and submit a plan to address any gaps in data on grants, contracts, and loans by a specified deadline. The FFATA required agencies to address gaps in their data on grants, contracts, and loans and implement internal controls for accuracy. OMB criticized the quality of data provided by agencies shortly after the launch of USAspending.gov. Agencies were called on to improve data quality due to incomplete, untimely, and inaccurate submissions. As of January 30, 2009, award information was not being posted within the required 30 days. As of January 30, 2009, no agency met the 30-day standard for posting new award data on USAspending.gov. This lack of timely information could lead to significant gaps in award data. For example, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) had missing assistance data for FY2007 and FY2008, potentially totaling $1.46 trillion. Even when agencies submitted data, it often appeared incomplete. The Social Security Administration (SSA) reported $593.9 billion in assistance outlays for FY2006, but only $38 million for FY2007 and $34 million for FY2008 on USAspending.gov. The Department of Agriculture and the Department of Housing and Urban Development reported significant decreases in assistance outlays from FY2006 to FY2008. Data on billions of dollars in assistance awards are missing on USAspending.gov as mandated by the FFATA. Subaward information was also not available as of January 30, 2009, due to delays in the subaward pilot program. The Director of OMB may extend reporting deadlines for subawards passed through state, local, or tribal governments. The Director of OMB may exempt entities with gross income of $300,000 or less from subaward reporting requirements. Concerns have been raised about the costs of implementing USAspending.gov, including the costs associated with developing information on subawards. The initial implementation cost of USA spending.gov is unknown, including the dollar value of the time federal agency employees spent on collecting, validating, and submitting award information. Prior to enactment, the FFATA was estimated to cost $15 million to establish and maintain a new database of federal assistance between 2007 and 2011. It is unclear if agencies had to modify their internal data collection systems to obtain new information. Implementation costs may vary among agencies, with some potentially needing to invest more resources to meet reporting provisions. Agencies reporting little or no information for FY2007 or FY2008 may be behind in their ability to obtain required assistance award data. The estimated cost of establishing and maintaining a new database of federal assistance under the FFATA was $15 million. Experts noted that significant data cleanup would be needed to correct inaccurate information in existing systems. The National Association of State Auditors expressed concerns about the financial burden on state and local governments to collect data on subgrantees. NASACT expressed concerns about the high costs associated with collecting data on subgrantees, especially for state and local governments. They supported a bill with a pilot program for this purpose but still believed it would be challenging to obtain all the required information. Trade groups, like CODSIA, also raised similar concerns about the expenses of collecting subcontractor information. The subaward reporting pilot program mandated by the FFATA aimed to find a cost-effective method for collecting subcontractor data. Delays in the pilot program may be due to technical challenges and costs. The program will test reporting data from first-tier subrecipients only. The FFATA subaward reporting pilot program aims to collect award data from first-tier subrecipients, facing challenges with lower tier subrecipients. The legislation's purpose was to identify congressional \"earmarks,\" but the website's data collection systems do not capture this information. The website's value for earmark identification is limited unless specifically identified. The FFATA also intended the website to allow the public to assess individual award worthiness. The award descriptions on USAspending.gov can influence public perception of federally funded projects. Legislation was introduced to improve data quality on the website, aiming to provide more information on federal awards. The legislation introduced aims to enhance data quality on USAspending.gov by requiring detailed information on lease agreements, contracts, procurement bids, contract awards, competition details, congressionally directed spending items, and federal award recipients. The legislation aims to improve data quality on USAspending.gov by requiring detailed information on federal award recipients, audit disputes, award terminations, suspensions, civil, criminal, and administrative actions, compliance with tax requirements, and agency inspector general reviews. S. 3077 aimed to enhance data quality on USAspending.gov by expanding award information, receiving both praise and criticism. Supporters believed it would improve fiscal transparency and accountability, while critics raised concerns about public access to certain contract details. Critics raised concerns about the potential consequences of disclosing contract information on USAspending.gov, particularly regarding the inclusion of bid price data. They warned that this could pressure government procurement officers to award contracts to the lowest bidder, even if they may not be capable of completing the work. Additionally, there were objections to posting contractor misconduct information on the website, as it was deemed misleading and unfair without proper context or metrics for public understanding. The public might misinterpret disclosed contractor performance information without proper context or metrics, leading to misconceptions about the severity of actions taken. Implementing S. 3077 lacked specific data sources, making it difficult to assess potential costs and technical challenges. Implementing the reporting provisions of S. 3077 may have posed technical challenges for agencies due to the diverse data sources required. USAspending.gov, while operational, still lacks complete and timely data, diminishing its effectiveness as an oversight tool. Some agencies, like the Department of Homeland Security, have incomplete information, and no subaward data is available. The effectiveness of USAspending.gov as an oversight tool is reduced by the lack of award information provided. Legislation such as S. 3077 aims to increase transparency by requiring identification of earmarked awards and improving data quality on the website. However, expanding data on USAspending.gov may delay full implementation of the FFATA as agencies and award recipients are still developing procedures to meet reporting standards. OMB is addressing technical challenges associated with this. Some observers are concerned that expanding agency reporting requirements could strain resources and hinder FFATA implementation."
