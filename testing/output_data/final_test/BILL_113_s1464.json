    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Preserving American Access to Information Act\". The 1994 Joint Security Commission and the Public Interest Declassification Board highlighted issues with the classification system, stating that it has grown out of control and is not trusted to protect or release information effectively. The 2012 report warns that agencies are generating petabytes of classified information annually, surpassing the amount declassified in the previous seventeen years. Without significant improvements in declassification, the backlog of classified records will grow exponentially, hindering public access to the nation's history. SEC. 3. DECLASSIFICATION OF INFORMATION WITH SHORT-TERM CLASSIFICATION SENSITIVITY. Congress finds that certain time-specific classified information should be automatically declassified without further review by specifying the types of information with short-lived sensitivity. Certain time-specific classified information should be automatically declassified without further review, excluding details on sources, methods, tactics, tradecraft, and procedures of personnel, as well as any information that could endanger the military, intelligence, diplomatic, or law enforcement operations of the United States. Federal agencies must submit a report to Congress outlining these specifications. The report to Congress will include details on specified information types, feasibility of a new classification category, and recommendations for legislative action on automatic declassification. SEC. 4. ENHANCEMENT OF THE NATIONAL DECLASSIFICATION CENTER. The President must enhance the National Declassification Center's authority and capacity to promote a government-wide declassification strategy. Federal agencies must review and declassify Presidential and Federal records within one to two years, as directed by the National Declassification Center. The National Declassification Center's Director oversees the sharing of declassification guidance among Federal agencies to promote a government-wide strategy. The Director of the National Declassification Center facilitates public consultation with the advisory panel, ensuring it occurs concurrently with panel meetings. The Public Interest Declassification Board's term is extended to 2018, and measures are taken to preserve and provide access to historically valuable records. Federal agencies must identify and designate historically valuable records for preservation and future accessibility. Additionally, reports on pilot programs for improving declassification processes are required. Federal agencies must submit reports to Congress on pilot programs to enhance declassification capabilities, focusing on current technologies and best practices. Federal agencies are required to submit reports to Congress within a year of this Act's enactment. The reports should include an assessment of the feasibility and advisability of transitioning to a two-tiered classification system and declassifying Formerly Restricted Data (FRD) records without national security value."
