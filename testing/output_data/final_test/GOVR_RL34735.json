    "content": "Since the end of the Cold War, the economies of the United States and Europe have become closely integrated through trade, investment, and employment. The EU-U.S. commercial relationship is the largest in the world, with a combined population of nearly 800 million people generating over half of the world's production and $4.4 trillion in annual commercial exchanges. Despite recent economic challenges, the transatlantic economy remains dominant in the global economy. The transatlantic economy, with the United States and EU as key players, generates around $4 trillion in commercial activity annually, representing close to 60% of global GDP and 40% of world trade. This is driven by foreign direct investment (FDI) and trade in various goods and services, including chemicals, transportation equipment, computers, processed food, and financial services. Foreign direct investment (FDI) and activities of foreign affiliates have been key in the transatlantic economy over the past decade. U.S. and European companies have major ownership stakes in each other's markets, with a total two-way direct investment of $2.7 trillion at the end of 2007. U.S. affiliate income in Europe reached $147 billion in 2007, while European affiliate income in the U.S. was $82 billion during the same period. The global economic downturn has impacted U.S. foreign affiliate income in Europe, which peaked in 2007 and declined by 2% by mid-2008. European affiliate earnings in the United States remained flat in 2008. The significant ownership of companies in each other's markets results in billions of dollars of sales, profits, and expenditures on research and development. Despite a decline in employment figures due to the current economic crisis, the transatlantic economic and financial activity between the U.S. and EU remains substantial. The relationship between the United States and EU in managing economic issues like domestic regulations, competition policy, and foreign investment impacts global dealings. Both sides have implemented policies to expand their commercial relationship, despite flirtations with protectionist measures. Leaders in Washington and Brussels urge restraint to ensure cooperation during the current crisis. The success of economic integration achieved so far does not guarantee continued deepening of transatlantic economies. The global economic crisis has negatively impacted the transatlantic economy, with regulatory barriers hindering greater commercial ties. Both sides need to address these issues to promote further integration and regulatory cooperation during the economic recovery. This report complements the discussion on Transatlantic Regulatory Cooperation. The report by [author name scrubbed] focuses on transatlantic regulatory cooperation, highlighting the importance of addressing non-tariff and regulatory barriers for a more integrated transatlantic market. A recent study identifies the economic impact of non-tariff measures in EU-US trade and investment, emphasizing the role of regulations in trade relations. The study focused on estimating the cost increase of regulatory differences in transatlantic trade and their impact on economic welfare. Estimates were based on industry perceptions and assumptions, with a report suggesting that reducing competition-related regulations and trade barriers could lead to GDP per capita gains. The study estimated that reducing regulatory differences and trade barriers could increase GDP per capita by 3 to 3.5 percent on both sides of the Atlantic. Regulatory divergence poses challenges to trade, with non-tariff barriers like safety norms and labeling requirements hindering alignment of regulations. Coordination issues between U.S. federal and state, and EU and member state regulators contribute to the problem. Attempts to reduce non-tariff and regulatory barriers to trade between the United States and Europe have faced challenges due to differences in regulatory processes. Initiatives like the New Transatlantic Agenda in 1995 aimed to enhance economic cooperation, with subsequent efforts including Mutual Recognition Agreements in 1997. Regulatory cooperation is crucial for reducing costs, improving consumer welfare, and promoting economic growth. Several initiatives such as Mutual Recognition Agreements (1997), Positive Economic Agenda (2002), Transatlantic Economic Partnership (2004), and Transatlantic Economic Agenda (2005) have made limited progress in reducing regulatory burdens for European and U.S. companies in the transatlantic marketplace. While some improvements have been seen in areas like competition policy and financial services, progress in areas like chemicals has not been achieved. German Chancellor Angela Merkel proposed further liberalization of transatlantic trade and investment barriers in January 2007. The April 2007 U.S.-EU Summit adopted a Framework for Advancing Transatlantic Economic Integration, establishing the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) to reduce regulatory barriers to trade and investment. The TEC's priorities include building upon sectoral dialogues between U.S. and EU regulators. The Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) was established to reduce regulatory barriers to trade and investment. It focuses on sectoral dialogues involving pharmaceuticals, automobile safety, cosmetics, consumer product safety, food safety, energy efficiency, and medical devices. The TEC's \"Lighthouse Priority Projects\" include policies on intellectual property rights, secure ports and trade, financial markets, innovation and technology, and investment. The TEC is led by ministerial-level appointees with cabinet rank to ensure high-level political support for regulatory cooperation. The Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) was established to reduce regulatory barriers to trade and investment, focusing on sectoral dialogues and \"Lighthouse Priority Projects.\" Despite high-level political support, concerns have arisen about structural weaknesses limiting its effectiveness. Recommendations include appointing the Vice President as the U.S. co-chair and placing responsibility for the TEC in the office of the EU President to enhance visibility and effectiveness. The Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) aims to reduce regulatory barriers to transatlantic commerce through various efforts such as dialogues, mutual recognition agreements, and recommendations for voluntary principles. To enhance its effectiveness, the TEC is instructed to include broader participation of stakeholders, including legislators, in discussions and meetings. An \"advisory group\" is to be established to draw upon existing transatlantic dialogues for input. The Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) has an advisory group that utilizes existing transatlantic dialogues to provide guidance on priorities for transatlantic economic integration. The TEC meets twice annually and reports to the annual U.S.-EU Summit on achievements and areas needing progress. The advisory group has met with the TEC at each of the four TEC meetings held as of October 2009. The TEC meetings have had mixed results. The first meeting focused on mutual recognition of accounting methods. The second meeting emphasized promoting open investment policies. The third meeting reviewed progress in areas like investment and accounting standards, highlighting the need for a focused agenda. The fourth meeting of the TEC in October 2009 had a significant impact on the transatlantic economy, emphasizing the need for a stronger partnership. The meeting featured a deviation from previous ones, with the TEC leadership meeting separately with advisory groups to explore future directions. Uncertainty loomed over the next EU Commissioner's priorities, but both sides committed to working closely on energy-related issues. The TEC meetings in 2009 focused on closer collaboration on energy, services trade, financial regulations, and intellectual property rights. Despite challenges in harmonizing regulations and resolving disputes, both sides showed commitment to transatlantic economic integration. The Obama Administration sought to address U.S. economic challenges and global issues. The Obama Administration aimed to address U.S. economic challenges and the global financial crisis by emphasizing the importance of the transatlantic economic partnership. Michael Froman was designated as the point man for the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC), with the first formal meeting taking almost eight months to convene. President Obama met with EU leaders to energize transatlantic ties and coordinate policies for resolving the global economic downturn. The Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) was established to promote a transatlantic marketplace free of barriers and increase commercial activity. It aims to facilitate communication and cooperation on various issues between the U.S. and EU. However, challenges like the poultry dispute have hindered its progress, leading to questions about the necessity of regulatory cooperation solely within transatlantic relations. The Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) faces uncertainty over its role in promoting regulatory convergence between the U.S. and EU, especially with the shift in responsibility to the DG for Trade under the new EU Commission. The dilemma persists whether TEC should focus on dispute settlement or regulatory alignment in a global context. The Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) faces challenges in promoting regulatory convergence between the U.S. and EU. Suggestions include appointing a \"sherpa\" from the National Security Council and involving the OMB in coordinating U.S. positions. The effectiveness of TEC in reducing transatlantic barriers remains uncertain, with past cooperation mainly limited to executive branches and regulatory bodies. Legislators taking a more proactive role in transatlantic economic cooperation is not a new concept. At the 1995 launch of the New Transatlantic Agenda, leaders of the US and EU emphasized the importance of enhanced parliamentary links. This has led to increased interest in the role of the US Congress and European Parliament in regulatory cooperation. The EU's Lisbon treaty may give the European Parliament more authority over trade issues and regulatory decision-making. The US Congress and European Parliament have long argued for greater legislative participation in US-EU relations, including trade issues and regulatory decision-making. Resolutions have been passed supporting the completion of the transatlantic market by 2015, showing a push for enhanced dialogue and coordination between the two legislatures. Despite past initiatives, there is still a need to incorporate legislators into regulatory processes. Advocates of a more barrier-free transatlantic marketplace believe that strong commitment and active engagement from the U.S. Congress and European Parliament are essential for success. They criticize the low level of engagement so far and call for more active oversight by congressional committees to articulate support or concerns about regulatory direction before negotiations progress too far. Enhanced oversight could strengthen the partnership between Congress and the Parliament. Advocates suggest that Congress and the Parliament should work together more closely to understand regulatory decisions early on. They believe Congress can push regulators to cooperate and provide necessary funding. Some propose involving legislators in high-level regulatory discussions. The \"open skies\" agreement between the US and EU, aimed at enhancing airline competition, faced setbacks due to congressional actions. The \"open skies\" agreement between US and EU airlines was scaled back by congressional action, leading to concerns about regulatory autonomy and sovereignty. The EU has proposed negotiations for a follow-on aviation agreement in 2010, which could test enhanced participation of Congress and the Parliament. Some in the business and regulatory communities worry that involving legislators in the process could undermine regulatory processes. Some in the group are hesitant to involve legislators in regulatory reform, citing political barriers and recent concerns over free trade. They point to instances like \"Buy America\" restrictions in U.S. economic stimulus legislation and skepticism towards transatlantic economic integration. Some in the group are hesitant to involve legislators in regulatory reform, citing political barriers and recent concerns over free trade. They raise concerns about legislatures taking regulatory matters into their own hands without consulting transatlantic regulatory bodies or stakeholders. Examples like Sarbanes-Oxley legislation and the REACH directive are cited as well-intentioned initiatives that caused regulatory problems in the transatlantic relationship. Doubts exist about whether the TEC process could have prevented such actions, regardless of regulator engagement with legislatures. Involving legislators as advisors alongside business and consumer communities is seen as inappropriate by some. The involvement of legislators in regulatory reform is seen as inappropriate by some due to concerns about political barriers and potential interference with transatlantic regulatory bodies. The difficulty in determining who to consult with and how to do so has been a challenge for successive Administrations since 1995. Congressional committees lack jurisdiction over the broad array of regulatory issues on the agenda, making it challenging to establish a consistent dialogue with legislators. The House Foreign Affairs Committee and Senate Foreign Relations Committee lack authority over specific regulatory issues, raising concerns about legislators' readiness for a substantive partnership in transatlantic regulatory processes. In 2000, a Subcommittee dedicated to Europe was created in the House International Relations Committee to address these concerns. The formation of a Subcommittee in the House International Relations Committee dedicated to Europe, along with the establishment of a Members Caucus on the EU in 2005, has created new platforms for focused discussions on transatlantic relations. Various organizations and think tanks, such as the Transatlantic Policy Network and the German Marshall Fund, have been actively involved in enhancing Congress's transatlantic knowledge base. Efforts by groups like the Transatlantic Business Dialogue and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have added specificity to the debate, with publications like the annual transatlantic economic report from the Center for Transatlantic Relations bringing economic issues to the forefront. The Atlantic Council/Bertlesman report and the \"Shoulder to Shoulder: Forging a Strategic U.S.-EU Partnership\" report have influenced regulatory cooperation dialogue in 2010. Efforts by outside organizations have raised awareness in Congress, impacting regulatory cooperation and transatlantic relations. Congress rarely considers transatlantic impact in legislation, and is unlikely to submit legislative initiatives for transatlantic impact statements. Some in Congress are uncertain about their role in the transatlantic regulatory process, including those contacted to participate in the TEC advisory group. However, efforts to raise awareness of the U.S.-EU partnership and transatlantic economic relationship have led to increased interest from Congress in becoming more engaged in the process. The TEC was created to support structured regulatory cooperation. The Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) was established to facilitate dialogue between transatlantic business and consumer communities, the European Parliament, and the U.S. Congress. Supporters believe it will increase awareness of the impact of legislative work on transatlantic trade, while skeptics fear it may hinder regulatory integration efforts. The Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue (TLD) dates back to 1972, fostering exchanges between the U.S. House of Representatives and the European Parliament. The European Parliament's origins can be traced back to 1972 when Members of the House first visited Brussels to meet with the Parliament. The visits were arranged by the House Committee on Ways and Means, focusing on issues like agriculture subsidies and trade agreements. This led to the formation of the US-EU Community Inter-parliamentary Group, which meets twice annually in the US and Europe. The exchange has evolved over the years due to changes within the EU. The US-EU meetings evolved to focus on foreign policy issues related to the cold war and the European Union. In 1989, the responsibility for organizing these meetings shifted to the House Foreign Affairs Committee. In 1999, the group's name was changed to the Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue in response to the New Transatlantic Agenda, enhancing parliamentary ties between the EU and the US. The U.S. House changed the group's name to the Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue in response to the New Transatlantic Agenda, aiming to enhance parliamentary ties between the European Union and the United States. Since then, the TLD's agenda has expanded to include discussions on economic, trade issues, and its potential role in the transatlantic regulatory process. Despite regular engagement between the U.S. House and the European Parliament for 36 years, the TLD remains relatively unknown, although awareness may be increasing. The lack of knowledge of the Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue (TLD) among House members has been disappointing, despite past participation in exchange activities with Europe. Key leaders, such as Speaker Pelosi and Chairman of the House International Relations Committee, have been involved in TLD meetings. The surprise invitation for TLD to join the Advisory Group of the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) caught many in the transatlantic community off guard. There was little communication from the White House to inform House leadership about TLD's involvement in the 2007 U.S.-EU Summit. The 2007 U.S.-EU Summit surprised House leadership by assigning a new role to the legislative branch without prior communication. The Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue (TLD) was unexpectedly given the responsibility of representing Congress in transatlantic economic integration and regulatory cooperation. Concerns were raised about TLD's ability to fulfill this new role due to its lack of statutory authorization. The TLD's role as advisor to the TEC is gaining more attention from Congress, highlighted by the unveiling of a report and a hearing emphasizing the importance of Congressional-EU Parliament exchanges. The TLD facilitates exchanges between the Congress and EU Parliament, with a formal group of 32 members in the European Parliament. In the U.S. Congress, participation in the USTLD meetings is informal, with continuity of participants improving recently. Despite recent improvements in continuity, there are concerns about the TLD's ability to attract and retain a diverse group of Members for long-term participation. Communication mainly occurs between U.S. and EU Chairs, with limited interaction among other members. Efforts have been made to promote ongoing dialogues through video conferences between meetings. The TLD is exploring restructuring ideas such as including members from both the House and Senate, creating political and economic committees, and appointing Chairs and Vice-Chairs from both U.S. and European delegations. This would enhance communication and collaboration among Members/MEPs. The TLD is considering restructuring by appointing Chairs and Vice-Chairs from both U.S. and European delegations to focus on specific issues and improve attendance. There are concerns about dedicating more time to economic and regulatory issues and balancing foreign policy matters on the agenda. The TLD is considering restructuring by appointing Chairs and Vice-Chairs from both U.S. and European delegations to focus on specific economic and regulatory issues. The EU parliamentarians' perspective on TLD operations remains consistent, but there are concerns about the TLD falling behind in regulatory dialogue with its transatlantic partners. The TLD is considering restructuring by appointing Chairs and Vice-Chairs from both U.S. and European delegations to focus on economic and regulatory issues. Concerns arise about members catching up on issues and becoming too specialized in economic matters. Changes in committee assignments have shifted focus towards regulatory issues. The U.S. Chair of the Europe Subcommittee lost her seat on the trade subcommittee, allowing for a broader focus on transatlantic relations and regulatory cooperation with the EU. It is unclear how other committees will interact with the USTLD Chair in providing advice to the TEC. This issue was discussed at a recent meeting between TLD and TEC leadership. During a recent meeting between TLD and TEC leadership, a member of the Financial Services Committee, deeply involved in new financial services regulation, participated in discussions. It is crucial for Committees with jurisdiction over issues on the TEC agenda to be included in these sessions to ensure recommendations are based on guidance from the House of Representatives and Parliament as a whole, rather than individual members. The challenge for TLD is to establish relationships with appropriate House and Senate committees and leadership. The TLD aims to establish relationships with House and Senate committees and leadership for effective exchange of views on TEC issues without diminishing their authority. The question arises on who the business and consumer communities should engage with at the congressional staff level for TEC-related matters. On the U.S. side, two principal staff members are assigned to the TLD, with one designated as the \"U.S. secretariat.\" Observers question whether the Foreign Affairs Committee staff, with their focus on European issues, can effectively handle TEC matters such as automobile crash testing, container scanning, toy safety, and hedge fund transparency. It may be unrealistic to expect them to have the necessary expertise for the TEC process. The Atlantic Council-Bertelsmann \"Blueprint\" suggests that designated \"coordinators\" should work with TLD secretariats to optimize legislative participation in the TEC. Many committee staff may be unfamiliar with the TLD, TEC, or congressional advisory role in the transatlantic regulatory process. The recommendation to have designated \"coordinators\" work with TLD secretariats for legislative participation in the TEC raises concerns about the Foreign Affairs Committee staff's capacity to meet with multiple coordinators. Questions have also been raised about the Senate's exclusion from the TLD despite its co-equal role in regulatory oversight. The lack of a formal mechanism to involve the Senate in TLD activities or solicit their opinion within the TEC Advisory Group is noted. The TEC Advisory Group did not engage with the Senate to seek their opinion, unlike their interactions with the House. The TLD, as currently structured, cannot claim to represent the Senate. This oversight needs to be addressed for the TEC to receive advice from the entire Congress. The issue of the Senate's role in the TEC process was raised at a Senate hearing and will be further investigated. The Transatlantic Business Dialogue (TABD) and the Transatlantic Consumer Dialogue (TACD) are seen as supportive of the TEC process, despite some criticisms. There is uncertainty about the role of Congress and the TLD in advising the TEC. Suggestions have been made to restructure the TLD to enhance its effectiveness in this advisory role. The group believes the TLD should be formally authorized and given a status different from other parliamentary groups in Congress to enhance its effectiveness as a TEC advisor. One option could be for the U.S. and EU TLD co-chairs to create a TLD/TEC Working Group with appointed members to address transatlantic issues. The USTLD could recruit members from groups like the EU Caucus to work closely with the TLD, TEC, TABD, and TACD. The working group would brief TLD co-chairs before TEC meetings. Another option is for the TLD to engage with groups like the Transatlantic Policy Network for input. The TLD could collaborate with the Transatlantic Policy Network (TPN) Task Force, consisting of legislators and private sector representatives, to share ideas and recommendations with the TEC. The TPN Task Force's work on regulatory reform aligns with the TEC's goals, and they could provide input to the TLD co-chairs before TEC meetings. The TPN Task Force could collaborate with the TLD by making formal presentations at TLD meetings. Another option is to create a \"Regulatory Cooperation Advisory Group\" consisting of TLD leadership and representatives from relevant House and Senate committees to follow the work of the TEC. The TEC advisory group and committee staff would follow the TEC's work through overseeing agencies. Periodic meetings between TEC and committee staff could update the process. A Leadership-appointed advisory group could elevate the TEC process and TLD role, potentially involving House and Senate Leadership. Downsides include conflicts over agenda setting, partisan issues, and jurisdiction disagreements. The TEC process could benefit from increased Congressional participation, with some suggesting that the Obama Administration should signal the importance of Congress in transatlantic regulatory cooperation. The recent meeting between TEC and TLD leadership on the Hill may be a step towards this. Questions remain about the role Congress should play in the regulatory cooperation process. The TLD process has raised questions about its influence and authority as a transatlantic policy resource. Despite some shortcomings, the inclusion of an advisory group from transatlantic legislative communities is seen as an opportunity for Congress and Parliament to have a more direct role in the transatlantic marketplace. The current Chair and Vice Chair are committed to making the TLD more active. The TLD, along with the EU Chair, aims to enhance its role in the TEC process by addressing concerns and fulfilling responsibilities. Observers believe that the TLD could become a significant stakeholder in regulatory cooperation and a voice for transatlantic relations in Congress. However, its primary challenge remains promoting transatlantic economic integration and regulatory cooperation on behalf of the U.S. Congress."
