    "content": "The housing and residential mortgage markets in the United States are recovering from the housing bubble burst in 2007-2008. Despite improvements since 2012, foreclosure rates and negative equity remain higher than normal, with low home sales and mortgage originations. The 114th Congress considered housing-related issues amidst concerns about housing affordability, rising home prices, and the impact on rental housing availability. Legislation was proposed to modify mortgage-related laws and regulations to address potential barriers to housing market recovery. The 114th Congress considered changes to mortgage rules in response to the housing downturn, with concerns about access to credit. There were also discussions about reforms to HUD-assisted housing programs and debates about GSE contributions to affordable housing funds. The 114th Congress received GSE funding in 2016. Key issues included oversight of HUD, enforcement of the Fair Housing Act, and housing-related tax provisions. The report provides an overview of housing and mortgage market conditions, highlighting improvements in owner-occupied housing indicators. The housing market has shown improvements in owner-occupied housing indicators, with falling house prices and increasing household equity. However, indicators like home sales and housing starts have not fully recovered to pre-housing bubble levels. Recovery varies across local markets, with low-income and minority neighborhoods lagging behind. The housing market turmoil from 2007 saw declining house prices, leaving many households with little to no equity in their homes. House prices increased from 2000 to mid-2007, then declined until 2011. They began rising again in 2012 and continued to increase in 2015 and 2016. Rising prices benefit current homeowners but can make it harder for prospective buyers. Falling prices during the housing market turmoil led to negative equity for many households, contributing to foreclosures. The housing market has seen a decrease in negative equity as home prices have been rising nationally. In the third quarter of 2016, just over 6% of mortgaged properties were estimated to have negative equity, compared to about 25% in the second quarter of 2011. Despite the improvement, over 3 million homes with mortgages still remain in negative equity across the country. Negative equity is not evenly distributed, with some areas still facing challenges. Equity is improving, but negative equity remains high in low-income and minority neighborhoods, especially in lower-priced homes. Housing market recovery varies across areas. Mortgage foreclosure rates have been consistently declining, with the share of mortgages in foreclosure decreasing to about 1.5% in the fourth quarter of 2016. This is the lowest rate since the second quarter of 2007. Home sales include existing and newly built homes. Home sales encompass existing and new homes, with existing home sales reaching nearly 5.5 million in 2016, the highest since 2006. New home sales have also increased, surpassing 560,000 in 2016. The number of new home sales has started to increase, reaching over 560,000 in 2016, but still below levels seen in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Housing starts, which include homes not intended for sale, are consistently higher than new home sales. Housing starts for single-family homes fell during the housing market turmoil but are now showing signs of increase as markets stabilize. The seasonally adjusted annual rate of housing starts for one-unit residential buildings fluctuated between 1.2 million and 1.8 million monthly from 2000 to 2007. However, it dropped to 400,000-600,000 monthly until around 2013 before trending upward, reaching over 700,000 in 2015 and 2016. Homeownership is closely tied to the mortgage market, impacting demand for homes. The number of home purchase mortgages originated has fluctuated over the years, with a low point in 2008 and a slight increase in recent years. Economic pressures may be affecting both the supply and demand for homes, leading to slower growth in home sales. The demand for home purchases may be affected by stagnant incomes, rising student loan debt, and demographic trends. Younger households, who are typically first-time homebuyers, are delaying home purchases due to economic pressures and delaying major life events like marriage. Observers argue that mortgage credit is too tight, further impacting the housing market. Many argue that mortgage credit is tight, making it difficult for households to buy homes. Access to mortgages must balance creditworthiness and risk. Organizations measure mortgage credit availability. Many experts agree that mortgage credit is tighter than before the housing bubble, with a higher proportion of loans going to high credit quality borrowers. Despite low interest rates, mortgage originations remain low. Interest rates have fluctuated since 2010, remaining below 4.5% for the most part. Rising rates could impact mortgage affordability and deter homeowners from selling. Lenders have options to hold, sell to private companies, or sell to government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. In the years after the housing bubble burst, there was an increase in federally backed mortgages, raising concerns about government exposure to risk and lack of private capital. Nearly two-thirds of mortgages originated in 2016 were either guaranteed by a federal agency or backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Less than 1% of mortgages were securitized in the private market. The share of new mortgage originations insured by a federal agency or guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac has decreased from nearly 90% in 2009. Despite this, the percentage of mortgages with federal insurance or GSE guarantee remains high compared to pre-2008 levels. The homeownership rate has dropped, leading to an increase in rental households. This has caused competition for rental housing and a rise in rents. The increase in competition for rental housing has raised rents, leading to more cost-burdened renter households. The share of renters has been rising, reaching close to 37% of all occupied housing units in 2016, the highest since the early 1990s. Homeownership rates have decreased from 69% in 2004 to just over 63% in 2016. The number of renter households has also increased, with over 43 million occupied rental housing units in 2016 compared to fewer than 36 million in 2008. This rise in renters has led to a decrease in rental vacancy rates in many areas. The increase in competition for rental housing has led to rising rents, causing affordability issues for lower-income households. The national rental vacancy rate has decreased over the years, reaching 6.9% at the end of 2016. Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies notes that rents have been increasing at a rate higher than inflation, exacerbating housing affordability problems. Housing affordability issues are prevalent, especially for lower-income households. According to the Joint Center for Housing Studies, the number of cost-burdened households slightly increased in 2014 to 39.8 million, with 21.3 million renter households experiencing cost burdens. Minority and lower-income households are more likely to be cost-burdened. Cost burdens are more common among lower-income and minority households, especially in higher-cost housing markets. In 2013, 7.7 million renters were considered to have \"worst-case housing needs,\" defined as renters with incomes at or below 50% of area median income who pay more than half of their incomes for rent or live in inadequate conditions. This number decreased from 8.5 million in 2011 but was 30% higher than in 2007. The 114th Congress addressed housing issues related to federally assisted programs administered by HUD. Reflecting on HUD's 50th anniversary, stakeholders and Members of Congress considered its future role and modernization efforts. The House Financial Services Committee chairman called for ideas to restructure and rebuild HUD for current needs. The House Financial Services Committee held a hearing on the future of housing in America, focusing on HUD's impact on federal housing policy. Concerns about federal budget deficits have led to interest in reducing discretionary funding for HUD programs, with Section 8 vouchers accounting for a significant portion of HUD's budget. The Section 8 voucher program makes up nearly half of HUD's budget, with costs increasing due to the creation of more vouchers each year and rising renewal costs. Public housing, the third-largest expense, has been underfunded for many years. The pressure to increase funding for HUD's largest programs, like public housing and Section 8 vouchers, must be balanced against the need to maintain or increase funding for other HUD programs. This includes grants for homelessness assistance, Native American housing, and the Community Development Block Grant program. Funding levels for HUD and the Department of Transportation are determined by the THUD appropriations subcommittee. HUD's budget, although smaller than DOT's, makes up the largest share of the overall budget. The 114th Congress considered HUD appropriations, influenced by the agency's budget size compared to DOT's. Congress has also looked into reforms for major housing assistance programs serving 4.5 million families. The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program is HUD's largest direct housing assistance program, serving over 2 million low-income families at a cost of over $19 billion in FY2015. Administered by public housing authorities, the program provides portable rental subsidies to very low-income families. The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program provides portable rental subsidies to very low-income families in the private market. The program has faced criticism for its administrative complexity and growing cost. Project-based rental assistance involves contracts between HUD and private property owners for over 1 million units of affordable housing. Recent reform proposals aim to streamline administrative processes and enhance protections for tenants in the program. The public housing program, owned by local PHAs, provides low-rent housing to eligible low-income tenants. With approximately 1 million units available, the aging housing stock requires nearly $26 billion for repairs. Congress funding falls short, leading PHAs to seek private market loans for capital needs. The public housing program, owned by local PHAs, provides low-rent housing to eligible low-income tenants. PHAs seek private market loans to meet capital needs, including converting properties to Section 8 assistance. Recent reform proposals aim to simplify income eligibility, rent determination, and inspection processes for all three programs. Moving to Work (MTW) demonstration seeks to modify and expand options for PHAs. The future of the Moving to Work (MTW) program, which aims to reduce program costs, provide work incentives, and increase housing choices, has been a controversial topic in housing reform. While no major legislation was considered in the 113th Congress, the President requested administrative reforms in annual budget submissions. Some of these reforms were included in the FY2014 and FY2015 HUD appropriations laws, with more controversial provisions in the FY2016 appropriations law. The FY2016 appropriations law (P.L. 114-113) included an expansion of the MTW demonstration by 100 agencies. In the 114th Congress, noncontroversial administrative reform bills were approved, such as the Tenant Income Verification Relief Act of 2015 (H.R. 233) and the Preservation Enhancement and Savings Opportunity Act of 2015 (H.R. 2482). These bills were enacted into law as part of the Surface Transportation Reauthorization and Reform Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-94). Late in the first session of the 114th Congress, the chairman of the Housing and Insurance Subcommittee of the House Financial. In the 114th Congress, the Housing Opportunity through Modernization Act of 2015 (H.R. 3700) was introduced by the chairman of the Housing and Insurance Subcommittee of the House Financial Services Committee. It included reforms related to administrative streamlining for assisted housing programs and was approved unanimously by the House and Senate before being signed into law by President Obama on July 29, 2016. The Native American Housing Block Grant (NAHBG) is the main federal program providing housing assistance to Native American tribes and Alaska Native villages. Authorized by the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (NAHASDA), it offers formula funding for affordable housing activities benefiting low-income Native Americans or Alaska Natives in tribal areas. The most recent authorization for NAHASDA programs expired in FY2013. The NAHASDA programs expired in FY2013 but have been funded through annual appropriations laws. The 113th Congress considered reauthorization legislation, but none was enacted. In the 114th Congress, both the House and Senate considered NAHASDA reauthorization bills. The House passed H.R. 360 in March 2015, while the Senate reported out S. 710. Both bills aimed to reauthorize NAHBG and the Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grant, along with two home loan guarantee programs for Native Americans and Native Hawaiians. Changes to program requirements and authorization of a demonstration program for housing financing in tribal areas were also included. The House and Senate bills aimed to reauthorize NAHBG and the Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grant, along with two home loan guarantee programs for Native Americans and Native Hawaiians. Both bills included provisions to increase private financing for housing activities in tribal areas and provide housing vouchers and supportive services for Native American veterans who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. Additionally, there was a provision to reduce funding to tribes with large unexpended balances of NAHBG funds. While the bills were similar in many ways, they also had some differences in provisions and approaches to addressing issues. During the 114th Congress, there was disagreement over NAHASDA reauthorization legislation, which ultimately was not enacted. In 2008, the Housing and Economic Recovery Act established the Housing Trust Fund to provide federal funding for affordable rental housing. For more information on NAHASDA and reauthorization efforts, refer to CRS Report R43307 and R44261 by Katie Jones. The Capital Magnet Fund, administered by the CDFI Fund, provides competitive funding for affordable housing activities to CDFIs and eligible nonprofit organizations. It can be used for a broader range of activities than the Housing Trust Fund and is funded through contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which were suspended after being placed into conservatorship in 2008. In 2008, the Housing Trust Fund was not funded, and the Capital Magnet Fund received a one-time appropriation in FY2010. In 2014, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were directed to set aside funds for the Housing Trust Fund and Capital Magnet Fund. The first contributions were made in early 2016, with allocations announced in May 2016 for the Housing Trust Fund and grant awards in September 2016 for the Capital Magnet Fund. These affordable housing funds have been controversial, with supporters arguing they are necessary to address the need for affordable rental housing for low-income households. Critics argue that funding the Housing Trust Fund and Capital Magnet Fund outside of the appropriations process limits Congress's oversight and could lead to misuse of funds. Some Members of Congress have tried to stop Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from funding these programs, citing concerns about duplication and potential misuse. In the 114th Congress, bills like the Pay Back the Taxpayers Act and the FY2016 HUD appropriations bill aimed to restrict Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from contributing to the Housing Trust Fund. Other issues considered included the housing finance system and mortgage accessibility. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government-sponsored enterprises, were created to support homeownership. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) created by Congress to support homeownership, cannot make mortgages but purchase qualifying ones from lenders. During the 2008 housing crisis, they entered conservatorship overseen by the FHFA. The Treasury Department bought $188 billion of senior preferred stock from each GSE, receiving $251 billion in dividends, which became general revenues. Since June 2012, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have not required additional support from the Treasury, receiving $251 billion in dividends. Policymakers aim for housing finance reform legislation to change or eliminate the GSEs' role. While there is agreement on certain principles like increasing the private sector's involvement and ensuring access to affordable mortgages, details are contentious. The 113th Congress considered but did not pass reform legislation, with less progress in the 114th Congress focusing on targeted GSE reforms. Legislation in the 114th Congress aimed to address issues related to the GSEs' conservatorship, including restricting the use of dividends, preventing Treasury from disposing of preferred stock without legislation, and limiting executive compensation. Proposals also focused on sharing mortgage risks with the private sector and improving the secondary mortgage market through a common platform for securitization. Increasing guarantee fees can boost GSE profits, with all profits paid to Treasury. Congress has used fee increases to offset government spending, such as the Temporary Payroll Tax Cut Continuation Act of 2011. Some oppose using GSE fees for other activities, arguing it raises fees unnecessarily. Some argue against using GSE fees for other activities, as it could increase costs for mortgage borrowers and hinder housing finance reform. The Financial Regulatory Improvement Act of 2015 aimed to restrict the use of guarantee fees for scoring appropriations, with exceptions for specific circumstances. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are required to reduce their capital buffer annually until it is eliminated in 2018. After January 1, 2018, any losses would require the GSEs to draw down support agreement funds at Treasury. Fannie Mae has $117.6 billion and Freddie Mac has $140.5 billion available under the support agreement. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 restricts the Secretary of the Treasury from disposing of senior preferred stock without future legislation. The GSEs' conservatorship and senior preferred stock are separate issues, with the possibility of ending conservatorship without disposing of the stock. The agreements with Treasury require all profits to be paid as dividends, preventing GSEs from accumulating reserves. Treasury's support agreements act as reserves under conservatorship. Changes to GSEs' status must consider warrants held by Treasury. FHFA approved raising CEO compensation in 2015. Mae's and Freddie Mac requested to raise CEO annual compensation to $4 million from $600,000, which was limited by the Equity in Government Compensation Act of 2015. FHFA directed the GSEs to develop programs to share mortgage credit risk with the private sector. S. 1484 aimed to encourage these programs. Both GSEs issue their own MBS, but FHFA determined that modernizing their computer systems and adopting a common MBS would improve market efficiency. The GSEs are working on modernizing their MBS system through Common Securitization Solutions (CSS). Freddie Mac issued MBS using the common securitization platform (CSP) release 1 in December 2016, with release 2 expected in 2018. S. 1484 aimed to expand access to CSS for private MBS issuers, require reports to Congress, revise the CSS board, establish a timetable for issuing new MBS, and limit CSS risks. Financial regulators are implementing mortgage-related rulemakings as part of post-housing bubble financial reforms. The CFPB has issued rules on the ability to repay. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has issued rules on mortgage-related topics such as ability to repay, qualified mortgage standards, homeownership counseling, escrow requirements, mortgage servicing, loan originator compensation, and disclosure forms. Federal bank regulators have also issued rules affecting banks' mortgage-related assets. Additionally, six federal agencies issued a final rule on credit risk retention and qualified residential mortgages (QRM). The 114th Congress focused on policy issues related to regulatory burden on lenders, consumer protections, and housing finance system stability. The 114th Congress focused on policy issues related to regulatory burden on lenders, consumer protections, and housing finance system stability. Some in Congress question how the rules will affect credit availability for creditworthy borrowers. Mortgage credit is relatively tight compared to the early 2000s, and some argue that the new regulations have contributed to the slow recovery. Others contend that the regulations are intended to prevent those unable to repay their loans from receiving credit. In the 114th Congress, legislation was introduced in both the Senate and House to reform the financial regulatory system, including mortgage-related rulemakings. The Senate Banking Committee reported the Financial Regulatory Improvement Act of 2015 (S. 1484), while the House Financial Services Committee reported bills covering manufactured housing, the QM rule, escrow accounts, mortgage servicing, and disclosures. Some bills, like H.R. 650 and H.R. 685, passed the House. In the 114th Congress, legislation was introduced to reform the financial regulatory system, including mortgage-related rulemakings. The Financial CHOICE Act (H.R. 5983) proposed wide-ranging reforms to the financial system. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insures mortgages made by private lenders to protect against borrower default. FHA insurance aims to make mortgages more accessible to certain households. FHA insurance facilitates access to mortgages for households with small down payments. Concerns about FHA's finances arose when its capital ratio fell below 2% in FY2009, leading to a mandatory appropriation from Treasury in FY2013. Despite improvements, ongoing concerns persist. FHA faces tension between expanding access to affordable mortgage credit and protecting its finances. In 2015, FHA reduced fees for mortgage insurance to make mortgages more affordable, but critics worry it could hinder financial rebuilding efforts. FHA is also working to provide clarity to lenders on its requirements and potential actions for non-compliance. FHA is addressing concerns about unclear requirements for lenders, which can deter them from offering FHA-insured mortgages. Changes are being made to provide more clarity and expand access to these mortgages, but some argue that the changes have not gone far enough. Some industry groups and Congress have differing opinions on recent changes to FHA-insured mortgages. Concerns have been raised about the impact of changes on lender certifications and accountability. Initiatives by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and FHA involve selling distressed mortgages to investors before foreclosure. For more information, refer to CRS Reports RS20530 and R42875 by Katie Jones. Loan sales are a departure from the traditional foreclosure process, aiming to reduce losses for FHA and GSEs by selling distressed mortgages to investors. Some critics argue that these sales should benefit more homeowners and contribute to neighborhood stabilization. Critics argue that investors who purchase distressed mortgages should do more to help keep borrowers in their homes and prevent vacant foreclosed properties from becoming community blights. Suggestions include selling more loans to nonprofit organizations and implementing measures to protect borrowers. Changes have been made to loan sales programs by FHA and GSEs, but concerns remain about the impact on investor willingness to pay for loans and potential limitations on reducing losses. The House Financial Services Committee held a hearing in July 2016 to review recent changes to FHA's loan sale program. The Fair Housing Act (FHA) prohibits discrimination in housing based on various factors. It applies to all types of housing and real estate transactions. Congressional interest in fair housing issues was active during the 114th Congress. The Supreme Court's ruling in Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project confirmed that the Fair Housing Act prohibits housing-related decisions that have a discriminatory effect on a protected class. The Court emphasized the need for evidence to support disparate impact claims and for swift resolution of such claims. The Supreme Court's ruling in Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project highlighted the importance of evidence in disparate impact claims under the Fair Housing Act. The decision may lead to fewer successful disparate impact claims and quicker disposal of such claims, potentially discouraging their filing. Some in Congress supported the ruling, while others have opposed the use of disparate impact claims in Fair Housing Act cases. The proposed amendments to the Fair Housing Act in response to the Inclusive Communities ruling did not pass in the final FY2016 appropriations law. Amendments to other related Acts were also proposed but not included in the final legislation. The Fair Housing Act requires HUD and funding recipients to affirmatively further fair housing, with HUD publishing a rule in 2015 governing this obligation for program participants. The 2015 HUD rule requires program participants to affirmatively further fair housing based on a three- or five-year cycle for their plans. Entitlement communities with CDBG grants over $500,000 started submitting AFHs in 2016, while other grantees and PHAs have later start dates. Before the AFFH rule, participants certified their efforts through an \"Analysis of Impediments\" (AI), which was often outdated or lacking content. The AFFH rule now defines more specific requirements for affirmatively furthering fair housing. The AFFH rule requires program participants to submit an Assessment of Fair Housing (AFH) to HUD every five years, encouraging collaboration for a broader perspective on fair housing issues. Participants assess segregation, poverty concentration, disparities in opportunity access, and housing needs, setting goals to address contributing factors in their Consolidated and PHA Plans. HUD provides data support for these efforts. HUD provides data and tools to assist program participants in preparing their AFHs, which must be submitted and approved by HUD. The proposed AFFH rule received over 1,000 comments, with supporters citing increased housing opportunity and opponents expressing concerns about local authority and costs of preparing AFHs. In the 114th Congress, proposed legislation aimed to prevent HUD from implementing the AFFH rule by prohibiting the use of federal funds for its administration and enforcement. This included the Local Zoning Decisions Protection Act of 2015 and amendments to appropriations acts. In the 114th Congress, legislation was proposed to block HUD from enforcing the AFFH rule by restricting federal funding. Amendments were made to appropriations acts, including provisions related to zoning laws. Funding for FY2017 HUD appropriations was still pending at the time of the report. The tax extenders legislation, known as the PATH Act, addresses issues like canceled mortgage debt income. When a taxpayer's mortgage debt is forgiven, the forgiven amount is usually included in their gross income. Lenders report canceled debt to the IRS using Form 1099-C. The Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007 temporarily excluded qualified canceled mortgage debt income associated with a primary residence from taxation. The exclusion was extended through 2016 by the PATH Act, allowing debt discharged after 2016 to be excluded if a binding agreement was made before January 1, 2017. The Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007 excluded canceled mortgage debt income from taxation, extended through 2016 by the PATH Act. Extending the exclusion beyond 2017 aims to minimize hardship for distressed households and support housing market recovery. Opponents argue it may encourage irresponsible behavior and be unfair based on various factors. The JCT estimated a 10-year revenue loss of $5.1 billion with the two-year extension in the PATH Act. The two-year extension in the PATH Act would result in a 10-year revenue loss of $5.1 billion. Homeowners traditionally deduct mortgage interest and property taxes when itemizing deductions. Starting in 2007, homeowners could also deduct qualifying mortgage insurance premiums. The deduction for mortgage insurance premiums was extended through 2016 by the PATH Act, with the aim of promoting homeownership and the recovery of the housing market. Homeownership is believed to have societal benefits such as higher property values, lower crime, and greater financial security. However, the recent housing downturn has raised questions about these benefits. The deduction for mortgage insurance premiums may not significantly impact the homeownership rate due to high transaction costs associated with home purchases. While the deduction could allow buyers to borrow more, it may not lower the primary barrier to homeownership. Additionally, the necessity of the deduction to assist in the housing market's recovery is unclear. Home prices have consistently increased since 2012, indicating a strong housing market. Extending the deduction for mortgage insurance premiums may help individuals in financial distress, but could lead to a misallocation of resources towards the housing industry. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated a $2.3 billion revenue loss with the two-year extension. The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) was established in 1986 to incentivize affordable rental housing development. There are two types of LIHTCs - 9% credit for new construction and 4% credit for rehabilitation and new construction with tax-exempt bonds. The credits are claimed annually over 10 years and are determined by a formula to ensure the present value of credits equals a percentage of qualified construction costs. LIHTC rates fluctuate based on interest rates. The Recovery Act of 2008 established a 9% floor for the new construction tax credit rate, which was extended through various acts until the PATH Act made it permanent. The 4% credit rate for rehabilitation construction remained unchanged. Low interest rates have historically kept LIHTC rates below the 4% and 9% thresholds. The floors on the credit rates, set at 4% and 9%, would result in subsidies exceeding 30% and 70% due to persistently low interest rates. This addresses concerns among LIHTC participants about the uncertainty introduced by variable rate methods in determining credit rates for projects. The original formula for variable credit rates aimed to achieve present value subsidies of 30% or 70%, but using risk-free U.S. Treasury yields for discounting tax credit streams posed a challenge for investors in LIHTC projects. The use of floors on credit rates at 4% and 9% addresses concerns about uncertainty in determining subsidies for LIHTC projects due to low interest rates. This may lead to fewer projects receiving funding as higher credit rates could result in fewer credits available per project. Other options for addressing issues with the LIHTC program are also being considered. Options for addressing issues with the LIHTC program include increasing target subsidy levels to 30% and 70%, adjusting the discount rate used in the formula for determining credits, and ensuring that the variable rate formula is still utilized. The JCT estimated a $19 million revenue loss over 10 years with the permanent extension included in the PATH Act. Tenants in LIHTC units must have incomes below a specific threshold, typically 50% or less of the area's median income. For more information on the program, refer to CRS Report RS22389 and CRS Report RS22917 by Mark P. Keightley and Jeffrey M. Stupak. Both civilians and servicemembers are potentially eligible to live in LIHTC units. Servicemembers' incomes for eligibility consideration must include their annual pay and basic allowance for housing (BAH). The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 temporarily excluded military housing allowances from LIHTC income calculations near growing military bases, making more servicemembers eligible for LIHTC housing. The exclusion of military housing allowances from LIHTC income calculations near growing military bases was initially set to expire in 2011 but has been extended multiple times, most recently being permanently extended by the PATH Act. This exclusion aims to increase the availability of affordable rental housing for military families near specific bases and alleviate rising rents in those areas. The exclusion of military housing allowances from LIHTC income calculations near military bases aims to provide affordable rental housing for military families and alleviate rising rents. However, a 2005 Government Accountability Office report suggests limited effectiveness due to various reasons, such as junior enlisted servicemembers living in barracks and housing allowances already covering area median cost of living. The exclusion could also displace LIHTC properties for civilians, with a projected 10-year revenue loss of $83 million. The elevated blood lead levels in children in Flint raised health concerns and questions for federal policymakers regarding the nation's water infrastructure and addressing environmental hazards in homes. HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes administers grant programs for lead-based paint and other housing-related hazards. Proposals for additional funding for the Healthy Homes program were introduced in Congress but not enacted."
