These programs target federal, state, and local government personnel, emergency responders, and critical infrastructure personnel to prepare for, respond to, and recover from terrorist attacks. The Departments of Defense and Homeland Security provide training for government personnel, emergency responders, and medical professionals to respond to terrorist attacks. The Department of Health and Human Services trains public health and medical personnel to respond to disasters, especially terrorist attacks using WMDs. The Department of Justice provides training for law enforcement personnel at federal, state, and local levels. These programs are often conducted in collaboration with educational institutions, laboratories, and research centers. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has primary responsibility for providing counter-terrorism training to federal, state, and local emergency responders. Other departments focus on specific sectors or types of emergency responders. DHS offers training to a wide range of personnel, including critical infrastructure, law enforcement, government, and medical personnel. This report gives an overview of federal departments and agencies providing counter-terrorism training and highlights associated issues. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) provides counter-terrorism training for federal, state, and local government personnel through various agencies and training facilities like the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC), National Fire Academy (NFA), and Emergency Management Institute (EMI). Issues include duplication of training programs, determining training priorities, and coordinating DHS training programs. The Emergency Management Institute (EMI) offers training programs for fire and emergency response personnel to enhance their abilities in responding to fires and related emergencies. The Office for Grants and Training (G&T) within DHS provides counter-terrorism and WMD training to states and localities through various partners and training institutions. The G&T provides training to emergency responders at different levels using various methods. TRADE ensures consistency in training courses and includes members like USFDA, FBI, DOJ, FEMA, EPA, DOE, HHS, CDC, EMI, and FLETC. NDPC consists of federal training facilities. The National Domestic Preparedness Consortium (NDPC) is a group of federal training facilities and academic institutions that provide specialized training to emergency responders across the United States. Members of NDPC include the Center for Domestic Preparedness (CDP) in Alabama, the Academy of Counter-Terrorist Education (ACE) at Louisiana State University, the National Emergency Response and Rescue Training Center (NERRTC) at Texas A&M University, the Energetic Materials Research and Testing Center (EMRTC) in New Mexico, and the National Center for Exercise Excellence (NCEE) in Nevada. CDP, administered by G&T, focuses on training state and local emergency responders in managing domestic terrorism incidents involving chemical agents and toxic substances. The Academy for Counter-Terrorism Education (ACE) at LSU provides training to emergency responders on detecting, preventing, and responding to terrorist incidents involving WMD. The National Emergency Response and Rescue Training Center (NERRTC) at Texas A&M University offers counter-terrorism training for federal, state, and local officials. The Energetic Materials Research and Testing Center (EMRTC) at New Mexico Tech provides explosive and incendiary training to state and local emergency responders. The National Exercise, Test, and Training Center (NETTC) at DOE's Nevada Test Site offers radiological and nuclear WMD training to emergency responders. The center collaborates with various federal agencies, private industry, and academic institutions to provide training on radiation, nuclear agents, and WMD exercise design. The Department of Defense offers terrorism-related training courses primarily for military personnel, with limited programs available to non-DOD personnel, focusing on chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) weapons. These programs are intended for medical and technical personnel who may need to respond to incidents involving CBRN weapons. Some training courses are jointly sponsored by the American Red Cross, and counter-terrorism training is provided to non-DOD personnel by the U.S. Army. The Department of Defense provides counter-terrorism training to non-DOD personnel at various locations, including Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland and Dugway Proving Ground in Utah. The Department of Energy offers technical assistance and training to states for public safety officials in preparation for transporting nuclear fuel. The Transportation Emergency Preparedness Program (TEPP) has provided training and technical assistance to emergency responders in multiple states since 1988, with approximately $30 million allocated for this purpose. The Department of Energy (DOE) has trained 16,200 responders since FY1999 and provided $5.8 million for training in FY2002 along its major transportation corridors. The EPA is designated as the lead federal agency for coordinating the protection of the nation's critical infrastructure for the water sector. The Water Security Division collaborates with utilities, states, tribes, and stakeholders to enhance security and response capabilities. It offers technical assistance and training on security and antiterrorism topics, including vulnerability assessments and emergency response plans mandated by the Bioterrorism Act. Training is delivered nationwide through stakeholder organizations and federal partners like the Office of Domestic Preparedness. EPA has sponsored various security training courses for medium and large drinking water utilities and first responders. EPA provides funding for security training for smaller drinking water utilities not covered by the Bioterrorism Act. They also support vulnerability assessment training for wastewater utilities, offering training through various organizations and funding emergency response exercises for large wastewater utilities. Other security-related training activities include train-the-trainer workshops and training on emergency responses to threats of intentional harm. The Water Security Division provides tools, technical assistance, and training on emergency response and security practices to help utilities address identified risks. EPA has responsibilities under CERCLA for responding to hazardous chemical releases in non-marine environments. EPA's Environmental Response Team responds to thousands of releases annually. The Environmental Response Team offers training courses on recognizing and controlling hazardous chemical releases for federal employees, contractors, and first responders at state and local levels. A new course on air monitoring for emergency responders is upcoming. Counter-terrorism training programs by the Department of Health and Human Services target public health providers, healthcare professionals, and researchers studying health effects and countermeasures to biological and chemical threats. Training programs have various purposes, including recognizing and treating victims of terrorist events, protecting workers from infection, ensuring continuity of critical healthcare assets, maintaining communication during catastrophic events, and protecting assets like radioactive materials. HHS agencies fund and administer specific training programs. The HHS agencies fund and administer training programs, utilizing resources from federal, state, and local agencies to support infrastructure development and delivery. This includes expanding training sites, enhancing information technology infrastructure, and coordinating with other agencies like FEMA EMI and FLETC. Preparedness grants to states also require compliance with the National Incident Management System (NIMS) since FY2005. The HHS agencies oversee training programs for emergency preparedness, including the USPHS Commissioned Corps and the Medical Reserve Corps. CDC is primarily responsible for public health response to emergencies and supports various training programs. CDC supports various public health training programs for emergency preparedness and response, including the Public Health Training Network, National Laboratory Training Network, Centers for Public Health Preparedness, and Emergency and Risk Communication Training program. These programs are developed and delivered in collaboration with state and local health departments and academic centers. The HRSA provides training and support for healthcare and public health workers to address shortages and maldistributions. This includes the National Bioterrorism Hospital Preparedness Program, which helps states prepare hospitals for public health emergencies. Additionally, HRSA funds the Bioterrorism Training and Curriculum Development Program for academic institutions to develop training programs. The FDA provides training for healthcare providers on terrorism preparedness and new regulations for food and drug safety. Training includes web-based and classroom instruction, video teleconferences, and a library of materials. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) implements the Crisis Counseling Training and Assistance Program (CCP) to provide mental health assistance and training in disaster areas. SAMHSA also operates a Disaster Technical Assistance Center to help manage mental health issues post-disaster. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) offers training fellowships for biomedical research. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) conducts research on bioterrorism preparedness and response, focusing on diseases caused by bioterrorism agents. The research includes developing new tests, drugs, and vaccines. Bioterrorism research at NIH is led by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), with other NIH institutes also funding relevant research. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) provides evidence-based information and guidance for healthcare providers in planning for and responding to bioterrorism. The Department of Justice (DOJ) enforces laws to ensure public safety against terrorist threats through federal investigations and prosecutions. They also provide assistance to state and local law enforcement agencies, offering programs related to special weapons, criminal intelligence, money laundering, computer crime, crisis response, and management. The Department of Justice (DOJ) offers various training programs through entities like the FBI, ATF, and National White Collar Crime Center, as well as nonprofit organizations. Training includes topics like anti-terrorism, crisis management, intelligence analysis, cybercrime, and terrorism response for law enforcement. Rail and bus transit systems are considered critical infrastructure due to their role in transporting many Americans. Rail transit systems are critical infrastructure, moving over 14 million passengers daily in urban areas. They are high-risk targets for terrorists due to their open environment and fixed routes. The Federal Transit Administration provides counter-terrorism training and security guidance to transit system operators. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) provides security guidance and a five-point security initiative to assist transit systems in preparing for terrorist attacks. FTA offers training, readiness assessments, technical assistance, regional forums, and grants for terrorism drills. They work with the transit industry to identify critical assets and develop security strategies, including training, sharing best practices, and testing new security technology. Counter-terrorism training courses are available to transit system personnel. Counter-terrorism training programs are offered to various entities such as federal, state, and local governments, medical systems, and critical infrastructure administrators. Issues in training evolution include duplication, funding allocation, attendance prioritization, redundancy, and consolidation. Potential oversight approaches for Congress are discussed. Rapid evolution of training programs may lead to duplication among different federal departments and agencies. The federal government offers training related to responding to hazardous material incidents, but coordination among agencies may be lacking. Congress could consider oversight approaches such as evaluating all federal counter-terrorism training programs to address potential duplication and the need for interagency coordination. After reviewing federal counter-terrorism training programs, Congress could direct agencies to establish an interagency task force chaired by DHS to coordinate and consolidate training to avoid duplication. This may lead to \"turf\" disputes among agencies. State and local governments receive counter-terrorism training funding through the DHS Homeland Security Grant Program (HSGP), which includes the State Homeland Security Grant Program (SHSGP) and the Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI). The allocation method for FY2006 DHS grants differs from previous years, with funds used for training first responders, government personnel, and emergency managers. In FY2006, DHS changed the distribution method for UASI funding to a risk- and needs-based formula. Major jurisdictions are grouped into single urban areas, with grouped jurisdictions determining allocations within the urban areas. Eleven urban areas that received UASI funding in FY2005 are not eligible for new funding but can apply for existing projects. DHS changed the distribution method for UASI funding in FY2006 to a risk- and needs-based formula. Urban areas can apply for sustainment funding for ongoing projects and for projects with dual-use capabilities. Critics argue that the current funding distribution methods for federal homeland security assistance are inadequate and unfair. The allocation of counter-terrorism training funding raises policy questions within the larger issue of federal homeland security funding distribution. The allocation of counter-terrorism training funding raises policy questions separate from federal homeland security assistance distribution. Not every state and locality can receive priority in training due to varying levels of risk. Some areas face greater risk based on population density or critical infrastructure. Training funding should enhance preparedness for states and localities facing terrorist threats. Possible approaches to the allocation of counter-terrorism training funding include Congress determining if the current training and funding levels are adequate for all states and localities. Arguments suggest that every state should receive baseline training due to the unpredictable nature of terrorism, regardless of the absence of critical infrastructure or low population density. This perspective implies that all states and localities may require some level of counter-terrorism training. Training funding and priority are essential to ensure every state and locality receives baseline counter-terrorism training. However, there is a concern that some areas face a higher risk of terrorist attacks and may require more training and funding. Congress could direct DHS to establish a priority attendance list for states and localities at greater risk, based on intelligence from G&T. Congress could direct G&T to increase funding to specific states or localities based on terrorist threat information to enhance preparedness for potential attacks. This would ensure that areas at greater risk receive adequate training and resources, potentially increasing security measures. G&T could coordinate terrorist threat information with SHSGP funding allocation, similar to how it does with UASI funding. G&T and FEMA administer training programs at various levels, including national training institutes like EMI and NFA. G&T provides guidance and funding to training institutes within the NDPC. The report suggests a need to consolidate or coordinate training programs offered by EMI, NFA, and NDPC for state and local first responders. While FEMA's firefighting training focuses on local fire departments, NDPC provides training primarily for law enforcement. Tailored profession-specific training may not be redundant, but basic training like incident management or WMD response could benefit from consolidation. Congress may need to address the redundancy and consolidation of training programs for first responders provided by DHS. One approach could be allowing DHS to continue training through two separate agencies for emergency managers, law enforcement, firefighters, and emergency medical personnel. However, this option may not resolve concerns about redundancy or lack of coordination in the training programs. Congress could consider requesting a GAO evaluation of DHS training programs. Congress could ask GAO to evaluate DHS counter-terrorism training programs, including ODP and FEMA curricula, trainees, and facilities. This evaluation could identify duplication and suggest ways to coordinate training. H.R. 1544 proposes this evaluation, requiring collaboration between Congress and GAO. If redundancy is found, Congress could direct DHS to improve coordination of training programs. DHS could establish a board to review and recommend coordination of G&T and FEMA training programs to reduce duplication. Congress may direct DHS to consolidate its training programs, potentially removing redundant programs. If deemed necessary, all counter-terrorism training could be consolidated under one agency, with G&T possibly assuming responsibility for administering FEMA training as well. The option of consolidating all counter-terrorism training under one agency, with G&T possibly taking on FEMA training administration, is seen as impractical due to the specific training provided by EMI for natural disasters and NFA for firefighters. FEMA historically administers training for emergency managers and firefighters, while G&T focuses on law enforcement training.
