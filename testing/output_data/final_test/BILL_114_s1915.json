    "content": "The \"First Responder Anthrax Preparedness Act\" establishes a voluntary pre-event anthrax vaccination pilot program for emergency response providers at high risk of exposure to anthrax. The program provides eligible anthrax vaccines from the Strategic National Stockpile to states for administration to these providers. The Secretary of Health and Human Services determines eligibility of anthrax vaccine for pilot program based on specific criteria. Before implementing the program, preliminary requirements must be met. The Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, will establish a communication platform, provide education and training, conduct economic analysis, create a logistical platform for anthrax vaccine requests, set goals and outcomes, and establish a reimbursement mechanism for vaccine costs. The Secretary of Homeland Security will select 2-5 states for a pilot program involving vaccines from the Strategic National Stockpile. States participating must ensure consistency with public health guidelines. The Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, will provide guidance to states and local governments participating in a pilot program to increase readiness for anthrax release. States must identify emergency response providers at high risk of exposure to anthrax. Each participating state must submit a written certification. Before implementing the pilot program, states must provide emergency response providers with disclosures and educational materials on vaccine benefits, risks, and anthrax exposure. The Federal Government is not obligated to continue providing anthrax vaccine after the pilot program ends. The Secretary of Homeland Security will establish a memorandum of understanding with the Secretary of Health and Human Services to define roles, responsibilities, and performance metrics for a pilot program. Reports on the program's progress will be submitted annually to specific committees in the House of Representatives. The House of Representatives and Senate committees will receive a report on the pilot program's progress and costs. The report to be provided to the House of Representatives and Senate committees will include total costs for management and administration, costs to ship vaccines, number of full-time equivalents allocated to the program, and costs to the Strategic National Stockpile. The final report will include details on the number and percentage of emergency response providers participating, completion rates of the vaccine regimen, total doses administered, and recommendations for improving participation. It will also consider whether the pilot program should continue and include relevant information for decision-making. The final report will analyze the costs and benefits of continuing the anthrax vaccine program for emergency response providers, assess the risks and benefits of administering vaccines through the pilot program, and provide a plan for continuing the program if recommended. The Secretary of Homeland Security must start implementing the pilot program within 1 year of the Act's enactment. The authority for the pilot program will end 5 years after the Act's enactment."
