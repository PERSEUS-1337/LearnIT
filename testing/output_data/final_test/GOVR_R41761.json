    "content": "The United States and Turkey have a strong history of defense cooperation, both bilaterally and within NATO. Recent shifts in Turkish foreign policy and a decline in military influence raise concerns among some Members of Congress about the future of defense cooperation. This presents challenges for both countries in pursuing their national security objectives. The Defense Department and State Department need to adjust bilateral interaction with Turkey on defense matters to account for changes in the Turkish civil-military power structure. Proper interlocutors for grand strategy, military strategy, and tactical objectives could lead to a more multidimensional approach. Areas of interest for Congress and U.S. policymakers include reconciling perceptions of Turkish influence and declining U.S. influence in the overall defense relationship. Turkey's growing influence and declining U.S. influence are impacting defense cooperation, particularly in NATO and missile defense. Cooperation with Turkey in Iraq and Afghanistan includes joint counterterrorism efforts and the use of Turkish bases for cargo transport. The implications of strained Turkey-Israel relations on U.S.-Turkey defense cooperation are also being addressed. The impact of strained Turkey-Israel relations on U.S.-Turkey defense cooperation, including concerns about a possible adverse Turkish reaction to an Armenian Genocide Resolution. Future prospects for defense cooperation include joint exercises, stationing of U.S./NATO personnel in Turkey, defense-related aid, and defense industrial cooperation. Turkey's NATO accession in 1952 was based on mutual benefits. The U.S.-Turkey defense cooperation is based on the concept of \"mutuality of benefits.\" Turkey receives security guarantees from the U.S. against Soviet aggression, allowing for the stationing of troops and equipment in Turkey. The alliance also helps contain Turkish-Greek tensions within NATO. Despite some recent strains, the relationship has always been troubled, particularly due to issues with Greece and Cyprus. In 1974, Turkey intervened in Cyprus with U.S.-supplied arms, leading to a U.S. embargo on military grants and arms sales from 1975 to 1978. This significantly impacted the Turkish military's readiness and strained the U.S.-Turkey alliance. Turkey closed U.S. defense and intelligence installations, leading to a shift towards diversifying arms imports and developing a domestic arms industry. Some believe that U.S.-Turkey tensions are evolving, with more complex differences emerging in their alliance. The 2003 vote by the Turkish Parliament not to allow U.S. troops to use Turkey's border with Iraq highlighted the changing nature of their defense relationship. Henri Barkey noted that issues of disagreement between Turkey and America are now more numerous and intricate than before, indicating a shift in mutual threat perceptions and defense priorities. Despite the longstanding U.S.-Turkey alliance, Turkish popular sentiment views the United States as its biggest external threat, influenced by historical concerns and events like the 2003 Iraq invasion. However, there has been a slight improvement in Turkish perceptions of U.S. influence in the world, as indicated by a BBC poll released in March 2011. U.S. influence in the world has improved significantly from a year earlier, which may impact Turkish leaders' strategic cooperation. Since 1948, the U.S. has provided Turkey with $13.8 billion in military assistance, but aid decreased after the Cold War. Current assistance includes IMET, INCLE, and NADR funds. Turkey is a significant ally for the United States, especially in the current geopolitical landscape. The U.S. utilizes Turkey's strategic location for its national security interests, including the stationing and transport of arms and personnel. Turkey's strong military capabilities and economic growth further solidify its role in the region. Turkey's expanding regional influence, supported by domestic military spending and arms exports, enhances its importance for the United States on global issues like Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, and Israeli-Palestinian conflicts. Turkey's role in regional security has become more prominent, especially with its involvement in NATO's intervention in Libya. Additionally, Turkey's significance as an energy transport hub, not limited to Russia and Iran, further emphasizes its importance for world energy markets. Iran emphasizes Turkey's security for world energy markets, impacting U.S. and Turkish defense cooperation. The U.S. aims to leverage Turkey's military in various defense initiatives to increase influence and legitimacy. Turkish leaders use this to gain benefits and enhance their prestige. However, there is talk of Turkey's growing self-sufficiency and a decline in U.S. influence in the region. Turkey's national security priorities focus on protecting borders from Kurdish militants and deterring aggressors without provoking them. Defense cooperation with the United States presents a dilemma as Turkey tries to avoid provoking neighbors who see them as enabling U.S. actions in the region. Developments during the Obama Administration have raised questions about overlapping national security goals and defense priorities between Turkey and the U.S. President Obama visited Turkey in April 2009, emphasizing the importance of the partnership between Turkey and the United States. Ahmet Davutoglu, Turkey's foreign minister at the time, played a key role in shaping Turkey's more independent foreign policy course. This course aims for Turkey to be at the center of its own sphere of influence through strategic depth. The tensions between the Obama Administration and the AKP government over regional challenges spilled over into bilateral defense relations, with the House Committee on Foreign Affairs considering H.Res. 252 in March 2010, which characterized actions of the Ottoman Empire against Armenians from 1915 to 1917 as genocide. In response to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs considering H.Res. 252 in March 2010, Turkey recalled its ambassador from the United States and warned of downgrading the relationship. This included a potential threat to limit U.S. access to Turkish bases used for transporting cargo to military missions. Turkey had previously recalled its ambassador in 2007 over a similar resolution. Additionally, concerns arose in May and June 2010 over Turkey's Iranian nuclear diplomacy with Brazil. Turkey's Iranian nuclear diplomacy with Brazil and the Mavi Marmara Gaza flotilla incident worsened Turkey-Israel tensions. Some U.S. officials questioned Turkey's stance on global security issues. Philip Gordon stated that Turkey needs to demonstrate its commitment to NATO, Europe, and the United States. Turkey's foreign policy direction has raised questions among officials and analysts, particularly regarding the downgrading of possible threats from Iran, Syria, Greece, and Armenia in the Turkish National Security Policy Document. This shift, along with defining Israel's actions as a threat, has implications for global alignment and is influenced by the AKP government's activist foreign policy. The United States has limited influence over these factors. The United States has limited influence over Turkey's foreign policy. President Obama warned Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan about potential difficulties in gaining congressional approval for foreign military sales, including weapons systems sought for use against the PKK. Speculation arose about increased congressional support. Speculation arose about increased congressional support for H.Res. 252 or another resolution on Armenian genocide claims. Turkey's concerns on Iran were somewhat eased at the NATO summit in Lisbon, where they approved a new strategic concept. However, a decision is pending on hosting a U.S. radar for missile defense in Turkey as part of the EPAA. Turkey's cooperation with NATO on missile defense plans, including the deployment of a radar, is crucial. Improved international perceptions of Turkish cooperation on Iran were noted after Turkey intercepted Iranian cargo planes in 2011. President Obama consulted frequently on political unrest in the Middle East in early 2011. Following the passage of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973 on March 17, 2011, the United States, France, and the United Kingdom began armed intervention in Libya against forces loyal to Muammar al Qadhafi's regime, initially repelling a planned assault on the Qadhafi-opposition stronghold of Benghazi. Turkey's position regarding NATO's role in the intervention has become increasingly important given its geographical closeness to Libya and its status as a Muslim-majority country with significant cultural and historical ties to Libya. Erdogan publicly opposed NATO involvement in Libya before the resolution was passed. Erdogan initially criticized Qadhafi's actions in Libya and advocated for a peaceful transfer of power. Turkey later decided to support NATO's involvement in Libya, actively participating in the implementation of Resolution 1973. Erdogan's support was a calculated decision to limit Western military involvement and steer NATO's decision-making processes. Turkey supports NATO's involvement in Libya but expresses concerns about hidden agendas and differing interests. President Abdullah Gul questions the aim of coalition forces and worries about a repeat of the Iraq situation. Turkish forces will not engage in combat, and Turkey emphasizes the need for political consultation within NATO. Turkey supports NATO's involvement in Libya but expresses concerns about hidden agendas and differing interests. Turkish officials want a cease-fire for the Libyan people to determine their political future. Other NATO members have set conditions for their involvement, which could limit strategic options for the United States and allies if more offensive action is needed against Qadhafi's forces. Turkey's Parliament approved the use of Turkish forces in Libya for humanitarian aid tasks within the NATO-led coalition. Erdogan announced Turkey's direct responsibility for tasks including control of Benghazi airport and the air corridor. Turkey is contributing six ships to NATO's naval fleet for enforcing the arms embargo in Libya. Turkey is contributing six ships to NATO's naval fleet for enforcing the Libya arms embargo, including four frigates, a submarine, and an auxiliary warship. The aerial mission is commanded from Turkey at NATO's Allied Air Component Command in Izmir, with Turkey providing at least 10 aircraft for support. There is speculation that designating Izmir as a sub-command structure for Operation Unified Protector could impact NATO's reform process. Turkish Defense Minister Vecdi Gonul has expressed strong objections to closing down the air command center in Izmir. Some analysts believe assigning Izmir as a sub-command structure for the Libyan mission could strengthen Turkey's position. The fate of NATO's Izmir command center will be decided at a NATO summit in June. Efforts to convince Turkey to close the command center during Operation Unified Protector were unsuccessful. The Turkish military has historically played a significant role in the country's defense and unity since the days of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. The Turkish military has historically played a significant role in the country's defense and unity since the days of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. It intervened in 1960, 1971, and 1980 to replace governments deemed to have lost control or strayed from secular principles. The military's dominance in government and society gave it primacy in defense cooperation with the United States. Since the 1980 military coup, the Turkish military's influence has weakened due to factors like economic liberalization empowering the middle class and the rise of populist sentiment challenging the military and other secular guardians. The Justice and Development Party (AKP) won a parliamentary majority in 2002 and enacted reforms strengthening civilian control. The AKP won a parliamentary majority in 2002 and enacted reforms strengthening civilian democratic institutions, sometimes at the military's expense. In 2007, the AKP received 12% more of the vote than in 2002. There were failed attempts by elements within the military, judiciary, and opposition to thwart the AKP. Events included the election of Abdullah Gul as President, alleged plots to undermine the government, a Constitutional Court case to ban the AKP, and amendments to the constitution in 2010 increasing civilian control over the military and judiciary. In a nationwide referendum, Turkish military and judicial accountability to civilian and democratic institutions increased in 2011. The first external audit of Turkish defense spending was reported by Jane's Sentinel Security Assessment, showing a gradual shift towards civilian oversight. Some analysts suggest further restrictions on military control over spending, involvement in the defense industry, and economic power through the pension fund OYAK for greater democratic accountability. U.S.-Turkey defense cooperation remains strong in promoting stability and countering terrorism in Iraq and Afghanistan, with ongoing joint defense consultations, training, and military exercises. Turkey's defense industry seeks advanced military equipment from the U.S. and engages in joint ventures, including the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. However, Turkey is also diversifying its defense relationships by conducting arms transactions and joint military exercises with non-NATO countries like China, Russia, and Pakistan, indicating a desire to decrease dependence on the United States. Turkey, with the second-largest military in NATO, plays a strategically important role due to its geographic location and Muslim-majority status. It has been part of the alliance since 1952 and actively participates in NATO's missions. Despite robust defense spending, Turkey's ability to contribute fully to NATO missions is hindered by ongoing commitments in various regions. Turkey's growing regional influence justifies greater involvement in setting NATO's objectives. It has shown assertiveness in recent years, especially during the 2011 NATO deliberations over intervention in Libya. Turkish-Greek disputes over Cyprus and the Aegean Sea have limited NATO's interoperability in the eastern Mediterranean. Turkey is perceived as an anomaly within NATO, but remains firmly anchored in the alliance. The reluctance of some European countries to support Turkey's defense guarantees and EU accession has reinforced Turkey's outsider status within NATO. Differences over NATO priorities exacerbate tensions within the alliance, linked to long-running perceptions about Turkey. Turkish Foreign Minister expressed concern about individual NATO member states acting without international consultation regarding Libya intervention. He emphasized the need for UN coordination and criticized the Paris meeting for not following international norms. Turkey's concerns about individual NATO member states intervening without international consultation in Libya highlight the potential for troubling situations in the Middle East. Differences between Turkey and other NATO allies on intervention in Libya have led to questions about Turkey's alignment within the alliance. The complexity of NATO's internal disagreements, driven by regional and cultural factors, raises doubts about the extent to which Turkish policies are influenced by cultural or ideological affinities versus a desire to address its unique geographical challenges within NATO. Turkey's alignment within NATO has been questioned due to differences with other allies on intervention in Libya. Despite regional and cultural factors, characterizations of Turkey as a NATO outlier may be overstated. Turkey approved ballistic missile defense at the 2010 Lisbon summit with conditions to protect its territory and not name specific threats. Discussions are ongoing for Turkey to host a U.S. radar as part of the NATO BMD system. EPAA Standard Missile-3 interceptors, supported by a radar in Turkey, will be based at sea, and eventually in Romania and Poland. Turkey may host a U.S. radar as part of an EPAA BMD system under the NATO umbrella, which could be justified domestically as cost-effective and NATO-interoperable. Turkey's active diplomatic role on the Iranian nuclear issue could impact threat perceptions. It is unclear how Turkey views the connection between hosting a U.S. radar for NATO's BMD system and the presence of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons in Turkey. Turkey may need to negotiate details with the United States if it hosts the proposed radar for NATO's BMD system. Contingency planning for missile defense could lead to differences of opinion between Turkey, the United States, and other allies. Turkey's active role in Afghanistan includes training Afghan military and security forces. Turkey's 2,000 troops in Afghanistan focus on training Afghan military, providing security in Kabul, Wardak, and Jawzjan provinces. Turkey has deployed AWACS aircraft, OMLT teams, trained ANA members, established PRTs, and runs humanitarian projects in Kabul. Turkey's 2,000 troops in Afghanistan focus on training Afghan military and providing security in Kabul. Turkey's participation in ISAF is seen as legitimizing its presence. U.S.-Turkey defense cooperation in Iraq is part of broader questions about Iraq's future stability and regional profile. Turkey's engagement in Iraq has increased as the United States plans to withdraw its troops by the end of 2011. Turkey has been politically and economically active throughout the country, contributing personnel to NATO training missions and providing specialized training for Iraqi security personnel. Analysts speculate whether Turkey will adopt a more assertive approach in countering Iranian influence and promoting stability post-U.S. drawdown. The PKK, a Kurdish separatist militant group, has been a concern for Turkey for nearly three decades. After the establishment of an autonomous Kurdish zone in northern Iraq in the 1990s, PKK attacks increased. The PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan was captured in 1999 with reported U.S. collaboration, leading to a ceasefire. However, after the 2003 Iraq war, the PKK resumed operations from safe havens in northern Iraq, causing tensions between Turkey and the U.S. The PKK maintains a fighting force of 4,000-5,000 militants, with a concentration in the Qandil mountains of northern Iraq. They have branches dedicated to attacks in southeastern Turkey and urban areas in western Turkey. Casualties from Turkey-PKK violence since 1984 range from 32,000. Since 1984, casualties from Turkey-PKK violence range from 32,000 to 45,000, with many Kurdish villagers displaced in southeastern Turkey. The Kurdistan Regional Government in northern Iraq has shifted to welcoming Turkish investment for stability and is now tolerant of Turkish efforts to counter the PKK. Syria stopped providing safe haven to the PKK in 1999, and Iran occasionally cooperates with Turkey against the PKK. Abdullah Ocalan. Iran cooperates with Turkey against the PKK due to its own Kurdish minority issues. Turkey amassed troops on its border with Iraq after PKK ambushes. The Bush Administration closed counterterrorism cooperation with Turkey to prevent a cross-border invasion. U.S. military set up a center in Ankara for intelligence sharing on PKK operatives. The U.S. is assisting Turkey in identifying PKK movements using aircraft and drones. Turkey decides whether to act on the information provided by the U.S. and conducts air strikes with ground-based artillery support. Turkish ground forces have not crossed the border, with the U.S. coordinating air strikes in Iraqi airspace since December 2007. The Turkish air strikes against the PKK are seen as insufficient to stop their operations but help in intimidating them. Future Turkish ground operations depend on factors like Iraqi and KRG approval. The US encourages coordination between Turkey, Iraq, and the KRG on non-military approaches to address tensions with Kurds. The AKP government has considered measures for Kurds such as greater local governance and cultural rights. The \"Kurdish opening\" initiative in Turkey stalled in 2009 due to criticism and the closure of the Democratic Society Party. Renewed PKK attacks in 2010 led to retaliatory strikes by Turkish forces. PKK offshoots may have been involved in a 2010 bombing in Istanbul. This issue is a major national security concern for Turkey. The Turkish military's prestige is tied to ending PKK attacks, with urgent defense cooperation requests focused on the issue. The shrinking timeline for U.S. military operations in Iraq has increased the sense of urgency for effective U.S.-Turkey counterterrorism cooperation. The U.S. maintains access to Turkish installations under the Defense and Economic Cooperation Agreement, with a significant presence at Incirlik air base. The largest U.S. presence in Turkey is at Incirlik air base near Adana, with approximately 1,500 U.S. personnel. The base also houses 60-70 U.S. nuclear bombs under NATO auspices and supports U.S. and NATO operations in various countries. Incirlik is crucial for providing logistical support for missions in Iraq and Afghanistan. The U.S. relies on Incirlik air base in Turkey for logistical support, saving $210 million annually. Turkey can cancel U.S. access with three days' notice. The Habur Gate is used for transporting supplies to northern Iraq, but its future role is uncertain. Mersin port in southern Turkey is increasingly important for transporting cargo to Afghanistan. The United States uses the Habur Gate in Turkey to transport non-lethal cargo from Iraq to Afghanistan along the Northern Distribution Network (NDN). U.S. military transportation corridors also utilize Kuwait, the Persian Gulf, and Pakistan to bypass Iran. U.S. personnel are stationed in Ankara, Izmir, and Istanbul to support NATO operations and logistics in the region. The United States has military personnel stationed in Ankara, Izmir, and Istanbul to support NATO operations. In Istanbul, there are two air postal squadrons and a tactical management office. One of the NATO Rapid Deployable Corps is headquartered near Istanbul. Congress and U.S. policymakers have various options for overseeing defense cooperation with Turkey. Approach: Emphasizes confidence in existing NATO and bilateral relationships to address security challenges, regardless of recent developments in Turkey. Advocates for maintaining historical defense ties without conditioning cooperation on specific actions or foreign policy stances. No need seen to revise institutional structures or decision-making processes. Critics argue that recent challenges to the U.S.-Turkey alliance are different from past ones, warning that a static view of the alliances risks leaving the United States unprepared for potential consequences. Omer Taspinar of the Brookings Institution warns of Turkey potentially pursuing its own \"Realpolitik\" with countries like China, India, and Russia, similar to France under Charles de Gaulle in the 1960s. The United States should consider accommodating Turkey's national interests within the U.S.-Turkey alliance, even if Turkey opposes certain U.S. policies. This approach prioritizes long-term regional stability and cooperation, responding to Turkish requests for arms and desires for a greater role in decision-making. Turkish desires for a greater role in multilateral institutions and decision-making processes could be achieved despite ongoing disputes with Israel and Armenia, and relations with Iran, China, Syria, and Hamas. Congress could still criticize Turkey on issues affecting U.S. interests without making it a litmus test for the alliance. Some argue that strong U.S. relations with democratically elected Turkish leaders are crucial for advancing regional U.S. interests and countering Iranian influence, regardless of divergences on some issues. The Linkage Approach suggests tying cooperation with Turkey to its relations with certain countries or non-state actors, as well as its actions on issues of U.S. national security interest. This approach aims to avoid ceding judgment to Turkey on matters conflicting with U.S. interests, such as Iran or Israel, and prevent tacit acceptance of Turkey's efforts to diversify military contacts and import-export relationships. It emphasizes the need for clear parameters for cooperation. The Linkage Approach suggests tying cooperation with Turkey to its actions on U.S. national security interests. Clear parameters for cooperation will allow Turkey to demonstrate its importance to the United States. However, misperceptions and conflicting views between Congress and the Administration could complicate communication. Firm redlines or ultimatums may risk the future of the relationship with Turkey. Approach(es) to U.S.-Turkey defense cooperation could depend on factors like regional security challenges, Turkey's relations with other countries, U.S. trust in Turkish leaders, and the likelihood of influencing Turkey to act in U.S. interests. Using a case-by-case approach is suggested, particularly if Turkey challenges cooperation, as giving ground could risk U.S. credibility. The case-by-case approach to U.S.-Turkey defense cooperation aims to strengthen bilateral and NATO relationships, but risks being seen as inconsistent. Concerns include potential denial of U.S. military access to Turkish bases and transport corridors, impacting cargo transport to Afghanistan. The focus is on how lack of access to key Turkish facilities could affect future options. The drop-off in Turkish military cooperation with Israel has occurred alongside a deterioration in Turkey-Israel relations since 2009, attributed to various factors including the Mavi Marmara incident and disagreements over Israel's actions in Gaza. This decline parallels a general decrease in the military's role. The souring of Turkey-Israel relations has led to a decline in military cooperation, with Turkey ceasing joint exercises and halting arms sales and defense cooperation with Israel. This could impact U.S.-Turkey defense cooperation, as both countries have close alliances with Israel and Turkey. The souring of Turkey-Israel relations has led to a decline in military cooperation, with joint exercises and arms sales on hold indefinitely. The air exercise Anatolian Eagle and naval exercise Reliant Mermaid, which previously involved U.S.-Turkey-Israel cooperation, did not include the United States or Israel in late 2010. Divergent Turkish and Israeli positions on regional issues could further strain U.S.-Turkey defense relations. Turkey has set a condition for hosting U.S. radar sensors for a ballistic missile defense system, requesting that information not be shared with Israel. The Senate passed S.Res. 548 condemning the attack on the Mavi Marmara and urging Turkey to maintain strong relations with Israel. Turkish officials expressed concerns about backlash from the Jewish lobby. In the near term, an improvement in relations between the AKP government and the Israeli government does not appear likely. The U.S. brokering role may impact Turkey-Israel rapprochement and future U.S. defense relations. Developments could affect U.S. influence on regional security. Deployment of U.S. European Phased Adaptive Approach to ballistic missile defense in Europe, including a possible radar in Turkey, is subject to congressional oversight. The Authorization Act (P.L. 111-383) enacted on January 7, 2011, includes provisions for the construction and deployment of land-based interceptors of the EPAA, with conditions on host nation approval and a waiver option for national security reasons. It also limits funds for the land-based portion of the EPAA until Congress receives an independent assessment of its operational and cost effectiveness as required by the FY2010 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 111-84). The United States is responsible for the costs of EPAA deployment, including land- and sea-based components, as part of NATO's BMD system. The common NATO budget will cover general BMD system costs, estimated at \u20ac200 million over 10 years. The radar deployment is planned by the end of 2011, with pressure on Turkey to decide on hosting the radar. Turkey's concerns about the EPAA's capabilities and decision-making process with the United States remain unclear. Despite not receiving annual Foreign Military Financing aid, Turkey still views the U.S. as a preferred supplier for military equipment. However, Turkey aims to reduce its dependence on any single nation or group. Turkey seeks to reduce dependence on any single nation, leading to tensions with U.S. over procurement policies. It considers offers from various countries for defense acquisitions, prioritizing flexibility and expertise sharing for industrial self-reliance. Potential procurement partners include NATO countries, South Korea, Russia, China, Pakistan, Indonesia, Singapore, and South Africa. Turkey's procurement policies require formal notice to Congress before defense equipment sales above $25 million to NATO allies. Congress can block sales at any time before delivery, considering regional actors' capabilities. Turkey has sought to purchase drone aircraft from the United States since 2008 for counterterrorism efforts. Turkish officials expect favorable attitudes from Congress towards potential arms sales to Turkey, considering its unique geopolitical position and demographics among U.S. allies. Turkey sought to purchase drone aircraft from the United States for counterterrorism efforts against the PKK. In 2010, Turkey deployed Heron drones acquired from Israel after production delays. President Obama mentioned difficulties in obtaining congressional approval for U.S. sales of drone aircraft to Turkey due to its diplomacy with Iran. The U.S. military operations in Iraq are transitioning to a State Department-led security assistance effort by the end of 2011. There are concerns about maintaining stability around the Turkey-Iraq border and the region, leading to debates on the extent of U.S. involvement and the potential costs and benefits of providing Turkey with advanced military capabilities. Possible PKK retaliatory targeting of U.S. personnel and equipment is also a concern. Negotiating the sale of U.S. drone aircraft to Turkey is complex due to proprietary technology and potential concerns about end use. Turkish reliance on non-U.S. defense suppliers could increase if delays occur. Turkey's air force, critical to its defense posture, heavily relies on U.S.-purchased fighter aircraft, such as Lockheed Martin F-16s. Delivery of 30 F-16 Block 50s co-produced by Turkish Aerospace Industries was agreed upon in 2009 after lengthy negotiations. Turkey signed an FMS contract in 2009 for 30 F-16 Block 50s to be co-produced by TAI, with delivery expected by 2013. The deal's estimated cost is $1.78 billion, potentially reaching $2.9 billion with all options. Turkey also plans to purchase up to 116 F-35s over a 10-year period as part of the JSF program. The F-35 program involves joint assembly and development by firms from JSF partners, with a cost of at least $11 billion. Turkish companies have received contracts for substantial work, potentially generating $5 billion-$6 billion in revenue over 20 years. Turkish officials have expressed concerns about modernizing their F-16 fleet and participating in the JSF program. Turkey has expressed dissatisfaction with the United States over the JSF program, considering producing its own fighter aircraft after 2020. Cooperation with South Korea, Indonesia, and Gulf countries is being explored for this purpose. Turkey is also seeking to purchase batteries for a Turkish Long Range Air and Missile Defense System. Turkey is looking to buy batteries for a Long Range Air and Missile Defense System, costing $4 billion, through a bidding process open to foreign companies. The US may offer its Patriot PAC-3 system, but technology transfer issues make the decision difficult. Russia, China, and Eurosam are also potential bidders. Turkey will consider tender offers for a Long Range Air and Missile Defense System, including from Raytheon and Eurosam, with a focus on NATO interoperability. The US provides military and security assistance to Turkey, with funds allocated for various law enforcement, customs, and security agencies, as well as the military. Turkey also has prior-year US Foreign Military Financing funds available. Turkey has approximately $75 million in unobligated Foreign Military Financing funds available. The funds are allocated for communications, general equipment sustainment, frigate upgrades, and other equipment and systems. Congressional oversight may focus on Turkey's joint exercises, operations, and use of bases with the United States. The US maintains a presence at Turkey's Incirlik air base and the Allied Air Component Command in Izmir through NATO. Turkey's military collaborates with the United States and NATO through joint exercises and operations, including hosting military exercises at its Konya air base. Turkey also participates in various NATO operations such as counterterrorism patrols, maritime groups, air policing missions, and anti-piracy tasks in different regions. The U.S.-Turkey cooperation involves joint participation in NATO operations and the use of Turkish bases for non-NATO training and missions. Turkish approval is required for U.S. use of Incirlik and other military installations for military operations in the region. Turkey has been diversifying its military relationships by cooperating with countries outside of NATO, such as China and Russia. This includes joint exercises and defense agreements. In 2010, Turkey conducted air and ground force exercises with China, using older F-4 fighter aircraft to address U.S. concerns about technology transfer. This signals a potential shift away from its traditional Western alliances. The U.S.-Turkey defense relationship has evolved over the years, influenced by various factors such as the 2003 Iraq war, Turkish political changes, and economic growth. Divergences in defense priorities and threat perceptions now carry greater implications. Efforts to leverage Turkey's strategic location between the West and Middle East may impact mutual benefits and leverage. Some officials and analysts believe that the United States may need Turkey more than vice versa due to Turkish economic and military self-sufficiency and the perceived decline of U.S. influence globally. However, others argue that Turkey's leverage over the U.S. is exaggerated, as it depends on delivering outcomes that serve U.S. interests. The potential for a non-NATO alliance to provide Turkey with comparable security is uncertain. Turkey may seek a potential non-NATO alliance to gain security guarantees, regional influence, and collaborative military benefits. This could allow Turkey to take a more proactive role in shaping processes and outcomes in response to regional and international changes. The current U.S.-Turkish defense cooperation reflects shared interests in maintaining regional stability through counterterrorism efforts and participation in missions like ISAF in Afghanistan. Turkey's agreement to a NATO ballistic missile defense system is driven by concerns about stability, including potential threats from Iran. Turkey's decision on hosting a proposed U.S. BMD radar under NATO auspices will depend on its perceived impact on stability and neighboring countries. The future of U.S.-Turkey defense cooperation will be influenced by mutual perceptions of the bilateral relationship, including Turkey's policies towards Israel and Iran, and possible action related to an Armenian genocide resolution by Members of Congress. The availability of Turkish bases for U.S./NATO operations is valuable but the importance and alternatives need further analysis. The decline of Turkish military influence could impact relations managed between DOD and Turkish General Staff. Turkey's diversification of defense contacts suggests a move towards greater autonomy and neutrality in international stance. Turkey's strategic orientation is shifting towards a more neutral international stance, aiming for greater autonomy and neutrality. They want to be important players in regional politics, have shown willingness to defy the US, and have industrial plans for strategic autonomy. Turkey aims for strategic autonomy in its military production and procurement, seeking advanced technologies from global suppliers like the US. Despite changes in the US-Turkey defense relationship, cooperation on security issues remains crucial for both countries. During the Cold War era, U.S.-Turkey defense cooperation began after Turkey declared war on Germany and Japan to become a founding member of the United Nations. The U.S. battleship U.S.S. Missouri arrived in Istanbul harbor in April 1946 as Turkey sought protection from Soviet Union threats on its territory and naval access through the Bosporus and Dardanelles Straits. Turkey solidified its role as a Western ally after President Harry Truman pledged economic and military assistance in 1947. Turkey joined NATO in 1952 after gaining a reputation as a reliable ally during the Korean War. The United States established over 30 defense-related installations in Turkey with thousands of personnel. In 1959, the U.S. stationed Jupiter ballistic missiles in Turkey, which were later removed as part of a deal with the Soviet Union. The U.S. provided Turkey with military assistance from 1948 to 1975 to modernize its armed forces. The U.S.-Turkey defense relationship faced complications during the Cold War, particularly regarding Cyprus in the 1960s and 1970s. President Lyndon Johnson's letter to Turkish Prime Minister Ismet Inonu may have prevented Turkish intervention on the island in 1964. Turkey's military assistance from the U.S. faced challenges during the Cold War, notably during the Cyprus conflict in the 1960s and 1970s. The alliance was strained when Turkey intervened in Cyprus in 1974, leading to a U.S. embargo on military aid. However, relations improved in 1980 with a new agreement after geopolitical shifts. U.S. military aid to Turkey increased significantly from 1987 to 1992, allowing for the modernization of Turkey's weapons systems. Turkey and Greece had a military assistance ratio of 7-to-10, with Turkey receiving more but wanting a greater advantage. Turkey joined the CFE Treaty in 1990 to limit conventional forces in Europe, but Russia suspended compliance in 2007. Turkey's disagreements with other parties over force posture in sensitive areas, such as the northeastern Turkish border in Georgia and Russia's North Caucasian periphery, have been a point of contention. In the post-Cold War era, Turkey played a significant role in the 1991 Gulf War by allowing the U.S.-led coalition to use its bases for air strikes on Iraqi territory. This decision, along with the amassing of troops on Iraq's northern border, helped draw Iraqi troops away from the southern front. However, there were tensions between military and civilian leadership, as seen when the Chief of the Turkish General Staff resigned due to disagreement with involving Turkey in the war. Turkey's geostrategic importance to the United States and NATO increased after the Gulf War, leading to a phase-out of grant aid to the Turkish military. However, after the 9/11 attacks, Turkey became crucial for potential U.S.-led military operations in the region due to its willingness to allow the use of its air bases for military action in Iraq since 1991. The George W. Bush Administration sought permission to station U.S. ground troops at Turkey's border with Iraq for the 2003 Iraq war. The Turkish Parliament failed to approve the request despite promises of $24 billion in U.S. aid and loan guarantees. The Turkish Parliament's 2003 decision on Iraq led to serious U.S. displeasure with its Turkish ally. Analysts suggest that the request for a ground invasion from Turkey in 2003 was more extensive than in 1991, and the benefits Turkey received for its cooperation in the previous war were less than expected. Turkey was skeptical of the U.S. and international aid received in 1991, questioning if it was worth the costs incurred in reduced trade, regional destabilization, and emboldening Kurdish separatists. Hopes for economic, political, and security integration with Europe were frustrated by NATO's tepid response and uncertainty over EU membership prospects. Turkey's strides since the 1991 war to increase economic and military self-sufficiency reduced its dependence on U.S. assistance. Despite Turkey's refusal to facilitate the invasion, the U.S. ensured Turkey's vital interests were protected and reinstated financial aid. The US officials realized they did not want to strain relations with Turkey, despite disappointment. Turkey allowed US overflights into Iraq and use of Turkish bases for troop rotations after the 2003 decision. Resumption of PKK attacks in Turkey post-2003 invasion led to counterterrorism efforts in northern Iraq. Since 2003, countering terrorism from PKK's northern Iraqi safe havens has become a core Turkish security concern, leading to tensions with the US. Turkey has received direct US cooperation in countering the PKK and aims to enhance its counterterrorism capabilities. US military and security assistance to Turkey has primarily consisted of IMET, INCLE, and NADR funds since FY2010, with $75 million of unobligated FMF funds held by DOD for potential future use. Turkey and the United States have a history of defense industry cooperation, with Turkey developing an indigenous defense industry that has become a major supplier in the region. Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) was formed in 2005, emphasizing the state's focus on boosting its defense production capacity. Turkey has a strong defense industry with key firms like Aselsan, Roketsan, and Otokar specializing in electronics, missile technology, and land-based vehicles. The country aims for 50% indigenous defense production by 2010, with a focus on obtaining offsets in procurement agreements. This strategy can conflict with U.S. arms export laws, making it challenging for American firms to secure contracts. Turkey's defense industry aims for 50% indigenous production by 2010, focusing on offsets in procurement agreements. U.S. firms face challenges due to technology restrictions, leading Turkey to seek suppliers perceived as more flexible. Recent tenders include the purchase of \"T129\" helicopters for $2.7 billion, with TAI as the primary contractor to promote Turkish self-reliance. Turkey sought off-the-shelf U.S. Apache or Cobra helicopters, but U.S. firms were excluded from the bidding process. After a test aircraft crash delayed delivery, Turkey purchased nine Mangustas from AgustaWestland for $209 million. Sikorsky Aircraft and AgustaWestland are competing to sell Turkey 109 utility helicopters for $4 billion. TAI would be the prime contractor for both deals. Turkey is considering purchasing utility helicopters to replace its aging fleet, with AgustaWestland and Sikorsky competing for the contract. The Defense Industry Executive Committee may decide on the tender by March 2011. Additionally, Turkey plans to purchase 10 Airbus A400M transport planes, with a final contract signed in April 2011. Saudi Arabia has agreed to sell Turkey six older model C-130s as an interim solution. Turkey will acquire six Type 214 submarines from Germany's Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft to replace its aging Atilay-class Type 209 submarines. Russia's Rosoboronexport will deliver 800 Kornet-E anti-tank missile systems to Turkey as a temporary measure while Turkish firm Roketsan develops its own system. Saudi Arabia has agreed to sell Turkey six older model C-130s to meet its interim needs. Turkey will acquire six Type 214 submarines from Germany's Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft (HDW) and MarineForce International (MFI) under a $3.96 billion contract signed in July 2009. Turkish industrial participation is expected to reach about 80% of the contract, with aspirations for indigenous defense capabilities in large drone aircraft and missile defense systems. Turkey seeks to acquire equipment in the near term to develop a knowledge base for indigenous design and production. Turkey's indigenous defense capabilities are growing, with increased exports of Turkish arms driven by external demand. Turkish industries have exported various platforms including missiles, rocket launchers, vehicles, electronic systems, and pilot simulators. These exports have generated income for Turkey's defense industry, allowing for the development of production bases and R&D institutions. Recent destinations for Turkish defense materiel include the Netherlands, Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates, South Korea, Algeria, and Bahrain. In June 2008, Turkey's Foreign Trade Minister highlighted the Asia Pacific region as a potential target for defense sales. Turkey was the world's 10th largest arms importer in 2009. A promotional office affiliated with Turkey's procurement agency opened near Washington, DC in 2010, with plans for similar offices in Europe, the Persian Gulf, and the Caucasus and Central Asia."
