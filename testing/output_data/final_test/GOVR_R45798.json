    "content": "Beneficial ownership refers to the natural person or persons who invest in, control, or reap gains from an asset, such as a bank account, real estate property, company, or trust. The United States has been criticized for gaps in the anti-money laundering system related to a lack of systematic beneficial ownership disclosure, especially concerning the use of \"shell companies\" to anonymously purchase assets and move money. Recent U.S. regulatory steps and legislation focus on beneficial ownership disclosure to combat crimes like money laundering. Law enforcement and financial institutions seek this information to identify individuals benefiting from financial assets held by legal entities. Criminals use shell companies to obscure ownership for illicit purposes. Criminals use shell companies, or \"nominal legal entities,\" to anonymously store and transfer illicit proceeds, relying on third-party nominees to conceal beneficial ownership. Many jurisdictions lack policy measures for beneficial ownership disclosure, hindering financial crime investigations. The absence of accurate beneficial ownership information hampers AML/CFT efforts, leading to pressure on the US to tighten disclosure requirements. Recent actions by regulators and increased congressional interest address this issue. High-profile cases highlight obscured beneficial ownership, especially in corporate formation. The report provides an overview of beneficial ownership issues in corporate formation and real estate transactions, recent history of policy and legislation, U.S. regulatory changes, current policy issues, international efforts, and legislative proposals in the 116th Congress. Focus is on the use of shell companies for anonymous asset purchases and money movement. FATF estimates over 30 million legal persons exist in the US, with 2 million new entities created annually. Legal persons include corporations, LLCs, partnerships, and trusts. FATF recommends transparency in identifying beneficial owners for legal persons and arrangements. Legitimate reasons for creating entities include risk diversification, tax purposes, and asset protection. Legal persons and arrangements are created for various reasons such as risk diversification, tax purposes, and asset protection. However, they can also be used for illicit activities like money laundering and corruption. FATF recommends maintaining accurate information on beneficial owners to prevent financial crimes. In the US, corporations, LLCs, and partnerships are formed at the state level, with varying laws and the option to choose the incorporating state. Corporate formation agents, who may not always be attorneys, assist in filing required paperwork. Most states have basic requirements for forming a corporation, including filing articles of incorporation with the secretary of state. These articles typically include the corporation's name, business purpose, registered agent, and address for legal service. States do not always verify beneficial owner information, allowing promoters to choose states with fewer disclosure requirements. The FATF found that the US lacks adequate measures to prevent misuse of legal entities. The United States has inadequate arrangements for recording or verifying beneficial ownership information during corporate formation, making it attractive for money laundering and terrorism financing. International criminals can anonymously form shell companies in the US, leveraging the country's global credibility to conduct business or open bank accounts outside the US. In the United States, real estate transactions are private contracts, with the federal government playing a minimal role. Buyers often finance purchases with mortgages, while some opt for \"all-cash\" transactions. Ownership of land involves public and private aspects, such as urban planning and tax consequences. In real estate transactions in the United States, approximately 23% of sales were all-cash in 2017. For New York state, the figure was 46% in 2016. Escrow agents act as neutral middlemen, holding funds temporarily for either side. They may look at LLC operating agreements to identify authorized signatories but have no duty to locate beneficial owners. Title insurance companies, like the American Land Title Association (ALTA), represent agents and companies in real estate transactions. They provide insurance to protect buyers from financial loss due to undiscovered defects in property titles. Before offering coverage, these companies investigate the property's history by examining public records. Title insurance companies conduct title searches by examining public records to trace a property's history, owners, sales, and property rights. This investigation includes tax and court records to determine insurability. Title insurers comply with money laundering requirements through FinCEN's Geographic Targeting Orders (GTOs), collecting beneficial ownership information for real estate transactions in certain metropolitan areas. The lack of AML requirements on real estate professionals poses a vulnerability for the United States, as highlighted in the FATF 2016 evaluation. FinCEN exempted the real estate sector from AML requirements under the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001. The New York Times found that LLCs with anonymous owners were increasingly used in luxury property purchases. In 2014, over 80% of units in the Time Warner building were bought by shell companies. Nationwide, nearly half of residential purchases over $5 million were made by shell companies. In 2017, 30% of high-end purchases in six areas involved a beneficial owner linked to a previous suspicious activity report. A 2017 GAO study found that GSA leased high-security space from foreign owners in 20 buildings, with 36% having unidentified beneficial owners. An example in the Appendix shows how LLCs with hidden owners can buy U.S. real estate with minimal transparency. The U.S. government has recognized the lack of accurate beneficial ownership information in creating legal entities as a vulnerability in the financial system. Reports from GAO and the U.S. Department of the Treasury highlight challenges in collecting beneficial owner data and identify the misuse of legal entities as a key vulnerability in the banking and securities sectors. Pressure from domestic and international entities, including FATF, has urged the United States to strengthen its AML/CFT regime. The FATF has pressured the U.S. to improve its AML/CFT regime by disclosing beneficial ownership information to combat money laundering. This gap in the U.S. system hinders law enforcement's ability to access crucial information during investigations and respond to foreign requests. In contrast, the EU has enacted laws requiring member states to share beneficial ownership information. Legislation addressing this issue has been introduced since the 110th Congress. Legislation has been introduced since the 110th Congress to address concerns over the lack of beneficial ownership disclosure requirements. Senator Carl Levin introduced the Incorporation Transparency and Law Enforcement Assistance Act in response to deficiencies in the National Association of Secretaries of State's proposal. Federal legislation is needed to address the issue of legal entities masking the identity of criminals by setting minimum standards for obtaining beneficial ownership information and bringing the U.S. into compliance with international commitments. Bills such as the True Incorporation Transparency for Law Enforcement Act and the Corporate Transparency Act have been considered in Congress. The Corporate Transparency Act of 2019, introduced in the House and Senate, aims to address money laundering risks by requiring beneficial ownership information disclosure. Various federal tools, including Treasury's CDD rule and economic sanctions programs, are utilized for this purpose. International cooperation for sharing beneficial ownership information is also highlighted. The Corporate Transparency Act of 2019 aims to address money laundering risks by requiring beneficial ownership information disclosure. FinCEN administers regulations under the Bank Secrecy Act to establish AML programs, with the Customer Due Diligence Rule as a key response to concerns about beneficial ownership transparency. Under the Customer Due Diligence (CDD) Rule, certain U.S. financial institutions must identify and verify the beneficial owners of legal entities opening new accounts. This rule applies to institutions with AML programs, such as banks, securities brokers, mutual funds, and commodities brokers. Covered institutions must collect identifying information on individuals owning 25% or more of legal entities opening new accounts. The CDD Rule also mandates the development of customer risk profiles and ongoing monitoring for suspicious transactions. FinCEN can impose additional recordkeeping and reporting requirements on domestic financial institutions. The authority to impose Geographic Targeting Orders (GTOs) on domestic financial institutions and nonfinancial businesses in a specific area helps regulators and law enforcement identify criminal activity. GTOs, dating back to 1988, can last up to 180 days and may be extended by FinCEN. Recent legislation broadened the scope of GTOs to include wire transfers and address beneficial ownership disclosure in real estate transactions. Section 311 of the USA PATRIOT Act added a provision to the Bank Secrecy Act. The USA PATRIOT Act added Section 311 to the Bank Secrecy Act, allowing the Treasury Secretary to impose special measures on foreign entities involved in money laundering. The second special measure requires domestic financial institutions to collect beneficial ownership information for accounts held by foreign individuals. FinCEN has not proposed or imposed special measures for collecting beneficial ownership information, which is valuable for economic sanctions administered by OFAC. OFAC may designate additional persons, including shell and front companies, associated with those already subject to sanctions. Sanctions apply to nonlisted entities owned by blocked persons, including those at least 50% owned by sanctioned individuals. Compliance with the \"50% Rule\" is required for financial institutions and others doing business with designated persons or sectoral entities. The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) is a U.S. policy tool to combat tax evasion by requiring disclosure of financial assets held overseas by U.S. taxpayers. It also mandates foreign financial institutions to disclose information to the IRS regarding customers who are U.S. persons or hold a substantial ownership interest in foreign entities. Foreign financial institutions that do not comply with FATCA reporting requirements face a 30% withholding tax rate on U.S.-sourced payments. Intergovernmental agreements negotiated by the U.S. allow foreign financial institutions to rely on existing AML practices for determining U.S. person control. The U.S. government committed to reciprocal automatic information exchange on U.S. financial accounts held by taxpayers of foreign jurisdictions, but there is no reciprocity in FATCA. Observers have debated the disclosure of legal entity ownership information to the IRS. Section 2876 of the NDAA requires the Defense Department to identify beneficial owners of covered entities leasing high-security office space for military use. Prior to this, the GSA did not track beneficial owners, including foreign owners, of such spaces leased to agencies like the FBI and DEA. GSA started implementing a new lease requirement in April 2018. The 116th Congress is considering H.R. 392, the Secure Government Buildings from Espionage Act of 2019, which aims to expand the scope of the FY2018 NDAA's provisions regarding beneficial ownership disclosure. The policy debate focuses on addressing gaps in the U.S. AML regime and evaluating risks associated with lack of beneficial ownership information in corporate formation and real estate sectors. The Treasury's current CDD rule requires financial institutions to collect information on beneficial owners holding more than 25% of an entity. Some legislative proposals suggest collecting beneficial ownership information for legal entities upon formation and reporting it to authorities. Critics argue that gaps remain in U.S. financial transparency requirements, such as the 25% ownership threshold under the current CDD rule. The FinCEN rule does not allow entities to name or identify their beneficial owners, except for one management official. FATF has criticized the US for lacking beneficial ownership requirements in corporate formation and real estate transactions. Legislation has been introduced to address these gaps. Third-party service providers like company formation agents can help shield beneficial owners' identities from law enforcement. Formation agents handle a significant portion of new company formations in the US, but are not regulated by federal AML laws. States have been criticized for inadequate oversight of the industry, leading to legislative proposals for increased regulation. Policymakers are considering making FinCEN's GTOs targeting money laundering in real estate permanent. Legislation like the Defending American Security from Kremlin Aggression Act of 2019 may require more transparency in beneficial ownership. The Security from Kremlin Aggression Act of 2019 (S. 482) and the COUNTER Act of 2019 (H.R. 2514) aim to increase transparency in real estate transactions by requiring reporting on beneficial owners. Additionally, the USA PATRIOT Act requires financial institutions to establish AML programs, with certain exemptions granted by FinCEN in 2002. In 2002, FinCEN exempted certain financial institutions, including those in real estate, from AML requirements to study the impact. In 2017, FinCEN warned about money laundering risks in real estate. In 2018, FinCEN planned to issue an ANPRM to establish BSA requirements for real estate closings and settlements. To register an aircraft in the United States with the FAA, applicants must certify their U.S. citizenship. Non-U.S. citizens can register through a trust agreement with an American trustee. Lack of beneficial ownership transparency in aircraft registered through noncitizen trusts has raised concerns about drug traffickers, kleptocrats, and sanctions evaders operating such aircraft. Legislation like H.R. 393 aims to address this issue by requiring the FAA to collect identifying information of beneficial owners, including nationality. The United States is looking to address beneficial ownership transparency for entities registering aircraft, following concerns about money laundering and corruption. International efforts are being made to tackle the issue, with some countries like the United Kingdom taking steps to improve transparency. Some countries, including the United Kingdom, have public registers for beneficial owners of companies. The European Parliament adopted the Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive, requiring EU member states to maintain national registers of beneficial ownership information. The European Commission is assessing third-country jurisdictions for AML/CFT deficiencies, including the availability of accurate beneficial ownership information. The Commission proposed a list of countries with AML/CFT deficiencies, including U.S. territories lacking beneficial ownership disclosure. The LEI system was developed to address opacity in financial risks highlighted during the 2008 crisis, such as difficulties in assessing exposure to Lehman Brothers' subsidiaries. The LEI system was created in 2009 by the Financial Stability Board and G-20 to assign a unique 20-digit identifying number to legal entities for tracking financial transactions globally. This system helps in identifying distinct entities involved in various financial activities like capital markets, derivatives transactions, commercial lending, and customer ownership. The Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) system was created in 2009 to assign a unique 20-digit identifying number to legal entities for tracking financial transactions globally. It helps in identifying entities involved in financial activities like capital markets, derivatives transactions, commercial lending, due diligence, and risk management for conglomerates. The LEI enables risk managers and regulators to identify parties to financial transactions instantly and precisely, providing benefits for financial transparency. The lack of consistent, reliable automated identifiers is burdening the financial industry, leading to a need for a unified global identifier. The LEI system tracks financial transactions but could be a first step towards easily tracking ownership of affiliates. Over 700,000 LEIs have been issued worldwide, but usage remains largely voluntary. Some financial reporting aspects require the use of LEI, but it is not legally mandatory. The lack of broader adoption of a common legal identifier like the LEI is seen as a collective action problem, where all participants benefit if everyone participates. Academics suggest mandating the use of LEI in regulatory reporting to solve this issue. Universal adoption is necessary for efficiency in reporting entities and providing useful information for financial stability oversight. In response to issues with beneficial ownership information, lawmakers have introduced legislation requiring small corporations and LLCs to report their beneficial owners to the federal government. The Corporate Transparency Act of 2019 would mandate reporting of identifying information to FinCEN for both newly formed and existing entities. The Corporate Transparency Act of 2019 would impose reporting requirements on existing corporations and LLCs two years after FinCEN adopts final regulations. The bill defines beneficial owner as individuals with substantial control, ownership of 25% or more equity, or receiving substantial economic benefits. Reporting requirements are limited to small corporations and LLCs, exempting entities with over 20 full-time employees, more than $5 million in gross receipts, and an operating presence in the US. FinCEN would be authorized to promulgate rules under H.R. 2513. H.R. 2513 would empower FinCEN to enforce rules for timely reporting of beneficial ownership changes by corporations and LLCs, clarify \"substantial economic benefits\" criteria, update the CDD Rule, and penalize false information providers. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse introduced the True Incorporation Transparency for Law Enforcement (TITLE) Act, requiring states to adopt transparent incorporation systems within three years. The bill mandates reporting of beneficial ownership information by newly formed corporations and LLCs, with changes to be reported within 60 days. Existing entities must comply two years after a state's adoption of the system. S. 1889, like H.R. 2513, defines beneficial owner as individuals with substantial control or interest in a corporation or LLC. It applies to small entities and exempts those with certain criteria. The bill imposes penalties for providing false information and amends the BSA to include individuals engaged in certain activities. S. 1889 would amend the BSA to include \"any person engaged in the business of forming corporations or LLCs\" in its definition of a regulated \"financial institution,\" directing FinCEN to issue a proposed rule requiring them to establish AML programs. Foreign or U.S. buyers could purchase real estate with minimal disclosure by establishing foreign-incorporated LLCs or U.S. LLCs with only a \"registered agent\" disclosed. Foreign or U.S. buyers can purchase real estate with minimal disclosure by using foreign-incorporated LLCs or U.S. LLCs. Payments can be made through wire transfers from foreign bank accounts, or by opening a U.S. bank account. To obscure the actual buyers, payments can be routed through a law firm, adding an extra layer of information for law enforcement to access. When purchasing a property through an LLC, the buyer's identity can be obscured, making it difficult for law enforcement to obtain details. Payments are typically routed through a title company, which then distributes the payment to the seller's account. If the seller also hides their identity through an LLC, the individuals involved in the transaction may remain hidden."
