    "content": "The \"Cancer Research Fund Act of 1997\" establishes the Cancer Research Trust Fund under the Public Health Service Act. The Cancer Research Trust Fund is established in the Treasury of the United States, consisting of amounts credited or paid to the Fund as provided in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Secretary of the Treasury is responsible for investing the Fund in interest-bearing obligations of the United States. The Cancer Research Trust Fund is established in the Treasury of the United States to authorize the issuance of special obligations exclusively to the Fund at par, bearing interest at the average rate of interest of all marketable interest-bearing obligations of the United States. The Cancer Research Trust Fund allows for the issuance of special obligations exclusively to the Fund at a slightly lower interest rate than the average rate of all US interest-bearing obligations. These special obligations can be sold at market price or redeemed at par plus accrued interest. The Cancer Research Trust Fund allows for the sale or redemption of obligations held in the Fund, with proceeds forming part of the Fund. The Secretary of Health and Human Services annually allocates available sums to the National Institutes of Health for biomedical research. The Director of NIH can distribute these funds to various research institutes for appropriate research projects. The Director of NIH allocates funds from the Cancer Research Trust Fund for cancer research. The funds are to supplement, not replace, other research with Federal funds. Expenditures under this provision are limited if NIH's annual appropriation decreases from the previous year. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a new part for the designation of overpayments and contributions to the Cancer Research Trust Fund. This allows individuals to designate funds to support cancer research through the Trust Fund. Individuals can designate a portion of their tax overpayment (not less than $1) to the Cancer Research Trust Fund when filing their tax return. Spouses filing jointly can each designate one-half of the overpayment (not less than $2). Designation must be made at the time of filing the original tax return and labeled 'Cancer Research Fund'. The tax overpayment can be designated to the Cancer Research Fund when filing a tax return. Any overpayment designated shall be treated as refunded to the taxpayer. A clerical amendment is made to the Internal Revenue Code. Designation of overpayments and contributions to Cancer Research Trust Fund effective for taxable years after December 31, 1996."
