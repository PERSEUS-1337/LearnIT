    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Mandates Information Act of 2001\". Congress finds that before acting on proposed private sector mandates, it should carefully consider their effects on consumers, workers, and small businesses. Congress has often lacked adequate information on the costs of these mandates, focusing only on their benefits. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 increased awareness of intergovernmental mandates without affecting existing environmental, public health, or safety laws. Implementing this Act will enhance awareness of prospective private sector mandates without harming the environment or public health. Private sector mandates can result in higher prices, lower wages, reduced benefits, and hiring disincentives for small businesses. The purposes of this Act are to improve Congress' deliberation on private sector mandates by providing more information and ensuring focused deliberation, and to help distinguish between harmful and beneficial mandates.
