It oversees national and community service programs authorized by the National and Community Service Act of 1990 and the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973. Funding for CNCS programs continued through FY2018 under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, with a total of $1.064 billion allocated. The FY2018 funding for CNCS was $1.064 billion, a 3% increase from FY2017. The report summarizes NCSA and DVSA programs and compares funding levels from 2015 to 2018. The NCSA aims to address various needs and promote national service programs. AmeriCorps State and National Grants, part of the NCSA programs, were created in 1993 to address community needs such as tutoring, disaster response, and affordable housing. Volunteers aged 17 and older can serve full-time or part-time for 9-12 months, receiving benefits like a living allowance and health coverage. AmeriCorps members receive a living allowance, health coverage, and child care. They can also receive educational awards and loan forbearance for their service. Each state appoints a service commission to manage grant applications, and the National Service Trust provides educational awards. The Trust in the U.S. Treasury provides educational awards for AmeriCorps members, with a maximum award equal to the Pell Grant amount. Awards are prorated for different service terms, and members aged 55 or older can transfer the award to a child. AmeriCorps State and National participants can serve up to four terms. AmeriCorps State and National participants can serve a maximum of four terms of service. The National Service Trust provides interest payments on qualified student loans to recipients of AmeriCorps Grants and participants in NCCC or VISTA. NCCC focuses on short-term projects related to disaster relief, infrastructure improvement, and environmental conservation. Volunteer eligibility is for individuals aged 18 to 24, with a requirement to increase disadvantaged participants to 50%. The NCCC program allows participants to serve up to two years full time, with benefits including a living allowance, room and board, limited medical benefits, and an educational award. The program is administered by the CNCS, which has the authority to fund various activities. The Serve America Act established programs like the Social Innovation Fund, which leverages federal investments to support community solutions. Funding for the Social Innovation Fund is not included in P.L. 115-141. The Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) supports innovative initiatives and demonstration programs like the Call To Service, engaging Americans in community needs. The DVSA program, authorized in 1973, benefits students and communities through service-learning. The DVSA program, authorized in 1973, aims to foster voluntary citizen service to help the poor, disadvantaged, vulnerable, and elderly. Administered by the CNCS, DVSA programs include VISTA and the National Senior Volunteer Corps, with VISTA focusing on community service to eliminate poverty for individuals aged 18 and older who serve full time for up to five years, receiving benefits such as a living allowance, student-loan forbearance, health coverage, and training. VISTA members receive relocation costs, training, and child care assistance. They can choose an educational award or a lump sum stipend. The National Senior Service Corps includes RSVP, FGP, and SCP programs for individuals aged 55 and older. RSVP volunteers focus on community service in various areas of need. The RSVP program offers volunteer opportunities for individuals aged 55 and older to support children with exceptional needs. Participants can contribute up to 40 hours per week, with benefits including mileage reimbursement and insurance coverage. The FGP program also targets individuals aged 55 and older, focusing on mentoring children and teenagers, teaching parenting skills, and caring for infants and children with disabilities. Eligible participants may receive a stipend based on income and volunteer schedules range from 15 to 40 hours per week. The Senior Companion Program (SCP) offers volunteer opportunities for individuals aged 55 and older to assist homebound and institutionalized elderly individuals. Participants can volunteer 15 to 40 hours per week, with an average of 20 hours. Income eligible participants may receive a tax-free stipend, mileage reimbursements, and insurance coverage.
