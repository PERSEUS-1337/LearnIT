Congress acknowledges the historical importance of infrastructure planning in the United States, dating back to Albert Gallatin's report in 1808 and President Theodore Roosevelt's conference in 1908. These events laid the groundwork for future infrastructure development in the 19th and 20th centuries. In the 20th century, infrastructure planning in the United States was influenced by historical events in 1808 and 1908. President Franklin D. Roosevelt's investments during the Great Depression were crucial. Today, the US faces economic, environmental, and demographic challenges, including the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and accommodate a projected population increase to 420 million by 2050. Population and economic growth are expected to occur in interconnected metropolitan regions, linked by environmental systems, transportation networks, economies, and culture. The National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study Commission estimates that maintaining the existing transportation system will require $225 billion annually over the next 50 years. The American Society of Civil Engineers has given the Nation's public infrastructure a grade of D-minus, estimating a cost of $1.6 trillion over the next 5 years for repairs. The Nation's decaying water infrastructure, with over 72,000 miles of old pipes, poses a serious threat to water quality, health, and the economy of communities. Population growth and development will further stress water resources, leading to increased pollutant loads, flooding risks, diminished drinking water supplies, and habitat loss. Global warming will worsen existing water challenges and impact natural hydrology. The natural hydrology faces challenges such as extreme storm events, droughts, higher temperatures, changes in stream flows, and sea level rise. A funding gap of $300-400 billion over 20 years is identified for wastewater infrastructure restoration. An additional $250 billion over 30 years is needed for drinking water pipe replacement. Electricity demand increased by 20% from 1999 to 2009. The Nation's infrastructure requires significant investment to accommodate increased demand and electrical supply from renewable sources by 2050. The rural economy depends on transportation and communications networks to compete globally. Under-investment in public lands infrastructure jeopardizes conservation benefits. Existing infrastructure will reach capacity limits without new capacity in roads, rails, airports, and seaports. By 2050, smart growth building policies could reduce transportation-related CO2 emissions by 7 to 10 percent. A national plan is needed to overcome infrastructure challenges and unlock economic potential. Residents of walkable cities drive 26 percent fewer miles per day compared to those in sprawling areas. By 2050, overcoming infrastructure challenges will enable the United States to respond sustainably to future economic and environmental challenges. The \"United States Commission on Rebuilding America for the 21st Century\" is established by this Act, referred to as the \"Commission.\" The membership details are outlined in the following section. The Commission, established by the Act, consists of 17 members appointed by various officials including the Speaker of the House, the Senate majority leader, and several Secretaries.

Public hearings will be held in 50 congressional districts to facilitate a national dialogue on infrastructure needs. The Commission will consult with stakeholders and prepare a final report for Congress outlining the challenges and national vision for infrastructure investments in transportation, water, energy, public lands, and housing. Specific recommendations will be included in the report. The Commission's final report for Congress will contain specific recommendations on policies and investments to improve transportation mobility, streamline investment processes, enhance community health outcomes, conserve water, improve the electric grid, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and enhance public lands infrastructure. The final report will include recommendations on improving transportation, investment processes, community health, water conservation, electric grid enhancement, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and enhancing public lands infrastructure to accommodate growth without degrading environmental values. Model principles will be provided to guide future investments in transportation, water, energy, public lands, and housing infrastructure. SEC. 6. POWERS. The Commission has the authority to hold hearings, gather evidence, and obtain official data from government departments or agencies for the purpose of carrying out the Act.
