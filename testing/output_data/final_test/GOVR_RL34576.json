    "content": "After a major natural disaster, managing disaster debris is crucial for safety and recovery. Debris can include waste soils, vegetation, man-made structures, and personal property. The volume of debris can overwhelm a community, as seen in Hurricane Katrina (118 million CY), Hurricane Andrew (43 million CY), and the Northridge Earthquake (7 million CY). Proper and timely management of debris is essential for residents to return to a safe environment. Proper management of disaster debris post-natural disasters is crucial to prevent overburdening landfills and potential long-term environmental hazards. Hazardous waste may be mixed with nonhazardous waste during disasters, leading to contamination risks if not disposed of properly. Pre-disaster planning is necessary to divert debris through recycling, burning, or composting to avoid logistical challenges. This report addresses debris resulting from a \"major disaster\" or \"emergency\" declared by the President, discussing types of debris generated and the roles of federal, state, and local agencies in funding and physically removing debris. Disaster debris includes waste materials from natural disasters like earthquakes, tornadoes, fires, floods, hurricanes, or winter storms. Understanding the types and volume of debris is crucial for recovery efforts. Disaster debris varies depending on the type of disaster, such as flooding, earthquakes, or tornadoes. Challenges arise when different types of waste mix together, making disposal difficult. Typical debris includes municipal solid waste, soil, putrescibles, white goods, household hazardous waste, and construction and demolition debris. Disaster debris consists of various materials like drywall, plaster, brick, concrete, roofing materials, lumber, vegetative debris, vehicles, vessels, fuel, electronic waste, and more. Estimating the total volume of debris is crucial for managing waste effectively, determining landfill space, contract services, and handling hazardous debris. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers uses mathematical modeling forecasts to estimate debris totals based on factors like the number of affected households and vegetative cover in the area. Disaster debris management involves developing a plan before disasters strike, as recommended by the EPA and FEMA. Plans outline handling and disposal laws for different types of waste, specify debris storage sites, waste-handling methods, and evaluate debris management facility capacity and equipment. Disaster debris management involves evaluating waste management options such as recycling, waste to energy, and disposal, considering environmental concerns like landfilling and burning. Compliance with local, state, and federal regulations, including the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), is necessary. Other environmental laws like the Clean Air Act or Clean Water Act may also apply depending on how waste is managed. EPA oversees waste management under Subtitle C of RCRA. Under Subtitle C of RCRA, EPA enforces hazardous waste management standards for businesses generating waste above certain thresholds. Household and small businesses are exempt from these regulations, allowing them to dispose of hazardous waste in common garbage. After a disaster, unregulated entities may generate significant amounts of hazardous waste, posing a concern. Non-hazardous solid wastes are regulated under Subtitle D of RCRA. EPA sets criteria for solid waste management facilities receiving hazardous household waste and small quantity hazardous waste. Facilities receiving hazardous household waste and small quantity hazardous waste must adhere to EPA regulations under Subtitle D of RCRA. State and local governments are primarily responsible for implementing solid waste programs, with municipal solid waste landfills required to meet federal standards. Disaster debris often includes construction and demolition waste. In the event of an emergency, states have the authority to broaden the definition of construction and demolition (C&D) waste to include more debris generated after a disaster. This raises concerns about hazardous materials being disposed of in C&D landfills not equipped to handle them. It is recommended to separate hazardous materials like asbestos, lead-based paint, and PCBs from C&D waste before landfill disposal to prevent contamination. Reusing and recycling C&D waste can reduce disposal costs. Vegetative debris can be chipped or burned to reduce volume by up to 75% or 95% respectively. Regulations on air pollutant emissions may apply if burning is used as a waste-handling method after a disaster. Regulations on air pollutant emissions may apply when handling waste after a disaster. White goods and household hazardous waste must be separated and disposed of properly. Putrescible wastes must be managed quickly to prevent disease vectors. Electronic wastes contain hazardous materials like lead and mercury. Some putrescibles can be composted and rendered. Electronic wastes containing lead, mercury, and other heavy metals should be separated for recycling or proper disposal. Automobiles and boats can be recycled, but certain components like gas tanks, mercury switches, batteries, and tires need to be managed separately. Soils and sediments can be reused, but in agricultural areas, soil may be too contaminated for use on residential or agricultural lands. Federal agencies respond to debris removal after disasters in accordance with the Stafford Act, which allows for assistance to state and local governments overwhelmed by catastrophes. The declaration under the Stafford Act authorizes federal agencies to provide assistance for disaster response, including demolition of unsafe structures and debris removal. The National Response Framework guides federal authorities in situations where state and local resources are overwhelmed and federal assistance is requested. The National Response Framework (NRF) organizes federal departments and agencies into 15 Emergency Support Functions (ESFs) to provide necessary planning, support, resources, and emergency services. Two ESFs related to debris removal are ESF #3, led by the Corps, and ESF #10, led by the EPA with support from the Corps. FEMA plays a role in providing funding for eligible debris removal operations. FEMA provides funding for debris removal operations through its Public Assistance Grant Program. Eligible applicants can receive reimbursement for response and recovery efforts following a presidentially declared disaster. The debris removal work must be within the designated disaster area and the legal responsibility of the applicant. Activities must be in the public interest to qualify for funding. The disaster declaration will specify funding for debris removal operations, with the federal share being no less than 75%. States can request direct federal assistance from FEMA if they lack the capability to respond to a disaster. When a state lacks the resources to respond to a disaster, it can request direct federal assistance from FEMA in the form of a \"mission assignment.\" This work order directs another federal agency to complete specific tasks, such as debris removal from critical areas and facilities, hauling debris to disposal sites, managing debris sites, monitoring operations, and demolishing damaged structures. The state must demonstrate the need for federal assistance, and the scope of work must be clearly defined with quantifiable tasks. The Corps and EPA are the lead agencies for completing debris-related ESFs, with the Corps coordinating ESF #3 for public works and engineering. This includes right-of-way clearance, debris removal, property demolition, and coordinating disposal sites. EPA assists in managing contaminated debris under ESF #10. EPA, as the lead federal agency under ESF #10, coordinates disposal sites for debris clearance and manages contaminated debris. They work with other federal, state, and local agencies to collect, segregate, and dispose of waste, providing guidance on issues like burning debris and handling hazardous materials. EPA also retrieves and disposes of orphan tanks and drums, collects household hazardous waste, and manages liquid and semi-liquid waste under ESF #10. The Corps coordinates with state representatives for debris removal missions, while local agencies handle permits, disposal methods, and environmental regulations. State environmental agencies oversee environmental protection. State environmental agencies issue declarations of emergency after disasters, specifying debris removal operations. For example, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality allowed flooded homes in New Orleans to be disposed of in C&D landfills after Hurricane Katrina. Each state manages its own waste programs, including debris disposal sites. Challenges in managing disaster debris include handling large waste volumes and ensuring property owners can return and assist with cleanup. The logistics of managing disaster debris after a widespread devastation can be a daunting task. It involves coordinating debris removal, designating staging areas for waste sorting, and finding qualified waste haulers. Communities are advised to conserve landfill space by reusing and recycling debris, but this depends on available markets for materials. The speed of cleanup and rebuilding after a disaster may rely on how quickly debris on private property is removed. Federal funding for debris removal is typically not available for private property, but may be accessible if residents move debris to public areas. Residents are urged to separate waste to comply with waste management regulations. Debris management after a disaster involves separating waste to avoid hazardous materials mixing, which can pose long-term health and environmental risks. The presence of asbestos-containing materials in older buildings adds complexity to the demolition process. After a disaster, states will develop protocols for complying with asbestos requirements during demolition and cleanup. EPA will work with states to provide guidance on debris management, including segregating asbestos for proper disposal. FEMA, EPA, and the Corps offer resources to assist with federal funding, debris planning, and removal operations. Debris removal operations resources are available from FEMA, EPA, and the Corps, including guidance documents and fact sheets on disaster debris management. EPA's website provides links to various resources on debris management and planning for natural disaster debris. The Corps also offers a fact sheet on debris management."
