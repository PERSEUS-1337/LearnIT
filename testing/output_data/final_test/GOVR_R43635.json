    "content": "The technology assessment was conducted by Pennsylvania State University with contributions from various individuals under contract to CRS as part of a multiyear project on U.S. energy policy. The report, current as of 2013, was funded by a grant from the Joyce Foundation. The report funded by the Joyce Foundation assesses water procurement and management technologies for shale energy development in the US. Shale energy poses challenges to water quality and usage, amidst evolving technology and energy demands. \"Unconventional\" hydrocarbon resources, such as shale oil and gas, are being developed in the US using directional drilling and hydraulic fracturing (\"fracking\"). This technique involves injecting water, chemicals, and proppants into shale formations to increase permeability. The proppant holds the fracture open, allowing gas and oil to be extracted. The water used, known as \"flowback\" and \"produced water,\" returns to the surface with the oil and gas. The report discusses the challenges of managing produced fluids in shale energy development, including potential contamination of water resources through various pathways. The report addresses concerns about gas and fluid leakage at wells, particularly in shale development. It highlights challenges in well construction, wastewater management, and emerging water technologies for shale energy production. The focus is on water issues and technology development specific to shale energy, excluding water-related risks. The report focuses on well development issues in shale energy production, highlighting its impact on U.S. energy security and natural gas independence. Shale gas is considered a cleaner fuel compared to coal and oil, making it a potential \"bridge fuel\" to a greener energy future. The development of shale energy directly affects water resources due to variations in deposits' size, depth, and quality. Shale energy deposits in the United States vary in size, depth, and quality across different states. The Marcellus Shale is the largest potential resource of shale gas, located near energy-demand centers in the Northeast. Other significant shale formations include the Barnett Shale in Texas, Utica Shale in Ohio, and the Bakken Shale in North Dakota. These formations produce natural gas and oil, impacting U.S. energy security and water resources. Shale energy resources, such as those in the Eagle Ford Shale of Texas and the Monterey Shale of California, require hydraulic fracturing for extraction. This technique involves using water and proppant to increase reservoir permeability and maintain fracture width. The injected mixture, known as \"fracking fluids,\" is used to fracture wells for oil and gas production. To fracture a well, water mixed with proppants and additives is injected at high pressures to enhance formation permeability. The volume of fluids used can vary depending on the well type. Uncertainties in shale energy development are influenced by market structures, regulation, and public perception. The uncertainties in shale energy development are influenced by market structures and regulatory policies at various levels. Differences in logistics and pricing between shale oil and shale gas contribute to varying sources of uncertainty within the industry. Regulatory approaches vary among states with active shale energy industries, with evolving policies in areas such as air and water quality, water utilization, and land use. Pennsylvania and West Virginia do not have forced pooling in deep geologic formations, but may allow it in the Marcellus Formation. Regulatory uncertainty poses challenges for shale energy production, especially in natural gas transportation due to significant sunk capital investments in pipelines and LNG terminals. The uncertainty in natural gas transportation infrastructure investment in emerging gas shale plays is due to the need for stable long-term supply contracts and unknown future regulatory costs. Additionally, gaps between risks as understood by scientists, media reports, and the general public highlight the importance of science-driven policymaking, especially in addressing risks to environmental resources like drinking water quality. Public perception in many areas suggests that hydraulic fracturing of deep shale formations may pose threats to local drinking water supplies, despite the lack of scientific consensus. Regulators have found that shale energy well development can impact water quality, with evidence showing varying effects on property values near drilling sites. Studies have shown hydrologic connectivity between groundwater supplies and fracture zones, raising concerns about potential links between fracking and water quality issues. The Marcellus Formation's connection to drilling activities is under investigation by the EPA due to gaps in scientific understanding. Different types of hydraulic fracturing fluids are used depending on the formation's properties. Public concern and regulatory scrutiny have led to moratoria in some states. Water-based fluids, like slickwater, are commonly used in hydraulic fracturing, especially in shale formations due to their cost-effectiveness and performance. Water is transported to the well site either by piping or trucking, stored in various ways such as lined impoundments or steel tanks, and then pumped through a system of pipes, blenders, and valves along with proppants and additives for the fracturing process. Fracturing in shale energy development initially requires significant water inputs, with few freshwater requirements while a well is producing. Refracturing may be used to stimulate production after a decline, but it is uncertain if most shale energy wells will require this. Industry practices for water utilization, transportation, and treatment are rapidly evolving. Regional differences in water availability may impact shale energy development, especially in arid to semiarid regions. In arid to semiarid regions, water sources for well development are typically surface or groundwater. Surface water may require transport to the well site, increasing costs and impacts. Groundwater near drilling locations reduces costs and environmental impacts. Water quality must also be considered for compatibility with hydraulic fracturing. In shale energy development, water quality and source considerations are crucial. Projects in temperate regions like the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale have used a mix of water sources including municipal systems, industrial wastewater, and surface waters. In the Marcellus Shale, 73% of water used comes from surface water, while in the Eagle Ford Shale, 90% comes from aquifers. Figures illustrate constraints on surface water and groundwater availability based on current water use levels. Surface water supplies are intensive in some locations, with groundwater use exceeding aquifer recharge rates in certain areas like Texas. Groundwater depletion over a century for 40 U.S. aquifers is shown in Figure 4. While groundwater and surface water are common sources for shale energy development, there is interest in using other water sources. Concerns have been raised about the removal of valuable water resources from the hydrologic cycle due to freshwater injection into shale formations. The reuse of alternative water sources like treated industrial wastewaters or saline groundwater is encouraged for shale energy development. However, economic, regulatory, legal, and technical factors may limit their adoption. Using some wastewaters as a substitute for freshwater can help mitigate environmental damage and reduce freshwater withdrawals, but may pose liability risks. Management practices recommend considering non-potable water for drilling operations. The recycling of produced fluids for hydraulic fracturing has increased in Pennsylvania, with records showing a rise from 10% in 2009 to 90% by mid-2012. Brine-tolerant friction reducers have enabled fluid reuse without compromising well completions. Approximately 70% of Marcellus wells recycled some produced fluids for fracturing purposes, with recycled water making up 10-30% of the total fluid composition. In other states like Texas and Colorado, there is a growing trend of recycling produced fluids for hydraulic fracturing due to water scarcity. Operators in Colorado's Piceance Basin have reported 100% reuse of produced fluids, while in Texas, reuse percentages vary by shale play. The use of discharge from abandoned mine drainage (AMD) in hydraulic fracturing is limited due to technical, economic, and legal constraints. The proximity of AMD sources to development activities and the chemistry of the AMD must be carefully considered for cost-effective transportation and safe use. The use of abandoned mine drainage (AMD) in hydraulic fracturing is limited due to technical, economic, and legal constraints. AMD chemistry must be carefully considered to prevent downhole precipitation of metals that could cause fracture plugging and impede gas flow. Treatment or dilution may be necessary before using AMD to minimize these risks. Ownership and liability issues exist for AMD from abandoned mines, requiring treatment to drinking-water quality before release to streams under state laws like Pennsylvania's Clean Streams Law. One company has started a trial of limited AMD utilization in northern Pennsylvania, despite potential liability issues under state laws. Industrial wastewaters can be used in fracturing operations if water quality is compatible, with each source evaluated individually. Location of industrial wastewater in relation to drilling operations must also be considered. The use of treated municipal wastewater for well development in the oil and gas sector has been increasing. In Pennsylvania, there are three municipal treatment plants approved to provide effluent to the shale gas industry. Texas has around 30 facilities supplying water to the industry. Water management practices in shale energy development are evolving to improve operational efficiency, with transportation costs being a significant factor. The transportation of freshwater and produced water involves using innovative methods to increase cost-effectiveness. Surface water withdrawal intakes typically use centrifugal or submersible pumps installed at permitted points in streams, rivers, or lakes. Intake structures must be non-obstructive and include screens to protect aquatic life. Some designs are modular for safety during floods, while others are built into streambeds to reduce sediment loading. Groundwater supply wells can serve as intake systems for hydraulic fracturing operations, but challenges include aquifer yield testing requirements and low yields compared to surface water sources. Transportation of water and wastewater by truck is a significant cost for shale energy water management, with total trucking costs around $90 per hour and typical truck capacity of 100 barrels. A well located one hour from a freshwater source would require between 700 and 1,400 truck trips, costing $70,000 to $140,000 in transportation costs. The transportation cost for water in shale energy operations can range from $70,000 to $140,000, representing $1 per barrel. Costs increase with distance, with wells two hours away from a water source incurring $2.21 to $2.84 per barrel. Direct piping is used where operational costs are lower than trucking. Using pipelines for water transfer in shale energy operations can reduce transportation challenges and costs. Seneca Resources demonstrated that an 11-kilometer pipeline system saved 50% in water transfer costs for fracturing operations at 70 wells. Freshwater impoundment construction costs approximately $1 per barrel, making it a cost-effective water storage method. Temporary above-ground storage tanks and impoundments are commonly used in the shale energy industry due to their cost-effectiveness and reduced surface footprint compared to centralized impoundments. Vertical steel tanks, for example, can store up to 5 million gallons of water in a small area. Regional organizations like river basin commissions play a role in managing conflicts between different watershed user groups. Potential conflicts between watershed user groups such as agriculture, energy, and public water interests are regulated in 30 out of 31 states surveyed. Pennsylvania requires a water management plan for shale gas production, with decisions mostly made by river basin commissions. Louisiana recommends using groundwater from the Red River Alluvial aquifer for drilling, while Texas mandates permits for surface water withdrawals for oil and gas operations. Groundwater supply for rig operations in Texas must comply with rules. In North Dakota, the oil and gas industry accesses water through water depots that require relevant permits. The state can issue permits for access to surface and groundwater supplies, with limited access for declining aquifers. Interstate commissions like the SRBC and DRBC play a role in allocating freshwater resources. River basin commissions may have authority to ration water for shale energy development. River basin commissions, such as the DRBC, have authority to ration water allocations and impose restrictions on nonessential water uses. They regulate withdrawals, monitor water quality, and may establish moratoria on drilling in shale energy regions. Additionally, they have expanded research and staffing to address the challenges of shale energy development. During shale energy extraction, a significant portion of injected fluids may be returned to the surface before the well comes online. Flowback water, used in shale formation fracturing, transitions to produced water in natural gas wells. Produced water can have high total dissolved solids values, ranging from 13,000 to over 280,000 mg/L, with constituents like barium and calcium leached from the shale formation. During the production phase of a well in shale formation fracturing, flowback water contains constituents like barium, calcium, iron, and magnesium, along with dissolved hydrocarbons and radioactive materials. Proper storage and management of these fluids is crucial to prevent groundwater and surface water contamination. The concentration of salts in flowback water increases rapidly after well completion. The management of produced fluids, including flowback and produced water, varies widely by operator and location in the shale gas and oil sectors. Practices include injection wells for wastewater disposal in Texas and a combination of methods such as underground injection, surface disposal, onsite treatment, and blending for reuse in the Appalachian region. Surface disposal is a cost-effective option for managing wastewaters from shale energy wells. Proper management of fluids from drilling and hydraulic fracturing operations is a significant environmental challenge. Operators have improved practices by using advanced technologies like lining well pads, closed-loop drilling systems, and recycling fluids. Further enhancements in fluid management are expected as companies refine their processes. Continued improvement in fluids management practices is ongoing as companies refine operations to meet environmental challenges and regulations. New treatment and reuse technologies are being deployed for flowback and produced fluid. Deep underground injection wells are used for disposal of oil and gas wastewaters. Treatment and reuse technologies vary by operator and region, with cost being a key consideration. Some are exploring beneficial uses for waste streams. Some states are permitting the use of produced fluids like brines for winter road treatment instead of disposal. Identifying beneficial uses for waste materials is crucial for designing regulatory frameworks. Deep well injection is a common disposal method for oil and gas wastes, regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Oil and gas waste fluids, primarily produced waters, are disposed of in Class II injection wells in the United States. There are over 30,000 Class IId UIC wells in the country, with Texas hosting the majority. However, produced water recycling rates in Texas are low, while the Appalachian Basin has fewer Class IId injection wells. The Appalachian Basin has a limited number of Class IId injection wells due to a lack of suitable reservoirs and historical lack of need before shale gas emergence. Ohio had 180 active Class IId wells, while Pennsylvania had eight. Regulatory differences and policy issues affect well permitting. Key questions for shale energy development include projected fluid volume and long-term disposal capacity. Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection records were reviewed to assess this issue. The review of produced fluids records from mid-2009 to mid-2012 compared Marcellus Shale fluids disposal via injection wells to gas production. In the first half of 2012, 8 barrels of fluids were generated per million cubic feet of gas, with 1.1 barrels disposed of in injection wells. 97% of Pennsylvania's produced fluids were disposed of in Ohio injection wells. The volume of fluids injected into Ohio wells increased rapidly since 2008. Projections suggest a 5.2% annual increase in Marcellus Shale gas development fluids. Based on trends from existing data, Pennsylvania projects a 5.2% annual increase in Marcellus gas production, with various scenarios showing different volumes of produced fluids injected into UIC wells. Factors like natural gas prices and technological advancements can influence the management of shale gas produced fluids. The disposal capacity in Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and New York is a significant unknown variable. It is projected that 3.3 million barrels of Marcellus produced water from Pennsylvania alone will require injection well disposal by 2022, representing a 65% increase in injection well use compared to rates in 2012. Ohio has 179 injection wells, including 40 new wells, which have been able to handle an increase of approximately 6 million barrels annually over a decade. The disposal capacity for Marcellus produced water in Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and New York is uncertain. There are concerns about the ability to inject all fluids due to increased scrutiny on a possible link between injected fluids and earthquakes. Induced seismicity from wastewater injection is a potential issue, although minor earthquakes possibly induced by fracturing have been reported in the past. Seismicity can be induced by wastewater injection into deep rock units at high rates, regardless of regional geologic differences. Factors influencing this potential include subsurface stresses, presence of faults, porosity, permeability, and pumping rate. Induced seismicity has been observed in supposedly stable tectonic regions like eastern Ohio, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. Induced seismicity from wastewater injection has been observed in various regions, such as eastern Ohio, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. Earthquakes with magnitudes up to 4.8 have been linked to underground injection wells, like in the Dallas-Ft. Worth area and Youngstown, OH. Abandoned oil and gas wells in active shale energy extraction areas pose a risk of methane or fluid migration into groundwater. Abandoned wells, known as \"orphaned\" wells, are inactive oil and gas wells with no responsible party to plug and restore them. Plugging these wells involves using cement and other materials to seal them to prevent fluid migration. Regulatory standards for well plugging are in place in all oil and gas producing states. Pennsylvania has standards for cement quality and requires advance notice for regulatory personnel to witness proper plugging of abandoned wells. Many wells were drilled before strict regulations were in place, with the first well drilled in 1859 and plugging requirements issued in the 1890s. The state began regulating oil and gas wells in 1955, with permits issued in 1956 and 1963. The Oil and Gas Act of 1984 mandated the registration of all wells, leading to the plugging of nonproducing wells. Pennsylvania has documented nearly 34,000 preregulatory wells. Pennsylvania has nearly 34,000 preregulatory wells, with estimates suggesting the total may reach 200,000. Improperly plugged and cased wells can lead to methane migration, with abandoned wells linked to methane migration to private water wells. Orphan wells, like one in Tioga County in 2012, contribute to methane flux. Orphaned and abandoned wells contribute to methane flux to the atmosphere, adding to greenhouse gas emissions. Responsibility for managing these wells typically falls to state authorities like the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. The pace of technological advancements in water sourcing and management for shale energy development varies. Water management trends are influenced by disposal costs, regulations, and geologic conditions rather than just water scarcity. Regulations restrict wastewater discharge to surface waters, leading to a shift towards closed-loop water management systems that recycle flowback water. Emerging technology options are being explored to reduce the impacts of shale energy activities on groundwater and surface water resources, with research conducted by private industry in partnership with government agencies and universities. At the drilling, completion, and production phases of shale energy well life cycle, alternatives to conventional water-utilization systems are being implemented, including nontoxic fracturing fluid additives and alternatives to freshwater in the fracturing process. Innovative well and well-pad configurations like multilateral wells are also being used to reduce the total volume of fluids required. Innovations in shale energy production include closed-loop completions, nontoxic additives, and alternative fracking fluids. These advancements aim to reduce costs, minimize emissions, and comply with regulations. Continued deployment of these innovations is driven by project economics and regulatory influences. Some innovations, like closed-loop completions, are already common, while others require further demonstration and validation before industry-wide acceptance. Transparent reporting of chemical additives is already being implemented in some areas. Companies like Halliburton, Schlumberger, and Baker-Hughes are developing nontoxic additives for hydraulic fracturing fluids. Pennsylvania now requires disclosure of additives on the FracFocus website, following other states like Texas and Colorado. This shift towards \"green\" fracking fluids aims to protect workers and reduce environmental impact. Federal law does not mandate disclosure of fracking fluid composition, but the U.S. Department of the Interior has proposed rules for disclosure. The U.S. Department of the Interior has proposed rules for disclosure of additives in fracturing fluids used on public lands. States provide exemptions for proprietary chemicals considered trade secrets. Additives like biocides, friction reducers, and scale inhibitors serve specific purposes in hydraulic fracturing. Some additives are toxic and can reappear in flowback water. Industry leaders are working to eliminate certain additives to improve environmental impact. Industry players are testing and developing nontoxic substitutes for additives used in reservoir stimulation. Some alternatives come from the food industry. \"Green\" additives must match or surpass traditional fluids' performance. Carbon dioxide and other water-free agents like nitrogen, methane, ethane, propane, and butane are being considered as fracturing fluids. Nitrogen is inert and compressible, carbon dioxide is corrosive, and methane, ethane, and propane are noncorrosive. The use of carbon dioxide, methane, ethane, and propane as fracturing fluids, known as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), offers advantages such as limiting formation damage and enhancing natural gas extraction by increasing permeability. Carbon dioxide can also replace methane sorbed to solid organic material in shale, potentially boosting methane production. The use of carbon dioxide, methane, ethane, and propane as fracturing fluids, known as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), can replace methane sorbed to solid organic material in shale, allowing for carbon dioxide sequestration. This \"gas frac\" methodology has been successful in tight-gas sand reservoir stimulations, primarily in Canada. Benefits include reduced water use, flowback, and formation damage, with the ability to recapture gas flowback for reuse. However, using carbon dioxide and other gases can be costly compared to water. The use of LPGs instead of water for fracturing can lead to higher costs and potential safety and environmental issues. This technique involves using lateral horizontal wells to tap multiple shale horizons from a single surface well pad, reducing surface footprint and improving economics, but not necessarily saving water volume. Closed-loop systems, also known as reduced emission or \"green\" completions, are used in some U.S. gas shale plays to handle flowback and reduce gas leakage and flaring. These systems help minimize environmental exposure of produced fluids to reduce the risk of water contamination and air pollution. In regions with rapid hydrocarbon exploration, well drilling rates can exceed the industry's ability to bring gathering lines to individual well pads, resulting in a period of three to 10 days (up to 60 days) where produced fluids must be captured. During the initial period of three to 10 days (up to 60 days) after drilling in gas shale plays, produced fluids must be captured, stored, and disposed of. Natural gas is also released but may be flared to convert it to carbon dioxide instead of venting directly. Devon Energy focuses on closed-loop completions in the Barnett Shale, which benefits from existing infrastructure. In newer shale plays like the Marcellus and Bakken Shale, wells may be drilled before the necessary gas transport infrastructure is in place. The EPA has mandated \"green completion\" guidelines for onshore natural gas wells by 2015 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and volatile organic compounds. In North Dakota, during 2008-2012, 22% of all natural gas was flared due to lack of infrastructure for transport. Treatment technologies and strategies are used in shale energy development to reduce freshwater usage and disposal of produced fluids. Costs for treatment vary widely, from a few cents to tens of dollars per thousand gallons. New water treatment technologies are being developed domestically and imported from international companies. Recycling of produced fluids is increasing, especially in the Marcellus Shale play, to minimize shale gas reservoir damage. The increased reuse of produced fluids in shale energy development has led to the use of treatment technologies to prevent reservoir damage. High chloride levels and divalent cations can cause plugging in fractures, reducing production efficiency. Operators are utilizing brine-tolerant fracturing mixtures to minimize damage and allow for the reuse of produced fluids. In 2012, Pennsylvania had a high reuse rate of 87% for produced fluids in unconventional well development, compared to 72% in 2011. Other states like Colorado have even higher reuse rates, with reports indicating most produced water is reused. Texas has varying reuse rates by shale play, ranging from 0% to 5% in different areas. Recycling approaches include field management technologies deployed at drilling sites. The use of field management technologies and centralized treatment facilities for recycling produced fluids in the field offers advantages such as reducing transport costs, fuel use, carbon emissions, and potential accidents. Operators require technologies that effectively remove contaminants, have high recovery rates, low maintenance, small footprint, and operational robustness. Recovery and direct reuse of produced fluids for hydraulic fracturing involve blending return fluids with fresh makeup water. Blending return fluids with fresh makeup water for hydraulic fracturing involves allowing sediments to settle out in tanks, but suspended particles may remain. The advantage is low costs for storage and blending, but the water quality may be suboptimal. Direct reuse increases the risk of reservoir damage from suspended sediments or scaling agents. Filtration technologies range from bag filters to advanced micro- or nanofiltration. Sophisticated micro- or nanofiltration technologies can reduce multivalent ion concentrations in produced fluids for reuse. These technologies achieve high scalant removal efficiency, require low to moderate maintenance, and have high recovery rates (>90%), minimizing the need for waste disposal. However, they may increase costs due to power and operational oversight requirements. Waste from spent bag filters or reject waters must be appropriately disposed of. The treatment technologies for removing scalants from wastewater involve a chemical addition process to increase pH and use a coagulant to precipitate out sludge. The sludge is separated, collected, dewatered, and disposed of in a landfill. This process is effective but requires maintenance to adjust chemistry. Electrocoagulation destabilizes contaminants in water using an electric current. Electrocoagulation destabilizes contaminants in water by introducing an electric current through an electrolytic cell. The particles coagulate to form a mass, which can be combined with electroflotation for effective contaminant removal from water. Desalination technologies, such as reverse osmosis and thermal-driven methods, offer clean effluent production with high recovery rates. The primary disadvantage is the electricity consumption. Reverse osmosis is effective for treating fluids with low TDS levels, such as in the Fayetteville Shale or Woodford Shale. However, it produces a saline waste concentrate that requires disposal. In contrast, thermal technologies can handle higher TDS loads and are more broadly applicable in most shale plays. Thermal processes require pretreatment to soften water before treatment. Thermal technologies like MVR are used to soften water before treatment, with MVR being more energy-efficient and achieving up to 90% fluid recovery efficiency. Centralized treatment facilities use similar technologies for fluid management, with the choice between centralized and on-site treatment depending on cost considerations. During 2012, 17 treatment facilities in Pennsylvania treated Marcellus Shale wastewater for hydraulic fracturing, primarily using chemical precipitation. Two facilities had advanced desalination capacity. The total capacity was around 4 million gallons per day, with only about 15% of the waste going to centralized treatment. Transport costs can be significant depending on the location of the facility in relation to drilling sites. Approximately 15% of the waste from Marcellus Shale wastewater treatment facilities in Pennsylvania is sent for centralized recycling, utilizing only 11% of the existing plant capacity. The remaining 85% is managed in the field, with 87% of produced fluids recycled for hydraulic fracturing operations. The rest is disposed of through UIC Class II disposal wells. Emerging technologies for fluid disposal are being evaluated based on their advantages and limitations, mainly involving chemical techniques with semipermeable membranes. Emerging technologies for fluid disposal involve techniques using concentration gradients across semipermeable membranes. Electrochemical processes separate ions from water through ion-permeable membranes or conductive adsorbers with an electrical potential gradient. Electrodialysis (ED) utilizes anion and cation exchange membranes to separate ions. Electrodialysis reversal (EDR) is a process that uses periodic reversal of polarity to minimize membrane scaling and fouling, allowing higher water recoveries. Electrodeionization (EDI) combines ED and conventional ion exchange technologies, using a mixed-bed ion exchange resin to increase conductivity in nonconductive water. Capacitive deionization (CDI) is an emerging technology where ions are adsorbed onto surfaces. Capacitive deionization (CDI) is a desalination technology where ions are adsorbed onto porous carbon electrodes using a low-voltage electric field to produce deionized water. CDI is less prone to fouling compared to other membrane processes but can be affected by low-solubility inorganic salts and multivalent ions, requiring pretreatment. Ceramic membranes are used for produced water purification due to their stability in harsh environments. Pretreatment is necessary before using ceramic membranes, and they have lower energy requirements but higher capital costs compared to polymeric membranes. Research and pilot studies may increase the application of ceramic membranes in produced water treatment. Membrane distillation is a thermally driven separation process where only vapor molecules pass through a hydrophobic membrane. Membrane distillation (MD) is a unique process where vapor molecules pass through a porous hydrophobic membrane driven by vapor pressure difference. MD can maintain performance independently of feed solution TDS concentration, producing ultra-pure water at a lower cost. Forward osmosis (FO) is an emerging technology that treats wastewater without energy, using a draw solution to create a pressure gradient. FO membranes are dense, nonporous barriers similar to reverse osmosis (RO) and nano-filtration (NF). Forward osmosis (FO) membranes are dense, nonporous barriers composed of a hydrophilic, cellulose acetate active layer. The FO process involves a draw solution, such as sodium chloride, to concentrate the feed solution while becoming diluted. Energy is required to regenerate the draw solution, but waste heat can help reduce energy inputs. FO membranes can operate with a wide range of TDS levels in produced fluids. Reconcentrating the draw solution using reverse osmosis (RO) can produce fresh product water for beneficial use or discharge. Forward osmosis (FO) membranes can reject particulate matter and dissolved constituents, achieving high recoveries with low energy and chemical demands. Common shale energy water management approaches include trucking water, storing in impoundments, and recycling for hydraulic fracturing. However, these methods have limitations such as waste production and high fuel costs for transport. New approaches are being sought to make water and waste transport more cost-effective and environmentally friendly, including using lesser-quality water sources, piping water, modular storage, and fluid recycling. Chemical precipitation and mechanical vapor recompression are common treatment methods, with emerging technologies like electrochemical treatment and forward osmosis showing promise. UIC wells are heavily used for fluid disposal, especially in Ohio and Texas, with research ongoing to understand their long-term sustainability. Technological advancements in water management practices can reduce impacts on groundwater and surface water quality in shale plays. Fracturing practices that minimize freshwater use may alleviate water supply pressures in arid regions like Texas and the Rocky Mountain states. In the Appalachian region, water transportation costs to drilling sites can be high. Efficient wastewater management practices and less water-intensive drilling methods can help mitigate risks to water supplies. Adoption of less water-intensive drilling practices and technologies in the shale energy sector can benefit water quality by reducing erosion along access roads. However, water management issues will persist, as some freshwater will still be needed for shale energy production. The sector is increasingly recognized as a water consumer in regional water planning and allocation practices. Emerging technologies that minimize water-use intensity in fracturing will face challenges. Emerging technologies for minimizing water-use intensity in fracturing face challenges beyond cost, including public perception, transportation needs, industry hesitancy, and uncertainties about optimal fracking fluid composition. The production of shale energy involves challenges such as high sulfate concentrations in acidic mine drainage potentially causing metal precipitation and fracturing plugging. The uncertainty surrounding treatments to lower sulfate concentrations and their impact on oil and gas production rates requires further study. The mobility of drilling capital can lead to shifting regional development patterns and costs. Drilling rigs are moved to areas with higher economic returns, affecting the demand for fracking fluids. The demand for fracking fluids and wastewater management services in oil-producing areas varies due to the mobility of drilling capital. Fixed treatment facilities incur high costs for movement, but mobile facilities may be costly initially. Truck transportation will likely continue until mobile treatment costs decrease. Water management is crucial throughout the shale energy development life cycle, as fluids are continuously produced even after drilling and fracturing. Research focusing on shale energy production in a life-cycle and materials-flow context can help identify technologies to mitigate potential impacts on freshwater contamination and other stages of development."
