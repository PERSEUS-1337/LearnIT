    "title": "SB 671",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 4073.5 of the Business and Professions Code states that a pharmacist can only substitute a biological product if it is interchangeable and the prescriber does not specify otherwise. The pharmacist must record the specific biological product dispensed within five days electronically for the prescriber to access. An interoperable electronic medical records system, electronic prescribing technology, pharmacy benefit management system, and pharmacy record are required for entry into an electronic records system. If a pharmacy lacks access to these systems, communication of the dispensed biological product to the prescriber is necessary, except in specific situations. In no case shall a selection be made if the prescriber indicates \"Do not substitute.\" This does not prohibit a prescriber from marking \"Do not substitute\" on a prescription, as long as they initial it. For electronic prescriptions, the prescriber can also indicate \"Do not substitute\" without manual initials. Pharmacists have discretion in selecting alternative biological products, assuming responsibility for substitution. Prescribers are not liable for pharmacist's actions. The selected product must cost the same or less than the prescribed one. The section applies to all prescriptions, including those for individuals receiving federal assistance or Medi-Cal. Pharmacists must communicate any substitution of a biological product to the patient. The board must maintain a list of interchangeable biological products on its website. \"Biological product\" is defined as per the federal Public Health Service Act. The section defines \"interchangeable\" biological products approved by the FDA and outlines prescription requirements. It also allows for immunizations and utilization controls by insurers. The section outlines prescription requirements for \"interchangeable\" biological products approved by the FDA and allows for immunizations and utilization controls by insurers. No reimbursement is required by this act as it creates, eliminates, or changes penalties for crimes or infractions."
