The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) was a successful Federal program in American history, providing work for 3,500,000 unemployed young Americans through projects to develop and conserve natural resources. Projects included environmental clean up, erosion control, reforestation, and disaster response, contributing to the modern national and State park systems. An estimated 3,800,000 18-24 year olds are not employed or in school, with a 19 percent increase since 2000. High school dropouts face a high risk of incarceration, with 16 percent of young men without a diploma being incarcerated or on parole. The cost of incarceration is $40 billion annually. Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings stated that dropouts cost the nation over $260 billion. Spellings mentioned that dropouts cost the nation over $260 billion in lost wages, taxes, and productivity. Energy inefficiencies contribute to 50% of US energy use, with potential for a 70% reduction in electricity use through efficiency gains. Low-income households spend 17% of earnings on energy, highlighting the need for energy efficiency improvements. Young people can be engaged in retrofitting and weatherizing buildings to enhance energy efficiency. The Energy Conservation Corps aims to engage disadvantaged youth in retrofitting and renovating residential and public facilities to reduce carbon emissions. This initiative provides educational and economic opportunities while benefiting the environment and communities. Service and conservation corps have a proven track record in administering such projects. The Energy Conservation Corps, established in the Department of Energy, engages individuals aged 16-25, with at least 50% from disadvantaged backgrounds, in energy conservation projects to promote stewardship of the environment and lifelong community service. The Energy Conservation Corps allows individuals to enroll without regard to civil service laws, for up to 24 months. It provides opportunities for education and job training, while engaging participants in energy efficiency projects. Eligible applicants include supporting organizations accepted by the Secretary. The Secretary accepts applications from qualified organizations to establish and support Corps, with a focus on providing education and job training opportunities for Corpsmembers. The Secretary may set a cost per member based on required information. The Secretary provides flexibility in recruitment and retention outcomes for Corps serving disconnected young people. Alternative success measurements, such as growth models, are allowed. Training and technical assistance are ensured for the Energy Conservation Corps. The Energy Conservation Corps will receive training and technical assistance from a national nonprofit organization. Corpsmembers must be aged 16-25 and not have dropped out of school to join. Preference is given to disadvantaged youth. Projects related to energy conservation, resource conservation, and rural development are eligible for funding. The Energy Conservation Corps focuses on developing residential and public facilities to meet standards, conducting energy assessments for low-income homeowners, providing education on energy efficiency, installing renewable energy sources, and building alternative transportation routes. Preference is given to projects that align with these goals. The Energy Conservation Corps gives preference to projects that provide development, training, and practical work experience for young individuals in energy efficiency fields, instill a work ethic and sense of public service, are labor-intensive, can be initiated promptly, and offer academic or community education opportunities. Each project must be consistent with relevant laws and policies. The Energy Conservation Corps gives preference to projects that provide development, training, and practical work experience for disadvantaged youth aged 16-25. The Corps is authorized to accept donations for operating purposes. Disconnected youth are individuals aged 16-25 who are out of school, work, exiting foster care, or formerly involved with the court system. Qualified service and conservation corps offer meaningful work for individuals in this age group. Qualified service and conservation corps offer productive work opportunities for individuals aged 16-25 in infrastructure, housing, or transportation settings. Participants receive a mix of work experience, skills training, and support services, while also developing citizenship values through community service. The Secretary of Energy is responsible for overseeing this program, with $100,000,000 authorized for each fiscal year from 2009 to 2013."
