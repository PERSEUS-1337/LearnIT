    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature in California acknowledges the low compliance rate for Selective Service System registration, especially among males aged 18 to 26. Failure to register can result in federal penalties and loss of benefits, including student financial aid and employment opportunities. State law in California also mandates selective service registration for state student financial aid programs. The failure of young men to register with the federal Selective Service System has led to a loss of over $100 million in potential benefits in California. Many states have enacted legislation linking driver's license issuance to Selective Service registration to ensure compliance with federal law. The driver's license application process should be revised to allow male applicants aged 18 to 26 to consent to Selective Service registration. Section 12801.3 is added to the Vehicle Code, requiring an original driver's license application to include a statement and signature line for Selective Service registration for male applicants aged 18 to 26. Males aged 18 to 26 must register with the Selective Service System. Failure to register can lead to various consequences, including ineligibility for federal benefits and potential legal penalties. For males aged 18 to 26, registration with the Selective Service System is mandatory. Failure to register can result in loss of federal benefits and legal consequences. Alternative service information for those objecting to conventional military service is available on the Selective Service System website. A person applying for a driver's license and required to register under the federal Military Selective Service Act is deemed to have consented to registration with the federal Selective Service System. The application establishes a conclusive presumption of authorization for the necessary information to be forwarded for registration. The department will only forward personal information to the federal Selective Service System for registration if the person has consented. Information will be provided in accordance with a memorandum of understanding. If federal funding is provided, the department will implement this section by forwarding necessary personal information for registration in an electronic format. The federal Selective Service System will not share personal information with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The Director of Motor Vehicles will determine and declare compliance with specified conditions by June 30, 2016. The Director of Motor Vehicles must declare compliance with specified conditions by June 30, 2016, and provide copies of the declaration to various committees and post it on the department's website. The department must implement certain sections by January 31, 2017."
