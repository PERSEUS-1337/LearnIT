    "content": "Setting National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) is a core action of the Clean Air Act, applying to criteria pollutants that endanger public health or welfare. The EPA Administrator can add or remove pollutants from the list based on criteria. NAAQS do not regulate emissions directly but set standards for pollutant concentrations in ambient air to protect public health and welfare. In essence, NAAQS define what EPA considers to be clean air. The National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) are standards set by the EPA to define clean air. Once established, the EPA identifies areas that exceed the standards and require pollution reduction measures. State and local governments then create State Implementation Plans within three years to reduce pollution levels in these areas. EPA also enforces national standards for products emitting pollutants and emission standards for new stationary sources. The Clean Air Act mandates EPA to adapt to new research on pollution effects. The Clean Air Act mandates EPA to review NAAQS every five years and appoint an independent Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) to ensure scientific standards are met. CASAC has seven members from academia and private research institutions who serve for two consecutive three-year terms. Panels of experts are also involved in NAAQS reviews, with recent panels having 22-23 members. CASAC and the public make suggestions for panel membership, with final selections made by EPA. The Clean Air Act mandates EPA to review NAAQS every five years and appoint an independent Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) to ensure scientific standards are met. CASAC has seven members from academia and private research institutions who serve for two consecutive three-year terms. Panels of experts are also involved in NAAQS reviews, with recent panels having 22-23 members. CASAC and the public make suggestions for panel membership, with final selections made by EPA. The panels review the agency's work during NAAQS-setting and NAAQS-revision, rather than conducting their own independent reviews. CASAC panels advise the agency's staff on NAAQS reviews and issue \"closure letters\" on the agency documents summarizing the science and policy options behind the NAAQS. The closure letters indicate a consensus that the agency staff's work provides an adequate scientific basis for regulatory decisions. After issuing a closure letter, CASAC removes itself from the process, leaving the formal proposal and final choice of standards to the Administrator. In 2006, the NAAQS review process was disrupted by objections from CASAC regarding the Administrator's decision on particulate matter standards. CASAC took unprecedented steps by writing to the Administrator both before and after the standards were proposed and promulgated, stating unanimously that the action did not provide an adequate margin of safety to protect the public. CASAC challenged the final particulate decision for not providing an adequate margin of safety as required by the Clean Air Act. The ozone review panel also criticized the current primary 8-hr NAAQS and recommended a more stringent standard. Despite this, the Administrator proposed a revision outside CASAC's range and promulgated new ozone standards in 2008. The EPA announced in December 2006 a modification to the process for setting and reviewing NAAQS. Political appointees will now have a role in selecting scientific studies, and CASAC will no longer approve the Policy Assessment. CASAC will only comment after the paper is published, aiming to expedite the review process to meet the five-year cycle required by the Clean Air Act. The EPA made changes to the process for setting and reviewing NAAQS, involving political appointees in selecting scientific studies and reducing CASAC's role. This shift has raised concerns among environmental groups and the scientific community about the integrity of the process. CASAC's increased visibility due to recent events has sparked discussions about the role of science in setting air quality standards. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee held a hearing on the ozone standard on April 24, 2008. This report provides a history of the NAAQS-setting process and the role of CASAC since the late 1970s. Before the Clean Air Act of 1970, air quality standards were primarily a state responsibility. Congress began establishing the NAAQS-setting process in 1963 with the Clean Air Act of 1963 and the Air Quality Act of 1967. The Air Quality Act of 1967 directed the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to develop criteria for air quality to protect public health and welfare. The National Air Quality Criteria Advisory Committee was established to provide scientific advice. The criteria were initially meant to assist states in setting their own standards but now serve as the first step in establishing national standards (NAAQS). The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970 required the Environmental Protection Agency to establish National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) to protect public health and welfare from air pollutants. Primary NAAQS are set to protect public health, while secondary standards aim to safeguard public welfare. The Administrator was permitted to revise standards based on criteria set to protect public welfare. The Advisory Committee established by the Surgeon General in 1968 was transferred to EPA in 1970 but had no statutory authority. EPA reorganized its science advisory structure several times, ultimately abolishing NAQCAC and reassigning members to the Science Advisory Board (SAB). The Science Advisory Board (SAB) was abolished while drafting a final report recommending a review of air quality criteria documents. The House Science and Technology Committee's investigative report led to the requirement for the SAB to review scientific information for air quality standards. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977 added dimensions to the process of establishing National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977 added requirements for the review and revision of National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), including establishing a formal review schedule and appointing an independent scientific review committee. These amendments allowed citizen suits to enforce the Administrator's duty to conduct reviews. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977 mandated the review and revision of National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) at regular intervals. The amendments established a review schedule and appointed an independent scientific review committee, including the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC). CASAC is tasked with reviewing criteria and NAAQS, making recommendations to the Administrator, although the Administrator is not legally bound to follow their advice. Congress granted authority to both CASAC and the Science Advisory Board (SAB) to review air quality criteria and NAAQS in 1977. EPA resolved potential jurisdictional overlap by integrating CASAC into the SAB. The Administrator is required to explain any deviations from CASAC's or the National Academy of Science's recommendations. The Clean Air Act requires the Administrator to provide specific information on criteria pollutants, leading to the development of a Criteria Document and Staff Paper for setting or revising NAAQS. The Criteria Document summarizes scientific knowledge on pollutant effects, while the Staff Paper provides options for NAAQS indicators, averaging times, and numerical levels. The Staff Paper has no statutory basis but is essential for standard setting. Section 109 of the Clean Air Act outlines the process for proposing and promulgating National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) as regulations, requiring publication in the Federal Register. Section 307(d) establishes procedural requirements for NAAQS promulgation, including the establishment of a rulemaking docket, notice of proposed rulemaking, and a statement of the proposal's basis, purpose, factual data, methodology, legal interpretations, and policy considerations. The proposed rule must include a statement of basis and purpose, reference pertinent findings, recommendations, and comments, and explain any differences from recommendations. Drafts of proposed and final rules, along with accompanying documents and comments, must be placed in the docket by the date of proposal or promulgation. The promulgated NAAQS in the Federal Register must explain major changes from the proposed rule and respond to comments. The NAAQS standard-setting process has not followed the statutory timeline, with only one standard reviewed by 1980 and none at five-year intervals since. Reviews have often stalled, with priorities set by citizen suits. The Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) has played a key role in maintaining discipline in the NAAQS process. CASAC has provided discipline to the NAAQS process, setting high standards for agency reviews. Completed reviews have generally earned respect from the scientific community and survived court challenges. CASAC's role involves reviewing key documents prepared by EPA staff for NAAQS development or review, rather than conducting independent reviews. The Administrator typically waits for CASAC's consensus before proposing a NAAQS revision. The closure letter, not required by law, originated in a 1979 memorandum to CASAC. Until 2006, NAAQS reviews always had closure letters before decisions were made. In 2006, this practice changed, leading to opposition from CASAC members. Staff Papers offer a range of options, with the Administrator's choice usually falling within that range. In 1997, EPA revised the PM standard, with the Staff Paper recommending a 24-hour PM 2.5 standard between 20 to 65 \u00b5g/m3. The Administrator chose 65 \u00b5g/m3. The Staff Paper also suggested an annual standard of 12.5 to 20 \u00b5g/m3, with the Administrator selecting 15 \u00b5g/m3. In 1990, a Staff Paper on lead standard revision proposed a range of 0.5 to 1.5 \u00b5g/m3, but EPA took no action. The sulfur dioxide review in 1996 saw the agency deviate from Staff Paper recommendations. In 1996, the sulfur dioxide review saw the EPA deviate from Staff Paper recommendations regarding regulatory alternatives for the NAAQS. EPA retained the existing standard but did not address the augmentation issue. Reports and memoranda discussed CASAC's role and the standard-setting process after the 1977 statutory changes. The EPA's Office of Research and Development, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, and CASAC staff outlined procedures for the NAAQS review process, including six phases and estimated timeframes. Although a memo detailing these procedures was never formally approved, CASAC's review and closure on Criteria Documents and Staff Papers were based on its recommendations. In the 1980s, reports and memoranda discussed procedures for NAAQS reviews and recommendations for standard-setting processes. The National Commission on Air Quality and CASAC issued reports with suggestions for improving the NAAQS process. These recommendations have resurfaced in subsequent discussions. The NAAQS review process has seen recommendations for improvements over the years, including calls for shorter Criteria Documents focused on key scientific issues, increased public involvement, and the incorporation of risk assessment methodologies to address uncertainties. Discussions on changes to the process were minimal until December 2005 when a top-to-bottom review was initiated by EPA's Deputy Administrator. The EPA initiated a top-to-bottom review of the NAAQS process in response to calls for improvements. The review, conducted by the Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, focused on ensuring rigorous scientific standards and methods were being followed. Recommendations were made by a Workgroup of EPA staff, leading to further discussions with CASAC and a public meeting before a decision was announced in December 2006. The Deputy Administrator announced on December 7, 2006, that the Agency would revise the NAAQS process based on recommendations from a Workgroup report. The report highlighted issues with completing NAAQS reviews on time, the role of CASAC, concerns about EPA's science assessment documents, and support for a policy-oriented \"Staff Paper.\" The report recommended combining planning activities for the Criteria Document, risk/exposure, and policy assessment into one integrated planning document, restructuring the Criteria Document to be more concise and accessible to policy-makers, developing a continuous process for identifying new scientific studies, and creating a more concise risk/exposure assessment document. The report recommended combining planning activities for the Criteria Document, risk/exposure, and policy assessment into one integrated planning document, restructuring the Criteria Document to be more concise and accessible to policy-makers, developing a continuous process for identifying new scientific studies, and creating a more concise risk/exposure assessment document. This includes recommendations such as replacing the Staff Paper with a more narrowly focused policy assessment document and considering the formation of a CASAC subcommittee on risk/exposure assessment. The CASAC recommended convening a science workshop to identify new scientific findings regarding the pollutant in question. The EPA accepted this suggestion, leading to positive feedback from CASAC. Another potentially controversial change was the preparation of a separate risk/exposure assessment. The CASAC recommended a science workshop to identify new scientific findings on the pollutant. Another controversial change was the proposal for a separate risk/exposure assessment and the formation of a subcommittee. This could enhance the efficiency of the NAAQS review process, but adding another document may not improve timeliness, as noted by CASAC in a letter to the EPA Administrator. The CASAC Chair expressed concerns about the EPA's proposed process for NAAQS reviews, stating that it may not make the process more efficient or streamlined. The proposed process could lead to court-ordered completion dates being the main driver for key milestones in the reviews. The decision memorandum retained the recommendation for a risk/exposure assessment document. The Workgroup report recommended adding risk assessment experts to future CASAC review panels and suggested removing EPA staff and CASAC from the final review of the policy assessment document to reflect senior management views. The Workgroup report recommended adding risk assessment experts to future CASAC review panels and suggested removing EPA staff and CASAC from the final review of the policy assessment document to reflect senior management views. The December 7, 2006 decision memorandum reiterated the need for a policy assessment that reflects the Agency's views, to be published in the Federal Register as an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. This allows for evaluation by CASAC and the public, with an opportunity for detailed comments. The CASAC's role in the NAAQS-review process has been questioned, with concerns raised about the timing of their review of policy options. Despite CASAC's request to review both draft versions of the policy assessment document before the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the December 7 decision memorandum seems to have rejected this request. The CASAC Chair expressed frustration at not being able to provide input on the policy before its release. The CASAC's role in the NAAQS-setting process may be diminished, with EPA senior management taking on a more prominent role. The recommendation for a single integrated planning document would allow for early involvement of senior management in policy decisions. The new policy assessment document will be reviewed after publication, with changes suggested for CASAC's role in the review process. Recommendations include a single CASAC review, soliciting comments from the public and CASAC, and providing more guidance on CASAC's role to maintain the distinction between science and policy judgments. EPA may have a more prominent role in the NAAQS-setting process, potentially diminishing CASAC's role. The EPA may be considering changes to CASAC's role in the NAAQS review process, including improving transparency in panel selection and addressing concerns about CASAC's independence. Comments from current and former CASAC members highlighted the need to enhance Criteria Documents and reinstate the \"closure\" procedure. The need to improve Criteria Documents and reinstate the \"closure\" procedure was highlighted by commenters, with suggestions for enhancing the process. The EPA's February 2006 CD on ozone was praised as a model for future efforts. The \"closure\" issue, raised by CASAC members, emphasized the importance of finalizing decisions to avoid controversy. EPA's response to questions about a change in policy on closure indicated that there was no actual change in policy. The current CASAC chair stopped using the term \"closure\" to avoid implying approval of documents. Some CASAC members disagreed with this decision, expressing concerns about the impact on document quality. Dr. Morton Lippmann emphasized the importance of maintaining the integrity and credibility of the review process. Recent changes in SAB Staff management led to the discontinuation of issuing formal 'CASAC closure letters' for Air Quality Criteria Documents and Staff Papers, a decision that generated strong reactions among CASAC members. Dr. Joe Mauderly expressed concerns about EPA's decision to relegate CASAC to a reviewer rather than an approver, citing potential negative impacts on document quality. The move by EPA to relegate CASAC to a reviewer, rather than an approver, of documents is criticized for slowing the process. Dr. Bernard Goldstein expressed concerns that this decision undermines the scientific community's involvement in the EPA advisory process. CASAC attempted to resolve the \"closure\" issue by reverting to the original wording of the 1979 memo. The 1979 memo introduced the term closure, stating that CASAC should affirmatively state when science is adequate for rulemaking. Concerns were raised about EPA and CASAC not adequately considering public comments due to lack of submission deadlines. Dr. Roger McClellan raised concerns about too many teleconference meetings at CASAC. The poor quality of initial drafts from EPA leads to iterative review processes. EPA sought feedback on distinguishing scientific conclusions from policy judgments, with no clear consensus reached. Dr. Ellis Cowling and others believe CASAC should recommend new air quality standards, leading to a more active policy role. Dr. Wolff, however, feels CASAC has overstepped into policy territory. Dr. Rogene Henderson's comments fall between these views. Dr. Rogene Henderson, the current Chair of CASAC, emphasizes the importance of clarifying the line between scientific advice and policy issues. Dr. Joe Mauderly also points out the challenge of distinguishing between science and policy in CASAC meetings, where discussions often revolve around the impact of pronouncements on policy decisions. EPA's reluctance to clearly define how science and policy influence its standards proposals further complicates the issue. The current discussion highlights the challenge of separating scientific advice from policy issues in EPA decision-making. There is a call for greater transparency in how science and policy are integrated into proposed standards, with criticism and recommendations on the NAAQS process. Dr. Bernard Goldstein emphasizes the need for the Administrator to clearly articulate the influence of science and policy on decisions. Dr. Roger McClellan discusses the NAAQS standard-setting process and the role of CASAC in ensuring high scientific quality. Dr. Lippmann questions if the process can be strengthened, acknowledging that improvements can be made. The Clean Air Act establishes requirements for setting NAAQS standards, with EPA staff preparing reviews and Criteria Documents on criteria air pollutants. EPA's process is a result of agency practice and statutory requirements, including the role of CASAC in making recommendations to the Administrator. Under EPA's new procedures, CASAC's role in reviewing and approving EPA documents on criteria air pollutants is changing. The Committee will no longer approve policy Staff Papers with recommendations to the Administrator, and EPA's political appointees will have a more active role in the process. This change aims to speed up the review process, which has often exceeded the five-year statutory limit. The EPA's new procedures aim to speed up the review process of NAAQS, ensuring a five-year cycle as required by the Clean Air Act. However, concerns have been raised about the increased role of political appointees over EPA staff and CASAC in the decision-making process. Congress may need to address the statutory role of CASAC in approving the Administrator's standards choices. The Administrator must include findings, recommendations, and comments by CASAC when proposing new NAAQS. CASAC evaluates EPA staff's analysis and policy recommendations, ensuring accuracy in reflecting the state of the science. While EPA is not required to have CASAC's approval, it generally aligns standards with CASAC's recommendations to build a defensible record against court challenges. In 2006, the Administrator promulgated standards outside of CASAC's recommendations, leading to legal challenges from various groups. The role of CASAC in evaluating NAAQS standards and potential Congressional intervention is under scrutiny. Legal challenges to PM standards have been common, with courts often deferring to the Administrator's judgment on scientific matters. However, CASAC's objections to the process not meeting statutory requirements could impact court reviews. The ozone review in 2008 also saw the Administrator not following CASAC's recommendations. The new NAAQS review procedures may change CASAC's role, with expectations of future court challenges. The CASAC's role may change with new NAAQS review procedures. The committee had suggestions incorporated into a decision memorandum, addressing concerns about the old process. CASAC's Chair mentioned that members will provide comments to EPA simultaneously with the public. In early February 2007, reports circulated that CASAC had changed its mind about the new NAAQS review process. The committee was critical of the process, stating that EPA was skipping scientific considerations and going straight to options based on management views. CASAC Chair Dr. Rogene Henderson emphasized the importance of producing options based on science before EPA management makes recommendations for the standard. CASAC expressed concerns about the new NAAQS review process, stating that it did not allow for appropriate input to evaluate the science. Negotiations with EPA management led to modifications in the schedule to address some of CASAC's concerns. However, CASAC continued to express serious concerns about other aspects of the review. CASAC's concerns about the new NAAQS review process were outlined in a four-page letter to Administrator Johnson, highlighting significant problems in the latter steps of the review process. The absence of a Staff Paper, which provides thorough analysis and scientific evidence for standards, was a major issue. The Policy Assessment intended to replace the Staff Paper was found to be unsuitable and inadequate for rulemaking. The letter from CASAC criticizes the ANPR for being empty and regressive, contrasting it with the thorough scientific analyses in EPA's Staff Paper. It points out that the ANPR considers options already dismissed on scientific grounds, slowing down the review process. CASAC emphasizes the need for the policy assessment to be peer-reviewed in public advisory meetings, similar to the Staff Paper. The CASAC letter criticizes the ANPR for lacking scientific depth and revisiting previously dismissed options, slowing down the review process. It emphasizes the importance of peer-reviewed policy assessments in public advisory meetings, similar to the thorough scientific analyses in EPA's Staff Paper. Senator Barbara Boxer called the changes announced in December 2006 \"unacceptable.\" Senator Barbara Boxer and the Public Works Committee deemed the changes announced in December 2006 by EPA Administrator Johnson as \"unacceptable\" and made them a top priority for oversight in the 110th Congress. Congressional attention has shifted to other issues, but as reviews of PM, ozone, and lead standards progress, there may be further opportunities for congressional oversight, including the role of CASAC in NAAQS reviews."
