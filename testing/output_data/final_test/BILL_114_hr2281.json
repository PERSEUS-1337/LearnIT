The \"States' Education Reclamation Act of 2015\" emphasizes the importance of state authority in educational policy. It highlights that governance of schools is best done by parents, teachers, and communities, not by a federal Department of Education. The Act criticizes the Department of Education for weakening parental decision-making and community governance in education. The Department of Education's budget has increased significantly to $65.7 billion annually, overseeing numerous programs. However, education performance for 17-year-olds has remained stagnant since 1971. The Department is criticized for over-regulation, standardization, and high overhead costs, with public school teachers earning less than Department employees. In some states like North Carolina, public school teacher salaries are below the national average. In North Carolina, public school teachers earn an average salary of $45,737. Recent tests show poor results in math, science, and reading for American students compared to other nations. Initiatives by parents and local communities are needed to improve educational performance. The current top-down education system is harmful to local businesses, communities, and the nation's global competitiveness. The Department of Education has been resistant to reforms empowering parents, teachers, and communities. The education system in the United States, once a hub of innovation, is now moving towards standardization that overlooks the diverse educational needs of students. The Department of Education is abolished, along with programs under its jurisdiction, except those transferred under section 7. Grants to states for education programs are established. Each State is entitled to receive grants for elementary and secondary school programs and postsecondary education programs, equal to the amount appropriated in fiscal year 2012, through fiscal year 2024. Each State is entitled to receive grants for education programs equal to the amount appropriated in fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2024. Funds are transferred directly to each State and must be expended within the fiscal year or the following year. The State must use grants for education purposes allowed by State law, including teacher salary increases for elementary and secondary education under subsection (a)(1) and postsecondary education purposes under subsection (a)(2). Grants should supplement, not replace, funds for education programs from non-Federal sources. SEC. 5. ADMINISTRATIVE AND FISCAL ACCOUNTABILITY. SEC. 5. ADMINISTRATIVE AND FISCAL ACCOUNTABILITY.
