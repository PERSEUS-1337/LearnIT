    "content": "The United Nations has recognized violence against women as a global health concern and violation of human rights since the late 1990s. Various U.N. efforts, including interagency initiatives and programs by NGOs and national governments, address VAW directly or within broader issues like humanitarian aid and human rights. However, the specific annual spending on anti-VAW programs within the U.N. system is unclear. U.N. member states collectively address VAW through the work of U.N. principal organs such as the General Assembly. The United Nations addresses violence against women through various organs like the General Assembly, Security Council, and ECOSOC. Member states have adopted resolutions on VAW, including issues like violence against women migrant workers, honor crimes, trafficking, and sexual violence in conflict. Many countries have ratified international treaties like the U.N. Protocol on Trafficking, CEDAW, and CRC. The U.N. Human Rights Council supports the Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women. The United Nations coordinates efforts to combat violence against women through various entities and mechanisms. Former Secretary-General Kofi Annan and current Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon have worked to enhance anti-VAW activities among U.N. entities since 2005. An inventory compiled by the U.N. Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women identifies 36 U.N. entities working to combat VAW globally, nationally, or locally. In February 2008, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon launched a U.N. system-wide public awareness campaign to end violence against women. The report provides examples of recent U.N. efforts to address VAW, including the Trust Fund to Eliminate Violence Against Women and interagency activities. Selected U.N. agreements, mechanisms, agencies, funds, and programs work to eliminate violence against women. This report supplements CRS Report RL34438, International Violence Against Women: U.S. Response and Policy Issues. Members of the 112th Congress may consider ongoing U.N. efforts when addressing violence against women internationally. Some experts suggest that Congress could utilize U.N. mechanisms to combat violence against women (VAW), which may involve providing financial or technical support to international organizations. This support could help the U.S. share anti-VAW costs and resources with other governments and prevent duplication of programs. However, there are differing opinions on whether the U.S. should focus on its own anti-VAW activities or reduce contributions to multilateral efforts. Some argue for reducing U.S. contributions to global anti-VAW efforts due to economic challenges, while others advocate for increasing support to U.N. programs like the Trust Fund to combat violence against women. Policymakers have considered the fund as a tool to address international violence against women, with proposed legislation in Congress aiming to boost U.S. contributions. The United States may address violence against women through various U.N. mechanisms and programs, including the Trust Fund to combat violence against women. Other U.N. agencies and programs also support anti-VAW activities through their regular budgets or voluntary contributions from member states. The United States can address violence against women through various U.N. mechanisms and programs, including the Trust Fund to combat violence against women. Multilateral treaties like the U.N. Protocol to Prevent Trafficking in Persons and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women are also relevant. The U.S. has not ratified some treaties due to concerns about sovereignty but can still promote resolutions in U.N. fora. In 2007, U.S. representatives at the United Nations pushed for a resolution condemning the use of rape as a state policy. The U.S. led in adopting U.N. Security Council resolutions addressing women, peace, and security in 2000, 2008, and 2009. In 2010, the U.S. played a key role in establishing a working group to address discrimination against women. Additionally, in 2009, the U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution to create a new U.N. entity focusing on women's well-being. In July 2010, the U.N. General Assembly combined four entities addressing women's issues into a new entity called UN Women. Michelle Bachelet, former president of Chile, was appointed as the Executive Director. UN Women, established in 2011, focuses on addressing violence against women and has taken on responsibilities from various other U.N. entities. Its impact on U.N. efforts in this area is still evolving. The U.N. General Assembly adopted the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women (DEVAW) on December 20, 1993. DEVAW defines violence against women as any gender-based act causing physical, sexual, or psychological harm. It urges countries to combat VAW and not justify it with customs or traditions. The Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women (DEVAW) states that countries should condemn violence against women and not use customs or traditions to avoid their obligations. The definition of violence against women varies among governments, organizations, and cultures, impacting how policymakers address the issue. The current Secretary-General and his predecessors have supported studies and initiatives to combat violence against women, including the U.N. Study on Violence Against Women and the UNITE to End Violence Against Women campaign. The In-depth Study on All Forms of Violence Against Women, published by then-U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan in July 2006, provided a statistical overview of types of violence against women (VAW) and identified 32 U.N. entities working to combat VAW globally. An updated inventory in February 2011 identified 36 U.N. entities addressing the issue. The study discussed gaps and challenges in U.N. system anti-VAW activities, including implementation of legal frameworks, data collection, awareness raising, resource mobilization, and coordination mechanisms at the international level. The study recommended increasing U.N. resources for addressing violence against women and promoting best practices for data collection. It urged national governments to establish action plans to combat violence against women. In response, the U.N. General Assembly adopted resolution 61/143 to intensify efforts to eliminate all forms of violence against women. This led to the launch of the UNITE to End Violence Against Women Campaign by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in 2008. The UNITE to End Violence Against Women Campaign was launched by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in 2008 to raise awareness and prevent violence against women. The campaign focuses on global advocacy, U.N. leadership, and partnerships, with key outcomes including adopting national legislation, implementing action plans, data collection, awareness campaigns, and addressing sexual violence in conflict. The UN Trust Fund in Support of Actions to Eliminate Violence Against Women is a multilateral mechanism focusing on combating VAW at various levels. It is administered by UN Women and relies on contributions from governments, NGOs, and individuals. Top government donors include Australia, Austria, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Since 1997, the Trust Fund has distributed $60 million in grants to over 317 anti-VAW initiatives. The UN Trust Fund has distributed approximately $60 million in small grants to over 317 anti-VAW initiatives in 124 countries. In 2010, $10.1 million in grants were awarded to 13 groups in 18 countries, with Africa receiving the largest number of grants. Grantees included women's organizations, U.N. Country Teams, development or youth organizations, and governmental and human rights organizations. The UN Trust Fund has increased its resource base since 2008, allowing for larger and longer-term grants to support projects spanning three years. However, during its 14th cycle (2009-2010), the Trust Fund only met 2.4% of the total amount requested by applicants. The U.S. government has contributed to the Trust Fund since 2005, with funding levels ranging from $990,000 in FY2005 to $3.0 million in FY2010. The UN Trust Fund's funding increased from $990,000 in FY2005 to $3.0 million in FY2010. The Trust Fund receives funding from the International Organizations and Programs account and supports projects through the IANWGE network. The network aims to strengthen anti-violence against women efforts globally, with pilot projects in 10 countries. The UN Trust Fund's funding increased to $3.0 million in FY2010, supporting projects through the IANWGE network to strengthen anti-violence against women efforts globally. The IASC coordinates humanitarian assistance and has a Task Force on Gender and Humanitarian Assistance that works on programs to prevent and respond to gender-based violence, including publishing guidelines in 2005. The Task Force meets every four to six weeks, involving over 20 U.N. entities and NGOs to coordinate the U.N. system response to sexual violence before and after conflict. U.N. Action aims to strengthen services for survivors, address gender imbalances, raise public awareness, and urge governments to take action. Selected U.N. conferences, agreements, resolutions, and treaties addressing VAW are discussed, without assessing member state compliance. Since 1974, the United Nations has been involved in these efforts. The United Nations has been involved in efforts to address violence against women since 1974. Recognition of VAW as an international human rights issue was achieved at the Third World Conference on Women in Nairobi in 1985 and reaffirmed at the Fourth World Conference in Beijing in 1995. These conferences laid the groundwork for future international anti-VAW initiatives, emphasizing the need for legal measures and national mechanisms to address VAW within families and society. The United States, along with other U.N. member states, recognized violence against women as a critical human rights issue at the Beijing conference in 1995. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) focuses on women's rights in various areas of life and has been ratified by 187 U.N. member states, but the United States has not ratified it. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) addresses gender-based violence as a form of gender discrimination. The Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC) requires parties to protect children from all forms of violence. The CRC, adopted in 1989, aims to protect children from abuse and exploitation. The United States has not ratified the treaty, unlike 193 other parties. In 2000, the U.N. General Assembly adopted the Convention on Transnational Crime, including the Protocol on Trafficking. The Protocol on Trafficking, part of the Convention on Transnational Crime, aims to combat cross-border crimes like trafficking in women and girls. It requires countries to enforce laws against traffickers, assist and protect victims, and enhance border security cooperation. The United States ratified the Protocol on December 3, 2005, joining 146 other countries. The U.N. Security Council has also addressed women, peace, and security issues through resolutions like 1325 adopted on October 31, 2000. Resolution 1325, adopted by the Security Council on October 31, 2000, emphasizes the protection of women and girls from gender-based violence in armed conflict. It calls for increased representation of women in decision-making roles in conflict resolution efforts. U.N. efforts in this area have intensified since 2003 and 2004 due to reports of sexual abuse by U.N. peacekeeping personnel. Resolution 1820, adopted by the Security Council in June 2008, demands the immediate cessation of all acts of sexual violence against civilians in armed conflict. It reaffirms commitment to resolution 1325 and recognizes sexual violence as a war crime, crime against humanity, or constitutive act of genocide. The resolution also calls for training programs for peacekeeping and humanitarian personnel. Resolution 1888, adopted by the U.N. Security Council in September 2009, calls for training programs for peacekeeping and humanitarian personnel to prevent sexual violence in conflict and post-conflict situations. It emphasizes the need to protect civilians, especially women and children, from all forms of sexual violence in armed conflict. The resolution appoints a Special Representative to address sexual violence in armed conflict and deploy experts to affected areas promptly. Resolution 1889, adopted by the U.N. Security Council in October 2009, focuses on improving women's participation in peace processes and condemns violations of international law against women and girls in armed and post-conflict situations.

Security Council in October 2009, aims to end impunity and prosecute those responsible for violence against girls and women in armed conflict, including rape and sexual violence. The United States strongly supported the resolution. The U.N. Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) is a key body addressing international violence against women, with a focus on policymaking and implementation. The U.N. Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) observes, monitors, and implements measures for the advancement of women, including addressing violence against women.
