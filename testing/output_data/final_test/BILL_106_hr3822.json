    "content": "The \"Oil Price Reduction Act of 2000\" may be cited as such. Key findings are outlined in the Act. The \"Oil Price Reduction Act of 2000\" highlights OPEC's significant role in reducing global oil supply, leading to a price increase from $11 to $30 per barrel. A hearing in February 2000 emphasized OPEC's impact on the Northeast Energy Crisis. During a hearing, it was noted that OPEC's goal of reducing oil stocks led to price increases in heating oil, gasoline, and diesel. Artificial supply constraints create market volatility, inflationary shocks, and threaten global economic recovery in Europe and Asia. The transportation infrastructure in the United States is strained, leading to many small to medium-sized trucking firms in the Northeast facing bankruptcy due to the sharp increase in diesel oil prices. This has forced them to allocate a significant portion of their operating budgets to fuel costs. Additionally, many elderly and retired individuals in the region struggle to afford heating oil, often having to choose between paying for groceries or staying warm. Several key oil-producing nations relied on the US military for protection during the Persian Gulf Conflict in 1990 and 1991. These nations still depend on the US for security, enjoying a close economic and security relationship that underpins global security and cooperation. However, the continuation of current policies from OPEC meetings in 1999 threatens this relationship. The United States policy aims to address oil price fixing by major net oil exporting and importing countries. This policy is crucial for the overall political, economic, and security relationship between the US and these nations. Additionally, the US will work with other major net oil importers to dismantle international oil price fixing arrangements. A report on these efforts will be submitted to Congress. The President must submit a report to Congress within 30 days of this Act's enactment. The report will detail the economic and security relationship between the US and major net oil exporting countries, including OPEC members. It will also discuss the impact of oil production and pricing coordination among these countries on the US economy and global energy supplies. Additionally, the report will provide information on assistance programs and export licenses under relevant Acts given to these countries. The President will make determinations for countries mentioned in paragraph (1) in accordance with section 5. SEC. 5. The President will determine if major oil exporting countries are engaged in price fixing to the detriment of the US economy. SEC. 6. Diplomatic efforts will be made to end price fixing. The President will conduct diplomatic efforts to convince countries engaged in oil price fixing to reduce their actions, and negotiate multilateral actions to reduce assistance and arms exports to these countries. This is part of a campaign with other major oil importers to dismantle international oil price fixing. The President will report on diplomatic efforts made to dismantle international oil price fixing arrangements within 120 days of the enactment of this Act. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines \"oil price fixing\" as agreements among oil-exporting countries to raise oil prices by limiting production or setting minimum prices, and \"OPEC\" as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries."
