    "content": "The Act titled \"Global Health Care Cooperation Act\" amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to allow temporary absence of aliens providing health care in developing countries. The Global Health Care Cooperation Act allows eligible aliens working as healthcare workers in candidate countries to reside there with their spouse or child. They will be considered physically present in the US for naturalization purposes and meet residency requirements. A candidate country is one eligible for assistance from the International Development Association. The International Development Association eligibility criteria include being a lower middle income country as per the World Development Report, or meeting specific income thresholds for candidate country status. The Secretary of State shall publish a list of candidate countries, including those qualified due to special circumstances like natural disasters or public health emergencies. Eligible aliens are defined as healthcare workers lawfully admitted for permanent residence. The Secretary of Homeland Security must consult with the Secretary of State in implementing this section. The Secretary of Homeland Security must promulgate regulations within 180 days of the enactment of the Act to allow eligible aliens and their family members to work as healthcare workers in foreign countries. The Secretary of Homeland Security must establish regulations allowing eligible aliens to work as healthcare workers in foreign countries for a 12 to 24-month period, extendable for an additional 12 months if needed. Documents will be issued to demonstrate authorization to reside in the country under section 317A, with an expedited process in place. The Secretary of Homeland Security will review applications for eligible aliens to reside in a foreign country under section 317A if the country is deemed a candidate country. Amendments are made to the Immigration and Nationality Act to accommodate eligible aliens authorized to be absent from the United States under section 317A. Amendments are made to the Immigration and Nationality Act to accommodate eligible aliens authorized to reside in a foreign country under section 317A, including their spouses and children. Amendments to the Immigration and Nationality Act allow eligible aliens providing health care in developing countries to temporarily reside abroad. Health care workers must provide an attestation. Amendments to the Immigration and Nationality Act require health care workers seeking to enter the United States for work to submit an attestation confirming they are not seeking entry during any period of outstanding obligation to their home country. The Immigration and Nationality Act requires health care workers entering the US to confirm they have no outstanding obligation to their home country. This obligation refers to financial assistance received for education or training in exchange for a commitment to work in their home country. The Secretary of Homeland Security can waive this requirement. The Secretary of Homeland Security can waive a finding of inadmissibility for health care workers if the obligation was incurred by coercion or if a valid agreement has been reached with the home country to satisfy the obligation. The Secretary of Homeland Security can waive inadmissibility for health care workers if coercion or other improper means were involved in reaching an agreement, or if extraordinary circumstances like undue hardship exist. The amendment will take effect 180 days after the enactment of the Act, and the Secretary must begin implementing the changes before that date. The amendment allows the Secretary of Homeland Security to waive inadmissibility for health care workers, regardless of whether regulations have been implemented."
