    "content": "The \"Internet Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act\" is cited as the short title. It amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to include a section on internet sales of prescription drugs. The \"Internet Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act\" prohibits the sale of prescription drugs through Internet sites that do not meet specified requirements. The \"Internet Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act\" requires Internet sites selling prescription drugs to provide detailed information about the person, including their name, address, and phone number, states where they are authorized to dispense drugs, and names of pharmacists and their authorized states. The \"Internet Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act\" mandates that Internet sites offering prescription drugs must disclose details of individuals providing consultations for prescriptions, including their names, states where they are licensed, and types of health professions they are authorized for. Additionally, each page of the site must contain a link to this information or display it on the page. The link must be clearly visible, not smaller than other links, and include the words 'licensing' or 'licenses' in the caption. The \"Internet Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act\" allows states to have primary enforcement authority for violations involving the purchase of prescription drugs from Internet sites if their requirements are as stringent as federal regulations. States can request a determination from the Secretary to confirm their enforcement responsibility within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Internet Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act requires the Secretary to issue a proposed rule within a certain timeframe. Definitions for terms like \"Internet\" and \"link\" are provided in the Act. The Internet Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act defines terms related to online activities, such as moving between pages on a website or different websites, accessing documents or files on the Internet, and the meaning of a prescription drug. It also clarifies that a \"site\" or \"address\" on the Internet is a specific location determined by Internet protocol numbers. The Internet Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act defines terms related to online activities and prescription drugs. It includes the definition of a domain name as a method of representing an Internet address without direct reference to Internet Protocol numbers. Additionally, it prohibits the introduction of prescription drugs into interstate commerce in violation of section 503B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The amendments made by section 2 of the Internet Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act take effect after a 60-day period from the enactment of the Act, regardless of the final rule implementation by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. This does not impact the Secretary's authority to promulgate the final rule."
