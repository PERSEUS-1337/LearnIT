    "content": "The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) of 1978 was created in response to perceived surveillance abuses by the executive branch. It established the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) and the FISA Court of Review to oversee electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes. Questions have been raised about the effectiveness of these mechanisms following revelations in 2013. Proposed changes include altering laws regulating surveillance and addressing authorization procedures. The report discusses the FISC and FISA Court of Review, their jurisdiction, appointment of judges, and procedures for issuing surveillance orders. Proposed reforms include involving \"friends of the court,\" requiring en banc sessions, and changing voting rules. The creation of these courts stemmed from concerns about surveillance abuses and the need for oversight. The foreign intelligence surveillance courts, established in the 1970s, were a response to concerns about surveillance abuses uncovered by the Church Committee. FISA created the FISC, a specialized court for reviewing requests for foreign intelligence surveillance. The FISA Act of 1978 established the FISC, a specialized court for approving foreign intelligence gathering efforts. The FISC's jurisdiction is narrowly tailored, with judges appointed differently from traditional courts, and operates mostly in secret. Its authority is limited to overseeing government applications for foreign intelligence collection. The FISA Court's jurisdiction was initially limited to hearing government applications for electronic surveillance but later expanded to include approving four types of investigative methods. The FISA Court of Review can review denials of applications for surveillance and physical searches, as well as orders for tangible things. The FISC, under the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, can review government certifications and procedures for targeting non-U.S. persons abroad and U.S. persons. The FISA Court has jurisdiction to review petitions by electronic communication service providers to modify or set aside directives issued under the FAA. It can also review requests by the Attorney General to compel compliance with a directive. The FISA Court of Review can review FISC decisions and compel compliance with directives. FISA judges are not appointed via presidential appointment and Senate confirmation, but are designated to their positions. The FISA Court judges are designated by the Chief Justice, serving one seven-year term. The Court of Review judges are also designated by the Chief Justice. The FISC has five full-time legal advisors who vet applications before presenting them to the judges. The FISA courts operate in secret and non-adversarial sessions. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) operates in secrecy, with court sessions held behind closed doors and ex parte with only the government presenting arguments. The 11 FISC judges rotate weekly in a secure courtroom in Washington, DC, with a duty judge presiding. Non-governmental parties have appeared before the FISC, and a pool of three judges can review petitions under specific acts. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) has jurisdiction to review petitions under the USA PATRIOT Act and FISA. Applications are heard by a single judge, and if denied, cannot be heard by another judge except when sitting en banc. The application process starts with the government submitting a \"read copy\" to the FISC, followed by discussions with legal advisors or judges to address any concerns before a formal application is filed. The duty judge reviews the government's submissions for weaknesses and makes an initial determination on the application. This can lead to approval without a hearing, request for more information, imposition of conditions, or a hearing. If the judge denies the application, a statement of reasons must be prepared. A hearing may be required before issuing an application, or at the government's request. The FISC may hold a hearing to challenge conditions on an application, or convene an en banc panel of all judges for important matters. An initial hearing en banc is for urgent and significant cases. The FISA Court of Review can review denials of applications for electronic surveillance or physical searches. It can also review petitions to affirm, modify, or set aside FISC orders for the production of tangible things. The Court must provide written reasons for its decisions and can transmit the record to the Supreme Court for review. The Supreme Court has jurisdiction to review decisions related to US foreign intelligence gathering efforts, with congressional proposals aiming to reform the FISC and FISA Court of Review. Suggestions include allowing the FISC to hear from an amicus curiae, mandating en banc panels, and changing voting rules to increase government surveillance thresholds. Before addressing specific legal questions, it is crucial to understand how Congress can regulate an Article III court's practices and procedures, rooted in the court's power derived from the Constitution and statutory law. The federal court's power is derived from the Constitution, statutory law, and federal common law, specifically Article III which vests the \"judicial power\" in the Supreme Court and inferior courts. The judiciary's authority includes interpreting laws, although other branches also interpret laws. President and Congress engage in legal interpretation. The federal court's power, derived from the Constitution, includes interpreting laws. Article III vests the \"judicial power\" in federal courts to decide cases and controversies with final judgments. Lifetime tenure and salary protections for federal judges are structural safeguards provided by the Constitution. The Constitution provides federal judges with lifetime tenure and salary protections to ensure independence from political interference. Congress can authorize federal courts to exercise their power through statutory law, including creating inferior tribunals to the Supreme Court. The federal courts are empowered by Congress to execute judgments and have inherent powers necessary for the orderly disposition of cases, separate from statutory provisions and Article III powers. The federal court's inherent power is a form of federal common law that allows judges to fill gaps in statutes and rules. This power is essential for the court to function properly, alongside its constitutional and statutory authority. Congress can regulate court practices and procedures, but the court's inherent powers remain crucial for its functioning. In Hanna v. Plumer, it was noted that Congress has the power to make rules governing the practice and pleading in federal courts. Title 28 includes provisions mandating how the federal judiciary conducts its business, such as the number of Justices on the Supreme Court and rules of evidence. The Court has interpreted Congress to have the authority to establish mandatory rules of procedure that Article III courts must follow. Congress can also regulate the inherent powers of a court. Congress's power over federal judiciary practices is not absolute and cannot erode the essential attributes of judicial power. This includes the ability to independently resolve cases with finality and prohibits requiring advisory opinions or subjecting judicial opinions to non-Article III review. The limitations of Congress's power over federal judiciary practices are highlighted, as it cannot interfere with the finality of court judgments or erode judicial independence. This includes restrictions on enacting laws that impact the decision-making process of federal courts. The report then discusses proposals to regulate the practice of FISA courts, which primarily involve one party and focus on electronic surveillance. Recent controversies over the ex parte nature of the FISC's review of government surveillance requests under FISA have sparked discussions on establishing a public interest advocate office or allowing the court to hear from certain individuals or interests on a temporary basis. The FISC may hear from \"friends of the court\" or amici curiae to brief on privacy or civil liberty interests in government applications. Proposals regulating this process raise legal questions on necessity and Congress's mandate on court parties. Amicus curiae, meaning \"friend of the court,\" originated in Roman law as advisors to courts on unfamiliar legal matters. The Roman amicus curiae served as an advisor to courts on unfamiliar legal matters, becoming a precursor to the Anglo-American amicus device. In English common law, amici were impartial assistants to the judiciary, helping judges avoid errors. American courts adopted the use of amici in the early nineteenth century, with federal courts expanding their role over time, including the Supreme Court appointing amici to represent the public interest in the administration of justice. Some federal courts allow amici to participate in cases of public interest, providing impartial information or legal observations. The classic role of amicus curiae involves assisting in cases of general public interest and drawing the court's attention to overlooked laws. Participation as an amicus is a privilege governed by a court's inherent authority, without a right to compel court involvement under federal common law. Some suggest Congress should establish a formal mechanism for the FISC to solicit independent views of an amicus curiae in certain cases. The FISA Improvements Act proposes allowing the FISC to designate individuals with expertise to assist in considering government applications under FISA. The duties of a FISA amicus include providing expertise on privacy and civil liberties. The FISA Improvements Act suggests allowing the FISC to appoint qualified individuals as amicus to assist in reviewing relevant court submissions. Congressional regulation of FISA amici does not raise serious constitutional questions as Congress has the power to regulate federal court procedures. This proposal imposes no firm mandates on the FISC. The FISA Improvements Act proposes allowing the FISC to appoint amicus to assist in court proceedings without imposing firm mandates that threaten judicial power. Providing statutory authority for FISA courts to appoint amici enhances judicial power without diminishing political branches' power. While this likely doesn't raise constitutional issues, the necessity of such a statute is still in question given the historical practice of courts appointing amici. The FISA courts have a long history of appointing amici and allowing the filing of briefs. While codifying this authority in statute could clarify it, the statutory authority would largely duplicate the courts' inherent power. Some proposals suggest regulating the amicus authority of the FISA courts, but not all leave the decision to appoint a friend of the court up to the discretion of the courts. Several proposals contemplate requiring the FISA courts to hear from amici when considering applications that involve novel or significant interpretations of the law. The USA FREEDOM Act mandates the FISC to consider the views of an amicus in such cases. The USA FREEDOM Act mandates the FISC to consider appointing an amicus in cases involving novel or significant interpretations of the law, which may limit the judge's discretion in appointing an amicus based on the application of settled law to new technologies or circumstances. The FISC may need to appoint an amicus for almost every surveillance application, as applying settled law to new circumstances is a common practice. However, mandating an Article III court to hear from an amicus could potentially conflict with the court's autonomy and independence in controlling its internal processes. This contrasts with the historic amicus tradition, which allowed the court flexibility and discretion in relying on amicus views. Mandating a specific amicus for the FISC may limit the court's independence and raise constitutional questions about the amicus' role, transforming it from a discretionary advisor to a party with a right to be heard. The proposal to mandate a specific amicus for the FISC raises concerns about potentially elevating the amicus to the status of a named party or real party in interest, which could violate Article III by granting non-standing individuals the right to be heard in federal court. The proposal to mandate a specific amicus for the FISC raises concerns about potentially elevating the amicus to the status of a named party, which could violate Article III by granting non-standing individuals the right to be heard in federal court. The role of an amicus curiae is limited and does not rise to the level of a party to the litigation, according to a recent FISC opinion. Critics question whether eliminating the court's discretionary power to hear from an amicus erodes one of the essential attributes of the judicial power. The proposal to mandate a specific amicus for the FISC raises concerns about potentially elevating the amicus to the status of a named party, which could violate Article III by granting non-standing individuals the right to be heard in federal court. Critics question whether eliminating the court's discretionary power to hear from an amicus erodes one of the essential attributes of the judicial power, as encompassed by Article III. Having the power to appoint amici in a federal case is an ancient power for a court, but it may not be considered \"essential\" for the FISC to function in line with the Constitution's envisioned scheme for federal courts. The proposal does not grant an amicus the right to seek judicial relief from a federal court, which could raise concerns about Article III standing. Laws and rules are limited in curbing the federal judiciary's power over amici, with different rules for district courts, appellate courts, and the Supreme Court regarding the appointment of amici. The federal appellate and Supreme Court rules waive the need for government amici to obtain court permission before appearing, enhancing the rights of government amici while imposing restrictions on the judiciary. Unlike congressional commands, very few statutory provisions mandate a federal court to hear from a specific amicus. The Commodity Exchange Act and Title 5 of the U.S. Code allow certain government officials to appear as amici in court proceedings, but the constitutionality of this provision has not been assessed by any court. The constitutionality of a mandatory amicus provision in FISA courts remains unresolved, with questions about the nature and scope of the amicus's role. The authority of the amicus has evolved from an impartial assistant to a more adversarial defender of legal interests. Judge Richard Posner has accepted a limited adversarial role for amici in certain instances. Judge Richard Posner has outlined three instances where an amicus brief should be allowed: when a party is not competently represented, when the amicus has an interest in another case affected by the decision, or when the amicus provides unique information to help the court. There are no serious constitutional constraints on defining the role of an amicus in briefing the FISA court, but questions remain about the appropriateness of their role. Legislation like the USA FREEDOM Act proposes amicus provisions for FISA courts. Amicus provisions in legislation like the USA FREEDOM Act require the amicus to advocate for individual privacy and civil liberties in FISA proceedings. The amicus must have expertise in relevant areas and represent interests not fully addressed in current proceedings. This aligns with Judge Posner's criteria for allowing amicus briefs. The amicus appointed under the USA FREEDOM Act must advocate for individual privacy and civil liberties in FISA proceedings, providing a unique perspective on legal issues. The responsibility to promote legal interpretations that advance privacy must be done \"as appropriate,\" similar to the current obligation of government attorneys. Congress defining the role of an amicus during briefing raises questions about its power to mandate FISA courts to hear from an amicus. In 2008, FISA was amended to allow the FISC to hold a hearing or rehearing en banc, consisting of all the judges. Congress regulating the ancient power of federal courts regarding amici raises questions about usurping the court's constitutional powers. There is no legal precedent to assess the appropriateness of a law defining the amicus's role in court briefings. The FISA Amendments Act of 2008 allowed the FISC to hold en banc hearings. Recent discussions have revived the idea of mandatory en banc proceedings for certain FISC cases. This raises questions about the constitutionality of such proposals. En banc review involves all judges of a court and has its origins in the 1930s. In 1938, the Ninth Circuit faced conflicting panel rulings and certified the question to the Supreme Court. The Third Circuit rejected this approach and resolved the split en banc. The Supreme Court affirmed in Textile Mills Security Corp. v. Commissioner that courts of appeals can decide cases en banc to promote finality and resolve circuit splits. In 1948, Congress codified the result of Textile Mills in Section 46(c) of the Judicial Code, allowing cases in the courts of appeals to be heard by a three-judge panel unless a majority orders a rehearing en banc. The Supreme Court later clarified that courts of appeals have the discretion to sit en banc. Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 35 outlines the criteria for when an en banc hearing is appropriate. En banc hearings in the United States Courts of Appeals are rare and not favored unless necessary for maintaining uniformity or involving a question of exceptional importance. En banc rulings in federal trial courts are even more unusual, with some exceptions in complex criminal cases. It is anomalous for a court of first impression to review a matter with all judges on the court. En banc hearings in federal courts are uncommon and typically reserved for cases of significant importance or to ensure consistency. Requiring a federal court to sit en banc does not impede its ability to independently adjudicate cases. Congress can constitutionally mandate en banc hearings as it does not infringe on core Article III powers. The Courts' interpretation of Congress's intent in enacting the statute was driven by practical considerations, not constitutional reasons. Congress has previously mandated the use of three-judge panels in federal courts for certain cases, showing that it could impose mandatory en banc proceedings if it desired. In 1910, Congress required suits to enjoin state officers from enforcing unconstitutional laws to be heard by a three-judge panel. Although the use of these panels has been narrowed, they are still used in certain cases like claims under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Requiring en banc panels in certain FISA cases aligns with historical precedent and does not violate core Article III norms. Another proposed change is altering the voting rules of the FISC and the FISA Court of. The FISA Court Accountability Act (H.R. 2586) proposes changing the voting rules of the FISC and the FISA Court of Review. It suggests requiring a 60% concurrence for en banc panels of the FISC and unanimous decisions in favor of the government by the FISA Court of Review. This proposal is not unprecedented as Congress has regulated the voting rules of federal courts before. Congress has never enacted a voting rule for federal courts, leading to uncertainty over whether it has the authority to set the voting rules of the Supreme Court and lower federal courts. Various arguments have been made that Congress lacks this authority. Arguments have been made that Congress lacks the authority to set the voting rules of the Supreme Court and lower federal courts. One theory suggests that once Congress vests the courts with the \"judicial power\" and sets the number of judges and quorum, its authority to regulate the Court's procedure ends. Another argument is that the Constitution itself mandates a bare majority rule. One observer argues that Congress cannot change the default majority rule without a specific constitutional provision. The Constitution does not expressly allow Congress to alter federal courts' voting rules. Current voting practices deviate from the bare-majority rule, such as setting the Supreme Court quorum at six. The use of simple majorities may not be constitutionally required, and the constitutionality of congressional regulation of courts' voting rules depends on interference with judicial function. The Constitution does not expressly allow Congress to alter federal courts' voting rules. While Congress has authority to regulate court practices, it cannot erode the core functions of the judiciary. The Supreme Court has held that Congress cannot regulate court jurisdiction to dictate outcomes. Requiring a 60% concurrence in en banc proceedings would not unduly interfere with court functions. The proposed rule suggests that if the 60% threshold is not met, the decision below would be affirmed. It would tilt the scales in favor of affirming the one-judge FISC decision in Section 215 and Section 702 proceedings. This rule aims to have a neutral effect on FISC's rulings and does not violate established principles. Congress has the authority to set rules for federal courts, including the FISA Court. The proposed rule requiring a unanimous vote in the FISA Court of Review for decisions in favor of the government could interfere with the court's independence and be seen as Congress dictating a specific outcome. It may prevent the court from issuing orders even when two-thirds agree, potentially hindering its ability to act as a duly constituted court. The creation of the Court of Review was within Congress's discretion, but once established, it may be argued that Congress cannot limit its core functions as a federal court. The proposal for a unanimous vote in the FISA Court of Review may make it harder for the government to win on appeal, but it does not mandate a specific outcome, leaving decision-making authority with the judges. There is limited judicial precedent to evaluate measures altering the court's voting rules."
