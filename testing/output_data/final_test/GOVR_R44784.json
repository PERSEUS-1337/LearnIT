    "content": "The farm bill has evolved over the years to include a wider range of food and agricultural interests beyond traditional commodities. New titles have been added to address emerging issues such as nutrition assistance, farmland conservation, biofuels, and horticulture. The bill has become more comprehensive and integrated, with provisions from different titles affecting land use and markets. Specialty crops, like fruits and vegetables, are supported through various provisions in different parts of the farm bill. The 2014 farm bill includes provisions for various agricultural interests, with a focus on lower farm prices and income. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) accounts for the majority of spending. Calls for expanding support to small and medium-sized farms, specialty crops, cottonseed, organic agriculture, and local markets are ongoing. Efforts to reduce farm bill costs may create competition among stakeholders. Uncertainty exists regarding farm policy priorities under the Trump Administration. The potential expiration of the current farm bill could lead to legislative action, affecting various programs differently. Farm commodity programs would revert to permanent law if the bill expires. Nutrition assistance programs require periodic reauthorization, with appropriations keeping them operating. Discretionary programs could lose statutory authority but annual appropriations could provide funding. Some programs have permanent authority and do not need reauthorization. The debate over including the nutrition title in the farm bill was seen in the 2014 bill. In 2013, separate bills for the farm bill and nutrition programs were passed by the House before being joined together in the final law. Arguments continue for a separate SNAP reauthorization. The farm bill since 1973 has included reauthorization of the Food Stamp Program, now called SNAP. There is debate over whether to include the nutrition title in the farm bill, with some arguing for a separate SNAP reauthorization. Budget constraints are a key factor in the discussion, with mandatory spending authorized for farm commodity programs, crop insurance, nutrition assistance programs, and some conservation and trade programs. The farm bill includes reauthorization of programs like SNAP, crop insurance, and conservation programs. Discretionary spending covers rural development, research, and education programs. Mandatory spending dominates the budget and is determined by baseline projections from the CBO. Funding for programs with discretionary spending is separate from mandatory spending. The farm bill budget is determined by baseline projections from the CBO, which project future federal spending on mandatory programs assuming current law remains intact. Changes in spending relative to the baseline are measured, with increases having a positive score and decreases having a negative score. Increases above the baseline may be subject to budget constraints, while reductions can offset other provisions or reduce the deficit. The baseline projections from the CBO determine the farm bill budget, with changes in spending relative to the baseline measured. Reauthorization of programs without a continuing baseline would increase the bill's cost. The 2014 farm bill's mandatory spending was mainly allocated to nutrition, crop insurance, conservation, and farm commodity support. The projected cost of the 2014 farm bill was $484 billion for the largest four titles and $489 billion for all 12 titles. Three years after enactment, the current projected cost is $456 billion for the four largest titles, which is $28 billion less than what was projected at enactment. Lower farm commodity prices have reduced the projected cost of crop insurance. The projected cost of the farm bill has decreased by $28 billion due to changes in crop insurance and farm subsidies, as well as lower enrollment in SNAP. The current baseline for a new farm bill is uncertain, but early projections suggest continued economic changes. The January 2017 CBO baseline projection for the farm bill is $435 billion over the next five years and $870 billion over the next 10 years, with the nutrition title accounting for 77% of these amounts. The farm bill's projected cost has decreased by $28 billion, mainly due to changes in crop insurance, farm subsidies, and lower SNAP enrollment. The current baseline for a new farm bill is uncertain, with early projections indicating continued economic changes. The nutrition title accounts for 77% of the projected $435 billion over the next five years and $870 billion over the next 10 years. Farm bill spending proportions have shifted over time, with conservation and crop insurance spending steadily rising, while farm commodity program spending has fluctuated with market conditions. The U.S. agricultural sector saw a golden period from 2010 to 2014 with record farm income and land values, but since 2014, there has been a dramatic change. Crop harvests and international demand have decreased, leading to lower commodity prices, farm incomes, and asset values. USDA projects a 9% decrease in U.S. net farm income to $62.3 billion in 2017, down 50% from the record in 2013. The forecast for lower net farm income in 2017 is primarily due to lower crop and livestock receipts, with record supplies in 2016 depressing prices. Agricultural exports are projected to be higher at $134 billion, but still below the 2014 record due to a strong U.S. dollar and weak economic outlook in importing countries. Despite the decline, U.S. agricultural exports are expected to account for over 30% of farm sector gross earnings in 2017. Farm wealth is projected to decline for a third year in 2017 to $2,836 billion, reflecting lower commodity prices and a decrease in farmland values. Farm credit conditions are deteriorating with increasing loan delinquencies and rising interest rates. Despite the financial downturn, the U.S. agricultural sector is still outperforming U.S. households in general. Average farm household incomes have been well ahead of average U.S. household incomes since the late 1990s, with the average farm household income in 2015 being 51% higher than the average U.S. household income. The outlook for lower commodity prices and farm income suggests a weakening financial picture for the agricultural sector in 2017, with substantial regional variation. Weak prices for major program crops and livestock products signal tougher times ahead for agricultural producers. The 2017 agricultural economic well-being will depend on crop harvests, prices, and macroeconomic factors. The federal government supports farm income through various programs like commodity-based revenue support, disaster assistance, and federal crop insurance. These programs cost $14.2 billion per year through the 2014 farm bill. The federal government provides support for farm income through programs like commodity-based revenue support, disaster assistance, and federal crop insurance. The cost for the farm safety net is mainly attributed to major crops such as corn, wheat, soybeans, rice, peanuts, and sorghum. These crops receive the majority of farm program support but do not constitute a majority of farm output value. Farm support originated in the 1930s Depression-era efforts to raise farm household income during low commodity prices. Federal support programs for farm businesses have evolved over time from supply control to direct revenue support payments and expanded crop insurance coverage. While many policymakers and farmers view these subsidies as necessary for financial survival due to the unpredictable nature of agriculture, critics argue that government funding could be better spent on environmental goals or improving productivity. Some producers also criticize the safety net programs for being slow to respond to disasters or lacking adequate risk protection. Many argue that farm subsidies encourage overproduction on fragile land and distort the market. Congressional budget constraints may impact the design of the farm safety net in a new bill, with concerns about the current safety net programs not providing enough support. The current suite of safety net programs is failing to provide sufficient support for cotton producers and dairy operations. Policy design favors planting peanuts on generic base acres despite market incentives. Large county-level variations in ARC-CO program payments have emerged due to data shortcomings. The 2014 farm bill supports 26 farm commodities, including food grains, feed grains, oilseeds, cotton, peanuts, pulse crops, and milk. Additional issues and options for a new farm bill are discussed in sections on budget considerations and commodities covered under safety net programs. The 2014 farm bill supports 26 farm commodities, including grains, oilseeds, upland cotton, peanuts, pulse crops, and milk. Producers are eligible for various payments through programs like ARC and PLC, which use historical data to determine revenue guarantees. Payments are made on a delayed basis due to the need for monthly price data. The 2014 farm bill supports various commodities with programs like ARC and PLC, which use historical data for revenue guarantees. Payments are delayed due to the need for monthly price data. Producers of \"loan commodities\" are also eligible for benefits under nonrecourse marketing assistance loans. Dairy support programs were changed in the 2014 farm bill, replacing old programs with the Margin Protection Program and the Dairy Product Donation Program. Sugar prices are supported through various measures like limits on domestic output, nonrecourse loans, and import quotas. The Margin Protection Program (MPP) and the Dairy Product Donation Program (DPDP) are new support programs for dairy producers. The MPP provides payments to farmers when the national margin falls below a selected insured margin. Producers of specialty crops and livestock have received little direct government support through commodity programs. Federal investments in agricultural research and extension programs, along with support for food and nutrition programs, benefit commodities. Farms manage risks through diversification, federal crop insurance, and disaster assistance programs. The crop insurance program offers risk management tools with revenue and yield policies. Price guarantee levels are set early in the year based on harvest-time futures contracts. The federal crop insurance program, which has grown in importance since the early 1990s, provides revenue guarantees based on national farm prices and county yields. The federal government subsidizes about 62% of farmers' crop insurance premiums, costing taxpayers an average of $7.2 billion per year from 2006 to 2015. The program covers 290 million acres and over 100 commodities, making it one of the broadest federal farm programs. Crop insurance covers a wide range of commodities on 290 million acres, including major field crops like corn, soybeans, wheat, and cotton. Specialty crop policies covered over 7.7 million acres in 2014. New policies like STAX and SCO were introduced in the 2014 farm bill to reimburse shallow losses for producers. STAX, or the Stacked Income Protection Plan, was created in response to upland cotton's removal from eligibility for Title I revenue support programs due to a WTO ruling by Brazil. The 2014 farm bill links crop insurance subsidies to wetland and conservation compliance and reduces subsidies for plantings on native sod acreage. Additionally, the bill permanently authorized four disaster programs for livestock and fruit trees. The four permanent disaster assistance programs (LIP, LFP, ELAP, and TAP) provide compensation for lost production after natural disasters. These programs have uncapped mandatory funding except for ELAP, which is capped at $20 million per year. Together with federal crop insurance and NAP, they cover most of the U.S. farm sector, reducing the need for emergency assistance from Congress. The CBO periodically projects the total cost of mandatory USDA programs, including the potential need for emergency assistance for farmers and ranchers. The 2014 farm bill expires in 2018, and if a new bill is not finalized, ad hoc disaster payments may be necessary. The CBO baseline budget projection for FY2019-FY2028 will serve as the benchmark for any new farm bill. This baseline score is crucial for determining the budgetary impact of policy proposals on agricultural programs. The farm bill includes farm safety net programs with a pool of money for commodity and crop insurance. Changes to the bill must fit within the CBO baseline score or have equivalent offsets in the federal budget. The price outlook for program crops is a key factor in determining the baseline budget. Low commodity prices could lead to higher annual farm program outlays. A large CBO projected baseline allows for flexibility in redesigning the farm safety net. CBO projects farm program outlays at about $14 billion per year for FY2017-FY2027. Currently, CBO projects farm program outlays for FY2017-FY2027 at about $14 billion per year on average, with $5.5 billion for commodity programs, $7.9 billion for crop insurance, and $0.3 billion for annual disaster assistance. Compared to the 2014 farm bill, commodity programs are costing about $1 billion more per year on average, while crop insurance is averaging about $1 billion less. Historical outlays from FY2006 to FY2014 were higher at $15.4 billion per year on average. The highest combined outlay for USDA safety net programs was recorded in FY2005 at $24.8 billion. The extent of current commodity coverage of the farm safety net is primarily a result of the historical and evolving nature of farm policy. Producers of major commodities have benefited the most from farm programs. Coverage could be increased by enhancing crop insurance for nonprogram crops or developing a new whole-farm revenue support program. Upland cotton is notably omitted from eligibility for Title I revenue support programs. Upland cotton was excluded from ARC and PLC eligibility under the 2014 farm bill due to a WTO dispute, leading to the introduction of the STAX insurance program. STAX's revenue guarantee is recalculated annually, causing concern among cotton producers as it has fallen below production costs. This has resulted in low participation rates, with only 25% of cotton-planted acres insured under STAX in 2016. The U.S. cotton sector has requested USDA to designate cottonseed as an \"other oilseed\" to make it eligible for ARC and PLC payments. The USDA considered designating cottonseed as an \"other oilseed\" for ARC and PLC payments, but faced opposition due to potential costs exceeding $1 billion annually. This decision could impact producer crop choices and attract scrutiny from other WTO members like Brazil. As a result of cotton's ineligibility for payments, former cotton base acres were reclassified as \"generic\" base acres under the 2014 farm bill. The USDA's decision to designate cottonseed as an \"other oilseed\" for ARC and PLC payments faced opposition due to potential costs exceeding $1 billion annually. This could impact producer crop choices and attract scrutiny from other WTO members like Brazil. Former cotton base acres were reclassified as \"generic\" base acres under the 2014 farm bill. ARC and PLC payments on generic base acres are tied to actual plantings, leading to a preference for peanut production due to favorable PLC reference prices. CBO projects large government payments to peanut producers compared to other crops, with annual USDA peanut program outlays of $580 million through 2027. The U.S. dairy industry has faced a downturn in market conditions, with a significant drop in milk prices. Despite this, minimal support payments have been made under the MPP program. In 2016, 54% of dairy operations were enrolled in MPP, with most at the minimum catastrophic level, leading to widespread dissatisfaction in the sector. In 2016, many dairy operations missed out on MPP payments as milk prices dropped. Discrepancies in county-level payments were found under the ARC-CO program due to how NASS calculates average county yields. NASS relies on producer surveys for yield estimates, with specific criteria for data prioritization. The NASS county yield estimate is based on crop insurance data if certain conditions are not met. RMA yields are often higher than NASS yields, leading to lower payments for producers in counties using RMA yields. USDA has no legislative requirement to address this issue, potentially causing disparities in ARC-CO crop payments in the future. Lawmakers may need to address county-to-county payment differences in a new farm bill. Most farmers opted for ARC-CO for corn and soybean base acres, while PLC was favored for rice, peanut, and barley. Wheat base acres were split between ARC-CO and PLC. There is uncertainty about the future of ARC and PLC programs in the new farm bill. CBO projections suggest a shift towards PLC for corn, soybeans, and wheat in 2019. The CBO projects PLC outlays to exceed ARC outlays by 2020, with the sugar program operating at no cost to the federal government. Trade in imported sugar from Mexico could impact the U.S. sugar program. The U.S.-Mexico sugar suspension agreements are controversial as they may not have entirely eliminated the injury to U.S. sugar interests. Stakeholders argue that these agreements could lead to government outlays if market distortions trigger forfeitures of domestic sugar. The implications of revising, withdrawing, or keeping the agreements in force could affect the U.S. sugar program. The American Sugar Alliance supports retaining the current sugar program structure to address foreign sugar subsidies. Sugar users advocate for more flexibility in managing domestic sugar supplies and import quotas. Payment limits for farm commodity programs aim to control the maximum amount of payments a person can receive per year. The controversy over payment limits for farm commodity programs revolves around the size of farms that should be supported, whether payments should be proportional to production or limited per individual, and who should receive payments. Some policymakers advocate for tighter limits to save money and address concerns overpayments to large farms, while others argue against penalizing larger farms for their efficiencies. Crop insurance, which has no payment limits, is seen as a beneficial aspect of farm policy that supports both small and large farms without favoring one over the other. Trade is crucial for the U.S. agricultural sector, with exports contributing over 30% of farm earnings. The United States, as a WTO member, must adhere to WTO rules governing domestic farm policy. The country's farm policy is closely scrutinized for compliance with WTO regulations, as seen in the 2009 WTO challenge by Brazil against U.S. cotton support programs. Pressure exists to minimize trade-distorting incentives in farm safety net programs, with CBO projections indicating compliance with WTO spending limits. The concern is that U.S. agricultural trade could be affected by distortions from U.S. policy, which may lead to challenges under WTO rules. There are criticisms of the farm safety net programs for being slow to respond to disasters and not providing adequate risk protection. Some argue that government funding for farm subsidies could be better spent on environmental goals or improving productivity. Some argue that government funding for farm subsidies could be better spent on advancing environmental goals or improving productivity. Others oppose the programs, citing economic arguments that they distort production, benefit resource owners, harm smaller producers, and pay benefits to high-income recipients. Producers in specialty crops, organic agriculture, and local foods sectors advocate for a more equitable farm bill that extends benefits to them. Specialty crops, including fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, and horticulture, are a significant part of U.S. agriculture. In 2012, farm-level specialty crop production was valued at nearly $60 billion, accounting for a quarter of U.S. crop production. Retail sales of fresh and processed fruits and vegetables total around $100 billion annually, with exports reaching about $26 billion in 2015. These sectors are eligible for various USDA programs and support under different farm bill titles, along with contributions from other federal agencies. In 2015, specialty crops totaled about $26 billion. There were over 244,000 farming operations growing various types of specialty crops in 2012. USDA organic certified products generated $5.5 billion in farm sales in 2014. Leading organic commodities include milk, eggs, broiler chickens, lettuce, apples, meat products, grapes, corn, hay, and spinach. California, Florida, and Washington are key states for organic production. Organic production in the U.S. accounts for 1% of total cropland, with key states being California, Florida, Washington, Pennsylvania, Oregon, Texas, and Wisconsin. Organic sales reached $43.3 billion in 2015, representing 5% of all food sales. U.S. organic exports total about $2 billion annually. Local food production involves various farm businesses, with no established definition but generally refers to agricultural production and marketing within a certain geographic proximity or involving specific social or supply chain characteristics. Sales of locally produced foods are a small but growing part of U.S. agriculture. Sales of locally produced foods in the U.S. totaled $6.1 billion in 2012, with sales from 164,000 farmers. This represents 8% of U.S. farms and 1.5% of total agricultural production value. The 2008 and 2014 farm bills increased support for specialty crops, organic agriculture, and local foods. The 2014 bill saw a $340 million increase in spending for programs supporting these sectors. The horticulture title programs are set to increase by nearly $340 million over the next five years compared to the previous period. Despite this, funding for this title still makes up less than half of 1% of total mandatory farm bill spending. Specialty crops, organic agriculture, and local food systems are expected to receive about $770 million annually. Key programs include the Specialty Crop Block Grant Program, the Specialty Crop Research Initiative, pest and disease prevention programs, and nutrition programs for fruits and vegetables. Additionally, the 2014 farm bill allocated an extra $300 million annually for related programs. The USDA offers various programs that cater to the interests of different groups, including marketing, promotion, food and nutrition, research, extension, and conservation programs. Congress has authorized programs to support specialty crops and organic production, benefiting these sectors. Specific programs for specialty crop and organic producers are detailed in CRS reports. Despite some shared interests, there are differences between U.S. programs. The U.S. specialty crop and organic producers have different farm bill priorities and support different key programs. The horticulture sector is diverse, with advocates having varied policy priorities. The certified organic and local foods sectors also have diverse priorities. The specialty crop industry is expected to call for increased funding for USDA programs, while the certified organic and local food sectors are likely to seek more support due to growing consumer demand and producer investment. The expansion of organic and locally produced food sectors may lead to increased support at USDA and state levels, facing resistance from traditional agricultural producers and established program recipients in the fruit and vegetable sectors. Specialty crop interest groups and leading state agencies have recommended maintaining funding for nutrition programs and increasing support for block grants, research programs, and plant pest and disease programs. The SCFBA recommended expanded funding for block grants, plant pest and disease programs, research programs, and disaster assistance in the next farm bill. They also suggested maintaining funding for USDA's Market Access Program and expanding the Technical Assistance for Specialty Crops. Additionally, they proposed expanding certain conservation programs to assist specialty crop producers and continuing funding for the Value-Added Producer Grant Program. The organic industry also promoted recommendations for existing programs, including funding for the National Organic Program. The farm bill focuses on existing programs for organic agriculture, including funding for the National Organic Program and support for research initiatives. It also addresses issues such as access to conservation programs, crop insurance, and marketing challenges. Programs supporting specialty crops and organic agriculture are also backed by organizations promoting local food systems. The Senior Farmers Market Nutrition Program, SNAP-related policies, and incentives support various rural development programs, including the Rural Micro-Entrepreneur Assistance Program. Senator Debbie Stabenow introduced the Urban Agriculture Act of 2016 to expand farm programs and funding for urban agriculture. The 2018 farm bill proposed expanded support for urban farming and risk management tools. Legislation in the 114th Congress aimed to address food waste with funding for composting and energy projects. Food waste efforts were also discussed in hearings by the House Agriculture Committee in May 2016. The House Agriculture Committee held a hearing on food waste in May 2016, which could be part of the larger farm bill debate. Livestock and poultry producers traditionally do not receive farm revenue support programs like major crops. Instead, they rely on the federal government for animal health protection, trade rules, and meat quality assurance. The 2014 farm bill's \"Miscellaneous\" title included provisions for livestock and poultry producers, with a focus on animal health programs. The 2014 farm bill included funding for various animal health programs, such as the Trichinae Certification Program, National Aquatic Animal Health Plan, National Animal Health Laboratory Network, and National Poultry Improvement Plan. It also addressed country-of-origin labeling (COOL) and USDA catfish inspection. Congress repealed beef and pork COOL provisions in December 2015. The 2014 farm bill confirmed the catfish inspection provision transferring it to USDA and defined catfish as \"all fish of the order 'Siluriformes'\". The final rule was issued in December 2015, effective in March 2016. Funding was provided for the National Sheep Industry Improvement Center. The bill also reauthorized disaster assistance programs for livestock and poultry producers. In the upcoming farm bill debate, Congress is expected to consider extending support for the livestock and poultry sectors through existing animal health programs. The 2014 farm bill reauthorized and funded existing animal health programs to protect animals and producers. The outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in 2014-2015 highlighted the USDA's crucial role in animal health. The livestock industry may seek expanded indemnities or disease insurance. There are concerns about foot-and-mouth disease, with calls for a vaccine stockpile. Congressional hearings in 2016 addressed FMD preparedness at USDA's APHIS. The last U.S. FMD outbreak was in 1929, and another outbreak would be devastating for U.S. livestock producers with estimated annual losses of nearly $13 billion over 10 years. U.S. law does not allow for domestic production of FMD vaccine, and USDA's current vaccine supplies would be insufficient in the event of a large outbreak. The livestock industry is calling for USDA to expand funding and capabilities to provide sufficient vaccine doses if needed. Expansion of feral swine eradication programs is also a potential farm bill issue, as feral hogs cause significant damages to agriculture and the U.S. economy annually. The U.S. economy faces annual crop and natural resource destruction from feral swine, which also spread animal diseases. Congress allocated $20 million to APHIS in 2014 for feral swine programs. There is debate on expanding funding for these programs. Additionally, there is ongoing controversy over USDA rules proposed by GIPSA in 2010, which divide livestock and poultry producers. The Trump Administration must decide whether to proceed with these rules. Farm and rancher groups may look to the farm bill for solutions. Some farm and rancher groups and rural advocacy groups may propose new policies in the farm bill to support producers, particularly contract growers. Current law requires minimum care standards for animals bred for commercial sale, used in research, or exhibited to the public. There is a debate on voluntary approaches to farm animal welfare, with increased consumer interest in the topic. Congress has debated horse slaughter during appropriations debates since FY2007. In the ongoing debate over horse slaughter, Congress has prohibited USDA's Food Safety Inspection Service from carrying out horse slaughter, except for FY2012-FY2014. The Safeguard American Food Exports Act of 2017 proposed banning horse meat for human consumption and transporting horses for slaughter. A new farm bill could potentially resolve the annual appropriations debate on horse slaughter. The federal government has a history of providing credit assistance to farmers for various reasons, including market failure and targeted lending to disadvantaged groups. The USDA Farm Service Agency (FSA) and the Farm Credit System (FCS) are agricultural lenders with federal mandates. FSA provides direct loans to farmers who cannot qualify for commercial credit and targets loans to beginning farmers and socially disadvantaged groups. FCS serves only agriculture-related borrowers and receives tax benefits as a government-sponsored enterprise. The Farm Credit System (FCS) is a government-sponsored enterprise that accounts for 40% of farm debt. Farmer Mac, another government-sponsored enterprise, provides a secondary market for agricultural loans. The statutory authority for FSA, FCS, and Farmer Mac is permanent, but farm bills often make adjustments to eligibility criteria and operations. The 2014 farm bill made small policy changes to USDA and FCS farm lending programs, including eliminating term limits on USDA-guaranteed farm operating loans and increasing the maximum size of down payment loans. The 2014 farm bill made adjustments to USDA and FCS farm lending programs, including increasing the percentage of conservation loans guaranteed and adding a lending priority for beginning farmers. Compensation decisions for FCS executives now rest with FCS boards of directors. Credit issues are not expected to be a major focus of a new farm bill, but potential changes could target resources to beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers or support emerging agricultural sectors like local food systems and organic agriculture. The USDA conducts research in various agricultural areas, including traditional production techniques, organic agriculture, bioenergy, nutrition, food safety, and economic decision-making. This research is carried out by government-employed scientists at federal facilities and through grants to universities and other institutions. The USDA conducts research in various agricultural areas through four agencies under the Research, Education, and Economics (REE) mission area. These agencies include the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), the Economic Research Service (ERS), and the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). They focus on research, education, and statistics related to food, agriculture, rural development, and the environment. The 2014 farm bill reauthorized funding for USDA research activities through FY2018, with increased mandatory spending for programs like SCRI, OREI, and BFRDP. It also established the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research to support public/private partnerships. Some programs lack funding beyond FY2018, requiring policymakers to decide on their continuation. In the new farm bill debate, policymakers need to find offsets for continuing programs like OREI, BFRDP, and the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research. USDA allocates over half of its research budget to intramural agencies, raising concerns about coordination with extramural research. The split between formula and competitive funding for NIFA's extramural research is also a topic of debate, especially regarding programs like AFRI. Despite concerns about funding allocation and prioritization in the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI), interest groups may seek inclusion via farm bill legislation for more funding. The federal government supports U.S. agricultural exports through export market development and export credit guarantees. The 2014 farm bill eliminated the Dairy Export Incentive Program, removing direct export subsidies for U.S. agricultural products. USDA's export promotion programs, administered by the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), are generally funded using mandatory monies. The Market Access Program (MAP) was targeted for cuts but was retained intact in the 2014 farm bill. The 2014 farm bill extended budget authority for export market development programs through FY2018, making funding mandatory and not subject to annual appropriations. It also reauthorized GSM-102 and the Facility Guarantee Program for short-term export credit guarantees. CCC provides payment guarantees for commercial financing of U.S. agricultural exports under these programs. The 2014 farm bill extended export market development programs' budget authority through FY2018, reauthorizing GSM-102 and the Facility Guarantee Program for short-term export credit guarantees. Changes were made to comply with a WTO decision in a cotton case won by Brazil, including shortening the loan guarantee period to two years and broadening the scope of TASC funding. The 2014 farm bill directed USDA to propose a plan to reorganize its international trade functions, including establishing an Under Secretary for Farm and Foreign Agricultural Affairs. Former USDA Secretary Vilsack intended to lay the groundwork for this task, but as of early 2017, no plan had been transmitted to Congress. Federal support for agricultural export promotion through programs like MAP and FMDP has raised questions about government funding for private sector activities. Critics argue that these programs may be considered corporate welfare and suggest that funds could be better spent on educating U.S. firms about exporting and overcoming trade barriers. With declining U.S. exports and farm income, discussions on the effectiveness of export promotion programs and the need for new approaches may arise in a new farm bill. Since the previous farm bill, U.S. exports and farm income have decreased. Policymakers may debate the eligibility of organizations and funding levels for trade programs. Congress could revisit reorganizing USDA's international trade functions under a new Under Secretary position. Other trade issues outside the farm bill may include multilateral and bilateral negotiations. The U.S. has been a leader in global funding for international food assistance for over 60 years. The U.S. has been a leader in global funding for international food assistance for over 60 years, with programs supporting agricultural safety nets, trade goals, and hunger relief. Most assistance is based on U.S. agricultural commodity donations and shipped on U.S.-flag vessels. Two agencies, USAID and FAS, implement these programs, with USAID's Food for Peace Title II being the largest program. The United States provides U.S. agricultural commodities as emergency and economic development assistance in response to food security issues in developing countries. Programs funded through the farm bill authorization include Food for Peace, Food for Progress, McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program, and the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust. Title II of Food for Peace Act is administered by USAID and provides donations of U.S. agricultural commodities for emergency food needs. The 2014 farm bill made changes to U.S. international food assistance programs, including enacting flexibilities into the Food for Peace Act and making the Local and Regional Food Aid Procurement Projects program permanent. It also increased funding to $80 million per year and introduced additional reporting requirements. These programs have sparked debate on whether to relax, retain, or strengthen statutory requirements. The 115th Congress may continue discussions on U.S. international food assistance programs, including potential new legislation addressing global hunger issues. Previous debates focused on altering requirements for food aid sourcing, transportation, and monetization to support Food for Peace development programs. Proponents of increased flexibility argue it could benefit more people at no extra cost, while supporters of existing mechanisms highlight the value of leveraging international programs to also support U.S. interests. The 2016 Global Food Security Act established the Emergency Food Security Program (EFSP) without restrictions on sourcing or shipping. The Act mandated coordination of U.S. programs addressing hunger internationally, with authorizations for food aid programs expiring after FY2018. Congressional discussions may arise on coordinating oversight and reauthorization across agricultural and foreign affairs jurisdictions. USAID's Office of Food for Peace implements EFSP, but the program lacks funding. The Emergency Food Security Program (EFSP) implemented by USAID's Office of Food for Peace operates without funding authorized through the Food for Peace Act. Domestic food assistance programs reauthorized in the farm bill's nutrition title include SNAP, TEFAP, CSFP, FDPIR, and other programs administered by USDA's Food and Nutrition Service. The nutrition title makes up nearly 80% of spending under the 2014 farm bill, with SNAP accounting for the majority of the spending. The 2014 farm bill's nutrition title includes SNAP, which accounts for the majority of spending. Changes in SNAP were projected to save $8 billion over 10 years. Most domestic food assistance programs are mandatory spending, funded through appropriations laws. Discretionary spending programs in the farm bill include CSFP, TEFAP, and FDPIR. The 2014 farm bill's nutrition title includes SNAP, which accounts for the majority of spending. Changes in SNAP were projected to save $8 billion over 10 years. Most domestic food assistance programs are mandatory spending, funded through appropriations laws. Discretionary spending programs in the farm bill include CSFP, a portion of TEFAP, and FDPIR. Typically, WIC and child nutrition programs are not reauthorized in the farm bill. Despite efforts to complete the next child nutrition reauthorization during the 114th Congress, the legislation did not advance beyond committees. SNAP, formerly known as the Food Stamp Program, provides benefits to low-income households on EBT cards. In FY2016, an average of 44.2 million individuals in 21.8 million households participated in SNAP each month, with federal spending totaling approximately $70.8 billion. Benefits are calculated on a household basis, with eligibility determined through traditional or categorical paths based on income and assets. SNAP eligibility is based on income and assets, with income needing to be at or below 130% of the federal poverty level. Household net monthly income must be at 100% of the federal poverty level. Asset rules are set at $2,000 per household. Categorical eligibility allows automatic SNAP eligibility for those in other means-tested programs like SSI, TANF, or GA. States can extend SNAP eligibility to TANF recipients without an asset test. The 2014 farm bill made changes to SNAP, including the elimination of the asset test and implementing work-related requirements. SNAP benefits are calculated based on household size and deductions. The bill also modified how LIHEAP payments affect SNAP benefits, reducing benefits in some states. Additionally, it included policies for the SNAP Employment and Training program. The 2014 farm bill made changes to SNAP, including pilot project authority and funding for work programs. It also required stores to stock more fresh foods, retailers to pay for EBT machines, and provided funding to combat trafficking. Additionally, the bill included funding for Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentive grants and TEFAP assistance for USDA-purchased commodity foods. TEFAP provides USDA-purchased commodity foods to states for needy persons through food packages or meals. States determine eligibility and choose local agencies. National networks like Feeding America are involved. States receive entitlement commodities and discretionary funds for administration and distribution. Bonus commodities supplement state entitlements. The 2014 farm bill increased funding for TEFAP entitlement commodities. The 2014 farm bill increased funding for TEFAP entitlement commodities by $125 million over 5 years and $205 million over 10 years. Funding is also available for CSFP, which provides supplemental foods to low-income elderly persons. Eligibility is limited to those with income below 130% of the federal poverty income guidelines. USDA purchases and distributes the foods to grantees, who also receive funding for administrative costs based on the number of persons served in the prior year. New projects can be added if new money is appropriated or allocated slots are not used. In FY2016, 47 states, the District of Columbia, and two Indian Tribal Organizations operated CSFP projects. The 2014 farm bill changed CSFP's eligibility rules, phasing out eligibility for low-income pregnant, postpartum, and breastfeeding women, infants, and children. Nearly all of the over 585,000 program participants were elderly. Puerto Rico, American Samoa, and CNMI do not participate in SNAP but receive a nutrition assistance block grant. Indian tribal organizations may choose to operate FDPIR instead of SNAP. The federal government covers the full cost of benefits and most administrative expenses. The federal government covers the full cost of benefits and most administrative expenses for food assistance programs on Indian reservations. The 2014 farm bill included policies related to the programs, such as the Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition Program (SFMNP) providing vouchers for low-income seniors to redeem at farmers' markets. The bill also maintained mandatory funding for SFMNP at $20.6 million per year and included provisions for USDA commodity foods in school meal programs. The 2014 farm bill extended USDA's authority to enter reprocessing agreements with private companies for commodity foods and allowed USDA to contract with processors while retaining title to the foods. It also required $50 million of additional acquisitions of fruits and vegetables to be fresh produce and created a pilot grant program for local sourcing. Additionally, the bill included a pulse crop pilot program and permanently authorized the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program. The 2014 farm bill permanently authorized and funded the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program. It also established a pilot grant program for community food projects and increased mandatory funding from $5 million to $9 million per year. The bill was enacted amid contentious debate on SNAP spending and eligibility rules. The 115th Congress will debate controversial policies from House-passed bills in the next nutrition title. The Trump Administration may influence discussions in the reauthorization. SNAP issues from the 114th Congress and budgetary decisions will also be considered. Eligibility for SNAP is available to recipients of low-income programs like SSI and TANF. The \"broad-based\" categorical eligibility option allows states to assess SNAP eligibility without considering assets. SNAP law includes rules on work-related activities for able-bodied adult participants, with some requirements varying by state. The role of asset tests in SNAP may be reconsidered in a new farm bill. The Employment and Training Program (E&T) under SNAP has rules regarding participation, time limits for ABAWDs, waivers, and exemptions. Controversy surrounds the enforcement of time limits, with fewer states eligible for waivers. Participants are increasingly being time-limited off benefits. A new farm bill may propose changes to work-related rules for SNAP benefits based on evaluations of pilot programs. There is ongoing debate about what foods SNAP benefits should be allowed to purchase. The House Committee on Agriculture discussed SNAP-eligible foods and the potential for a new farm bill to address rules around eligible foods and retailers. States can apply to USDA for permission to run demonstration projects to restrict certain foods from SNAP purchases, but none have been approved yet. Previous farm bills have funded incentives for SNAP participants to buy fruits and vegetables. The 2014 farm bill authorized the Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentive grant program, with potential for further support in a new farm bill. Changes to SNAP-authorized retailer inventory requirements will impact stores starting in May 2017. The conservation title of the farm bill promotes resource-conserving practices on private land, with a history of broadening conservation topics since 1985. The USDA administers conservation programs to assist private landowners with natural resource concerns, offering technical and financial assistance in exchange for implementing resource-conserving practices. These programs aim to improve or restore degraded resources and prevent future degradation, with goals related to soil, water, and wildlife. Each farm bill since 1985 has expanded the range of issues addressed and funding levels for conservation programs. The 2014 farm bill reauthorized, repealed, consolidated, and amended various conservation programs grouped into working land, land retirement, easement, compliance, and other programs. These programs receive mandatory funding and have authorities expiring in FY2018. Other conservation programs like watershed and emergency land rehabilitation have permanent authorities and receive annual appropriations. The conservation title in the farm bill accounts for 6% of the total funding, with current budget constraints driving the debate. The 2014 farm bill reduced conservation funding by $3.97 billion over 10 years, reflecting a 24% decrease in savings. Budgetary dynamics continue to impact the conservation title. The conservation title in the farm bill is affected by budgetary dynamics like sequestration and annual appropriations reductions. Uncertainty remains on how these reductions will impact a new farm bill's baseline. Producers support conservation programs, but it's unclear how much they would reduce other farm program spending to expand conservation efforts. Previous farm bills showed a need for expanding conservation due to backlogs of interested producers unable to enroll due to lack of funds. Demand for conservation programs exceeds available funding, with working lands programs only able to fund a fraction of applications received. The working lands programs funded a fraction of applications received for CSP, EQIP, and AMA. The acceptance rates for CRP general sign-up, CRP grasslands enrollment, and ACEP easements were low. The new RCPP had high demand but accepted only a portion of proposed projects. Backlogs suggest a need for additional funding or policy changes to reduce demand. Land retirement programs like CRP benefit producers. Land retirement programs like CRP provide financial incentives for producers to temporarily remove environmentally sensitive land from production. Working lands programs such as EQIP offer incentives for adopting resource-conserving practices while keeping land in production. Farm bill conservation policy has shifted towards working lands programs due to high commodity prices and new technologies. A potential shift in focus towards increasing funding for land retirement programs could occur in the future. Interest is increasing in partnership programs that target conservation funding to local areas of concern, leveraging private and federal funding. The Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP) receives $100 million annually and redirects 7% of funding from other programs to partnership agreements. RCPP has received considerable interest in its fourth year of project selection. The Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP) has garnered interest in its fourth year of project selection. Some praise its ability to leverage nonfederal funding and involve state and local partners, while others question if funds are directed to areas with established support rather than those with the greatest resource concerns. The 1985 farm bill introduced conservation programs tied to farm benefits, which have been amended over time. The 2014 farm bill added crop insurance premium subsidies as a benefit, contingent on meeting conservation standards. Since its introduction in the 1985 farm bill, conservation compliance has remained a controversial issue, with a high certification rate of 98.2% reported by USDA in 2015. Despite being viewed as burdensome, conservation compliance requirements are necessary to address environmental impacts related to agriculture. Conservation programs are seen as a way to prevent or reduce the need for environmental regulation, and debate on this issue is likely to continue. Since 1973, omnibus farm bills have included a rural development title, focusing on creating new competitive advantages in rural areas to better compete globally. The debate on the future of rural America also includes the need for new approaches to federal assistance. The rural development title of farm bills provides assistance for rural business creation, infrastructure, housing, electricity, broadband, water, and wastewater. Policymakers have also supported innovative business development and financing mechanisms. Support for alternative approaches is expected to continue as rural communities vary in growth and prosperity. The 2014 farm bill reauthorized programs for rural development, including assistance for rural business creation, infrastructure, housing, electricity, broadband, water, and wastewater. Concerns exist about the effectiveness of USDA's targeting of rural development funding. The bill directed USDA to collect data on economic activities created through rural development grants and loans. The 2014 farm bill authorized a new Strategic Economic and Community Development initiative to support economic development plans on a multi-jurisdictional basis, giving priority to certain projects and reserving 10% of available appropriations for community facilities, rural utilities, and rural business. It also created other rural development programs and authorized the Rural Energy Savings Program to provide loans for energy efficiency measures in rural households and small businesses. The 2014 farm bill authorized the Rural Business Development Grants program, merging two grant programs and reauthorizing loans for locally produced agricultural food products. Priority is given to projects benefitting underserved communities with limited access to healthy foods. Grants were also authorized for technical assistance and training in rural areas. The development title includes provisions to reauthorize and amend loan and grant programs for broadband, rural water infrastructure, business development, and regional development. One mandatory spending authorization of $150 million is allocated for reducing the backlog of water and wastewater applications. The 2014 farm bill expanded the definition of rural areas for housing programs. Some policymakers argue that current farm policies have a limited impact on most rural areas' vitality. Rural manufacturing faces challenges from foreign competition, while service employment tends to be lower-wage. Economic development efforts focus on entrepreneurial strategies and microenterprise development, leveraging local strengths. Developing a regional entrepreneurial culture is seen as crucial for rural development, with policymakers suggesting a reevaluation of federal assistance structures. Emphasizing socioeconomic relations between rural and urban areas within a regional context could lead to more successful outcomes. Redesigning existing programs to target regional efforts may yield positive results. Redesigning existing programs to better target regional efforts could yield positive results. The 2014 farm bill authorized new data collection to assess federal development assistance to rural businesses. Application processes for program loans and grants can be a barrier for many rural projects, especially in smaller, poorer areas. Assistance is currently provided through direct and guaranteed loans, limiting overall development strategy integration. Rural communities may benefit from technical assistance for strategic planning. Interagency coordination among federal agencies targeting rural areas needs improvement. In the current budget environment, advancing new approaches to rural development in a new farm bill may be challenging. Many in Congress believe federal approaches to rural development need reexamination and better targeting of programs. The Renewable Fuel Standard has spurred commercial interest in renewable energy, particularly ethanol and biodiesel production, seen as a catalyst for rural economic development. The USDA renewable energy programs incentivize adoption of solar, wind, and anaerobic digesters for rural economic development and reducing U.S. dependence on foreign energy imports. Initially focused on biofuels like ethanol and biodiesel, the programs now promote renewable power and biomass-based products. Federal programs supporting renewable energy production often originate outside the farm bill. The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-171) was the first omnibus farm bill to include an energy title, authorizing grants and loans for research on agriculture-based renewable energy. Subsequent energy bills in 2005 and 2007 expanded renewable energy programs. The 2014 farm bill focused on noncorn feedstocks for biofuels in response to concerns about increased corn use for ethanol production. The 2014 farm bill, like previous farm bills, included an energy title with reduced mandatory and discretionary funding for bioenergy programs. Congress has cut funding for these programs through annual appropriations bills and has limited discretionary funding to certain programs like REAP and the Sun Grant Initiative. Some energy programs are authorized in the energy title, while others are in different titles. The 2014 farm bill brought significant changes to bioenergy programs, including BCAP, REAP, and BRDI. Funding availability was limited, eligibility requirements were altered, and certain programs were repealed. USDA's Rural Development Agency administers BAP, RAP, and REAP, while FSA administers BCAP and NIFA administers BRDI. Only REAP is authorized beyond FY2018. The farm bill's bioenergy programs face funding challenges as mandatory baseline funding for several programs expires before FY2018. Congress may reassess the utility of these programs in light of budget constraints, with BCAP funding limited to $3 million for FY2016. These programs were established when oil prices were higher and the US was more reliant on imported energy. The 2008 farm bill led to changes in energy policy, with a focus on biofuels and renewable energy. Congress is considering the role of a new farm bill in shaping the country's energy future, including the potential benefits for rural America. Forestland in the US covers one-third of the land area, providing resources for lumber production. The forestland in the United States covers 766 million acres and provides wood for various materials and ecological services. The federal government owns one-third of the forestland (238 million acres), while nonindustrial private landowners own 298 million acres. The Forest Service manages 19% of all U.S. forestlands (145 million acres) and provides assistance to nonfederal landowners. Past farm bills have included forestry provisions. The 2014 farm bill included forestry provisions that authorized stewardship contracting and extended the good neighbor authority nationwide. A new farm bill could modify existing programs and establish new options for forestry research, federal land management, and assistance to nonfederal forest owners. Potential issues to be addressed in a new farm bill's forestry title include expanded wildfire protection, support for woody biomass energy, and controls for invasive species. The 2002 farm bill authorized a community wildfire protection program, but it has only been funded as part of state fire assistance. New programs for wildfire protection on federal and nonfederal lands may be considered in a new farm bill. Interest in energy production from woody biomass and other renewable sources is driven by supply efforts to reduce wildfire threats and demand for renewable transportation fuels. Budgetary challenges face many energy programs, and a new farm bill may extend, expand, alter, or terminate these programs. Invasive species, such as exotic plants and animals, are a major threat to forests and rangelands in the United States and globally. Options to prevent their spread, especially on private forestlands, may be addressed in a new farm bill."
