    "content": "The process for raising a constitutional point of order against a pending question is the same as for raising other points of order. A Senator would address the presiding officer when no one else holds the floor, stating how the pending matter violates the Constitution. Raising a constitutional point of order confers no special recognition rights unless specified by a unanimous consent agreement. No Senator can interrupt another Senator without consent for raising a point of order. After raising the point of order, the Senator loses the floor but can seek recognition again from the presiding officer. A UC agreement may impact the availability of a point of order by prohibiting certain points of order or specifying a vote at a specific time without interruptions. If a UC agreement limits debate time, a point of order can only be raised after the time has been used or yielded back, unless by unanimous consent. This is because a new UC agreement would be needed to allow a point of order before the debate is complete. The Senate follows precedents that require constitutional points of order to be submitted for decision rather than ruled upon by the presiding officer. This practice has varied throughout history, with a period in the late 19th and early 20th centuries resembling the current practice in the House of Representatives. Members are expected to express their opinion on the constitutionality of a measure through their vote. The Senate generally submits constitutional points of order for decision rather than ruling on them directly. A majority vote is needed to sustain a point of order, which can be debated unless the Senate is under cloture. Cloture could be used to end debate and force a vote on the point of order. Statutory provisions may limit debate on points of order, and a non-debatable motion to table can also be used. The Senate submits constitutional points of order for decision rather than ruling on them directly. A majority vote is needed to sustain a point of order, which can be debated unless the Senate is under cloture. A non-debatable motion to table can be made at any time after the point of order has been raised, requiring a majority vote to agree. If agreed to, it permanently disposes of the point of order.

Constitutional points of order are not common, relative to many other points of order that are more routinely made. Table 1 presents data on constitutional points of order in the Senate made since 1989 on which the Senate voted. Since 1989, the Senate has voted on constitutional points of order, with more than half being disposed of negatively. Five of the six sustained points were related to an alleged violation of the Origination Clause. The House may only originate revenue measures, with most constitutional points of order raised in recent Congresses related to provisions other than the Origination Clause. This shift in the grounds for points of order mirrors historical variations in constitutional challenges. In recent decades, points of order in Congress have been raised on various constitutional grounds, including the Senate's rule-making ability, proposing amendments, representation and apportionment issues, the line item veto, Equal Protection Clause, First Amendment, Due Process Clause, congressional apportionment, and powers of Congress and states."
