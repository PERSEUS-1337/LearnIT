This has squeezed profit margins, decreased the sector's value-share relative to crops, and may lead to herd liquidation, resulting in higher retail prices for meat and dairy products. The report discusses the impact of rising feed costs on livestock product prices in the U.S., highlighting the challenges faced by the livestock sector. It also provides background information on the feed grain sector and the types of feedstuffs used in livestock and poultry rations. Livestock producers aim to find cost-effective feed sources to maintain profitability. Livestock and poultry producers seek cost-effective feed sources for optimal weight gain, egg production, and milk output. A balanced nutrient intake of energy, protein, and roughage, along with essential vitamins and minerals, is crucial for animal health and productivity. Various natural feed ingredients can meet these nutritional requirements, tailored to the specific needs of different livestock and poultry species based on digestive capabilities, age, sex, breed, health, and reproductive status. Livestock producers must balance animals' nutritional needs with feed cost and availability. Ruminant animals can digest high-fiber roughages, while monogastric and avian species struggle with cellulosic material. Swine and poultry rely on feed grains and protein meals, while cattle and dairy cows consume roughage. The hog industry heavily relies on the U.S. corn crop for feed. The growth of U.S. poultry meat production has led to increased protein meal consumption. Livestock and poultry producers have flexibility in choosing feeds based on nutritional needs and availability. Feed costs make up a significant portion of operating expenses. Changes in feed grain supply, influenced by weather variations, impact market prices. Various factors affect the total supply of feeds, including producer choices and agricultural policies. Livestock and poultry feeders consider planting choices, agricultural policies, climate, soil type, processing and storage facilities, and international market conditions when making feed decisions. Comparative market prices and nutrient requirements influence feed choices, with sensitivity to price changes and proximity to feed sources. Planning ahead is crucial due to shifting nutrient needs and feed availabilities. Livestock producers must plan ahead to avoid cost-price squeezes caused by fluctuating feed grain prices, which are highly correlated and influenced by factors like weather and international demand. Corn plays a dominant role in feed grain markets, affecting the prices of other feedstuffs. Swine and poultry producers are more dependent on corn than cattle producers, especially before the final marketing stage. When the hog-corn or steer-corn price ratio becomes unfavorable, producers are at higher risk. Livestock producers may adjust their marketing strategies in response to changes in corn prices, impacting future market conditions. Cattle producers take longer to respond due to the lengthy gestation and growth cycle, while hog producers can adjust within months and broiler/egg producers within weeks. High feed costs are driven by tight supply prospects and long-run market forces, with U.S. corn stocks forecasted to reach historic low levels by the end of summer 2011. Stocks are expected to reach historic low levels relative to demand by the end of summer 2011. Uncertainty about the current crop outlook, late planting in the Northern Plains and Eastern Corn Belt, and a severe drought have dried up pasture lands, exposing cattle producers to expensive commercial feed markets. U.S. feed grain demand has exceeded production since 2004 due to factors such as rapid growth of U.S. corn-based ethanol production and strong income growth in international markets increasing demand for livestock. The demand for feed grains and protein meal has increased due to income growth in China and other international markets. Factors such as tight stocks, limited cropland, and industrialization of hog and poultry production are expected to maintain strong demand for feed grains, leading to record prices in 2011. Market observers are monitoring the tightness of commodity markets closely. The ratio of end-of-season stocks to total use of a commodity is crucial for monitoring market tightness. Season-ending stocks reflect supply and demand factors, with a certain level needed for continuous grain flow before the new crop. A stocks-to-use ratio below 7% raises market concerns, leading to price volatility. USDA projections for corn stocks by September 1, 2011, highlighted market sensitivity to unexpected news. According to USDA, the U.S. corn stocks-to-use ratio is expected to be 7.1% by September 1, 2011, the lowest since 1996. The ratio is forecasted to decline further to 5.4% in 2012 due to increased demand and limited production. Severe drought conditions have worsened across the Southern Plains, Southeast, New Mexico, and Arizona, reducing grazing opportunities and increasing reliance on commercial feed markets. The severe drought conditions in Texas and Oklahoma are expected to persist, leading to reduced grain crops and increased reliance on commercial feed markets for the livestock sector. If the drought continues into October, there may be lower winter wheat plantings, impacting ranchers who rely on pasture lands for cattle grazing. The U.S. agricultural landscape has changed dramatically since 2004 with the rise of the U.S. ethanol sector, leading to increased demand for corn. Ethanol production has grown significantly, using a large portion of the annual corn crop. Corn ethanol advocates argue that a significant amount of corn used for ethanol is returned to livestock feed markets. The ethanol sector argues that nearly 30% of corn used for ethanol is returned to livestock feed markets as high-valued distillers grains and solubles (DGS). Adjusted estimates show a 29% corn-for-ethanol use share in 2010/2011 compared to 9% in 2004/2005. Ethanol plants cover only variable operating expenses once built, benefiting from strong international crude oil prices. Despite high corn prices, the ethanol sector remains profitable and is the preferred buyer of local corn over other users. Total feed grains consumed by livestock and poultry have decreased by 11% in the past seven years, even when DGS supplies are included. Total feed grains consumed by livestock and poultry have fallen 11% from 7.1 billion bushels in 2004/2005 to a forecasted 6.3 billion bushels in 2011/2012. The expansion of the U.S. ethanol industry since 2005 has led to a strong positive link between crude oil and corn prices. Ethanol production from corn is nearing the maximum mandated level of 15 billion gallons by 2015, after which demand for corn is expected to slow dramatically. The outlook for corn-based ethanol production remains strong due to factors like the slow start-up of the cellulosic ethanol industry and congressional interest in budget savings. The eventual balance between ethanol production and corn demand will depend on market factors like crude oil prices and the U.S. domestic blend wall. China's rapid economic growth has led to increased demand for livestock feedstuffs, particularly soybeans. Consumer demand for meat is closely tied to income growth, with China's upper-middle income population expected to grow significantly in the coming years. China's feed industry in China has been growing at nearly 10% annually, with the country increasingly relying on international markets due to limited domestic resources. China's soybean imports have risen significantly, accounting for a high percentage of usage. Future import and demand increases are expected to slow down in line with income growth projections. China's increasing reliance on international markets for corn imports is a growing concern, with projections showing a decline in import growth rates. Recent purchases from the U.S. and predictions of future large imports have raised alarms. The USDA's baseline study forecasts strong income growth in major foreign markets, leading to increased per capita income over the next decade. The USDA projects strong demand for livestock and poultry products over the next decade, leading to challenges for producers to keep pace. The weakening U.S. dollar has made agricultural products more price competitive in international markets, offsetting the rise in commodity prices. The demand for U.S. feed grains remains high despite rising commodity prices, leading to challenges in production due to land and water constraints. Total planted acres for major field crops have plateaued around 250 million acres since 1990. Total planted acres for major field crops have hovered around 250 million acres, with corn and soybeans gaining acres at the expense of other crops. Set-aside programs ended in 1996, but as of March 2011, over 31 million acres were enrolled in the CRP. There is a debate between CRP defenders and those seeking access to more cropland or concerned about the cost. Future crop production growth will likely depend on yield gains, impacted by weather patterns and investments in agricultural research. The demand for a good decreases when its price increases, with the degree of decrease known as \"responsiveness.\" Lack of substitutes and industrialization of agricultural processes can reduce price responsiveness. A recent study shows that feed grain demand is becoming less responsive to price increases, leading to higher and more volatile prices. Factors contributing to this decline include biofuels policy favoring ethanol demand for corn and high livestock prices since 2009. The study highlights factors driving high demand for corn, such as livestock prices, tight feed grain stocks, limited cropland supply, and trade policies restricting international supplies. Until global stocks rebuild, agricultural markets are at risk of price volatility. Despite slowing demand growth, tight world stocks for corn and soybeans are expected to persist for several years, leading to higher feed costs since 2007. Since 2007, U.S. and global feed costs have risen sharply due to various factors like biofuels policy, resource scarcity, market conditions, and weather events. This has led to feed demand surpassing supply, impacting the livestock and poultry sector with declining profit margins and potential herd liquidation. The current prolonged drought in the Southwest and Southeast worsens the feed supply shortage, resulting in higher retail prices for meat and dairy products. The 2008 farm bill authorized three new livestock assistance programs to help ranchers facing feed supply shortages. These programs include the Livestock Forage Disaster Program (LFP), the Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP), and the Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program (ELAP). These programs provide compensation for livestock mortality, grazing on drought-affected land, and disaster losses not covered by other programs. The Livestock Forage Disaster Program (LFP), Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP), and Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program (ELAP) compensate producers for disaster losses not covered by other programs. These programs expire on September 30, 2011, with uncertain reauthorization due to lack of baseline funding. Precautionary measures in spring can help mitigate economic losses from drought or high feed costs, with federal risk management tools and commercial hedging operations available. USDA offers limited livestock programs under federal crop insurance, including new programs for livestock and dairy producers. Index-based policies are also available to insure against losses on pasture, rangeland, and forage, addressing concerns about increasing price volatility in the U.S. dairy industry. The U.S. dairy industry is concerned about price volatility in commercial feed markets and is exploring a federal dairy program for margin protection. Federal policies linked to feed availability decline and high commodity prices include biofuels and land-use policies. High market prices have led to a decrease in payments for crop producers under price contingent farm programs. Livestock feed availability issues are becoming more important to Congress. The availability of feed and its impact on the U.S. livestock and poultry sectors, as well as potential retail food price inflation, are key concerns for Congress. They are also closely monitoring any unintended consequences on the livestock sector from corn use for ethanol production. The upcoming farm bill debate is expected to focus on feed availability, market price volatility, and federal support for risk management tools for agricultural producers. Feed grains like corn, sorghum, barley, oats, and feed wheat are the main energy sources for livestock, providing energy for body maintenance and meat, milk, and egg production. Poultry and hogs are the main users of feed grains, with corn being the most important feed ingredient. Corn accounts for 92% of U.S. feed grains produced and 65% of all U.S. feedstuffs consumed. Corn is a key feed grain in the U.S., accounting for 92% of feed grains produced and 65% of all feedstuffs consumed. It is deficient in certain nutrients but is high in carbohydrates and fats. The U.S. is the largest producer, consumer (38% of world use), and exporter (60% of global exports) of corn. The crop is mainly grown in the Corn Belt region, with over 86 million acres planted annually since 2005. U.S. corn is highly valued in international markets for its nutritional profile and palatability. It is used in various food and industrial products such as starch, sweeteners, corn oil, and fuel ethanol. While traditionally used as a main energy ingredient in livestock feed, a growing share of the U.S. corn crop is now consumed by the ethanol industry, increasing from less than 6% in 1999 to over 40% in 2010. In 2011, USDA forecasts that the volume of corn used for ethanol will exceed corn fed to livestock for the first time in history, putting upward pressure on U.S. corn prices. Corn demand for feed varies seasonally, with highest use in the first and second quarters after harvest. Corn use varies by region, with surplus in the Corn Belt, Lake States, and Northern Plains. Sorghum, barley, and oats have declining importance as feed grains compared to corn. Corn's expansion into non-traditional areas has led to a decrease in planted acreage and output of sorghum, barley, and oats. Sorghum is primarily grown in the Central and Southern Plains. Sorghum is a drought- and heat-resistant crop primarily grown in the Central and Southern Plains regions. It is mainly used as a feed grain in Southwestern cattle feedlots and as a potential ethanol feedstock. The United States is the world's leading sorghum exporter. Barley production is concentrated in the Northern Plains and is valued for malt production. Oats production is also mentioned. Since the 1950s, oats production in the United States has declined due to lower feed value and price compared to other grains. The US has become the world's largest importer of oats, mainly for horse feed. Wheat is primarily grown as a food crop but can also be used as livestock feed, depending on quality and market conditions. Weather-related damage to wheat can make it unsuitable for milling, leaving feeding as the only option. Weather-related damage to wheat can render the grain unsuitable for milling, leading to feeding as the only option. Wheat feeding in the US varies depending on crop size and price relative to corn. Supply tightness of traditional feed grains or abundant wheat supplies can influence wheat into greater feed use, especially in corn-deficit areas like the Southern Plains. Beef cattle in Southwestern feedlots are the main consumers of feed wheat, with poultry in Southeastern operations occasionally fed wheat. Protein meals, derived from oilseed meals, are essential for correcting protein deficiencies in all-grain diets. Soybeans are the primary source of protein meal globally, with soymeal representing a significant portion of protein meals fed to livestock in the United States. The rapid growth of poultry meat production in the United States has led to a change in concentrated feed use, with poultry requiring less feed to produce meat compared to other animals. Poultry's consumption share of high-protein feed ingredients has increased from 40% in the 1970s to 57% in recent years, while hogs' share has remained steady at 22%. Dairy and beef cattle have seen a decrease in their share of high-protein feeds. Oilseed meals are the primary source of protein meals fed to U.S. livestock. Protein meals, derived from oilseed crushing residue, are major sources of feed for U.S. livestock. Soybean meal, representing 65-70% globally and 85% in the U.S., is the primary protein meal. Soymeal makes up 75% of a soybean's volume and 60% of its value, while soyoil accounts for 19% of volume and 39% of value. The value share can vary yearly based on oil and meal prices. Soybeans are a high-yielding oilseed plant with positive market characteristics, mainly grown in the Corn Belt region of the United States. They require less water than corn and have a larger growing zone, including the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Central Plains. Other oilseed crops are less profitable and are grown in areas where soybeans do not thrive. Other oilseed meals, such as rapeseed, cottonseed, canola, and sunflower, have a lower digestible energy content for swine and poultry compared to soymeal. These meals are primarily used by the cattle industry and account for about 9% of total protein meals fed in the United States. Animal feeds often utilize byproducts from the meat, poultry, milk, and fish processing industries to create high-quality protein supplements. Meatpacking byproducts include meat, bones, blood, and animal fat. Roughages are bulky, high-fiber feedstuffs derived from vegetative plants like pasture, hays, and silages. They are low in digestible nutrients and are essential for animal nutrition. Meatpacking byproducts, including meat, bones, blood, and animal fat, are used to produce protein meals but face restrictions due to BSE concerns. Silage is a fermented forage preserved in a silo for winter feeding, while grazing involves animals feeding on crops or grasses in pasture. Roughages, essential for ruminants like cattle and sheep, provide fiber needed for digestion. They make up a significant portion of dairy and beef cow diets but cannot replace grains and protein meals due to lower energy levels. Dairy cows and beef cattle operations heavily rely on roughage for digestion, with corn and sorghum being key silage crops due to their high nutrient yields. Silage is typically produced on-farm as transporting it is costly and affects quality. Livestock grazing is often secondary to other farm activities on agricultural land. Pastures and ranges are best suited for marginal land unsuitable for cash crops, especially in primary crop production areas like the Corn Belt. In these areas, pastures are mainly used for dry dairy cows, calves, replacement heifers, breeding beef cows, or sheep. Ranges in Western States are less productive due to lower rainfall, poorer soils, shorter growing seasons, and steep topography. Both pastures and ranges are most productive in spring and early summer. Access to good quality pasture and range is crucial for ranchers to reduce costs by grazing livestock on young, leafy plants in the spring and early summer when they are more palatable. This can help minimize expenses for feed concentrates and grain storage. Producers may graze cattle longer to save on finishing costs during periods of high feed grain prices, provided there is enough forage available. However, ongoing drought in the Southern Plains and Southeast has severely limited pasture and range fertility. The ongoing drought in the Southern Plains and Southeast has severely limited grazing opportunities for cattlemen. Feed grains can be purchased commercially or produced on the farm. Commercial feed concentrates offer ready-to-eat form and precise nutrient composition, but are more expensive. Grinding feed grains reduces energy expenditure in chewing and improves digestion. Different milling procedures are used depending on the type of livestock. Grinding assists in handling and pelleting but adds cost. On-farm feeding of own-produced feedstuffs is common in regions with surplus production. Late planting or weather issues may lead to high-moisture grain storage for feed. High-moisture grain is valuable but requires proper storage conditions. Commercial feed markets play a larger role in feed-deficit regions. High-moisture grain is valuable but not easily marketed off the farm due to spoilage. Storing high-moisture grain on-farm commits to feeding it on-farm rather than selling it commercially. Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR) measures animal efficiency in converting feed to body mass. Grain milling byproducts include corn, wheat, and rice mill feeds, accounting for about 4% of total feed concentrates. Corn milling byproducts have grown with the U.S. ethanol industry's growth. Byproducts from corn wet and dry milling processes are important in the U.S. ethanol industry, serving as animal feed alternatives. Wet milling extracts starch, HFCS, glucose, dextrose, and ethanol, producing corn gluten feed and meal. Dry milling produces distilled liquor and ethanol, with distillers grains and solubles as byproducts. Since mid-2005, new corn milling plants in the U.S. have been dry milling plants, leading to dominance in ethanol production. The U.S. ethanol industry is now dominated by the production of distillers grains and solubles (DGS) as a major co-product of corn-starch ethanol. DGS has rapidly expanded in the last six years, increasing from 1 million metric tons in 1999/2000 to 33.2 mmt in 2010/2011. It is a valuable feed alternative with medium-protein content and concentrated nutrients compared to corn. Initially, the livestock and poultry industry was slow to adopt DGS into feed rations but eventually developed systems for efficient handling and feeding. The feeding of DGS is widespread in the United States, especially in the beef cattle and dairy industries. DDGS exports have grown rapidly in recent years as foreign livestock producers see its cost-saving potential. Wet DGS is sold at a discount to DDGS, giving a cost advantage to livestock feeders. DDGS is best suited for feeding ruminant animals like cattle, sheep, and goats due to their digestive system's ability to convert DGS fiber into energy. However, its use in hog and poultry rations is limited because of its fiber content, requiring amino acid supplementation. High levels of DDGS in hog diets can lead to soft bellies and issues in bacon production. Recommended maximum DDGS percentages in swine and poultry rations are lower than in cattle due to digestive system differences. Beef cattle are the largest market for DDGS. Beef cattle are the largest market for DDGS, followed by dairy cows, hogs, and poultry. Replacement ratios for substituting DDGS for corn and soybean meal vary with the species of animal being fed."
