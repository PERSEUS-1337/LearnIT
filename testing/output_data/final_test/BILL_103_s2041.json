    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Rights of Intellectual Property Owners Fairness Facilitation Act of 1994\". The Congress finds that US industry loses billions annually due to inadequate protection of intellectual property rights by foreign countries. It is crucial for the US to use its foreign policy to ensure proper protection of these rights. Several countries under the generalized system of preferences do not provide adequate protection. Several countries that receive United States foreign assistance have been identified as not providing adequate protection of patents, copyrights, and trademarks or denying fair market access to US persons relying on intellectual property rights protection. Countries that do not adequately protect patents, copyrights, and trademarks or deny fair market access to US persons are ineligible for GSP treatment. Countries that do not implement parts I, II, and III of the Agreement on TRIPS are ineligible for GSP treatment after a specified period. The Agreement on TRIPS states that least-developed beneficiary developing countries will have a 5-year grace period before certain provisions take effect. Additionally, a \"qualified certification\" by the President to Congress within 1 year of the Agreement entering into force indicates a country's significant progress in implementing the Agreement. The Agreement on TRIPS defines terms related to intellectual property rights and trade agreements resulting from the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. Additionally, a new subsection designates countries as eligible for the Generalized System of Preferences. The Agreement on TRIPS establishes criteria for designating countries as beneficiary developing countries under the Generalized System of Preferences. Countries denied or suspended from this designation can be reconsidered if they fully implement the Agreement on TRIPS and report to Congress. Annual reports on compliance are required within a year of the Agreement entering into force. The President will annually assess beneficiary developing countries' implementation of the Agreement on TRIPS and report to Congress. The President will annually assess beneficiary developing countries' implementation of the Agreement on TRIPS and report to Congress. SEC. 4. COORDINATION OF TRADE POLICY AND FOREIGN POLICY. The United States Trade Representative will notify relevant authorities of countries not fully implementing the Agreement on TRIPS. The Secretary of State, Secretary of Commerce, and Administrator of the Agency for International Development will work together to encourage these countries to enact and enforce laws to comply with the Agreement on TRIPS. The Secretary of State will instruct diplomatic missions to include intellectual property rights in their efforts. The President is authorized to take actions to encourage developing countries to improve intellectual property rights protection, including providing insurance for intellectual property assets, supporting the development of national IP laws, and establishing cooperation committees on IP standards within regional organizations. Establish a council, in collaboration with the private sector, to provide intellectual property-related technical assistance through the Agency for International Development and the Department of Commerce. Require US representatives to multilateral lending institutions to advocate for programs supporting strong intellectual property rights protection in recipient countries that have implemented the Agreement on TRIPS. Property Rights entered into as part of the trade agreements resulting from the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade define a developing country as eligible for beneficiary status under the Trade Act of 1974 or designated as a least-developed beneficiary under the same Act."
