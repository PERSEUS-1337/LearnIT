    "content": "VOLUNTARY SEPARATION INCENTIVES FOR EMPLOYEES OF THE AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT. The Act defines terms such as \"agency,\" \"Administrator,\" and \"employee\" for the Agency for International Development. An employee is defined as someone employed by the agency for at least 12 months, excluding those eligible for immediate annuity upon separation. The curr_chunk describes eligibility criteria for various types of employees under different retirement systems within the agency, including reemployed annuitants, disabled employees, those facing involuntary separation, and those eligible for voluntary separation incentives. Employees who may not qualify for voluntary separation incentive payments include those who have previously received such a payment and not repaid it, employees with statutory reemployment rights on transfer, and those who received recruitment or relocation bonuses or retention allowances within specific timeframes. Before implementing voluntary separation incentive payments, the Administrator must submit a strategic plan to relevant committees outlining the intended use of the payments, positions to be reduced, and the number and amounts of payments to be offered. The agency must submit a strategic plan outlining the intended use of incentive payments, positions to be eliminated, and how the agency will operate without those positions. Voluntary separation incentive payments can be provided to a maximum of 100 employees to eliminate identified positions, paid in a lump sum from available funds. Voluntary separation incentive payments can be made up to $25,000 to employees who voluntarily separate before February 1, 1997. These payments are not considered for other government benefits or severance pay calculations. Additionally, agencies can make additional contributions to the Retirement Fund. The agency must remit 15 percent of the final basic pay of employees who receive a voluntary separation incentive to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund. \"Final basic pay\" refers to the total basic pay for a year of service at the employee's final rate. (e) An individual who receives a voluntary separation incentive payment and then accepts employment with the US Government within 5 years must repay the entire incentive payment before starting work. (f) Agencies must reduce one funded employee position for each vacancy. The agency must reduce one position for each vacancy created by an employee receiving a voluntary separation incentive payment. The President will monitor and enforce compliance with this requirement. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
