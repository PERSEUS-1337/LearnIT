The term 'qualified energy efficiency expenditures' refers to expenses made by the taxpayer for improving their dwelling unit in the US, used as their main residence, after consulting with a qualified individual. These expenditures do not include any already deductible or creditable expenses, and the definition of 'principal residence' aligns with section 121 but without ownership requirements. The term 'residence' includes a manufactured home conforming to Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards.
