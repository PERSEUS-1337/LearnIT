    "content": "The Act titled \"Medical Marijuana Research Act of 2016\" focuses on the production and supply of medical marijuana. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must continue producing marijuana through the National Institute on Drug Abuse Drug Supply Program and offer immature marijuana plants and seeds to qualified medical marijuana researchers for research purposes. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may continue producing and supplying marijuana for research purposes beyond a specified date. Before supplying marijuana, the Secretary must verify the registration of qualified medical marijuana researchers seeking to conduct research under the Controlled Substances Act. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, in consultation with the Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, will issue guidelines on the production of marijuana by qualified medical marijuana researchers. Researchers and manufacturers authorized to produce marijuana are encouraged to comply with these guidelines. In this section, the term \"immature marijuana plant\" is defined as a plant without observable flowers or buds, and a \"qualified medical marijuana researcher\" is a researcher registered to conduct research with marijuana under specific regulations. SEC. 3. FACILITATING MARIJUANA RESEARCH. Amendment to Section 303(f) of the Controlled Substances Act allows for the registration of practitioners to conduct research with marijuana, excluding marijuana from schedule I classification. Practitioners can conduct research with marijuana if authorized to handle controlled substances and if their research protocol is approved by the Secretary or a federal agency funding scientific research. The National Institutes of Health must approve an applicant to handle marijuana for medical or scientific use, ensuring safeguards against diversion. The Attorney General will grant registration unless it is against the public interest, considering factors like the applicant's experience and conviction record related to controlled substances. The National Institutes of Health will establish a process for researchers to submit and receive approval for their research protocols on marijuana within 90 days of the Medical Marijuana Research Act of 2016. The Attorney General must decide on registration applications within 60 days, considering factors like the applicant's conduct that may threaten public health and safety. The Attorney General must approve or deny a complete application for registration under this paragraph, with requirements satisfied by submitted documentation. Researchers registered under this paragraph must store marijuana securely, and security measures for research must be consistent with other controlled substances in schedule II. If the Attorney General approves an application for registration, the applicant can amend the research protocol without reapplying if it does not change the drug type, source, storage conditions, or increase diversion risk. The applicant must notify the Attorney General of any amendments or new protocols to renew registration. If the research protocol amendment involves changes to the drug type, source, storage conditions, or increases diversion risk, the applicant must notify the Attorney General 30 days before proceeding. The Attorney General can object if additional security measures are necessary. If marijuana is listed on a schedule other than schedule I, specific provisions apply. In research involving marijuana or compounds listed on a schedule other than schedule I, specific provisions under the Controlled Substances Act apply. Amendments to research protocols must be notified to the Attorney General if they involve changes to drug type, source, or storage conditions. SEC. 4. MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTION OF MARIJUANA FOR LEGITIMATE, MEDICAL RESEARCH. Section 303 of the Controlled Substances Act is amended to allow for the registration of manufacturers to produce marijuana for medical research purposes. The Attorney General will register applicants to manufacture marijuana exclusively for qualified medical researchers, unless it is against the public interest. The Attorney General will consider factors like diversion controls, compliance with laws, and prior convictions when registering distributors of marijuana for medical research. Other factors will not be taken into consideration. The Attorney General will register distributors of marijuana for medical research, considering diversion controls and public interest. The Attorney General will register distributors for medical research based on compliance with laws, prior convictions, experience in controlled substances distribution, and diversion controls. No limit on the number of manufacturers and distributors. The Attorney General will not impose limits on the number of persons eligible to manufacture or distribute marijuana for medical research. Registrants must verify that marijuana will be used exclusively for qualified medical marijuana researchers. The Attorney General will review documentation before supplying marijuana to ensure it will be used for qualified medical marijuana researchers. Requests for registration must be granted or denied within 30 days, with a written explanation for denials. SEC. 5 prohibits reinstating the interdisciplinary review process for non-NIH-funded researchers. SEC. 6 addresses the consideration of research results. The FDA approval of a marijuana-based drug triggers a review of existing research by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, who must report to Congress within 5 years of enactment on whether marijuana should be rescheduled based on medical benefits and research gaps. The FDA approval of a marijuana-based drug triggers a review of existing research by the Secretary of Health and Human Services to determine if marijuana should be rescheduled from schedule I. SEC. 7 amends the Controlled Substances Act to allow the Attorney General to establish quotas for marijuana production for medical research. SEC. 8 clarifies that the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs does not restrict marijuana research conducted in accordance with the Controlled Substances Act. SEC. 9 ensures no interference by the Department of Justice. SEC. 9 prohibits the Department of Justice from interfering with the production, distribution, and sale of marijuana as outlined in the Act. The term \"marijuana\" is defined in accordance with the Controlled Substances Act."
