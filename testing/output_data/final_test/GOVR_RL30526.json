    "content": "Medicare is a federal insurance program that covers health services for individuals 65 years and older or permanently disabled under 65. Part A covers hospital services, skilled nursing facility care, home health visits, and hospice services. Part B includes medical services like physician visits, lab tests, and outpatient care. Part C offers private plan options, while Part D provides prescription drug coverage. Total payment to providers for Medicare services is made up of two components. Medicare payment to providers for covered services includes a program payment from Medicare and any required beneficiary cost-sharing. Specific rules govern program payments for all covered services, such as acute inpatient and outpatient hospital services, skilled nursing facility services, and home health care. Payments for physician services, clinical laboratory services, and durable medical equipment covered under Part B are also regulated. Medicare payments to providers for covered services are based on fee schedules or reasonable costs. Updates to payments reflect inflation and other factors, with physician fee schedule updates determined by the sustainable growth rate system. Beneficiary payments include cost-sharing amounts. Beneficiary payments for Medicare Part A and Part B include cost-sharing amounts such as coinsurance, copayments, and deductibles. Part A covers hospital services, skilled nursing facilities, home health services, and hospice care with varying levels of cost sharing. Part B requires monthly premiums, a deductible, and a 20% coinsurance payment. The cost sharing for Medicare Part C is determined by private plans. Until 2005, premiums and cost sharing for Part C could not exceed actuarially determined levels for original Medicare benefits. Starting in 2006, plans can charge a premium to cover basic Medicare benefits if costs exceed the maximum amount CMS will pay. The Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) changed cost sharing for Medicare Part C, allowing plans to charge a premium to cover basic benefits exceeding CMS payments. Part D has a base premium of $31.17 per month, with varying actual premiums based on income. Cost sharing includes a deductible, co-payments, and out-of-pocket limits. The Secretary can negotiate bids from managed care organizations to ensure reasonable revenue requirements. Providers under Medicare Parts A and B have rules on billing beneficiaries. Part A providers must accept Medicare's payment as full and cannot bill extra. Part B providers have limits on what they can bill, with participating physicians accepting the approved fee schedule amount as payment in full. Nonparticipating physicians may or may not accept assignment for services. Physicians under Medicare Part B have different billing rules. Nonparticipating physicians may charge more than the fee schedule amount on nonassigned claims, subject to limits. Assignment is mandatory for some providers like nurse practitioners and physician assistants, while optional for others like durable medical equipment providers. The Medicare program has been a focus of legislative attention due to its rapid growth and spending reductions. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) has achieved savings in Medicare program spending through reductions in provider payments, including hospitals, physicians, and MA plans. Despite frozen payments in some areas, Medicare spending continues to rise due to an increasing number of beneficiaries and services. The ACA has implemented permanent reductions in payments to MA plans and fee-for-service providers, leading to substantial program savings. The ACA implemented permanent reductions in payments to Medicare Advantage plans and fee-for-service providers, resulting in substantial program savings. The productivity adjustment allows for negative payment updates, potentially leading to lower payment rates compared to previous years. The ACA was estimated to achieve net Medicare savings of approximately $430 billion over a 10-year period. The ACA implemented payment changes to Medicare providers and plans to slow spending growth and extend the Trust Fund's solvency. Concerns arise about sustainability without health care provider productivity improvements. Congress may need to reassess productivity adjustments based on the impact of ACA changes. The ACA also established the Independent Payment Advisory Board to control Medicare spending growth. The Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) in Medicare can recommend changes if spending exceeds targets set by statute. IPAB cannot reduce payments to certain providers before 2020 or make changes to premiums, benefits, eligibility, taxes, or result in rationing. Its recommendations are automatically implemented unless Congress acts, with limitations on altering proposals. The Board is appointed by the President in consultation with Congress and must submit recommendations by January 15, 2014. The CBO projects that the IPAB trigger may not be activated soon. The Budget Control Act of 2011 impacts Medicare. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (P.L. 112-25, BCA) impacts Medicare payments in 2013 by triggering a government-wide sequestration process to reduce Federal spending. Payments for most Medicare benefits will face a maximum 2% reduction each year from March 2013 through 2021. Reductions apply to individual payments for items and services provided under Medicare Parts A and B, while monthly payments to private plans administering Medicare Parts C and D will also be reduced. Certain parts of Medicare are exempt from these reductions. Certain parts of Medicare, such as Part D low-income subsidies, Part D catastrophic subsidy, and Qualified Individual (QI) premiums, are exempt from sequestration. Provider-specific sequestration adjustments are temporary and not reflected in the tables provided in the report. The report serves as a guide to Medicare payment rules by type of benefit, presented through a series of tables representing different provider types. The report provides information on Medicare payment rules by provider type, presented in tables. Each table lists types of payments, payment determination policies, annual payment updates, and recent update amounts. Acronyms used in the report are also included. The report includes the most recent update amounts and a list of acronyms used in the report, reflecting legislative changes to the program and payment updates available through January 2013. It also includes health care acronyms and laws that have amended Medicare since 1997."
