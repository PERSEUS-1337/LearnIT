    "content": "The CFTC was satisfied with its role under the CFMA, and few in Congress saw the need for a thorough overhaul of the CEA. However, hearings revealed areas for fine-tuning the CFMA, leading to reauthorization legislation by the 110th Congress. This legislation, title XIII of the Farm Bill (P.L. 110-234, H.R. 2419), addressed issues and authorized appropriations for the CFTC through FY2012. Energy markets have faced turmoil with high prices, volatility, fraud, and suspicions of artificially high prices due to excessive speculation. During the California electricity crisis of 2000, energy trading firms like Enron manipulated prices. Many energy firms engaged in fictitious trades to manipulate prices. The CFTC charged traders with providing false information about natural gas prices. Hedge funds and speculators are suspected of driving prices higher than justified by supply and demand. Calls for more oversight of OTC markets and limits on speculative futures positions have been made. In August 2006, the Amaranth hedge fund lost $2 billion in natural gas derivatives, leading to the liquidation of its $8 billion portfolio. A Senate report found that Amaranth's large speculative positions caused significant price movements before its collapse, highlighting the need for more oversight in energy markets. The reauthorization legislation aims to regulate certain OTC energy derivatives markets to prevent manipulation and excessive speculation. Markets where multiple buyers and sellers can trade electronically will be required to register with the CFTC and follow regulatory principles to curb manipulation. They must disclose information on prices, trading volume, and positions held by speculators and hedgers. The reauthorization legislation aims to regulate OTC energy derivatives markets to prevent manipulation and excessive speculation. New regulatory requirements apply to electronic markets resembling regulated futures exchanges. Bilateral OTC derivative contracts not executed on trading facilities are largely exempt from CFTC regulation. Security futures are contracts based on single stocks or narrow-based stock indexes, jointly regulated by the SEC and CFTC. Trading rules were slow to develop, with the first contracts traded in 2003. Trading volumes in security futures trading remain low compared to stock options market. OneChicago is the only active market, with 8.1 million contracts traded in 2007. Single-stock futures struggle to compete with the more liquid stock options market. Witnesses argue that the dual regulatory regime hampers trading. CFTC Chairman Brown-Hruska pledges to work on improving the situation. The Chicago futures exchanges seek an amendment to the CFMA to allow security futures to trade like other futures contracts. This would remove the joint CFTC/SEC oversight and enable the exchanges to set margin requirements, potentially lowering trading costs and increasing volumes. The Chicago futures exchanges are seeking an amendment to the CFMA to allow security futures to trade like other futures contracts, potentially lowering trading costs and increasing volumes. However, this move would face resistance from options exchanges and the SEC due to concerns about unfair competition and manipulation of stock prices. Section 13106 of the reauthorization legislation directs the CFTC and SEC to permit risk-based margining for security futures by September 30, 2009, which would reduce trading costs for traders with offsetting positions in stock options and securities futures. Additionally, the agencies are directed to permit trading in futures based on certain foreign stock indexes by the same date. The CFMA addressed the exemption of contracts based on foreign exchange and Treasury securities from CFTC regulation. A 2004 court case ruled that certain retail foreign exchange contracts were not futures contracts. CFTC Chairman Brown-Hruska suggested the need for additional legal authority to protect small investors from fraud. Reauthorization bills in Congress sought to clarify the CFTC's authority over retail agreements and contracts in foreign currency. The CFMA addressed the exemption of foreign exchange contracts from CFTC regulation. S. 1566 aimed to clarify CFTC jurisdiction over retail foreign exchange contracts. The President's Working Group recommended amendments to avoid restrictions on large foreign exchange contracts. Amendments were expected to be offered by committee chairmen. The 110th Congress legislation clarifies the CFTC's authority over retail contracts and allows banks to continue foreign exchange trading without CFTC regulation."
