    "content": "Historically, electricity service has been considered a natural monopoly due to declining costs, high investment thresholds, and limited entrants. Most people are served by vertically integrated, investor-owned utilities. However, there is a growing belief that market forces can replace traditional regulation, as evidenced by the presence of cooperatives and publicly owned utilities. Recent evidence suggests that vertical integration is not necessary for efficient electric service, as independent firms can now provide generating capacity. The Public Utility Holding Company Act and the Federal Power Act established a regulatory framework for electric utilities, with states and the federal government having specific powers. Utilities must provide electricity at regulated rates in exchange for an exclusive franchise service territory. State regulatory commissions oversee intrastate utility activities and rate-making. State regulatory bodies have broad authority over utility operations, including rate-making. The primary focus is on establishing retail electric prices through an adversarial hearing process. Federal regulation addresses wholesale transactions and rates for electric power in interstate commerce. Federal regulation supplements state regulation in the electricity utility industry, with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) overseeing economic regulation, wholesale rate regulation, transmission of unbundled retail electricity, and ensuring reliable service. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulates utilities' corporate structure to prevent abusive practices. The SEC regulates utilities' corporate structure under PUHCA. The electric utility industry has shifted towards smaller, more cost-effective generation facilities, allowing non-utility entities to enter the market. Improved technologies have reduced barriers to electricity generation. The oil embargoes of the 1970s led to the enactment of PURPA in 1978, requiring utilities to purchase power from independent firms at their avoided cost. This aimed to increase efficiency in electricity generation and provide fair rates to consumers. The Fuel Use Act of 1978 also allowed qualifying facilities (QFs) to take advantage of natural gas and new technology, as utilities were restricted from using natural gas for new generating facilities. The Fuel Use Act of 1978 allowed qualifying facilities (QFs) to utilize natural gas and new technology, lowering the financial threshold for entering the electricity generation business. FUA was repealed in 1987, but by then QFs and small power producers had gained a portion of the total electricity supply, challenging cost-based rates. FERC began approving wholesale transactions based on competitive bidding processes due to non-utility generators lacking market power to influence rates. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT) removed regulatory barriers to entry into electricity generation, promoting competition in the market. It introduced \"exempt wholesale generators\" (EWGs) to generate and sell electricity at wholesale without utility regulation. EPACT also ensured transmission of wholesale power to purchasers. EPACT shifted regulatory responsibilities to the federal government, creating new options for utilities and regulators to meet electricity demand. It allowed for a robust wholesale market in electricity, enabling bulk-power transfers between utilities. States began considering retail choice after EPACT's enactment. States began considering retail choice after the enactment of EPACT, with the belief that competition would lower retail prices. However, many state plans have not met expectations, as few alternative suppliers remain in the market and consumers are hesitant to switch. Currently, 24 states and the District of Columbia have implemented retail access, with California being the first to do so. California suspended its program after the 2001 energy crises, leading to price spikes and reliability issues. Eighteen states have active restructuring programs, while six states have delayed implementation. Six states - Arkansas, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and West Virginia - have delayed retail access implementation. President Bush signed comprehensive energy legislation (H.R. 6) in 2005, repealing the Public Utility Holding Company Act. The law includes provisions favored by the electric utility industry, such as strengthening FERC's merger review authority and preventing cross-subsidization. The mandatory purchase requirement under PURPA is repealed, and an Electric Reliability Organization (ERO) is established to enforce reliability standards in the electric industry. The Energy Policy Act (EPACT) of 1992 established mandatory cybersecurity protection standards for the electric industry. It also introduced exempt wholesale generators (EWGs) and addressed transmission access issues through FERC Orders 888 and 889 to promote fair competition in bulk power markets. Under Order 888, transmission line owners must offer point-to-point and network transmission services under comparable terms. The rule allows for recovery of stranded costs and encourages the creation of independent system operators. Order 889 establishes standards for a level playing field in wholesale power marketing and transmission operations. Order 2000, issued by FERC on December 20, 1999, outlines the characteristics and functions of regional transmission organizations (RTOs). RTOs must be independent from market participants, serve a sufficient region, have operational control, and maintain grid reliability. They must administer their own transmission tariff, manage congestion, and address parallel flow issues. The Order 2000 by FERC outlines the functions of regional transmission organizations (RTOs) which must be independent, manage congestion, address parallel flow issues, and ensure grid reliability. RTO participation is voluntary, with guidelines in place for independent operation and various entity structures allowed. FERC Order 2000 mandated ISOs and utilities to submit plans for transmission organization compliance by specific deadlines. Utilities not joining an RTO had to justify their decision. FERC later ordered talks to form Regional Transmission Organizations, setting boundaries for RTOs. A blueprint for a single RTO was presented in a report by FERC's Administrative Law Judge Mediator. H. Peter Young filed a report outlining the creation of a single RTO in the Northeast. FERC has granted RTO status to multiple entities, including MISO, GridWest, and PJM. Other RTOs have received conditional approval, such as ISO-NE. FERC granted conditional approval to Southwest Power Pool (SPP) on February 10, 2004, serving 4 million customers in Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. SeTrans RTO and WestConnect RTO were conditionally approved on October 10, 2002. SeTrans includes utilities in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Texas, while WestConnect RTO includes parts of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah. Utilities and state utility commissioners have raised concerns about integrating large RTOs due to expertise limitations. FERC released a report on February 26, 2002, assessing the economic costs and benefits of RTOs. On November 7, 2001, FERC issued an order outlining the goals and process for creating Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs). A study found potential annual savings from RTO formation ranging from $1 billion to $10 billion, with no significant difference in savings between larger and smaller RTOs. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit ruled in a case involving FERC and Northern States Power Company, raising federal-state jurisdictional questions. On October 3, 2001, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments in a case challenging FERC's authority to regulate transmission for retail sales. Nine states, led by New York, argued that FERC only has jurisdiction over wholesale sales and interstate transmission. Enron argued that FERC has jurisdiction over all transmission to prevent discrimination. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of FERC on March 4, 2002, granting jurisdiction over transmission lines, including unbundled retail transactions. Congress is considering whether utilities can provide preferential treatment to native load customers. The blackout of August 2003 emphasized the need for infrastructure improvements. NERC is responsible for bulk power system reliability, with voluntary compliance to guidelines. FERC has jurisdiction over unbundled transmission but lacks authority to regulate reliability. NERC is conducting reliability readiness audits of reliability coordinators following the recommendations of a joint U.S.-Canada task force investigating the August 2003 blackout. FERC held a technical conference in September 2004 to discuss the status of the Reliability Readiness Reviews. The audits revealed that improvements are needed in staff training and support for control centers during emergencies. NERC, FERC, and industry officials agree that an electric reliability organization (ERO) will enhance the reliability of the electric system. The Energy Policy Act of 2005, signed by the President on August 8, 2005, aims to improve the reliability of the electric system. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 established an Electric Reliability Organization (ERO) to develop and enforce reliability standards for the bulk-power system. The ERO can impose penalties for violations of FERC-approved standards, but cannot order construction of additional generation or transmission capacity. Advocates argue that central jurisdiction over the ERO by FERC would enhance reliability. Advocates believe giving FERC authority over the ERO would improve accountability and coordination for reliability issues. Opponents argue FERC lacks experience in this area and would rely heavily on NERC for expertise, potentially adding uncertainty to institutional changes. Investment in transmission system lags behind demand due to regulatory uncertainty and difficulty in siting lines. Transmission capacity is not keeping up with the rapid growth in generating capacity. Several federal agencies and states have roles in the siting process for transmission lines, with FERC supporting federal siting backstop authority since the blackout of 2003. The electric industry favors giving FERC siting authority, while states generally oppose this proposal. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 includes federal backstop authority for siting transmission lines. Pricing mechanisms for transmission are a concern for some utilities, with FERC regulating all transmission to ensure \"just and reasonable\" rates for wholesale transactions. FERC sets \"just and reasonable\" rates for wholesale transactions using an embedded cost method. Transmission owners are compensated based on a contract path, but electricity often follows the path of least impedance. This results in transmission owners not always being compensated for use of their lines, creating a disincentive to increase capacity. Under Order 2000, FERC supports incentive ratemaking to encourage participation in regional transmission organizations, compensate for financial risks, and facilitate efficient system expansion. FERC may move towards uniform access charges like postage stamp rates, where users pay a single charge for electricity transmission within a region. Postage stamp rates in regional transmission organizations eliminate rate pancaking and increase available generation. However, this may lead to rate increases for customers in low-cost transmission areas and hinder high-cost providers from recovering embedded costs. Regulatory uncertainty, such as the debate over repealing PUHCA since 1996, is a concern for transmission owners and investors, impacting new investments in infrastructure. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has been working towards requiring participation in regional transmission organizations to improve the transmission system's efficiency. Utilities are hesitant to invest in transmission due to uncertainty surrounding the operational characteristics and transmission rates of these organizations. FERC has granted RTO status to some entities and conditionally approved others, but enforcement of rules is currently not possible in court. Some argue for more market transparency in wholesale power markets to enhance competitiveness. Proposals suggest FERC establish an electronic information system for energy pricing. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 repeals PUHCA, giving FERC more merger review authority. Electric utilities seek PUHCA reform to diversify assets. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could allow diversification of assets for electric utilities to improve efficiency and service. Repealing parts of PUHCA has bipartisan support to give FERC and state commissions access to records. Utility holding companies argue that diversification would mitigate investment risks and optimize underutilized resources. Since the 1980s, the Securities and Exchange Commission has advocated for changes to PUHCA, stating that many provisions are outdated. However, after Enron's collapse, there has been a shift in Congress towards amending or repealing PUHCA. Despite Enron's attempts to claim exemption, the SEC denied their applications. State regulators are concerned that increased diversification could lead to abuses, such as cross-subsidization. Cross-subsidization, a concern raised against the creation of EWGs and PUHCA repeal, could lead to abuses in the electric and gas industry. Non-utility ventures from diversification may benefit holding companies financially but could harm utility subsidiaries if unsuccessful. Consumer and environmental groups fear that repealing PUHCA could worsen market power abuses in the industry. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 includes a potential repeal of \u00c2\u00a7210 of PURPA, which is supported by investor-owned utilities in the Northeast and California. They argue that PURPA's mandatory purchase obligation leads to high power prices and is outdated in the current competitive environment. The PURPA Reform Group, representing IOU interests, strongly supports the repeal, claiming it is anti-competitive and anti-consumer. Opponents of PURPA reform include industrial power customers, segments of the natural gas industry, the renewable energy industry, and environmental groups. Opponents of PURPA repeal argue that it introduced competition in the electric generating sector and promoted the use of cleaner fuels. They believe that repealing PURPA would decrease competition, hinder renewable energy development, and give utilities more control. State regulators are concerned about losing jurisdiction, and the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners opposes legislation protecting utilities from PURPA contract costs."
