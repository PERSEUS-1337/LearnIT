    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"UNRWA Humanitarian Accountability Act.\" United States contributions to UNRWA are addressed in the Act. Section 301 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended to require a certification by the Secretary of State for US contributions to UNRWA or related entities. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended to require a certification by the Secretary of State for US contributions to UNRWA or related entities, ensuring that UNRWA and its affiliates do not support terrorism or propagate anti-American, anti-Israel, or anti-Semitic rhetoric. The amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 requires a certification for US contributions to UNRWA, ensuring no support for terrorism or dissemination of anti-American, anti-Israel, or anti-Semitic rhetoric. UNRWA undergoes financial audits and oversight to prevent resources from being used by terrorist organizations. No UNRWA-funded school uses materials promoting such rhetoric, and recipients of UNRWA funds cannot be members of Foreign Terrorist Organizations. UNRWA must not have any affiliations with such organizations. UNRWA must not have any affiliations with financial institutions linked to money laundering or terror financing. Definitions include Foreign Terrorist Organization designated by the Secretary of State. Appropriate congressional committees oversee these matters. The certification described in paragraph (2) is effective for 180 days or until proven inaccurate. If certification becomes invalid, the Secretary must inform congressional committees. During a valid certification period, the US cannot contribute to UNRWA or a successor entity beyond a specified annual amount. Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) or a successor entity cannot receive an annual amount exceeding certain limits set by the US government. SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. The sense of Congress is for the President and Secretary of State to lead diplomatic efforts to urge nations to withhold contributions to UNRWA until it meets specified conditions. It also calls for removing citizens of recognized states from UNRWA's jurisdiction and changing the definition of a \"Palestine refugee\" to align with UNHCR. The text calls for transferring responsibility for Palestinian refugees to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees to alleviate their suffering."
