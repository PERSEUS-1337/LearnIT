    "content": "The \"IRA Preservation Act of 2017\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. It includes provisions for education and outreach. The \"IRA Preservation Act of 2017\" requires the Secretary to make information on individual retirement arrangements available to the public, including laws, regulations, common taxpayer errors, and targeted advance notices to prevent errors. The Soft Notice Program allows the Secretary to issue notices to taxpayers if material inconsistencies are detected in their tax returns or reports, potentially leading to tax liabilities. This program aims to prevent errors such as excess contributions to individual retirement arrangements. The Soft Notice Program allows the Secretary to issue notices for excess contributions or errors in individual retirement arrangements, except in cases where an audit is planned or no outstanding tax liability is suspected. The Soft Notice Program allows the Secretary to issue notices for excess contributions or errors in individual retirement arrangements, with explanations of potential taxes owed and options for voluntary correction under specific tax codes. The Soft Notice Program allows voluntary correction of excess contributions or accumulation under specific tax codes, with warnings of potential taxes owed and the risk of an audit for failure to remit taxes. The Soft Notice Program allows voluntary correction of excess contributions or accumulation under specific tax codes, with warnings of potential taxes owed and the risk of an audit for failure to remit taxes. A notice issued under this program includes a copy of the applicable form for remitting taxes owed due to errors in individual retirement arrangements, without initiating an audit or demanding immediate payment. SEC. 3. REDUCTION OF EXCISE TAXES FOR VOLUNTARY CORRECTION OF COMMON IRA ERRORS. Section 4973 of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to reduce the excise tax on excess contributions to individual retirement arrangements if corrected during a specified window, lowering the tax rate from 6 percent to 3 percent. The correction window for excess contributions to individual retirement arrangements is defined as the period between the imposition of the tax and the earlier of the initiation of an audit or demand for payment by the Secretary, or the end of the second tax year after the tax imposition. Additionally, a reduction in excise tax on failures to take required minimum distributions is introduced, allowing for a tax reduction in certain cases. The reduction of tax in certain cases allows a taxpayer to correct a shortfall in distributions from an individual retirement arrangement during the correction window, resulting in a reduced tax rate of 5 percent instead of 50 percent as per subsection (a). The correction window is defined as the period starting from the imposition of the tax. The reduction of tax in certain cases allows a taxpayer to correct a shortfall in distributions from an individual retirement arrangement during the correction window, which ends either when the IRS initiates an audit or demands payment, or by the last day of the second tax year after the shortfall occurred. Coordination with waiver provisions is also addressed in the amendment to subsection (d) of section 4974 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The amendment allows the Secretary of the Treasury to compromise the amount of tax due under section 4974 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, taking into account voluntary correction options. The amendment allows the Secretary of the Treasury to compromise the amount of tax due under section 4974 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, considering voluntary correction during the correction window. SEC. 4. Harmonization of treatment of IRAs with employer plans. The text discusses amendments to the Internal Revenue Code related to individual retirement arrangements, including the elimination of additional tax on certain distributions and the repeal of the tax disqualification penalty. Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code regarding individual retirement arrangements include changes to various sections such as 220(e)(2), 223(e)(2), and 530(e), as well as modifications to section 4975(c)(3). Additionally, the statute of limitations under section 6501(l) is amended to exclude individual retirement arrangements from certain provisions. Individual retirement arrangements are subject to taxes under sections 4973, 4974, and 4975. The required return for these taxes is the income tax return filed by the person liable for the tax in the year the liability occurred. If the person is not required to file an income tax return, the return needed is the one they would have filed if required. If the person is not required to file an income tax return, the 3-year period for filing the return for taxes on individual retirement arrangements begins on the date it would have been required. SEC. 5. INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ARRANGEMENT DEFINED as an individual retirement account, annuity, or Roth IRA under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE. The Act and its amendments will take effect upon enactment. Transition provisions allow taxpayers to request waivers during a defined period. The transition period defined in the Act begins on the date of enactment and ends one year after. The amendments apply to any tax liability determination made after the enactment date, regardless of when the conduct occurred. The correction window for errors eligible for correction under specific sections of the Internal Revenue Code begins on the date the tax was imposed and ends when the Secretary of the Treasury initiates an audit or demands payment. The implementation of Section 2 of the Act must occur within 1 year of its enactment."
