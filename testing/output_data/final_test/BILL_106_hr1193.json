The Statewide Newborn and Infant Hearing Screening, Evaluation, and Intervention Programs aim to provide early intervention for deaf and hard of hearing children through referral to specialized agencies and organizations. Data collection is done for research, evaluation, and policy development purposes. Technical assistance, data management, and applied research are also part of the program. The Public Health Service Act authorizes the Secretary to award grants for technical assistance to State agencies for newborn and infant hearing screening programs. This includes developing standardized procedures for data management, quality monitoring, and cost-effectiveness studies.
