    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Protecting Our Youth from Dangerous Synthetic Drugs Act of 2013\". Enforcement measures are outlined in the Act. The Controlled Substances Act is amended to define 'controlled substance analogue' as a substance with a similar chemical structure and effect on the central nervous system as a controlled substance in schedule I or II. The Controlled Substances Act is amended to define a 'controlled substance analogue' as a substance with a similar chemical structure and effect on the central nervous system as a controlled substance in schedule I or II. The Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary, has the authority to designate a substance as a controlled substance analogue. The Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, establishes the Controlled Substance Analogue Committee, comprised of scientific experts from various federal agencies. The Controlled Substance Analogue Committee, established by the Attorney General in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, convenes as needed to maintain a list of substances similar to schedule I or II controlled substances, without requiring evidence of human consumption. The Attorney General will establish operational procedures for the Committee through rulemaking. The Controlled Substance Analogue Committee, established by the Attorney General, submits a notice of substances to be considered for designation as controlled substance analogues to the Secretary of Health and Human Services before each meeting. The Secretary then responds to the request for exemptions or approvals within 30 days. The Committee considers responses from the Secretary of Health and Human Services to designate substances as controlled substance analogues. The Attorney General publishes designations in the Federal Register, and the DEA Administrator publishes them on their website, including chemical names, effective dates, and related controlled substances. The Committee designates substances as controlled substance analogues, with the designation taking effect 30 days after publication in the Federal Register. If a substance is later scheduled through rulemaking, it is automatically removed from the list. Challenges to the designation are considered a question of law. Funding for controlled substance analogues is included in an amendment to Public Law 102-395. SEC. 3 amends the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act to make it unlawful to import controlled substance analogues without proper notification. SEC. 4 directs the Sentencing Commission. The United States Sentencing Commission will review and amend sentencing guidelines to ensure adequate penalties for offenses related to controlled substance analogues. This includes manufacturing, importing, exporting, trafficking, possession, and conspiracy to commit these offenses. The Sentencing Commission will adjust sentencing guidelines for offenders convicted of controlled substance analogues offenses to ensure severity and consistency with federal guidelines and sentencing purposes."
