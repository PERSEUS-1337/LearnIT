    "content": "Title XXIV of the Revised Statutes is amended by inserting a new section 1994A, which pertains to charitable choice and the provision of assistance under government programs by religious organizations. The Charitable Choice Expansion Act of 1999 prohibits discrimination based on religion in the distribution of government funds to nongovernmental organizations. It allows organizations to accept funds without compromising their religious character or the freedom of individuals. Religious organizations are included as providers in government programs funded by the Federal Government, State, or local governments. The government can use nongovernmental organizations, including religious organizations, to provide assistance under programs funded by Federal, State, or local governments. Discrimination based on religion is prohibited in the distribution of funds, and organizations with a religious character cannot be excluded from providing assistance. The curr_chunk specifies that certain activities are not included in the assistance programs, such as those under Federal education programs or the Higher Education Act. Additionally, religious organizations providing assistance must maintain independence from government entities. Religious organizations providing assistance under certain programs must maintain independence from government control and are not required to alter their internal governance or remove religious symbols. Employees may be required to adhere to religious tenets and teachings. Religious organizations may require employees to adhere to their religious rules, including abstaining from drugs or alcohol. The exemption for religious organizations regarding employment practices under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is not affected by their participation in government-funded programs. Beneficiaries of assistance funded by these programs have the right to object to the religious nature of the organization providing the assistance. Individuals who object to receiving assistance from a religious organization funded by government programs must be provided with alternative assistance of equal value from an accessible organization. Notice of this right must be given to these individuals by the appropriate governmental entity. Religious organizations providing assistance under government-funded programs must not discriminate against individuals based on religion, beliefs, or participation in religious practices. This includes direct grants or contracts, as well as indirect forms of disbursement like vouchers or certificates. Religious organizations receiving government funds must not discriminate based on religion or beliefs when admitting individuals to their programs. They are required to adhere to accounting regulations and segregate government funds for audit purposes. Compliance with these non-discrimination policies is essential. The government must comply with non-discrimination policies when providing funds to religious organizations. Funds cannot be used for sectarian purposes. When State or local governments contribute funds to a program, they can choose to segregate or commingle the funds with Federal funds. If commingled, the same rules apply to both types of funds. Intermediate contractors, like nongovernmental organizations, can select other organizations to provide assistance under the programs. When State or local governments contribute funds to a program, they can choose to segregate or commingle the funds with Federal funds. Intermediate organizations, like nongovernmental organizations, can select other organizations to provide assistance under the programs described in subsection (c), with the same duties as the government but retaining all other rights of a nongovernmental organization."
