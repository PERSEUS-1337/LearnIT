    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Treaty of Greene Ville 200th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act\". Congressional findings are also included in the Act. The Congress finds that the rapid westward expansion of the United States led to warfare between white settlers and Native Americans in the early 1790s. British traders in the Northwest Territory encouraged Native American attacks on frontier settlements, but they were ultimately defeated in 1794 by General Anthony Wayne at the Battle of Fallen Timbers. A year later, the Treaty of Greene Ville was negotiated, establishing a definite boundary. The Treaty of Greene Ville established a boundary between Indian lands and lands open to settlement, leading to the surrender of territory in Ohio and Indiana by defeated tribes. This forced the British into Canada and eliminated their influence over Native Americans in the region, paving the way for westward expansion in the United States. The events at Fort Greene Ville are considered historically significant, ranking alongside Bunker Hill, Yorktown, Appomattox, and Gettysburg. The Secretary of the Treasury will mint $1 silver coins to commemorate the Treaty of Greene Ville, weighing 26.73 grams, with a diameter of 1.500 inches, and containing 90% silver and 10% copper. These coins will be legal tender and considered numismatic items. The silver for minting will be sourced from stockpiles established under the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act. The design of the coins minted under this Act shall be emblematic of the Treaty of Greene Ville, with specific inscriptions and designations required. The design will be selected by the Secretary in consultation with relevant commissions and committees. SEC. 6. ISSUANCE OF COINS.
