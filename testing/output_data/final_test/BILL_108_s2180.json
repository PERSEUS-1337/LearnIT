    "content": "There is no information provided in the curr_chunk to summarize. The \"Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests Land Exchange Act of 2004\" allows for a land exchange in Colorado, with the City of Golden offering non-federal land for conveyance. This includes land near Evergreen in Park County and near Argentine Pass in Clear Creek. Certain land near Argentine Pass in Clear Creek and Summit Counties, Colorado, totaling approximately 55.909 acres, is depicted on the map titled \"Argentine Pass/Continental Divide Trail Lands\" from September 2003. The conveyance of this land to the Secretary is subject to the City's right to access and use the Vidler Tunnel. Upon acquisition by the Secretary, the land is permanently withdrawn from public entry and appropriation laws. The Secretary will convey certain Federal land to the City upon receiving title to the non-Federal land identified in subsection (a). The United States has an interest in approximately 9.84 acres of Federal land, as shown on the map titled \"Empire Federal Lands--Parcel 12\". The values of the Federal and non-Federal land will be appraised according to specific standards. The conveyance of non-Federal land will be considered a donation, except in certain cases. The final appraised values of Federal and non-Federal land will be compared, and any surplus in value can be equalized by reducing acreage, making cash payments, or a combination of both. The Secretary will conduct an appraisal to equalize the values of Federal and non-Federal land, using the value of the non-Federal land to balance any surplus in value. The City may make a cash equalization payment to the Secretary if the value of the Federal land exceeds the non-Federal land. The City is responsible for land surveys, appraisals costs, and the land exchange should be completed within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Secretary may authorize the City to construct a water pipeline on Federal land within 45 days of the Act's enactment. If the land exchange is not completed, the Secretary will sell the Federal land to the City at the final appraised value. The Sisk Act applies to any cash equalization payment received by the United States. Land acquired by the United States in a land exchange becomes part of the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests. The boundary of the Forests is adjusted to incorporate non-Federal land and an additional 80 acres. Acquired land is administered according to National Forest System laws. The boundaries of the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests are adjusted to include acquired land. Technical corrections can be made to maps by the Secretary with the City's agreement. Public orders withdrawing Federal land are revoked to allow for disposal. The Federal land identified in subsection (b) is withdrawn until the date of conveyance to the City. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
