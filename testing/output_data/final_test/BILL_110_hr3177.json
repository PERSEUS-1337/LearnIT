    "content": "The \"Local Education Authority Returns Now Act\" allows states to opt out of K-12 education grant programs. The Act outlines determinations by the Secretary of Treasury, amounts creditable to states, ineligibility of opt-out states for grants, exemption from grant program requirements, and defines key terms. Additionally, it introduces a refundable education credit for taxpayers in opt-out states. TITLE I--ABILITY OF STATES TO OPT OUT OF K-12 EDUCATION GRANT PROGRAMS\n\nSEC. 101. DETERMINATIONS BY SECRETARY OF TREASURY AS TO WHICH STATES ARE OPT-OUT STATES. The Secretary of the Treasury determines opt-out States for the following calendar year by February 1. A State is considered an opt-out State if it has a law in place by January 1 that indicates a refusal to accept grant funds for K-12 education programs. The Secretary notifies the State of this determination. The Secretary of the Treasury transmits the determination to the Secretary of Education and Congress. SEC. 102. AMOUNTS CREDITABLE TO STATES. The Secretary of Education determines the refundable opt-out State education credit for each State annually based on K-12 funding. The Secretary of Education determines the extrapolated amount for a State for a calendar year based on grant funds received under the K-12 program. The Secretary of Education determines the extrapolated amount for a State for a calendar year based on grant funds received under the K-12 program, including grants, subgrants, or other forms of funding. Regulations will be prescribed for making these determinations. The Secretary of Education will prescribe regulations within 6 months of the Act's enactment for determining K-12 funding. The aggregate K-12 funding for a State includes all grant funds received, both non-competitive and competitive, for the current and previous four calendar years. SEC. 103 states that opt-out States are not eligible to receive K-12 education grants. Any unallocated funds will be returned to the Treasury. SEC. 104 exempts opt-out States from K-12 education grant program requirements. SEC. 105 provides definitions. SEC. 105 defines key terms related to K-12 education grant programs and public educational entities. SEC. 201 introduces a new refundable opt-out state education credit under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The opt-out State education amount is a credit against the tax for eligible individuals, calculated based on the taxpayer's household tax burden from the State for the opt-out year. The household tax burden for an opt-out year in a State includes real property taxes, personal property taxes, income taxes, war profits taxes, excess profits taxes, and general sales taxes paid or accrued by the taxpayer in the second preceding taxable year. Terms used in this calculation follow the definitions in section 164. The total tax revenue of a State for an opt-out year is determined by the Secretary as the aggregate tax revenue for the second preceding taxable year. An eligible individual is defined as someone whose main residence was in the opt-out State for the entire taxable year, excluding dependents who have a deduction allowed to another taxpayer. The term 'opt-out year' is defined as a calendar year determined by the Secretary for a State under the Local Education Authority Returns Now Act. The credit amount under subsection (a) is determined by tables prescribed by the Secretary, taking into account filing status, State of residence, and adjusted gross income. Section 1324(b) of title 31, United States Code, is amended to include section 36. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include section 36 in subsection 1324(b) of title 31, United States Code. The table of sections for subpart C of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 is updated accordingly. The amendments made by this section, including the opt-out State education credit and overpayments of tax, will apply to taxable years beginning after the enactment of this Act."
