    "content": "The \"Consumer Windfall Excess Oil Profits Protection Act of 2005\" imposes a windfall profits tax on crude oil, natural gas, and related products under a new chapter in the Internal Revenue Code. The \"Consumer Windfall Excess Oil Profits Protection Act of 2005\" imposes a 50% excise tax on taxpayers for windfall profits from sales of crude oil, natural gas, and related products, as well as net gains from transactions linked to their prices. The term 'windfall profit' is defined as the excess of adjusted taxable income over the reasonably inflated average profit for the taxable year. Adjusted taxable income includes taxable income increased by certain deductions and reduced by certain income sources and losses. The adjusted taxable income for a foreign corporation is determined based on income effectively connected with a trade or business in the US. The reasonably inflated average profit for any taxpayer is calculated as the average of adjusted taxable income for specific years plus 10 percent. The term 'taxable product thereof' refers to fuel derived from crude oil or natural gas. SEC. 5898. SPECIAL RULES AND DEFINITIONS. The Secretary will establish rules for tax withholding and deposit under section 5896, taxpayers must maintain records and provide information as required, the return of the tax imposed under section 5896 must be filed as per Secretary's instructions, businesses under common control are treated as one entity, and regulations will be prescribed by the Secretary. The Secretary will establish regulations necessary for the purposes of this chapter. Section 3 discusses the use of proceeds from windfall profits on crude oil, natural gas, and related products.
