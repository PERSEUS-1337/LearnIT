    "content": "The Act titled \"Sweepstakes Toll-Free Option Protection Act of 1999\" requires promoters of skill contests or sweepstakes mailings to meet certain requirements. The \"Sweepstakes Toll-Free Option Protection Act of 1999\" mandates that promoters of skill contests or sweepstakes must comply with new regulations, including providing a removal request form for individuals who do not wish to receive mailings related to such contests. The \"Sweepstakes Toll-Free Option Protection Act of 1999\" defines skill contests as competitions where a prize is awarded based on the contestant's skill, while sweepstakes are games of chance that do not require any payment to enter. Nonmailable matter related to these contests must not be sent through the mail and should be disposed of as directed by the Postal Service. The \"Sweepstakes Toll-Free Option Protection Act of 1999\" prohibits mailing nonmailable matter, which includes skill contests or sweepstakes addressed to individuals who opted out of receiving such mail. Promoters must include a notice with each mailing providing a toll-free number to opt out of receiving future mailings. The \"Sweepstakes Toll-Free Option Protection Act of 1999\" requires promoters to participate in a notification system allowing individuals to exclude their name and address from mailing lists for skill contests or sweepstakes. Individuals can contact the system through a toll-free number to request removal from future mailings. The Act mandates that individuals can request to be excluded from skill contest or sweepstakes mailing lists by contacting the system through a toll-free number. A removal request form will be mailed within 7 business days, and the election to prohibit mailings will take effect 30 business days after the signed request is received. Individuals can elect to exclude their name and address from mailing lists used by promoters of skill contests or sweepstakes by mailing a removal request form to the notification system. Within 30 business days of receiving the form, promoters must remove the individual's information from all lists. An election under this section is effective for all promoters and remains in effect unless an individual notifies the system in writing of a change and elects to receive skill contest or sweepstakes mailings. Promoters or those maintaining the notification system are not liable for excluding an individual's information from mailing lists if a removal request form is received and processed within 30 days. The system allows individuals to request exclusion from mailing lists if the promoter believes the request is genuine. Commercial use of lists from the system is prohibited, with a civil penalty for violations. The Postal Service can assess civil penalties for violations related to mailing nonmailable matter or failing to comply with mailing requirements. The system allows exclusion from mailing lists, with penalties for commercial use violations. SEC. 3. STATE LAW NOT PREEMPTED. This Act does not override any State or local laws. SEC. 4. EFFECTIVE DATE. The changes from this Act will be effective one year after enactment."
