    "content": "The Child and Family Services Improvement Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-288) extended funding authorization for the Promoting Safe and Stable Families program for five years. The program provides formula grants for services to children and families, including family support, preservation, reunification, and adoption promotion. It increased funding for tribes and allocated $40 million annually for grants to address child welfare issues related to substance abuse. The Promoting Safe and Stable Families program, funded by the Child and Family Services Improvement Act of 2006, supports monthly caseworker visits to children in foster care. Part of the funding is reserved for Court Improvement Program grants to improve handling of child welfare cases. Funds are also allocated for evaluation, research, and technical assistance related to the program. The Safe and Stable Families program, initially created under the Family Preservation and Support Services, was reauthorized and expanded by the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997. Subsequent legislation, such as the Promoting Safe and Stable Families Amendments of 2001 and the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, further supported the program through funding increases and new grants. Congressional committees have overseen the program, holding hearings for reauthorization. P.L. 109-288 made amendments to the Child Welfare Services program, setting its funding authorization to expire in FY2011. It also extended funding for the Mentoring Children of Prisoners program. The Child and Family Services Improvement Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-288) extended funding for the Mentoring Children of Prisoners program and authorized a demonstration project to test the effectiveness of using vouchers for mentoring services. On June 8, 2006, the Senate Finance Committee reported a bill to reauthorize the PSSF program. The bill, S. 3525, was introduced by Senator Grassley on June 15. The Senate passed the legislation on July 13 and sent it to the House for further action. Witnesses testified at hearings regarding the effects of the methamphetamine epidemic on the child welfare system. The Senate Finance Committee heard testimony on the impact of the Methamphetamine Epidemic on America's Child Welfare System. Witnesses emphasized the effectiveness of family-based, longer-term residential treatment for methamphetamine abuse and the need for increased access to these services to improve the lives of affected children and families. The Child and Family Services Improvement Act of 2006 (H.R. 5640) was introduced by Representatives Wally Herger and Jim McDermott. After amendments, the bill received unanimous approval from the House Ways and Means Committee and was reported to the House. It was passed under suspension of the rules on July 25, 2006. The legislation aimed to improve child protective services and incorporated language from earlier proposals. The Child and Family Services Improvement Act of 2006 (S. 3525, P.L. 109-288) extended funding authorization levels for the Promoting Safe and Stable Families program from FY2007-FY2011. The program costs are shared by the federal government (75%) and states (at least 25%). States were limited to spending 10% of federal funds for administrative purposes under prior law. The Promoting Safe and Stable Families program, funded by the Child and Family Services Improvement Act of 2006, extends funding authorization levels from FY2007-FY2011. States share program costs with the federal government, with a 10% limit on spending for administrative purposes. States must plan and report on the use of funds annually, including actual expenditure data submitted starting June 30, 2007. The new law requires states to report on the use of funds under the PSSF and Child Welfare Services programs, including spending by service, activity, and number of people served. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services must compile and submit these reports to Congress annually. The FY2006 funding authorization for the PSSF was increased to $345 million, but the additional $40 million was not appropriated. P.L. 109-288 extended the $40 million annual increase in mandatory funding for the PSSF through FY2011, targeting funds for monthly caseworker visits of children in foster care and grants to improve the well-being of children affected by substance abuse. A total of $95 million was allocated between FY2006 and FY2011 for caseworker support, focusing on retention, recruitment, training, and technology access. The P.L. 109-288 extended funding for the PSSF program through FY2011, with allocated funds for monthly caseworker visits and grants to support children affected by substance abuse. States will receive funds based on the number of children receiving food stamps, with requirements to prevent supplanting of other federal foster care funds. Additionally, states must spend a certain ratio of federal funds on caseworker visits to access the full allotment of funds. Between FY2007 and FY2011, P.L. 109-288 reserves $145 million in mandatory PSSF funds for competitive grants to improve the safety and well-being of children in out-of-home placements due to substance abuse. Services funded include substance abuse treatment, early intervention, counseling, and mental health services. The P.L. 109-288 reserves $145 million in mandatory PSSF funds for competitive grants to improve the safety and well-being of children in out-of-home placements due to substance abuse. Regional partnerships must be established by a collaborative agreement between multiple entities, including providers of child welfare services, mental health services, and tribes. The state child welfare agency does not need to lead the partnership but must be a member. HHS considers the level of need demonstrated in the grant applications. HHS gives priority to regional partnerships demonstrating the impact of methamphetamine abuse on the child welfare system. Grants last 2-5 years with funding between $500,000-$1 million annually. Grantees must submit annual reports and performance indicators. HHS reports grant funding usage to Senate Finance and House Ways and Means committees. The P.L. 109-288 law requires HHS to reserve funds for research, technical assistance, and training related to the child welfare program. It mandates annual spending of at least $1 million for caseworker visits and grants to improve the well-being of children affected by substance abuse. Tribal PSSF programs receive funding from set-asides of mandatory and discretionary funds. Beginning with FY2007, P.L. 109-288 increases the tribal set-aside for the PSSF program to 3% of mandatory funding and 3% of discretionary funding. The maximum funding available to tribes would be $15.2 million, with a minimum of $9.2 million. Tribal PSSF funding in FY2007 is expected to be $11.8 million, based on set-aside rules and funding from P.L. 110-5. Tribal allotments are determined by the number of individuals under 21 in each tribe, with no allotment less than $10,000. P.L. 109-288 allows tribes to form consortia to increase access to PSSF funds for tribes with smaller populations. The law also limits HHS authority to exempt tribes from PSSF state plan requirements based on tribe size and resources. Under P.L. 109-288, tribes can be exempt from certain restrictions on federal PSSF funds usage, but must still meet other plan requirements. The Child Welfare Services program funding is authorized at $325 million annually for five years (FY2007-FY2011). The Child Welfare Services Program funding is authorized at $325 million annually for five years (FY2007-FY2011) under P.L. 109-288. This program aims to promote State flexibility in developing coordinated child and family services, protecting children from neglect, abuse, and exploitation, and ensuring they are raised in safe, loving families. The Child Welfare Services Program aims to prevent neglect, abuse, and exploitation of children, support at-risk families, promote safety and well-being of children in foster care, and provide training for a qualified workforce. The program costs are shared by the federal government (75%) and the state (25%). Beginning with FY2008, P.L. 109-288 limits the use of program funds for administrative purposes to no more than 10%, which includes various specified costs. Spending on caseworker services is not considered an administrative cost. Under prior law, the state could not spend more federal program funds on foster care maintenance payments, adoption assistance, or child day care solely for employment purposes. Beginning in FY2008, P.L. 109-288 limits the use of federal Child Welfare Services funds for administrative purposes to 10%, excluding caseworker services. States must demonstrate prior use of federal funds for foster care, adoption assistance, or child day care in FY2005 to continue funding for these purposes. Matching funds for the program cost can include state spending on foster care. Beginning in FY2008, P.L. 109-288 limits states from using foster care maintenance payment expenditures for non-federal matching dollars under the Child Welfare Services program unless they can prove it was used for matching in FY2005. States must develop a plan to meet federal requirements, including new requirements added by P.L. 109-288. P.L. 109-288 introduces new requirements for states regarding the involvement of medical professionals in assessing the health of children in foster care, ensuring continued services after disasters, and setting standards for caseworker visits to children in foster care. States must comply with these requirements by FY2008. P.L. 109-288 introduces new requirements for states regarding the involvement of medical professionals in assessing the health of children in foster care, ensuring continued services after disasters, and setting standards for caseworker visits to children in foster care. It also clarifies that children in foster care with a permanency goal of \"another planned permanent living arrangement\" may include placement in a residential education program. Certain outdated requirements were eliminated, and the law re-organizes the Child Welfare Services program language with conforming and technical amendments. P.L. 109-288 mandates specific caseworker visitation standards in state Child Welfare Services plans. States must provide data to HHS showing the percentage of children in foster care who were visited monthly, with a target of 90% receiving monthly visits by October 1, 2011. HHS will outline state-specific steps to reach this goal. Beginning with FY2009, if a state fails to meet the monthly caseworker visitation standard, they must spend more state funds to receive full federal allotment. Penalties range from 1 to 5 percentage points based on noncompliance with visit targets. HHS is required to submit a progress report on state visitation standards to Congress by March. The Mentoring Children of Prisoners program, funded since FY2003, provides grants for mentoring services to children of prisoners. P.L. 109-288 expands the program's purpose to include using vouchers for mentoring services. P.L. 109-288 extended funding for the Mentoring Children of Prisoners program through FY2007-FY2011, with $49.5 million allocated for FY2006. The program will continue to receive this amount in FY2007. HHS must use a competitive process to select an entity to conduct a voucher demonstration for mentoring services, giving priority to Indian children and those in rural or underserved areas. The Mentoring Children of Prisoners program extended funding through FY2007-FY2011 with $49.5 million allocated for FY2006. An entity must provide 3,000 vouchers in the first year, 8,000 in the second year, and 13,000 in the third year for mentoring services, with quality standards and background checks for mentors. Vouchers are valued at one year of services and providers must show they can continue services after the voucher expires. P.L. 109-288 increased the reserved funds for evaluation, research, and technical assistance for the Mentoring Children of Prisoners program to 4%. An independent evaluation of the voucher demonstration project is required, with a report due to committees within 90 days after the second year. The cooperative agreement can be extended for two years if performance is satisfactory and vouchers are proven effective. P.L. 109-288 extends funding for voucher service delivery demonstration and court improvement programs through FY2011. It reserves funds for the voucher demonstration project and requires an independent evaluation. The highest state courts must provide a portion of funding for Court Improvement Program activities. P.L. 109-288 extended funding for voucher service delivery demonstration and court improvement programs through FY2011. It also amended the definition of the case review system for children in foster care and appropriated $40 million in additional FY2006 funding for the Promoting Safe and Stable Families program. The Promoting Safe and Stable Families program received a total funding of $434 million in FY2006, with an expected continuation of funding at the same level in FY2007. The program is authorized to receive $545 million annually through a combination of mandatory and discretionary authorization levels, with mandatory funding increased from $305 million to $345 million by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. The P.L. 109-288 extended mandatory funding for the Promoting Safe and Stable Families program to $345 million annually for FY2007-FY2011. Discretionary funding authorization remained at $200 million, with Congress typically allocating less than the authorized amount. Eligible states receive a portion of mandatory and discretionary funds for child and family services, with certain funds reserved for specific purposes as outlined in the statute. The P.L. 109-288 extended mandatory funding for the Promoting Safe and Stable Families program to $345 million annually for FY2007-FY2011. $40 million of the program's mandatory funds must be reserved in each of FY2006-FY2011 to support caseworker visits to children in foster care and improve outcomes for children affected by substance abuse. Funding to tribes was increased by establishing a 3% set-aside. HHS must use a portion of the funds for research, evaluation, and technical assistance to improve caseworker visits and outcomes for children affected by substance abuse. The P.L. 109-288 extended mandatory funding for the Promoting Safe and Stable Families program to $345 million annually for FY2007-FY2011, with $40 million reserved for improving outcomes for children affected by substance abuse. Table 2 outlines the PSSF funding distribution requirements, while Table 3 shows annual funding for the program since its inception. Table 4 displays actual awards of PSSF funds by state for FY2005 and FY2006, and allotment of these funds by state for FY2007. For FY2007, P.L. 109-288 allocated $40 million in PSSF funding for improving outcomes for children affected by substance abuse. The funds are distributed to states based on their share of children receiving food stamps, and must be used for monthly caseworker visits for children in foster care. Additionally, all targeted funds for FY2007 must be distributed through competitive grants for services to help children impacted by parent/caretaker abuse of methamphetamine. States have until FY2009 to spend these funds. The Promoting Safe and Stable Families Program aims to improve outcomes for children affected by parent/caretaker substance abuse. Congress has been consistently concerned about the stability and permanence of children in foster care since the 1980s. The program, established in the 1990s, provides funding for services to help children impacted by substance abuse. By the end of the 1980s, concerns arose about the growing foster care caseload due to crack cocaine use. States, with private foundation support, started offering family preservation services to reduce unnecessary foster care placements. Congress discussed increasing federal support for preventive services, leading to an agreement in 1992 for innovative services for children and families. The 1992 agreement proposed new capped entitlement funding for innovative services, substance abuse prevention, and respite care for children and families. The legislation allocated $165 million in FY1993, increasing to $575 million in FY1998, with adjustments for inflation. Despite approval by Congress, the legislation was vetoed by President George H. W. Bush and did not become law. Child welfare advocates succeeded in including new entitlement funding for family preservation and support services in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (P.L. 103-66), proposed by the Clinton Administration. The legislation entitled states to receive federal funds to develop and operate family programs, with funding increasing from $60 million in FY1994 to at least $255 million by FY1998. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 provided funding for states to establish family preservation and support services. One percent of the funds was reserved for tribal services, allocated based on the number of children receiving food stamps. States had to maintain funding levels and contribute non-federal funds. Additionally, funds were set aside for state courts to improve handling of child welfare cases and for HHS to evaluate programs. The 1997 Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA, P.L. 105-89) aimed to prioritize a child's safety in welfare decisions and expedite foster children's placement in permanent families. Concerns arose over states' prolonged focus on family reunification, even when it posed risks to the child's safety. Reports also highlighted the need for more adoptions from foster care. The Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA) prioritized child safety in welfare decisions and aimed to expedite foster children's placement in permanent families. Concerns were raised about the lack of adoptions from foster care despite the increasing number of children in care. ASFA renamed the Promoting Safe and Stable Families program and emphasized the safety of children as the \"paramount concern.\" Congress required states to use a significant portion of their funding for time-limited family reunification services and adoption promotion and support. Congress increased funding for the Promoting Safe and Stable Families program from $275 million in FY1999 to $305 million in FY2001. They also set time limits for reunification services and required states to initiate termination of parental rights proceedings for children in foster care for 15 of the past 22 months. Adoption cannot proceed without termination of parental rights. The 2001 Amendments Program reauthorization language aimed to expedite permanency for children in foster care by introducing new funding categories for reunification and adoption promotion services. Initially seeking to raise mandatory funding to $505 million, Congress later authorized discretionary funds above the prior level in the Promoting Safe and Stable Families Amendments of 2001. The Promoting Safe and Stable Families Amendments of 2001 (P.L. 107-133) authorized $200 million in discretionary funding for the program annually from FY2002-FY2006, maintaining the prior authorized mandatory funding level of $305 million through FY2006. States were entitled to a share of discretionary funds based on the number of children receiving food stamps. Additionally, set-asides were designated for tribal child and family services, Court Improvement, and research, evaluation, training, and technical assistance. The Promoting Safe and Stable Families Amendments of 2001 authorized $200 million annually for the program, with provisions for family preservation and support services, Court Improvement Program funding, research priorities, and technical assistance. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 increased funding for the Promoting Safe and Stable Families program to $345 million for FY2006 only. It also amended the Court Improvement Program to provide for new grants related to training and child well-being. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 increased funding for the Promoting Safe and Stable Families program to $345 million for FY2006 only, with additional grants for training and child well-being. The legislation also allocated $100 million for grants to ensure safety and well-being for children, separate from PSSF funding. The Court Improvement Program was amended to align with recommendations from the Pew Commission on Children in Foster Care. The Child and Family Services Improvement Act of 2006 extends funding for the PSSF program for five years, targeting $40 million for caseworker visits and improving outcomes for children affected by substance abuse. HHS must use funds for evaluation and support of these activities. States must report on actual use of funds, increase set aside for tribal services, and allow access for more tribes. The Child and Family Services Improvement Act of 2006 did not amend the definition of services under the PSSF program, but requires states to report actual spending of funds. HHS must use research set-aside to support caseworker visits and improve outcomes for children affected by substance abuse. States must also increase set aside for tribal services and allow access for more tribes. The PSSF program requires states to spend funding on family support, family preservation, time-limited family reunification, and adoption promotion services to improve outcomes for children affected by substance abuse. These services aim to strengthen families, promote child safety and well-being, and enhance child development. Family preservation services aim to help families at risk or in crisis, including programs for children to safely return home or be placed for adoption. This includes preventive services, follow-up care, respite care, and parenting improvement programs. Family preservation services include support for parents and caregivers to improve parenting skills, such as child development, budgeting, stress management, health, and nutrition. They also offer infant safe haven programs for parents to safely relinquish newborns. Time-limited family reunification services aim to reunite children in foster care with their parents through counseling and support within a 15-month period. The curr_chunk discusses various services provided to children in foster care, including counseling, substance abuse services, mental health services, domestic violence assistance, and adoption promotion and support. The definitions of these services focus on the mission rather than specific activities. The PSSF service categories have similar missions but different target populations. Family support services aim to help any family in a community, while family preservation services focus on families at risk of foster care placement due to abuse or neglect. Federal child welfare funding for family support and family preservation services was established to prevent foster care placement, with reunification services specifically for children and families separated for 15 months or less. Adoption promotion and support services encourage and assist families adopting from foster care. Federal funding for family support services, including adoption promotion and support, was increased by Congress through the Adoption and Safe Families Act. States are required to allocate PSSF funds towards reunification and adoption promotion to ensure the safety and permanency of children in foster care. This shift in focus aimed to expedite exits from foster care rather than prevent entries into care. States are required to allocate PSSF funds towards family support, family preservation, time-limited reunification, and adoption promotion and support. Program evaluators note that the newer service categories of reunification and adoption have become well-established. This allows states to offer a full range of child and family services to those in need. The effectiveness of family support and preservation services funded under Title IV-B, Subpart 2 was evaluated by HHS through three large-scale evaluations in the early 1990s. The evaluations focused on implementation issues, the effectiveness of specific family preservation service models, and overall program effectiveness. The effectiveness of family support and preservation services funded under Title IV-B, Subpart 2 was evaluated through three large-scale evaluations in the early 1990s. These evaluations focused on implementation issues, specific service models, and overall program effectiveness. Congress amended the statutory language on evaluations in 2001 to include research priorities such as time-limited reunification services and post-adoption services. The 2006 amendments require HHS to fund research and evaluation related to improving caseworker visits for foster children. The curr_chunk discusses funding for improving caseworker visits for foster children and providing services to children affected by substance abuse. Despite optimism in the 1990s, evaluations have not shown that intensive family preservation services effectively reduce placements in foster care. Intensive family preservation services did not reduce out-of-home placement or maltreatment recurrence, nor did they improve family functioning beyond normal casework services. The evaluations were not designed to compare outcomes for families receiving no services versus those who did receive services. Intensive family preservation services, like the Homebuilders model, aim to quickly provide intensive and short-term support to families at risk of child removal. The model requires caseworkers to work closely with no more than two families, be available 24/7, and offer a range of material and clinical aids. This approach is based on crisis theory, emphasizing the importance of immediate intervention for families in crisis. The study on intensive family preservation services found that only a small percentage of control group children were placed in foster care within 30 days, ranging from 89% to 95%. The study found that the control group children not placed in foster care ranged from 89% to 95%, similar to the experimental group. Researchers suggest that targeting intensive family preservation services on children at imminent risk may never be fully achieved, as many families may not perceive themselves to be in crisis. The study found that intensive family preservation services may not fully address chronic family problems. While these services did not harm families, they may not be sufficient for families with diverse child welfare needs. A single service delivery model may not work for everyone, suggesting the need for more tailored services. The federal statute does not mandate a specific family preservation services model for states, and HHS has not enforced one in program regulations. Despite discouraging evaluation data on intensive family preservation services, states have had time to adjust their service delivery models. Researchers recommend further study on effective caseworker activities, parent training classes, and different service delivery models for specific subgroups. In FY2004, out of 872,000 child maltreatment victims, 40% received in-home services, 19% were placed in foster care, and 41% received no post-investigation services. There is a need for in-home services for families where children have been maltreated but not removed from their homes. Researchers note that parents must voluntarily participate in services offered to intact families, and there may be a lack of needed services or long waiting lists. A case-level analysis found that states were less successful in meeting the needs of children and families in their own homes compared to those in foster care. In-home cases were more likely to receive a \"needs improvement\" rating for key indicators related to child and family well-being. In-home cases are more likely to receive lower ratings for key indicators related to child and family well-being compared to foster care cases. Common challenges in state performance include inadequate provision of services and weaknesses in ensuring children's safety. The agency lacks consistency in providing sufficient services to address risk of harm to children, monitor families, offer appropriate services, involve fathers, mothers, and children in case planning, ensure face-to-face contacts for children's safety, meet education-related needs, provide enough dentists/doctors accepting Medicaid, offer mental health services for children. The agency lacks consistency in providing sufficient mental health services for children in foster care and in-home case loads, as well as conducting mental health assessments. Family support services aim to prevent child abuse and neglect and improve parental functioning. Family support services are typically provided by community agencies for a broad range of families, not just those at risk of child abuse. These services, such as parent training and child development classes, are more likely to be sought out by families rather than court-ordered for family preservation. The Abt Associates researchers conducted a meta-analysis of 665 studies on family support programs in Canada, the United States, and Great Britain after 1965. The programs aimed to improve child outcomes by enhancing parenting skills and child development. The meta-analysis of family support programs found that most programs focused on improving parenting (98%) and child development (91%). Services were mainly delivered in the family home (62%), with other settings including hospital, school, community center, university, and agency. Home visits were the primary service delivery mode, followed by parent meetings/classes/groups and group early education for children. Majority of programs (87%) utilized staff with formal training. Many programs targeted specific populations, with 88% focusing on families at environmental or biological risk. Family support programs target families at risk (e.g., poverty, abuse, teen parenthood) or with biological risks. Services are short-term with small amounts of support. Overall, these programs have positive effects on children's cognitive and social-emotional development, especially for children with special needs or those receiving early childhood education. Home visiting programs have less impact on cognitive outcomes. Family support programs targeting teen parents with young children and combining case management with parent-child activities were more effective in protecting children from accidental injury, abuse, or neglect. These programs had small but consistent positive effects on parenting attitudes, knowledge, behavior, and family functioning. Professional staff assistance and support groups were key components in producing positive outcomes for parents. The meta-analysis found that family support programs had little effect on parent mental health and family economic self-sufficiency. Recent projects funded by HHS focus on smaller scale projects related to various services such as healthy marriage promotion and father involvement in child welfare. The 1993 law (P.L. 103-66) established funding for child and family services under Title IV-B, Subpart 2, requiring states to engage in planning and reporting on services for children and families. This includes welfare casework, Early Head Start services, interventions for substance abusing parents, post-adoption services, adoption promotion efforts, family reunification, and crisis nursery/respite care services. Ongoing research and evaluation are conducted for these projects. The 1993 law established funding for child and family services, requiring states to engage in planning and reporting on services for children and families. States must annually review progress towards goals and make necessary adjustments to the plan. Every five years, a new five-year plan must be established, with annual progress reviews and reports. States were encouraged to take planning seriously, with the option to use up to $1 million for planning purposes without matching state spending. Regulations consolidated child welfare program planning requirements into a single Child and Family Services Plan. The Child and Family Services Plan consolidates child welfare program planning requirements, including assurances for various funding programs. States submit a five-year plan and annual progress reports, estimating total child welfare spending. HHS allows states to use PSSF funds for planning purposes. HHS permits states to use PSSF funds for planning purposes without counting towards the 10% limit on PSSF funds. Collaboration is emphasized in creating the plan to ensure a full continuum of child and family services. Most states engaged in extensive planning with increased community involvement. The locus of decision-making for PSSF funds shifted from outside the state child welfare agency to back towards the agency after the passage of ASFA. Limited information is available on the current program since the Bell study. The analysis of state spending plans for FY1999-FY2002 showed that most states spread their PSSF funding across all four categories, leading to difficulty in accurately reporting spending in statutorily defined categories. The lack of a single plan format made it challenging to track how funds were being used consistently across states. Researchers suggested understanding how funds were used based on other factors. The report tracked the planned use of PSSF funds for various activities between FY1999-FY2002, including home visiting, family centers, information and referral, recreation, employment services, health services, child care, prevention services, parent support, mentoring, and more. Researchers suggested understanding fund usage based on service delivery location and target recipients. The researchers noted drops in states planning to use PSSF funds for child care, parent support, skills training, and family preservation between FY1999-FY2002. Reporting requirements for PSSF include sending five-year plans to HHS and providing descriptions of family services in Annual Progress Review. The 2006 amendments (P.L 109-288) changed reporting requirements for PSSF funds, now requiring states to include information on how the funds were actually spent. Before the amendments, plans were sent to HHS regional offices and were not standardized or easily compared. The state spent PSSF and Child Welfare Services funds and provided information on planned spending. HHS is required by law to compile this information annually in a report for Congress. Some federal programs with similar purposes include the Community-Based Child Abuse Prevention program, which supports community-based services to prevent child maltreatment. The Community-Based Child Abuse Prevention program distributes funds to community-based groups for family support services, including parent education, home visiting, respite care, counseling for adoption, child care, and services for families with children with disabilities. Child Welfare Services, authorized by Title IV-B, Subpart 1, is a federal program supporting state child welfare activities. It was most recently amended and re-authorized in 2003, with an authorization level of $80 million for FY2004. However, the program has never received more than $43 million in funding. Child Welfare Services, part of the federal program authorized under Title IV-B, Subpart 1, supports state child welfare activities. Changes made by P.L. 109-288 align its funding authorization with the PSSF program, expiring with FY2011. Funds are distributed to states, territories, and tribes for services to protect children at risk of maltreatment, including counseling, family support, and removal of children from unsafe homes. Child Welfare Services involve removal of children from unsafe homes and providing services for reunification. If reunification is not possible, parental rights may be terminated, and children placed for adoption. States use Child Welfare Services for a wider range of activities than PSSF grants, with a 2003 study showing different funding priorities. Child Welfare Services funds are primarily used for child welfare worker salaries, administration, child protective services, and foster care maintenance payments. The program has a discretionary funding authorization level of $325 million but has never received more than $295 million in a year. The House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee oversee the program. The programs funded by discretionary appropriations support research or demonstration projects related to adoption and services for families at risk of child abuse or neglect. These programs include Adoption Opportunities, Abandoned Infants Assistance, and Adoption Awareness, with funding authorization extended through FY2008. The House Energy and Commerce and Senate HELP committees handled the 2000 legislation that created Adoption Awareness program authority. Additional programs supporting family support goals of PSSF include Early Head Start, Head Start, and the Healthy Start Initiative. Some states use non-dedicated federal funding streams like TANF, SSBG, and Medicaid for child welfare purposes. State child welfare agencies have access to federal funding streams like TANF, SSBG, and Medicaid, with $1.3 billion used for prevention activities, family reunification, and child protective services. However, their access to these funds is not guaranteed as it depends on funding decisions made by others in the state. The current Administration seeks new limits on state use of certain Medicaid services, affecting child welfare.
