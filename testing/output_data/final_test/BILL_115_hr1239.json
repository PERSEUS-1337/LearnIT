Congress acknowledges the importance of language readiness for national security, emphasizing the need for extensive language training for personnel in the Intelligence Community and Department of Defense. The ability of U.S. citizens to communicate in other languages is crucial for future national security and economic well-being. The Federal Government aims to ensure that its employees are prepared for the challenges of the changing international environment. The Federal Government recognizes the need for American students to be better prepared for global challenges by improving teaching in foreign languages, area studies, and other international fields. The Federal Government acknowledges the importance of enhancing teaching in foreign languages and international studies to better prepare American students for global challenges. This is reflected in the establishment of World Language Advancement and Readiness Grants. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence and the Secretary of Education, will provide grants to State and local educational agencies for innovative world language programs for elementary and secondary students. Grants will be awarded for a 3-year period and support systemic approaches to improving language learning at the State level. The Secretary of Defense will provide grants to local educational agencies for programs that show promise of continuation, can be replicated, and may include professional development. The Federal share for each fiscal year will be 50 percent, with exceptions determined by the Secretary of Defense. The Secretary of Defense will allocate funds for world language learning in elementary schools and for critical language instruction related to national security. Additionally, a small percentage of funds may be reserved for program evaluation. To apply for a grant under subsection (a), a State or local educational agency must submit an application to the Secretary of Defense with required information. Special consideration will be given to programs that offer summer language programs for teachers, connect nonnative English speakers with schools for language learning, and promote sequential world language study. The grant program aims to promote world language study through innovative activities like dual language immersion and technology use. The program involves a consortium of agencies, schools, and higher education institutions. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.
