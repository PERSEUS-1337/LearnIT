    "title": "AB 1161",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Article 7.5 of the Education Code establishes the California Preschool Investment Pilot Program to increase preschool slots and subsidies. Key terms are defined, including the State Department of Education as the overseeing department and the California Preschool Investment Fund as the funding source. The California Preschool Investment Pilot Program allows counties to apply for inclusion by June 1, 2016. The Department will select five counties by September 1, 2016, prioritizing those with long waitlists for child care assistance. Urban, suburban, and rural counties will be represented in the program. The county's waitlist for child care assistance, increasing preschool slots, and receiving federal Race to the Top funds are key considerations for the California Preschool Investment Pilot Program. The program allows counties to apply for inclusion and create a Preschool Investment Fund for monetary contributions. The department will establish a procedure for monetary contributions to the fund and issue receipts indicating the amount contributed, date, contributor's name, and tax credit status. Credits will be allocated based on a first-come-first-served basis, subject to annual caps. The department will notify the Franchise Tax Board of allocated credits monthly and update their websites quarterly with remaining credit information. Funds in the account will first be transferred to the General Fund, then allocated based on appropriations. The funds allocated to the department will be used for California state preschool programs in selected counties. Participating counties must report annually on program performance to the department's Early Education & Support Division. The article will be in effect until January 1, 2021, and will be repealed unless a later statute extends the date. Any remaining funds will be transferred to another state fund for preschool programs for low-income children. Section 41202 of the Education Code is amended to clarify the meanings of certain words and phrases. The California Constitution defines \"moneys to be applied by the State\" as appropriations from the General Fund allocated to school or community college districts. Withheld or unallocated appropriations do not fall under this definition. General Fund revenues available for appropriation are defined as proceeds of taxes, including any excess revenues over the appropriations limit. Only revenues from the current fiscal year are included, starting from 1995-96. Starting from the 1995-96 fiscal year, General Fund revenues for appropriation include proceeds of taxes, specifically from the state sales tax realigned for children's programs. The calculation method follows the Department of Finance's approach in the 1986 Budget Act. The General Fund revenues for appropriation now include the total annual amount of credit claimed under specific tax code sections, treated as proceeds of taxes. This provision will expire on January 1, 2021. The paragraph explains that \"General Fund revenues appropriated for school districts\" includes all appropriations for school districts, regardless of the source or purpose. Any reappropriation of funds from prior years is not counted in the total amount. This provision will no longer be in effect after January 1, 2021. The definition of \"General Fund revenues appropriated for community college districts\" includes all appropriations for community college districts, regardless of the source or purpose. Reappropriation of funds from prior years is not counted in the total amount. The total allocations to school districts and community college districts from General Fund proceeds of taxes appropriated pursuant to Article XIII\u2009B include all appropriations made for allocation to these districts, regardless of the funding source or purpose. Any reappropriation of funds is also included in the calculation of the required percentage. Reappropriation of funds from prior years is not included in the sum of appropriations. The definition of \"General Fund revenues appropriated for school districts and community college districts\" in the California Constitution includes funds for part-day state preschool programs and the After School Education and Safety Program, but excludes reappropriated funds from prior years. Any appropriation not designated for school districts or community college districts, excluding funds for part-day state preschool programs and the After School Education and Safety Program. Appropriations to the Teachers\u2019 Retirement Fund or Public Employees\u2019 Retirement Fund are also excluded, except for those related to state mandates before January 1, 1988. (g) \"Allocated local proceeds of taxes\" refers to local revenues used to offset state aid for school districts, excluding certain identified revenues. (h) \"Allocated local proceeds of taxes\" for community college districts offset state aid and exclude student fees. (i) The 4-percent entitlement calculation excludes allocated local proceeds of taxes. Section 17053.87 is added to the Revenue and Taxation Code. For taxable years between 2016 and 2020, a 40% tax credit is allowed for contributions to the California Preschool Investment Fund. Taxpayers must provide a receipt from the State Department of Education to claim the credit. The tax credit allowed for contributions to the California Preschool Investment Fund can be carried over for up to five years if it exceeds the \"net tax.\" The credit reduces any deduction allowed for the contribution amount. The Franchise Tax Board can establish rules and guidelines for implementing this credit. For taxable years between 2016 and 2020, a 40% tax credit is allowed for contributions to the California Preschool Investment Fund, up to $250 million annually. The credit expires on December 1, 2020. The taxpayer must provide a receipt from the State Department of Education to claim a credit for contributing to the California Preschool Investment Fund. Any excess credit can be carried over for up to five years. The credit can only be claimed on a timely filed original tax return. The Franchise Tax Board can establish rules and guidelines for this section, with a limit of $250 million in credits per year. The section will be repealed on December 1, 2020."
