The Business and Professions Code is amended to allow the board to take action against a license for various reasons, including advertising violations, fraud in obtaining a license, employing unlicensed individuals, criminal convictions related to the profession, impersonation during exams, and negligence in practice. The Business and Professions Code allows the board to take action against a license for various reasons, including negligence, criminal convictions, aiding or abetting violations, fraudulent acts, and falsifying records. The board can take action against a license for reasons such as changing prescriptions or falsifying orders, as well as denial, suspension, or revocation of a license by another agency. The board may take action against a licensee for failing to follow infection control guidelines, risking transmission of bloodborne diseases. The board will reference standards from the State Department of Public Health and California Occupational Safety and Health Act to prevent HIV, hepatitis B, and other pathogens in healthcare settings. The Dental Board of California, Board of Registered Nursing, and Board of Vocational Nursing and Psychiatric Technicians aim to ensure consistency in implementing infection control guidelines to prevent bloodborne diseases in healthcare settings. The board ensures licensees are informed of infection control guidelines and safeguards for minimizing bloodborne disease transmission. The board may take action against respiratory care practitioners for unprofessional conduct in administering respiratory care. Repeated acts of administering inappropriate respiratory care procedures, protocols, therapeutic regimens, or diagnostic testing may result in unprofessional conduct. This includes any unsafe practices or abuse towards patients. Violations can lead to misdemeanor charges with fines or imprisonment. The board has the authority to address all aspects of respiratory care performed by licensed practitioners. The act does not require reimbursement under the California Constitution as it pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions."
