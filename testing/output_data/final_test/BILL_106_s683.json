    "content": "The Act titled \"Independent Spent Nuclear Fuel Storage Act of 1999\" defines terms like \"Commission\" as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of the Department of Energy. It also includes findings related to nuclear waste storage. The Congress acknowledges the current storage of 35,000 tons of spent nuclear fuel at commercial reactors nationwide. The planned repository for high-level radioactive waste and spent fuel from the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 has not been built on time, hindering the Secretary from accepting waste as intended. Additionally, there have been no new orders for civilian nuclear power facilities. Construction of civilian nuclear power generating facilities has been hindered by delays in the establishment of a deep geologic repository for high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel. This delay has led to the need for additional spent fuel storage capacity at currently operating commercial nuclear reactors, prompting nuclear utilities to invest in facilities like dry cask storage. The technology for long-term storage of spent nuclear fuel, including dry cask storage, has significantly improved since the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has jurisdiction over this matter under various statutes and regulations. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has jurisdiction to review and evaluate the spent fuel storage capability of commercial nuclear utilities. These utilities are well suited to maintain the institutional capability necessary to steward spent nuclear fuel during interim storage. Increased radioactive decay will occur in spent nuclear fuel stored before delivery to the Secretary as per the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (42 U.S.C. 10143) aims to ease the handling, transportation, and disposal of nuclear waste. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 aims to ease the handling, transportation, and disposal of nuclear waste through amendments. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 is amended to allow persons with contracts to offset storage expenses for spent fuel until the Secretary accepts the fuel at an authorized facility. This amendment aims to facilitate the handling and disposal of nuclear waste. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 is amended to allow offsetting storage expenses for spent fuel until the Secretary accepts the fuel at an authorized facility. The amount for storage shall reflect the cost of qualifying storage under subsection (f)(1)."
