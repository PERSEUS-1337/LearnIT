    "content": "The House and Senate Armed Services Committees report their versions of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) annually, containing provisions affecting military personnel. A conference committee resolves differences between the House and Senate versions before passage. This report highlights personnel-related issues in the FY2013 NDAA. The House and Senate versions of the FY2013 NDAA were introduced, reported, and passed in Congress. The Senate incorporated its provisions into an amendment upon receiving the House version. A conference report was agreed to in both chambers in December 2012. The FY2013 NDAA was introduced, reported, and passed in Congress, with a conference report agreed upon in December 2012. The legislation was signed by the president on January 2, 2013 as P.L. 112-239. The authorized active duty end strengths for FY2001 were outlined, with related CRS products available for more detailed information. In response to the demands of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Congress increased the authorized personnel strength of the Army and Marine Corps substantially after FY2006. By FY2012, the Army's authorized end strength was 562,000, with potential to increase to 592,400, while the Marine Corps was authorized for 202,100 personnel. Plans were announced to reduce Army and Marine Corps personnel to 490,000 and 175,000, respectively, by FY2017. End strength for the Air Force and Navy decreased during this time frame. The House bill included reductions in end strengths for the Army, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Navy for FY2012. The bill specified that individuals being evaluated for disability would be excluded from the end strength count, allowing more personnel to remain on active duty, especially for the ground forces with many wounded personnel. The House bill included reductions in end strengths for the Army, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Navy for FY2012, excluding individuals being evaluated for disability. The Senate and conference report also addressed end-strength levels, with slight variations for the Air Force. The conference report adopted limitations on end-strength reductions for the Army and Marine Corps but did not include the certification requirement. The conference report for FY2014-17 did not adopt certification requirements, budgeting restrictions, or disability exclusion. Section 528 requires Service Secretaries to report on adverse impacts related to service members in the Integrated Disability Evaluation System. Reference(s): CRS Report R41874, FY2012 National Defense Authorization Act. Reserves have been extensively used in operations since September. The overall authorized end strength of the Selected Reserves has declined by about 2% over the past 10 years, with reductions in Navy Reserve strength being a significant factor. Between FY2001 and FY2012, the Army National Guard, Coast Guard Reserve, Air Force Reserve, and Navy Reserve saw the largest shifts in authorized end strength. The authorized end strength of Selected Reserves has decreased over the past 10 years, with significant reductions in Navy Reserve numbers. The Army National Guard, Coast Guard Reserve, Air Force Reserve, and Navy Reserve experienced the largest changes in end strength between FY2001 and FY2012. In FY2013, there were decreases in the Air Force Reserve, Navy Reserve, and Coast Guard Reserve, while the Army Reserve and Marine Corps Reserve remained relatively stable. The House and Senate rejected the Administration's proposed reductions in end strength for the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve in FY2012. Instead, they authorized a small reduction for the Air National Guard and an increase for the Air Force Reserve compared to FY12. The committee report noted that the increase in end strength for the Air Force Reserve reflected the committee's limitation on retiring, divesting, or transferring aircraft assigned to the Air Force. The committee report supported the Department of Defense's request for reserve component end strengths in fiscal year 2013, except for additional Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve end strength to support force structure changes. The conference report adopted lower strength levels than the House and Senate provisions but higher than the Administration request. The military pay raise is a topic of concern due to the overall cost of military personnel and ongoing operations in Afghanistan. The President's FY2013 Budget requests a 1.7% raise, consistent with the formula indexing it to the Employment Cost Index. Congress has sometimes approved raises different from the ECI, with examples from past fiscal years. The House bill aligns with the Administration's request, while the Senate bill lacks specific language, which would default to a 1.7% increase. The conference committee adopted the House language for a 1.7% military pay increase effective January 1, 2013, costing $1.3 billion in 2013. Congress passed P.L. 106-446 in 2000 to end euthanizing military working dogs. Congress passed legislation to support the adoption of retired military working dogs by law enforcement agencies and former handlers. Eligible adopters now include the handler (if wounded) or a family member in case of the handler's death. These dogs are currently classified as \"equipment,\" requiring adopters to cover transportation costs. Efforts are underway to reclassify them as military \"members\" to have the military cover transportation expenses. Military working dogs are trained to be fearless and aggressive, which may not be desired outside of the military or law enforcement. Concerns exist for the welfare of these dogs, as well as for family members of deceased or seriously wounded Armed Forces members who care for them. In 2011, 444 dogs left the inventory, with various dispositions including death on duty, being killed in action, and euthanized due to medical or behavioral issues. In 2011, 444 military working dogs left the inventory, with dispositions including death on duty, being killed in action, and euthanized due to medical or behavioral issues. 16 dogs were euthanized for being unsuitable for law enforcement, and 44 remained pending disposition. The military has been a leader in advancing minorities and women, with changes starting in 1948 with Executive Order 9981 for \"equal treatment and opportunity.\" Issues of racial and sexual discrimination still exist. Diversity advocates see measuring progress in racial and sexual discrimination as crucial. Critics fear it may lead to quotas despite prohibitions. Military provides 42 days maternity leave, 10 days paternity leave, and 21 days adoption leave. Adoption leave can be used in addition to other leave provisions. The military provides 42 days maternity leave, 10 days paternity leave, and 21 days adoption leave. Maternity leave has been extended to 42 days, and adoption leave for the primary caregiver has also been increased to 42 days. Dual military couples who adopt receive 10 days of leave for the non-primary caregiver spouse. In February 2012, DOD opened additional occupations to women previously closed due to the combat exclusion rule, with women being held to the same standards as men. The services are evaluating women's roles in combatant occupations. The term 'physical standards' in the military raises questions about its definition, particularly regarding gender-neutral requirements. Different standards may apply to men and women based on the amount of effort exerted, regardless of the actual work accomplished. For example, if a female soldier carries 70 pounds of equipment and exerts the same effort as a male carrying 100 pounds, the differing standards could be seen as gender-neutral. This distinction may be significant in tasks involving ammunition, medical equipment, communications gear, and supplies. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 made changes to the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) regarding sex crimes like rape. Congress aims to improve judicial proceedings under the UCMJ, including addressing sexual assault and related offenses. Recent reports of hazing in the military, including cases of hazing-related suicides, prompted the House to hold hearings on the matter. Concerns have been raised over conflicts between the policy banning open homosexuality in the military and religious expressions against homosexuality. The First Amendment and federal laws protect religious freedoms in the military, especially regarding the repeal of DADT. Section 533 allows service members and chaplains to express their religious beliefs on sexual practices without fear of disciplinary action. The repeal of DADT raises First Amendment issues for chaplains who may refuse duties conflicting with their beliefs. Some argue the provision protects religious expression, while others fear it may create a hostile environment for openly homosexual service members. The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) does not recognize same-sex marriages at the federal level, allowing states to refuse recognition. Some states have recognized same-sex marriages, with the Navy Chief of Chaplains issuing a policy allowing same-sex marriages to be performed. The Navy Chief of Chaplains issued a policy allowing same-sex marriages in Navy Chapels on bases in states that permit them. However, the policy was later suspended following criticism. The FY2012 National Defense Authorization Act allowed military chaplains to opt out of performing marriage ceremonies based on conscience or moral principles. The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) is currently being contested in courts, with Section 537 reflecting DOMA's definition of marriage and preventing same-sex marriages under the Department of Defense. The House supports the Defense of Marriage Act, which prohibits same-sex marriages under the Department of Defense. The \"Troops-to-Teachers\" program helps retired service members become teachers in schools serving low-income populations. The Troops-to-Teachers program, originally a Department of Defense initiative, was transferred to the Secretary of Education in 2000. However, a report in 2012 recommended returning the program to the Department of Defense. The House provision includes changes such as reducing the required years of service for participants. The Senate provision for the Troops-to-Teachers program includes reducing service years, giving priority to language teachers, emphasizing military experience for career or technical teaching, adjusting metrics for school placement, and adding counseling services. The Secretary of Education advises the Secretary of Defense on teacher requirements and shortages. The Senate provision for the Troops-to-Teachers program aims to address critical shortages by reducing service years required for eligibility, modifying metrics for school placement, and transferring program responsibility to the Secretary of Defense. It also includes prioritizing language teachers, emphasizing military experience for career or technical teaching, and adding counseling services. On June 9, 2009, a civilian opened fire on U.S. Army soldiers in Little Rock, AK, and on November 5, 2009, an Army major opened fire at Ft. Hood, TX. Both were charged with murder. Some believe these acts should be viewed as acts of war, while others are concerned about anti-Muslim overtones if the Purple Heart is awarded in these situations. The Purple Heart could have anti-Muslim overtones if awarded in certain situations. The Combat Action Ribbon is awarded to soldiers engaged in combat, regardless of specialty. Section 555 of a House bill would have addressed this issue. Section 555 of the House bill would have aligned the eligibility dates for the Combat Action Ribbon (CAB) with those for the Combat Infantry Badge (CIB) and Combat Medical Badge (CMB), allowing eligible Army veterans from World War II to the present to be awarded the CAB. However, survivors of deceased service members would not be able to acquire the CAB on behalf of the service member. The Senate bill did not include a similar provision, and the conference report did not adopt the House provision. Military members who are single parents face the same assignment and deployment requirements as other service members, including the need for contingency plans for dependents in non-dependent areas. Concerns have been raised about custody rights during deployments, with the House proposing language to allow courts to assign temporary custody. The House is considering language to allow courts to assign temporary custody of a child for deployment without it being used against the service member in a custody hearing. This is part of ongoing efforts to address sexual assault issues in the military. The House is considering provisions to address sexual assault in the military, with a focus on prevention, reporting, judicial proceedings, and victim support. Congressional attention has led to new measures detailed in the FY2012 National Defense Authorization Act. Section 1146 of U.S.C. 10 allows members separated between October 1, 2007, and December 31, 2012, to continue using commissary and exchange stores. The House is considering provisions to address sexual assault in the military, with a focus on prevention, reporting, judicial proceedings, and victim support. Section 1146 of U.S.C. 10 allows members separated between October 1, 2007, and December 31, 2012, to continue using commissary and exchange stores until 2018, easing the transition out of the military for those involuntarily separated. A military retiree transitioning to a federal employee can waive their military retired pay and have their military time credited to their civil service retirement. This change would create parity between CSRS and FERS retirees regarding survivor benefits. H.R. 4310, passed by the House, did not include the Administration's 2013 budget proposals to raise premiums for military retirees. The bill also did not adopt the proposal to introduce enrollment fees for TRICARE Standard/Extra and TRICARE for Life. Section 712 of the bill increased certain pharmacy copayments. The curr_chunk discusses blocking statutory authorities to increase TRICARE copayments and enrollment for National Guard and Reserve members. It references previous reports on military personnel policy issues and provides a point of contact for further information. The TRS and TDP programs offer health and dental insurance to active duty family members and Selected Reserve members. Both programs require a monthly premium, and coverage terminates when a member is separated from the Selected Reserve. Continued health coverage can be purchased through CHCBP for up to 36 months. Premiums for CHCBP are $1,138 per quarter for individual coverage and $2,555 per quarter for family coverage. CHCBP does not include dental benefits. Section 701 of the bill would authorize the Secretary of Defense to make amendments to Title 10 of the United States Code. The bill would amend Title 10 of the United States Code to extend TRICARE Reserve Select coverage for 180 days to involuntarily separated members of the Selected Reserve. This would allow them to continue purchasing health care for up to 42 months. Applied behavioral analysis is a method used for individuals with autism spectrum disorders, starting around age 3\u00bd with intensive therapy for up to two years or longer to teach social, motor, and verbal behaviors. The bill aims to extend TRICARE Reserve Select coverage for involuntarily separated members of the Selected Reserve. Applied behavioral analysis is used for individuals with autism spectrum disorders to teach social, motor, and verbal behaviors through structured therapy. A memo found insufficient evidence to support the medical necessity of applied behavioral analysis for autism spectrum disorders. The memo concluded that applied behavioral analysis is considered an educational intervention and not medical care under TRICARE. While not reimbursable under TRICARE, it is covered under the ECHO program for active duty family members with specific disabilities. The proposed rule aims to expand coverage under the ECHO program with a $36,000 per year reimbursement limit. In April 2011, a report by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality supported early intensive behavioral and developmental interventions like applied behavioral analysis for children with autism. In April 2012, the Office of Personnel Management issued new guidance on coverage of applied behavioral analysis for Federal Employees Health Benefits Program insurance carriers. The Panel concluded that there is now sufficient evidence to categorize ABA as medical therapy, allowing insurance plans to propose benefit packages including ABA for federal civilian plans. The Secretary of Defense would conduct a one-year pilot program to provide treatment for autism spectrum disorders, including applied behavior analysis, for TRICARE beneficiaries. The conferees have granted the Department of Defense 1-year authority to assess coverage for applied behavior analysis under the basic TRICARE benefit independently from litigation proceedings. This decision aims to allow for a thorough evaluation of such coverage, separate from legal challenges. Recent Government Accountability Office testimony highlighted the lack of central command authority in the Military Health System, leading to inefficiencies and high costs. The current structure involves multiple organizations within the DoD, each with its own headquarters and support functions. Limited efforts have been made to consolidate administrative, management, and clinical functions. To address duplication and reduce costs, DoD should consider restructuring the governance of the military health system. In 2006, a report by the Center for Naval Analyses showed that DoD could have saved $281 million to $460 million annually by implementing reorganization alternatives for the military health system. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 required the Secretary of Defense to submit a report on reorganization options before any restructuring could take place. The DOD reported to Congress in 2012 on options for reorganizing the military health system, considering 12 options and recommending option C. The analysis recommended option C for reorganizing the military health system, stating that all options would increase costs. The Secretary of Defense is required to develop a detailed plan for reforms by specific deadlines, with funds not to be obligated until the plan is submitted to Congress. The Comptroller General must also review the plan. A TRICARE mail order pharmacy option has been available to DOD beneficiaries since the late 1990s, saving money for DOD by negotiating lower prices. Beneficiaries receive a 90-day supply for the same copayment as a 30-day supply at a retail pharmacy. Section 716 of the FY2012 National Defense Authorization Act would require the Secretary to implement certain changes. Section 716 of the FY2012 National Defense Authorization Act mandates a five-year mail-order pilot program for TRICARE for Life beneficiaries. This program allows beneficiaries to fill prescriptions at military treatment facilities and requires the Secretary to regulate instances where beneficiaries try to refill prescriptions at retail pharmacies. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that medications purchased through the mail-order pharmacy program cost DOD 19% less than if purchased through retail pharmacies. The President's Budget for 2013 proposes cost-sharing measures with TRICARE beneficiaries, including altering pharmacy copayments to encourage the use of mail-order pharmacies. The proposal aims to change pharmacy copayments for TRICARE beneficiaries, encouraging the use of generic medications and mail-order pharmacies. Copayments would be linked to National Health Expenditure changes, with no cost for prescriptions at military treatment facilities for beneficiaries. Active duty members would also not pay fees for prescriptions. Section 712 sets new cost-sharing rates for TRICARE pharmacy benefits, limiting annual copayment increases to retiree cost of living adjustments until 2022. The Department of Defense would be authorized to delay copayment increases until they reach at least 1 dollar, with the Secretary of Defense able to adjust copayments as needed after fiscal year 2022. Selected over-the-counter drugs may be added to the uniform formulary for eligible beneficiaries based on cost-effectiveness and clinical criteria. The Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee may recommend cost-effective and clinically effective drugs for no or low copayment. The Department of Defense has successfully saved money by providing certain over-the-counter drugs with no copayment. Congressional Budget Office estimates that Section 702 allows DoD to offer OTC medications at little or no charge. The Department of Defense has been authorized to subsidize over-the-counter drugs instead of more expensive prescription versions, resulting in annual savings of about $8 million. Extending this authority indefinitely would decrease spending by $4 million per year initially. The Department of Defense has been authorized to subsidize over-the-counter drugs instead of prescription versions, saving $8 million annually. Extending this authority would initially decrease spending by $4 million per year, with savings increasing due to inflation. Half of the savings would go to the Medicare-Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund. Assisted reproductive technologies are excluded from TRICARE coverage, but some services have been provided to severely wounded warriors under special circumstances. Military Treatment Facilities may offer these services as part of their medical education programs. The Department of Defense authorizes subsidized over-the-counter drugs, saving $8 million annually. Assisted reproductive services are available for seriously ill or severely injured active duty service members, with ongoing reviews on fertility preservation for service members. The Secretary of Defense is required to submit a report to Congress on the implementation of the \"Policy for Assisted Reproductive Services for Seriously or Severely Ill/Injured Active Duty Service Members\" by June 1, 2013. The report will include data on the types of injuries/illnesses, procedures sought, services provided, quality of life issues, and costs related to fertility preservation treatment for service members. The conferees expect a report from the Secretary of Defense on providing fertility assistance services to active-duty members with medical treatment-related conception difficulties. The report should include recommendations for policy or legislation changes and cost estimates for TRICARE to cover these services. CBO estimates that about 1,200 active duty members would utilize fertility assistance services each year, costing TRICARE approximately $20 million annually. This estimate includes the cost of in vitro fertilization and additional expenses for resulting pregnancies. CBO estimates that implementing section 712 would increase costs to TRICARE by $145 million over the 2013-2017 period, with about 200 additional pregnancies per year costing $10 million annually. This cost is higher due to the higher percentage of multiple births and preterm deliveries associated with fertility assistance procedures. Implementing section 712 would increase TRICARE costs by $145 million over 2013-2017. New T-3 contracts for TRICARE Prime service areas were awarded after delays. Some beneficiaries near MTF and BRAC sites may no longer have Prime coverage. Beneficiaries will no longer be offered Prime but retain TRICARE coverage under Standard or Extra plans. TRICARE Standard is fee-for-service health insurance available everywhere, while TRICARE Extra offers discounts for network providers in Prime Service Areas. MTF and BRAC PSAs are established by regional managed care support contractors to meet access standards. Additional PSAs were planned to be eliminated in 2012 but were still in place as of January 2013. DOD announced delays in reducing Prime Service Areas to save $55M/year due to higher costs for Prime compared to Standard. TRICARE retired beneficiaries losing access to Prime can switch to TRICARE Standard or enroll in another PSA within 100 miles. The DOD announced delays in reducing Prime Service Areas to save money. Beneficiaries within 100 miles of another PSA can enroll there by submitting a new form and selecting a new primary care manager. Section 732 of the bill requires the Secretary of Defense to report on the future availability of TRICARE Prime for eligible beneficiaries nationwide. The House and Senate bills addressed concerns about military mental health issues, with additional measures included in the enacted bill. The House-passed bill required mental health assessments for deployed members. The executive branch also showed concern with an Executive order on improving access to mental health services for veterans and military families. The House-passed bill required mental health assessments for deployed members, but the enacted bill did not adopt this measure. The Joint Explanatory Statement encourages the Secretary of Defense to develop a policy for mental health assessments for service members deployed in contingency operations. Section 725 authorizes a three-year pilot program for enhancing DOD efforts in mental health, substance use disorders, and TBI for National Guard and Reserves members. Grants will be awarded to community partners through a competitive process with matching contributions required. Section 728 directs a five-year pilot program for third party treatment of TBI and post-traumatic stress by the Secretaries of Defense and Veterans Affairs. The section outlines a process for providing payments to facilities for treating TBI or PTSD for members and veterans outside of military or VA medical facilities. It mandates the VA Secretary to inform veterans with service-connected injuries of treatment options and requires the Secretaries to develop a database of patient cases and report to Congress annually. Additionally, it aims to educate individuals on PTSD and establishes an advisory commission to coordinate prevention efforts across DOD, VA, and other agencies. The enacted bill expresses Congress's support for greater awareness of PTSD. The Senate-passed bill authorizes the Secretary of Defense to conduct research on mental health and substance use disorders in National Guard and Reserves members. Sections 731 and 733 require DOD to report on Warriors in Transition programs and eliminate gaps in psychological health and TBI programs. Section 735 conveys the Senate's sentiment. Section 735 of the bill expresses the Senate's support for developing a plan to ensure a sustainable flow of qualified counselors for the long-term needs of Armed Forces members, veterans, and their families. It also requires the Secretary of Defense to establish a position for oversight of suicide prevention and resilience programs within DOD, as well as implement a comprehensive suicide prevention program. Section 754 of the bill requires an independent assessment of mental health care benefits for members of the Armed Forces under the TRICARE program. Section 756 mandates a memorandum of understanding between the Secretaries of Defense and Veterans Affairs for peer counseling programs. Section 757 would require the Secretary to implement a suicide prevention program. The Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-163) requires the Secretary of Defense to establish an organization within DOD for translational research on mental health conditions and to make recommendations on medical practices for members of the Armed Forces. Additionally, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs must develop measures to assess mental health care services. The Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010 mandates the development of measures to assess mental health care services by the VA. Section 760 expands counseling services eligibility to certain active duty and reserve service members and their families. Section 761 authorizes mental health care for immediate family members of deployed Armed Forces members. Section 580 requires oversight of suicide prevention and resilience programs within DOD. Section 581 establishes a position for oversight of these programs. Section 581 amends title 10, United States Code, to codify the Suicide Prevention and Community Health and Response Program for National Guard and reserve component members. It requires training on suicide prevention, resilience, and community healing at Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program events, moves the program to the Office of the Secretary of Defense, and repeals a subsection of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008. The program would end on October 1, 2017. Section 583 mandates a study on resilience programs in the Army, using accepted measurements. Section 703 aligns post-deployment mental health assessments with other health assessments. Section 706 authorizes the Secretary of Defense to implement certain actions. The House-passed bill authorizes a pilot program to enhance DOD's efforts in mental health, substance use disorders, and traumatic brain injury for National Guard and reserves. It also requires joint sharing of medical records between the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. The House-passed bill authorizes a pilot program to enhance DOD's efforts in mental health, substance use disorders, and traumatic brain injury for National Guard and reserves. It also requires joint sharing of medical records between the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Additionally, the bill allows certain members of the armed forces to volunteer or be considered for employment as peer counselors under peer support counseling programs. The Secretary of Defense is required to translate research on mental health into medical practice policy, while the Secretary of Veterans Affairs must develop measures to assess mental health care services and provide counseling and mental health services to certain members of the armed forces. The House-passed bill authorizes a pilot program to enhance mental health services for National Guard and reserves. It also requires joint sharing of medical records between the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Additionally, certain members of the armed forces can volunteer as peer counselors. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs is required to establish a peer support counseling program to reduce veteran suicide rates."
