    "content": "Foreign ballistic and cruise missiles, particularly those capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction (WMD), are a significant concern for the national security interests of the United States. Countries with WMD missile capabilities can influence other nations and potentially cause widespread destruction. The United States is currently within range of ballistic missiles from Russia, China, North Korea, France, and the United Kingdom, with other countries having missiles that can reach U.S. overseas facilities. There is a growing fear of longer-range ballistic missiles being developed to deliver WMDs over great distances. The threat of ballistic missiles carrying WMDs is a major concern for the United States. The development of these missiles has become more difficult to track due to underground programs and hidden within civilian industries. The 1995 National Intelligence Estimate and the Rumsfeld Commission Report are still sources of controversy regarding missile threats. Despite global advancements in missile programs, the Rumsfeld Commission Report remains a key reference in 2005. The Bush Administration's commitment to ballistic missile defense has led to the deployment of interceptors in Alaska and California. The U.S. Intelligence Community estimates that Iran and North Korea pose ICBM threats to the United States. New missile developments may require re-evaluation of timelines. North Korea's ballistic missile development timelines may need re-evaluation as new missile programs are underway, posing regional tensions. Reductions in long-range missile threats have been noted since the Cold War due to nonproliferation treaties. The threat now includes widespread short-range missile capabilities, limited medium-range capabilities, and decreasing long-range missiles from the Cold War era. The possibility of new nations acquiring long-range missile capabilities is low, with an increase in short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs) noted. SRBMs in the 100 to 200 km range are on the rise, along with programs modifying surface-to-surface unguided rockets to add low-cost SRBM capabilities. Ballistic missiles are considered cost-effective compared to maintaining an air force, leading to their continued proliferation. The proliferation of ballistic missiles is increasing, with 15 countries known to produce them. Countries with missile production facilities can produce large quantities limited only by critical materials and components. The proliferation of ballistic missiles is increasing as countries with production facilities can produce large quantities limited only by critical materials and components. Acquiring a large number of missiles enables sustained attacks and overwhelms defense systems. Indigenous production capabilities also help avoid export control restrictions and allow for potential exports to other countries. North Korea has been exporting missiles and production facilities, raising concerns about more countries entering the market as suppliers. The concern is that more countries may enter the missile market as suppliers, with Russian and Chinese organizations being primary sources of missile technology. Missile proliferation is worrisome due to the delivery of nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons over long distances. Countries like India, Pakistan, North Korea, Iran, and Israel have tested long-range missiles and possess weapons of mass destruction programs. Nuclear weapons programs have decreased, with South Africa dismantling its arsenal and other countries abandoning theirs. Several countries have abandoned nuclear weapon programs and transferred weapons to Russia. Concerns arise over North Korea and Iran's nuclear programs. Countries with missiles also possess chemical and biological weapons, with challenges in developing biological warheads due to environmental sensitivity. Iraq had chemical weapons during the 1991 Gulf War. During the 1991 Gulf War, Iraq had missile warheads filled with nerve agents, botulinum toxin, and anthrax. Various countries including China, Egypt, Iran, Israel, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, and others possess missiles and chemical weapons. Ballistic missiles armed with conventional warheads were used in the Iran-Iraq war and the Gulf War. The development of advanced conventional warheads and enhanced missile reliability will increase military effectiveness. The United States has shown the effectiveness of cruise missiles. The United States has demonstrated the military effectiveness of cruise missiles in various conflicts. A new generation of stealthy and more capable cruise missiles is currently in development in multiple countries. The demand for longer-range missiles and nuclear, biological, and chemical warheads has increased due to their low cost, ability to penetrate defenses, and deliver weapons that could threaten enemy countries. Missiles have become a preferred delivery system for some countries, symbolizing national might. The US showcased its technological and military prowess during the 1991 Gulf War, Afghanistan, and Operation Iraqi Freedom, making adversarial countries and non-state groups more likely to avoid direct conflict. Some potential adversaries like Iran and North Korea are developing missiles and WMD to counter U.S. military strength and intimidate neighbors. Allies and neutral countries are also building missiles for national security. The stigma of missile possession was reduced by past conflicts. Missile attacks on civilian populations are now common in regional wars. The use of standoff weapons like cruise missiles and air-to-surface guided weapons is a common practice in U.S. military combat. Around three dozen countries, mainly in Asia and the Middle East, have ballistic missiles capable of delivering warheads 300 kilometers or more. Countries like Argentina, China, Iran, and North Korea have produced ballistic missiles, while some European countries and former Soviet republics also possess them. Eastern European countries and former Soviet republics possess missiles. International pressures and domestic policy decisions have eliminated missile programs in various countries. The Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) aims to slow missile proliferation, while the International Code of Conduct Against Ballistic Missile Proliferation (ICOC) impact remains uncertain. The MTCR, established in 1987 by several countries, focuses on controlling the transfer of missiles and related technology to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction. The Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) aims to slow missile proliferation by controlling transfers of missiles and related technology. The International Code of Conduct Against Ballistic Missile Proliferation (ICOC) focuses on addressing the demand side of proliferation through transparency and confidence-building measures. The ICOC aims to establish a formal organization for information control and confidence-building measures related to ballistic missile programs. Russia plans to reduce its ICBM force from 496 to 313 by 2010, with a mix of silo-based and mobile land versions. The number of ICBM nuclear warheads is expected to decrease from 1,770 to 923 by that time. Russia is phasing in the Topol-M missile system to replace older ICBMs, with a maneuverable reentry vehicle and countermeasures. The silo-based version is operational with plans for a fifth regiment in 2005, while production of the mobile version is set to begin. The production of the mobile version of the Topol-M missile system is scheduled to begin in 2005, with plans for three to nine systems to enter service in 2006. Russia is also developing a new heavy ICBM successor to the Topol-M, called Bulava, a submarine-launched ballistic missile with 10 warheads. Additionally, the Iskander missile system is being developed with maneuverable warheads and countermeasures. The Iskander missile system, designed to defeat Western ballistic missile defense systems, comes in two versions: the \"M\" version with a 400 km range and the \"E\" version with a 200 km range. It has four countermeasures including boost phase maneuvering and terminal phase maneuvering. Syria showed interest in acquiring Iskander-Es from Russia in 2005, but protests from Israel have reportedly halted the acquisition. Russia has deployed conventional air-launched cruise missiles with a range of 3,000 to 3,500 km and a 400 kg warhead capacity. Some of these missiles were illicitly transferred to Iran and China from Ukraine in 2001. China's military modernization, particularly its missile programs, has raised concerns among Western analysts. There are suspicions that more missiles were supplied to North Korea than acknowledged by the Ukrainian government. China's emphasis on missile programs, including ICBMs capable of reaching the United States, is seen as a potential threat to the regional balance of power in the Pacific. China has between 20 to 30 CSS-4 nuclear ICBMs in service and storage, with plans to phase out the DF-5 series in favor of newer solid propellant missiles. Development continues on the DF-31 road-mobile ICBM, with an initial operational capability expected in 2005-2006. The DF-31 is capable of striking targets in Europe, Asia, parts of Canada, and the northwestern United States, with a longer range DF-31A version also in development. The DF-31A road mobile version is reportedly under development with a projected IOC of 2007-2009, enabling China to strike the United States, Australia, and New Zealand. There are reports of a longer-range DF-41 in development for both road mobile and silo use. China aims to have 75-100 nuclear warheads on ICBMs capable of threatening the United States by 2018, with the main purpose being to disrupt U.S. decision-making, particularly regarding Taiwan intervention. China is developing the JL-2 SLBM for its Type 094 ballistic missile submarine, with an estimated range of 12,000 kilometers and multiple warheads. Reports indicate a test-firing of the JL-2 in 2005. The Type-094 submarine is expected to carry 16 JL-2 SLBMs, making it China's first intercontinental strategic nuclear delivery system. The U.S. DIA predicts the first Type-094 submarine with JL-2 SLBMs to be in service by 2010. China is developing new SRBMs, MRBMs, and IRBMs as part of its military modernization program, with plans to field these systems in military regions near the Chinese coast. The Type-094/JL-2 combination will allow China to target portions of the United States from operating areas close to its coast. The XIA-class ballistic missile submarine currently in service is considered noisy and has limited evasion capabilities. China is deploying between 650-730 mobile CSS-6 and CSS-7 SRBMs near Taiwan, with deployments increasing by about 100 missiles per year. These missiles can target key Taiwanese and U.S. military installations in the region to deter intervention or for potential attacks. China is deploying mobile CSS-6 and CSS-7 SRBMs near Taiwan to target military installations. Newer versions of these missiles have improved range and accuracy, with plans to explore their use for anti-access and sea-denial purposes. China is also deploying a new land-attack cruise missile, the \"Hong Niao,\" with different versions and ranges, including the capability to carry nuclear warheads. China is expected to deploy 200 additional LACMs near Taiwan, including the new HN series, by the end of 2006. China's participation in the EU's Galileo satellite navigation system raises concerns about enhancing the accuracy of its missiles and munitions. The Galileo system aims to provide highly accurate navigation for civilian and military use, potentially increasing China's missile strike capabilities. North Korea's ballistic missile program is a major concern for the United States and its allies, as the country continues to enhance its missile fleet and develop nuclear warheads for various range ballistic missiles. North Korea is also suspected of possessing chemical and possibly biological warheads for its missiles, and has reportedly exported missile technology to other countries. North Korea's missile program includes shorter-range Scuds, No Dong, and Taepo Dong missiles. Analysts believe North Korea has around 700 Scud C missiles with a 500 km range, capable of delivering chemical and biological agents. North Korea's missile transfers to other countries have advanced their programs, and missile test firings are seen as attempts to influence the United States and regional countries. Speculation arose in 2005 when North Korea announced the end of a self-imposed moratorium on long-range missile testing. North Korea's missile program includes Scud, No Dong, and Taepo Dong missiles with varying ranges. The Taepo Dong missile was launched over Japan in 1998, sparking speculation about new versions. Prior to September 9, 2003, there were rumors of a longer-range Taepo Dong missile, referred to as \"Taepo Dong X,\" being displayed during military parades in Pyongyang. North Korea's missile program includes Scud, No Dong, and Taepo Dong missiles with varying ranges. The allegedly longer-range version of the Taepo Dong is referred to as \"Taepo Dong X,\" believed to be based on the former Soviet Navy SS-N-6 submarine-launched ballistic missile. North Korea may have obtained SS-N-6 technology from Russia between 1992 and 1998. South Korean intelligence officials identified 10 new intermediate-range ballistic missiles and five launch pads at North Korea's Mirim Aerodrome. North Korea's new missile, based on the Soviet-designed SS-N-6, has a maximum range of 3,600 kms and is road-mobile, making it harder to detect and destroy. It can potentially carry a heavier nuclear weapon. North Korea's new missile, based on the Soviet-designed SS-N-6, has a maximum range of 3,600 kms and is road-mobile, making it harder to detect and destroy. This would significantly increase North Korea's ability to deliver a nuclear weapon at extended ranges, potentially striking U.S. military forces in Japan, Okinawa, and Guam. U.S. military officials suggest that North Korea's missile programs continue to evolve. Army General Leon LaPorte, Commander of U.S. Forces in Korea, expressed concerns about North Korea's missile capabilities in 2005. He warned about the regime's development of a three-stage Taepo Dong missile that could target the United States within a decade. Vice Admiral Lowell Jacoby also testified that North Korea had the ability to arm a missile with a nuclear device and potentially reach parts of the U.S. with a two-stage nuclear missile. During a hearing, Admiral Jacoby made controversial statements about North Korea's nuclear missile capabilities, which were later clarified as theoretical without flight testing. This caused a stir among senators and led to the Pentagon suggesting an overstatement. Experts, like Peter Hayes, highlight the unreliability of North Korean missiles. Peter Hayes suggests that North Korean missiles have a low reliability rate, with a 49 percent chance of successful takeoff and staging. He also points out that North Korea's missile attacks could resemble an \"uncontrolled fireworks display\" due to their poor systems engineering. The International Institute for Strategic Studies proposes that North Korea's long-range missiles may be more for bargaining leverage than for military use. North Korea leverages its missile capabilities for political and economic benefits rather than military use. It has been a prolific exporter of ballistic missiles and related technology to countries in the Middle East, earning significant hard currency in the process. North Korea's missile sales have been a source of hard currency earnings, exchanged with Iran and Pakistan. However, declining revenues are noted due to customers developing their own missile capabilities. In 2005, North Korea ended a self-imposed moratorium on missile tests, launching a short-range ballistic missile into the Sea of Japan. Iran's long-range ballistic missile program is a focus of interest due to its resurgent nuclear program. Concerns exist that Iran could develop nuclear-armed ballistic missiles capable of striking targets in the Middle East, Europe, and beyond. Iran's Defense Minister announced Iran's plan to launch a satellite, raising concerns among U.S. analysts about the potential use of a modified Shahab-3 missile for military purposes. The upgraded Shahab-3, tested multiple times in 2004, shows modifications indicating possible nuclear warhead capabilities. Experts suggest similarities to the Russian SS-9 ICBM. Iran is developing a reentry vehicle similar to the Russian SS-9 ICBM, which could potentially be modified for a small solid propellant upper stage and satellite payload. This dual-use missile could complicate intelligence analysis efforts to differentiate between ballistic missile and space launch activities. Additionally, Iran is reportedly working on a missile reentry vehicle with a small nuclear warhead for its Shahab missiles, based on an indigenous design that includes the necessary nuclear weapons components. U.S. officials have expressed concerns about Iran's development of nuclear warheads for its missiles. Iran is developing a reentry vehicle for its missiles, potentially using ceramic matrix composite material for heat shields. Iran also successfully tested a new solid-fuel motor for the Shahab-3 missile. The information on Iranian warhead development came from reliable intelligence sources. Iran's ballistic missile program is currently based on liquid-fuel technology, but there is speculation about upgraded versions like the Shahab-4/5. Solid propellant-based missiles are more reliable and accurate, with a longer range capability. Developing longer range missiles requires solid propellant technology, as in-flight separation and ignition of additional stages are complex processes that require solid fuel. Iran's ballistic missile program is focused on upgraded versions of the Shahab 3, known as the Shahab-4/5, with a potential shift towards more capable, longer-range missiles. Iran has stated that its missile development is aimed at regional adversaries like Israel, rather than the United States. Some experts suggest that Iran may be developing improved Shahab missiles without explicitly labeling them as Shahab-4 or 5 programs. India has an extensive missile program, including antitank, surface-to-air, and air-to-air missiles, as well as SRBMs, MRBMs, and IRBMs. Concerns arise from India's nuclear tests in 1998, possible arming of missiles with nuclear warheads, and ongoing conflict with Pakistan over Kashmir. The Prithvi series includes liquid fuel theater missiles with ranges of 150 km, 250 km, and 350 km. The Agni I has a range of 700 - 750 km, while the Agni II has a range of at least 1,500 km, capable of reaching all of Pakistan. India has not signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty or the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. India's extensive missile program includes various types of missiles, with concerns arising from nuclear tests in 1998 and potential arming of missiles with nuclear warheads. India has not signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and is not part of multilateral export control mechanisms. Recent developments include acquiring a Russian submarine capable of carrying nuclear-capable cruise missiles and testing the Agni I missile. Plans are in place to create additional missile groups armed with conventional and nuclear warheads. India's missile program includes Agni I and Agni II regiments with nuclear warheads, with plans for testing the 3,000 km Agni III missile. The first Agni III test flight was expected by the end of 2005, delayed due to developmental difficulties and pressure from the United States. India also successfully tested the Brahmos cruise missile and is testing the Dhanush naval variant. In 2004, India and Russia jointly developed the supersonic Brahmos missile with a 200 kg payload. They agreed to build 360-370 missiles annually, with plans for exports. Pakistan, not in an arms race with India, developed its own missiles with help from China and North Korea. Pakistan's Hatf-2 and 3 are solid fuel SRBMs likely based on Chinese missiles, while Ghauri-I and Ghauri-II are reportedly North Korean designs. Pakistan's Shaheen/Ghaznavi series are solid fuel missiles of uncertain origin, serving as a deterrent against India's conventional forces. In 2004-2005, Pakistan conducted routine flight tests of its missiles, including the Shaheen-II with a range of 2,000 km. President Musharraf mentioned acquiring short-range missiles and technology from North Korea during a meeting in Seoul. Pakistan had obtained short-range missiles and technology from North Korea, but can now produce the missiles itself. There is currently no interaction with North Korea on defense matters. Analysts suggest that Pakistan's capability to produce Ghauri missiles may reduce U.S. pressure on Pakistani-North Korean cooperation. Publicly ending ties with North Korea could pose risks if missile dealings were re-initiated. The DOD's National Air and Space Intelligence Center predicts an expansion of land attack cruise missiles in the next decade. The National Air and Space Intelligence Center predicts a proliferation of land attack cruise missiles in the next decade, with at least nine countries involved in production. These missiles will be highly accurate and conventionally armed, posing a significant threat to U.S. defense systems. The U.S. vulnerability to cruise missile attacks was highlighted during the 2003 Iraq War. China's development and acquisition efforts include the HN series of land attack cruise missiles and various other types of cruise missiles. They are also working on a ram-jet powered cruise missile and have sold missiles to Iran for indigenous production. This could lead to an increase in the export and production of cruise missiles by other countries in the future. India, Taiwan, Israel, France, Germany, Sweden, Italy, South Africa, and the United Kingdom are all involved in land attack cruise missile programs. Some countries may achieve self-sufficiency in cruise missile production. Israel denies reports of developing a nuclear-armed cruise missile. Advanced missiles could be exported, complicating the security environment. The development and acquisition of ballistic and cruise missiles remain a central security goal for many countries. The development and acquisition of ballistic and cruise missiles are key security goals for many countries, including China, Iran, and North Korea, who are seeking to enhance their capabilities for strategic purposes. Missile defense systems like the U.S. Patriot and Israeli Arrow provide a means to counter these threats. Some countries are in various stages of nuclear missile development and can be deterred through diplomacy or coercion. North Korea and Iran may eventually achieve the capability to deliver nuclear weapons with ballistic missiles. Cruise missiles are more common due to affordability and technology dual use. While they may lack range, their stealth and accuracy offer an advantage. The U.S. addresses these threats through nonproliferation and counterproliferation efforts. The United States has utilized a combination of nonproliferation and counterproliferation activities, with some analysts criticizing past Administrations for focusing too much on nonproliferation. The current Bush Administration is accused of leaning heavily towards counterproliferation, partly due to the events of September 11, 2001. The National Security Strategy emphasizes proactive counterproliferation efforts against terrorist and hostile states. The Bush Administration's National Security Strategy emphasizes proactive counterproliferation efforts against terrorist and hostile states, including preventing the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and missiles through interdiction and preemption. The current national security strategy emphasizes preemption in countering WMD and missile programs, particularly in North Korea and Iran. Efforts include strengthening the Missile Technology Control Regime and implementing agreements to prevent missile proliferation, such as the Proliferation Security Initiative announced in 2003. The Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) was launched by President Bush in 2003 to interdict shipments of WMD and related technology. Over 60 countries support the PSI, with limited details on its implementation due to security concerns. Secretary of State Rice mentioned the PSI stopped 11 WMD-related transfers since 2004. In 2005, President Bush issued an Executive Order to freeze assets of entities involved in WMD proliferation, including companies in Iran, North Korea, and Syria. The Order Annex names eight companies, freezes their U.S. assets, and prohibits business transactions. The Administration's focus on PSI and freezing assets of WMD-related companies suggests a more aggressive nonproliferation approach. Some view these actions as confrontational, but argue traditional treaties have not deterred countries like North Korea and Iran from advancing their missile programs."
