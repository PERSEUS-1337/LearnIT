The grant program provides capitalization grants to States for creating revolving funds to support grocery stores in underserved communities. States prioritize applications from nonprofit or municipally owned entities that hire workers from the underserved community they serve. For-profit entities meeting specific criteria may also be prioritized for loans from the state's revolving fund. These criteria include providing educational classes on a healthful diet, sourcing food locally, not selling alcohol or tobacco products, demonstrating supply chain relationships in the grocery industry, or expertise in the grocery industry. An entity seeking a loan from a State's revolving fund must meet specific requirements and submit an application with required information. Loans from the fund can only be used for specified purposes and must have interest rates at or below market rates, with terms not exceeding 30 years or the projected useful life of the project. A State's revolving fund can provide loans to program participants, with payments starting within a year of disbursement and fully amortized by the end of the loan term. Loan amounts cannot exceed 10% of the fund's available amount in a fiscal year. A program participant must establish a revenue source for loan repayment from a State's revolving fund. The fund will receive all loan payments. The State can charge up to 4% in administrative fees. The Secretary will offer technical assistance for operational needs. In case of bankruptcy, the loan amount owed to the fund remains. The earnings of a nonprofit organization or municipally owned program participant from a loan received from a State's revolving fund must be reinvested into the participant or used to support its operations, with precedence given to loan repayment over other debts. SEC. 3. Capitalization grants provided to fund state revolving funds. To be eligible for a capitalization grant, a State must establish a revolving fund, set up a loan application process, and match at least 20% of the grant amount from non-Federal sources. Upon receiving the grant, the State must deposit it into the revolving fund. The Act authorizes $150,000,000 for fiscal year 2017 and additional funds for subsequent years. The Secretary will distribute capitalization grants among eligible States based on the population of underserved communities in each State compared to all eligible States. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.
