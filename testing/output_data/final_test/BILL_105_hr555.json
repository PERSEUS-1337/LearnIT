    "content": "The Native American Telecommunications Act of 1997 establishes Indian telecommunications policy under section 12 of the Communications Act of 1934. The Congress finds that Indian and Alaskan Native people live in remote areas with high poverty rates, limited phone access, and substandard phone service in Indian country despite efforts by the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 requires the Federal Communications Commission to implement universal service recommendations by May 8, 1997. Federal universal service policies have not adequately reached Indian country, and telecommunications carriers have not been required to provide services on Indian lands. The United States recognizes the sovereignty of Indian tribes in relation to the States. The Federal Communications Commission is mandated to develop an official policy regarding its relations with American Indians and Alaskan Natives, recognizing their special needs, tribal sovereignty, and trust obligations of the United States. The policy aims to promote tribal governments' authority over communications policies within their jurisdictions and support Native Americans' interests. The Federal Communications Commission is required to establish a policy to promote Native Americans' participation in telecommunications services on tribal lands and improve negotiations between tribes and states. The policy includes giving Native Americans notice and the opportunity to participate in proceedings affecting tribal lands. The Commission can forbear from applying certain provisions to ensure compliance with trust obligations. The Federal Communications Commission must establish a policy to promote Native Americans' participation in telecommunications services on tribal lands and improve negotiations between tribes and states. The policy allows the Commission to forbear from certain provisions to ensure compliance with trust obligations and is subject to triennial review for necessary revisions. Additionally, a conforming amendment includes Indian tribes and Alaskan Native villages in the scope of the policy. SEC. 3 amends Section 214(e) of the Communications Act of 1934 to designate eligible telecommunications carriers for service areas within tribal lands. The Commission must comply with State commissions' authority and requirements while following established policies. SEC. 4 focuses on achieving universal service principles in Indian Country. Section 254 of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended to ensure quality telecommunications services for Native Americans and Alaskan Natives at affordable rates through Federal universal service support mechanisms. The Commission will gather data on Native American telecommunications subscribership and affordability on Indian lands to ensure universal service delivery at fair rates. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act is amended to include Native American Telecommunications Infrastructure Policy Initiatives, encouraging investment and deployment of telecommunications systems on Indian lands."
