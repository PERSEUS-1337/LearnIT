The Congress established criteria for creating new Federal judicial districts in 1978, including caseload, judicial administration, geography, and community convenience. Caseload considers the number of cases per Federal judge, while judicial administration includes backlog of pending cases hindering effective resolution. The criteria for creating new Federal judicial districts in 1978 include caseload, judicial administration, geography, and community convenience. Geography refers to the accessibility of the central administration, while community convenience relates to better serving diverse populations. The 13 southern counties of New Jersey are part of a substantial criminal district. In fiscal year 2002, the 13 southern New Jersey counties had a high criminal caseload, exceeding that of 32 other Federal judicial districts. For example, the Eastern District of Louisiana had 304 criminal cases, and the District of Connecticut had 251 criminal cases. In fiscal year 2002, the southern New Jersey counties had a substantial civil caseload, with approximately 2,744 Federal civil cases originating in that region. This caseload exceeded that of 61 other Federal judicial districts, with only 32 districts having more civil cases than the southern New Jersey region. In fiscal year 2002, the southern New Jersey counties had a significant caseload, with 2,744 Federal civil cases filed. This exceeded the caseload of 61 other Federal judicial districts, with only 32 districts having more civil cases than the southern New Jersey region. Additionally, the backlog of pending cases in the 13 southern counties of New Jersey necessitates the creation of a separate judicial district. The southern New Jersey region had a high caseload in fiscal year 2002, with 2,744 Federal civil cases filed. The number of pending cases in the Camden vicinage exceeded that of many other Federal judicial districts, indicating the need for a separate judicial district. For example, the Western District of Tennessee had fewer pending cases with 5 judges compared to the Camden vicinage. The Camden vicinage in New Jersey had a high caseload in fiscal year 2002, with 1,400 civil cases and 250 criminal cases pending. The distance between northern and southern regions of New Jersey creates challenges for efficient justice administration. Louisiana's new Federal court district in 1971 also faced distance issues between New Orleans and Baton Rouge. In 1971, Louisiana created a new district court due to travel difficulties between New Orleans and Baton Rouge. New Jersey's District of New Jersey is the fourth most populous Federal judicial district in the United States, with a culturally diverse population inconvenienced by having only 1 judicial district. The population of southern New Jersey counties exceeds that of 69 other Federal judicial districts.
