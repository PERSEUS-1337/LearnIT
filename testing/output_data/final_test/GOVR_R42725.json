    "content": "The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) allows government agencies to obtain authorization for wiretapping, physical searches, and access to business records for gathering foreign intelligence. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) issues court orders for these activities. Title VII of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 provides procedures for acquiring foreign intelligence on individuals outside the U.S., affecting both U.S. and non-U.S. persons. The Act also introduced a new procedure for targeting non-U.S. persons abroad. The FISA Amendments Act introduced new procedures for targeting non-U.S. persons abroad without individualized court orders and requiring individualized court orders for targeting U.S. persons abroad. It also established new procedures for obtaining court orders for electronic surveillance and acquiring foreign intelligence information. Other laws governing electronic surveillance include the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, Executive Order 12333, and the Fourth Amendment. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) prohibits wiretapping, access to stored electronic communications, and the use of trap and trace devices. Exceptions exist for surveillance activities for foreign intelligence purposes, which may be allowed under FISA procedures. The interception of a domestic telephone call is generally prohibited by ECPA and qualifies as electronic surveillance under FISA. If the government obtains a court order from FISC authorizing the interception, it is lawful surveillance. If the activity involves acquiring foreign intelligence from international communications, it is not subject to ECPA. For example, intercepting an international call targeting the non-domestic end for foreign intelligence purposes is not considered electronic surveillance under FISA. The acquisition of foreign intelligence information on United States soil is not subject to ECPA prohibitions. Both ECPA and FISA require using FISA procedures for electronic surveillance activities. Prior to the FISA Amendments Act, wiretapping activities involving international communications were exempt from ECPA but did not require FISA procedures. Section 704 of FISA makes its procedures compulsory for surveillance involving a United States person. Executive Order 12333 and the Fourth Amendment govern activities not covered by ECPA or FISA. The Attorney General can approve intelligence techniques within the US or against a US person abroad, requiring probable cause for each case. This authority must be exercised in accordance with FISA. The Fourth Amendment protects against \"unreasonable searches and seizures\" in domestic criminal law investigations, requiring a court-issued warrant. Government activity is subject to a \"reasonableness\" test under the Fourth Amendment when the warrant requirement does not apply. The extent of the warrant requirement in the government's collection of foreign intelligence is unclear, with a Supreme Court case in 1972 invalidating warrantless electronic surveillance of domestic organizations. In a 2002 case, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review upheld FISA, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act, against a Fourth Amendment challenge. The court assumed that FISA court orders do not constitute warrants for Fourth Amendment analysis but upheld them based on general reasonableness and the government's interest in national security. In 2005, it was reported that the federal government monitored international communications of people in the US without warrants, which was later acknowledged by President George W. Bush after 9/11. President George W. Bush authorized the National Security Agency to conduct the Terrorist Surveillance Program (TSP) after 9/11 to intercept international communications linked to al Qaeda. The program was active from 2001 to 2007 and was replaced by the Protect America Act (PAA) in 2007, allowing acquisition of foreign intelligence information without individual court orders. The Protect America Act (PAA) replaced the Terrorist Surveillance Program (TSP) authorized by President George W. Bush after 9/11. The PAA allowed the acquisition of foreign intelligence information without individual court orders. This temporary authority expired in 2008, leading to the enactment of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, which created separate procedures for targeting non-U.S. persons and U.S. persons reasonably believed to be outside the United States under a new Title VII of FISA. Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act provides procedures for targeting non-U.S. persons, permitting the AG and the DNI to jointly authorize targeting of persons reasonably believed to be located outside the United States. Acquisitions under Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act must not target individuals in the United States, must be consistent with the Fourth Amendment, and focus on electronic communications or stored information. The acquisition under Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act requires the AG and DNI to attest that it involves obtaining information from an electronic communication service provider, which may include wiretaps, intercepting digital communications, or accessing stored data. The joint authorization must be based on a court order or exigent circumstances, without the need to identify specific targets. The AG and DNI must attest that acquisitions under Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act are limited to targeting persons believed to be outside the US. The targeting procedures must be approved by the FISC and prevent intentional acquisition of communications where all parties are known to be in the US. FISC orders approving certifications and procedures are issued if they meet statutory requirements and Fourth Amendment standards. The FISC will issue an order to correct deficiencies in certifications, targeting procedures, or minimization procedures within 30 days. In exigent circumstances, the AG and DNI can authorize targeting of non-U.S. persons abroad without a court order, with a certification required to be submitted to the FISC within seven days. The FISC must receive certifications within seven days after an exigency determination. Collection of information is allowed before certification submission. Section 702 of FISA allows electronic surveillance without individual court orders, impacting activities falling under electronic surveillance definitions. Section 702 of FISA allows for the domestic acquisition of international wire communications in the United States without a court order. It also applies to the installation of surveillance devices to gather information in situations where a warrant would typically be required for law enforcement purposes. Section 702 of FISA permits surveillance without a warrant for international wire communications in the U.S. This may include hidden microphones and access to stored communications. The authorization procedure for surveillance of non-U.S. persons has been challenged in court. The United States Supreme Court ruled in Clapper v. Amnesty International that plaintiffs did not have legal standing to challenge Title VII under the Fourth Amendment. The FISA Amendments Act created separate procedures for targeting non-U.S. persons and U.S. persons believed to be outside the United States. Section 703 and 704 of the FISA Amendments Act address targeting U.S. persons abroad for surveillance. Section 704(a)(2) prohibits targeting a U.S. person abroad without authorization. The determination of a \"reasonable expectation of privacy\" depends on individual circumstances. Activities like physical searches and wiretaps conducted on foreign soil may require authorization from the FISC based on the target's \"reasonable expectation of privacy.\" Sections 703 and 704 establish procedures for FISC orders authorizing such acquisitions, with Section 703 applying to electronic surveillance and Section 704 applying to other situations where a warrant would be required in the U.S. for law enforcement purposes. The FISC procedures under Sections 703 and 704 are similar to those in FISA for obtaining court orders for electronic surveillance or physical searches of U.S. persons. The government must provide evidence justifying the belief that the target is a foreign power or agent, supported by probable cause. Both sections also address targets outside the U.S., requiring probable cause for geographical limitations. The FISC procedures under Sections 703 and 704 allow for short-term acquisitions in emergency situations. Section 704 has less specificity in the application requirements and only addresses dissemination of acquired information, while Section 703 also covers acquisition and retention of information. The standard required under Sections 703 and 704 for FISC orders is less stringent than traditional FISA requirements. FISA mandated identifying search facilities and linking U.S. persons to terrorism, unlike Sections 703 and 704. Section 703 relaxes FISA standards for U.S. targets. Section 703 relaxes FISA standards for U.S. targets, while Section 704 expands the scope of FISA to areas previously beyond its reach. President Obama signed the FISA Amendments Act Reauthorization Act of 2012, extending Title VII of FISA until December 31, 2017. Title VII of FISA is set to be automatically repealed on December 31, 2017, unless there is new legislation. Transition procedures will allow existing surveillance orders under Title VII to continue until their expiration dates."
