    "content": "The United States and the international community rely on UNAMA as the coordinator of international donor activity in Afghanistan. UNAMA's role has been emphasized in various contexts, including through U.N. Security Council Resolution 1806 and the Declaration of the International Conference in Support of Afghanistan in 2008. The Obama Administration highlighted the importance of coordination and burdensharing among donors in building Afghan capacity and providing civilian expertise in a new strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan in 2009. The Obama Administration emphasized UNAMA's coordination role in Afghanistan, urging its expansion into more provinces. UNAMA played a central role in international events and meetings in 2010, including the Kabul Conference hosted by the Afghan government. The Kabul Conference was hosted by the government of Afghanistan in July 2010, co-chaired with the United Nations. Progress has been noted in reconstruction, governance, and security in Afghanistan, despite ongoing violence. Experts emphasize the challenges of rebuilding a country emerging from decades of conflict. Despite some progress in Afghanistan's reconstruction, challenges such as slow reconstruction, corruption, and failure to extend government authority into rural areas contribute to continuing instability and a Taliban resurgence. Increased insecurity in previously stable areas and ongoing issues with narcotics trafficking and independent militias remain significant concerns. UNAMA plays a key role in civilian reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan, facing challenges with credibility after the 2009 elections. Despite improvements in fraud investigations for the 2010 elections, the international community sees UNAMA's success as crucial for Afghanistan's stability. The United States, other countries, and international relief organizations have a long history of providing assistance to Afghanistan. Afghanistan became a member of the United Nations in 1946 and has had a relationship with the UN for over 60 years. During the 1980s, the US and other countries supported mujahedin forces against the Soviet Union and provided humanitarian aid to Afghan refugees in Pakistan. The Geneva Peace Accords in 1988, brokered by Diego Cordovez, led to the Soviet withdrawal. The UN then established a presence in Afghanistan with separate offices for political processes and humanitarian operations. During the violent civil war in the 1990s, the United Nations focused on peace agreements and reconstruction in Afghanistan. International donors prioritized humanitarian aid due to unstable conditions and reluctance to support the Taliban. Afghanistan, already underdeveloped, saw a shift in assistance after the Taliban's removal in 2001. After the Taliban's removal in 2001, Afghanistan quickly established a governance plan through the Bonn Agreement. An interim government led by Hamid Karzai was formed, paving the way for a progressive constitution approved in 2004. Subsequent elections were held, with Karzai elected president in 2004 and parliamentary elections in 2005 and 2010. The Afghan government collaborated with international donors on reconstruction programs. The Afghan government has been working with international donors on reconstruction programs since 2002. Strategic challenges remain in every sector, putting institution-building at risk. Successful development is crucial for sustaining peace and preventing Afghanistan from becoming a haven for terrorists. UNAMA's role is to promote peace and stability in Afghanistan and lead international efforts in reconstruction. UNAMA, established in 2002, supports the Afghan government in rebuilding the country and strengthening governance, development, and stability. Despite challenges in coordinating with multiple donors, UNAMA aims to implement the Bonn Agreement through political and humanitarian efforts. Led by Lakhdar Brahimi until 2004, UNAMA's mandate is renewed annually in March. U.N. Security Council resolutions extended UNAMA's mandate annually until 2011, with expanded scope to support Afghan government, cooperate with ISAF, and engage with Afghan leaders. Resolution 1917 (2010) emphasized promoting international support for Afghanistan's development and governance priorities. The UNAMA's mandate was extended annually until 2011 to support Afghanistan's development and governance priorities, cooperate with international security forces, and engage in political outreach and reconciliation programs. The head of UNAMA is Staffan de Mistura, with two Deputy Special Representatives covering Political Affairs and Relief, Recovery, and Reconstruction. UNAMA, led by Norwegian diplomat Kai Eide from 2008 to 2010, has 1,500 staff, mostly Afghan nationals. It coordinates UN activities in Afghanistan with 18 agencies. Calls to expand presence in more provinces were made in conferences. Expenditures in 2008 were $86.34 million. UNAMA's expenditures exceeded approved budgets in CY2008 and CY2009, with a budget of $241.9 million for CY2010. The mission has expanded staff and offices in Tehran and Islamabad. The U.S. contributes approximately $53.22 million to UNAMA's budget. UNAMA was established to implement the 2001 Bonn Agreement and subsequent Afghanistan reconstruction strategies. The Afghanistan reconstruction strategy includes the 2006 Afghanistan Compact, the 2008 Afghanistan National Development Strategy (ANDS), and the Bonn Agreement signed in 2001. The Joint Coordination and Monitoring Board (JCMB) oversees the implementation of these agreements, with UNAMA co-chairing. Several international conferences have provided guidance and support for Afghanistan's future. In 2001, a Transitional Authority (TA) replaced the AIA after an Emergency \"loya jirga.\" The TA led the country until a full government could be elected. A progressive constitution was approved in 2004, and Hamid Karzai was elected president. The Bonn Agreement called for the establishment of a Supreme Court and a Judicial Commission, as well as the deployment of a U.N.-mandated security force. The Bonn Agreement in 2005 led to the implementation of the Afghanistan Compact in 2006, outlining goals in Security, Governance, and Economic Development with a focus on counternarcotics. The international community committed to monitoring progress and improving aid effectiveness. The Afghanistan National Development Strategy (ANDS) was signed in 2008 as a policy paper by the Afghan government, focusing on security, governance, and economic growth/poverty reduction. It sets goals for 2020 with specific targets for 2008-2013, aiming for donor funding through the central government. The Joint Coordination and Monitoring Board (JCMB) was established in 2008 for coordination. The Joint Coordination and Monitoring Board (JCMB) was established in 2008 as the coordination body between the Afghan government and the international community. UNAMA plays a central role in implementing development strategies and monitoring activities outlined in the Compact and ANDS. UNAMA is directed by U.N. Security Council Resolutions to coordinate international donors and organizations for aid effectiveness. The JCMB co-chairs reviewed the Compact in 2008, noting progress in health, education, infrastructure, economic growth, and Afghan national security forces. The donor community has established institutional mechanisms for coordinating reconstruction in post-conflict countries. After the fall of the Taliban in 2001, international organizations and financial institutions initiated new initiatives for sustainable reconstruction in Afghanistan. International donor conferences, trust funds, and humanitarian programs were administered with input from UNAMA and other U.N. institutions, highlighting ongoing challenges and increased international participation. The international community has shown increased participation in supporting Afghanistan's reconstruction through donor conferences like the Bonn, Tokyo, Berlin, and London Conferences, where pledges exceeded billions of dollars. At the London Conference in February 2006, pledges for Afghanistan's reconstruction exceeded $8.2 billion. The Paris Conference in June 2008 reaffirmed the partnership between the Afghan government and the international community, focusing on key priorities such as strengthening democracy, infrastructure investment, aid effectiveness, counter-narcotics measures, and meeting the needs of all Afghans. The Hague Conference in March 2009 brought together over 80 countries to discuss a comprehensive strategy for Afghanistan, emphasizing the role of UNAMA in coordinating international assistance. The London Conference in January 2010 focused on key priorities such as security, governance, economic growth, and regional cooperation. Trinidad and Tobago, on November 28, 2009, announced plans to host an international conference on Afghanistan in London. The conference aimed to strengthen the Afghan government and security forces for a transition of responsibilities from the international community. President Obama also mentioned the possible withdrawal of international troops in a speech on December 1, 2009. The Kabul Conference in July 2010 focused on Afghan-led plans for development, governance, and security. Capacity building at national and sub-national levels was emphasized, with the \"Kabul Process\" seen as crucial for the transition to Afghan leadership. The NATO Summit in November 2010 endorsed a framework for handing over full security responsibilities to Afghan forces by 2014, with a province-by-province transition and drawdown of international combat forces. UNAMA will support the civilian side of this transition, focusing on governance and development. In 2002, the international community prioritized funding the Afghan government's current expenditures, including salaries for government employees. The Afghan government prioritized funding current expenditures, including salaries for government employees, through trust funds established for rapid distribution of monies. Donor countries contribute to funds like the Afghan Interim Authority Fund (AIAF) and the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) to support governmental operations. Additionally, the Law and Order Trust Fund for Afghanistan (LOTFA) was created for police rehabilitation and capacity-building, while the Counter-Narcotics Trust Fund addresses anti-narcotics efforts. The Afghan government established trust funds like the Afghan Interim Authority Fund (AIAF) and the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) to support governmental operations, including salaries for government employees. The ARTF, administered by the World Bank, provides funds for the government's budget, investment activities, and various programs in sectors like education, agriculture, justice, and urban infrastructure. It covers half of the government's non-security operating costs and a quarter of its development expenditures. Donors have agreed to extend the ARTF until 2020, reflecting their ongoing commitment and acknowledging the development challenges in Afghanistan. The U.S. has significantly increased its aid to Afghanistan since 2001 through various agencies like the Department of Defense, USAID, and the State Department. Military and security assistance make up more than half of the funding, while development and humanitarian aid are mainly distributed through USAID and the State Department. The U.S. provides aid to Afghanistan through various agencies like USAID, the State Department, and multilateral institutions such as the United Nations, World Bank, and IMF. Funding comes from U.S. dues, voluntary donations, and specific accounts. UNAMA's mandate was extended with specific priorities and expanded authority as a coordinating body. The U.N. Security Council extended UNAMA's mandate with specific priorities and expanded its authority as a coordinating body in Afghanistan. The Secretary-General was asked to report every three months on developments and establish benchmarks to measure progress. Key areas of UNAMA's work include promoting support for the Afghan government, cooperating with ISAF, and providing political outreach throughout the country. UNAMA's mandate was extended by the U.N. Security Council to support Afghan-led reconciliation programs, improve governance, combat corruption, coordinate humanitarian aid, monitor human rights, and support the electoral process. Strategic benchmarks include extending government authority, building democratic institutions, and developing a sustainable Afghan security structure. Development of a sustainable Afghan security structure for peace and stability, economic growth supported by international policies, improved human rights in line with Afghan Constitution and international law, and sustained reduction in narcotics production are key benchmarks outlined by the U.N. Secretary-General in September 2009. The U.N. Secretary-General outlined key benchmarks for UNAMA's mandate, focusing on results-based goals aligned with national strategies. Monitoring progress would involve collaboration with the Afghan government and international stakeholders. Regular reports on benchmarks could enhance UNAMA's effectiveness, but some question the efficiency of this approach for tracking implementation. The U.N. Secretary-General set benchmarks for UNAMA's mandate aligned with national strategies, with some questioning the efficiency of tracking progress in three-month intervals. UNAMA provides assessments of the Afghanistan situation to U.N. institutions and member states, highlighting its role in promoting peace and integration. President Karzai established the High Peace Council to promote peace and unity in Afghanistan, with former President Rabbani as its Chair. The Council called for all sides to renounce violence and engage in talks, seeking UN and OIC participation. UNAMA created the Salaam Support Group to support the Council's efforts, while the Kabul Silk Road initiative aimed at regional cooperation had its fourth meeting in November. The government of Afghanistan presented its first 100-day progress report on commitments made at the Kabul conferences, with over 70% of benchmarks met. A monitoring framework was introduced at the JCMB meeting to track progress in 22 national priority programs. The Kabul Process aims to define specific goals and achievements in discussions with the international community. UNAMA is working on aid coherence for donor support. UNAMA is involved in developing a coherent approach to donor assistance as part of the Afghan government's anti-corruption agenda. There is a focus on development activities at the subnational level, ensuring consistency with national priorities, promoting coordination at the provincial level, and supporting local authorities in leading development activities. Afghanistan remains a top priority for Congress and the Obama Administration's national security agenda. UNAMA plays a key role in coordinating international donor activity and assistance, which may be of interest as congressional concerns about the strategy in Afghanistan unfold. UNAMA's role in coordinating donor assistance and addressing security concerns in Afghanistan is crucial. The increasing lack of security threatens development progress, with violence levels not seen since 2001. Congress may question UNAMA's budget, oversight, and aid effectiveness in light of these challenges. Attacks on unarmed civil servants and the aid community, including the United Nations, have risen in Afghanistan. Despite some progress in development, there is frustration among Afghans due to perceived lack of evidence of development. Various factors contribute to this, such as lack of security, capacity, funding, and competing priorities. Security and development progress are crucial to maintain international donor interest, encourage private investment, and uphold hope for improvement in Afghanistan. The key issue in Afghanistan is the need for credible elections to promote good governance and democracy. UNAMA is working with local governance and ISAF on securing communities. Concerns about corruption and registration issues in the elections are prominent. UNAMA assisted with the registration and nomination process for the Afghan elections, addressing electoral irregularities and ensuring civilian safety. Approximately 15.6 million voters updated their registrations, with 32 presidential candidates and 3,178 provincial council candidates on the final list. UNAMA provided technical support and collaborated with UNDP on the ELECT project to enhance legal and electoral capacity. The Afghan elections in August 2009, supported by the international community, were the first run entirely by Afghan authorities in 30 years. Despite irregularities, fraud, and violence affecting turnout and results, Karzai led with 54.6% and Dr. Abdullah with 27.7%. The ECC ordered a recount due to fraud investigations. The ECC determined that 1 million Karzai votes and 200,000 Abdullah votes were fraudulent, leading to a runoff election as Karzai did not reach the required threshold for a first-round victory. UNAMA ordered the replacement of election commissioners and the elimination of polling stations to ensure a clean second round. On November 1, 2009, Dr. Abdullah announced he would not participate in the runoff election due to unresolved fraud issues. The next day, the IEC declared Karzai the winner by consensus as the only candidate left in the race. International leaders congratulated Karzai on his victory, while U.S. officials praised Abdullah for his peaceful withdrawal. Karzai was inaugurated on November 19, 2009. President Karzai was inaugurated on November 19, 2009. Despite calls for a competent and corruption-curbing cabinet, he faced challenges in forming a full cabinet in 2010. Concerns lingered about the legitimacy of his government and the partnership with the U.S. and international community. Disputes within UNAMA over election fraud led to the departure of DSRSG Peter Galbraith in September. The dispute over election fraud in Afghanistan led to a public disagreement between Eide and Galbraith on how to address the issue. Eide advocated for letting the process run through ECC and IEC, while Galbraith believed the UN should intervene to ensure election legitimacy. This disagreement resulted in Galbraith being removed from his post by U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. Several Galbraith supporters resigned from UNAMA due to low morale following the dispute over election fraud in Afghanistan. Concerns were raised about U.S. influence and international interference in the election. SRSG Eide announced his planned departure in March 2010, stating it was unrelated to the election controversy or the attack on U.N. staff. Calls were made for Eide's resignation, with some suggesting the need for a super envoy outside the UNAMA structure. The parliamentary elections in Afghanistan were held as planned on September 18, 2010, with 2,506 candidates competing for 249 seats. Approximately 4.3 million Afghans voted, and while security did not deteriorate significantly, there were increased incidents of low-level violence. Concerns were raised about the potential for fraud and irregularities, similar to issues faced during the 2009 presidential election. The 2010 parliamentary elections in Afghanistan saw fraud and irregularities, with measures taken to audit and recount votes. Over 5,000 complaints were investigated, resulting in 4,271,908 valid votes and 1,330,782 invalidated votes. The final results showed a shift in ethnic representation, with Pashtuns losing 20 seats. The elections demonstrated technical improvements but raised questions about the need for electoral reform in Afghanistan. Before its project ends in March 2011, the UNDP-ELECT will review lessons learned in Afghanistan. UNAMA is expected to play a role in election reform, with donors willing to support an Afghan-led reform process. An attack on a U.N. guest house in Kabul in 2009 led to the temporary withdrawal of 600 international staff from UNAMA for security reasons. The United Nations in Afghanistan faces questions about its neutrality and impartiality, with concerns raised after attacks on UN facilities. The attack on the U.N. center in Herat in 2010 was election-related, but no fatalities occurred. SRSG Staffan de Mistura credited luck, preparation, and support from Afghan security forces for minimizing the impact of the attack. De Mistura noted efforts by Afghan and ISAF forces were yielding results in minimizing the impact of attacks. He warned of potential tense security environment in the coming months and emphasized the need for reconciliation. A UNAMA Support Office in Kuwait was established for data backup and relocation in emergency situations. UNAMA signed an agreement with the government of the Netherlands to transfer the Alpha compound in Kabul to the United Nations, serving as office and residential space for international and national staff. The 2011 budget includes the construction of security-enhanced compounds in various provinces. UNAMA monitors civilian casualties in Afghanistan, reporting a 24% increase in casualties in 2009 compared to the previous year, with most occurring in the south and east, attributed to anti-government elements and international/Afghan forces. In 2010, civilian casualties in Afghanistan increased by 20% in the first 10 months compared to 2009, with 75% linked to anti-government elements. Most casualties were due to targeted attacks by the Taliban and terrorist groups, highlighting the risks of mistaken targets in bombing campaigns. The difficulty of intelligence gathering and security problems on the ground complicates the situation. The complex factors contributing to civilian casualties in Afghanistan, including concerns about air strikes in populated areas and the impact on the Afghan population's perception of international forces. UNAMA has expressed concerns over civilian casualties, with calls for expanded presence in all provinces. Increased troops may lead to more civilian casualties, requiring significant resources for UNAMA's regional and provincial offices. UNAMA's regional and provincial offices require additional resources to support civilian surge, national programs, and local participation. The mission needs to be strengthened to meet expectations outlined in its mandate. Emphasis is placed on creating Afghan jobs and building capacity, with a focus on Afghan ownership of reconstruction efforts. The degree of Afghan leadership and control in reconstruction efforts is unclear, with some arguing for increased Afghan involvement and others for the opposite. Concerns exist about aid reaching the people directly and the lack of visible improvements in their lives. Empowering Afghans is crucial for the country's success, requiring an integrated approach and capacity building on multiple levels. The UN Secretary-General highlighted strategic shifts in Afghanistan towards an \"aid effectiveness framework\" in June 2009. The emergence of an \"aid effectiveness framework\" in Afghanistan, coordinated by UNAMA, focuses on civilian efforts, subnational governance, and aligning international efforts with government programs. President Karzai criticizes the direct provision of aid by international donors, calling for more aid to be channeled through the Afghan government. The Afghan government seeks a higher percentage of international aid to be directed through them or in partnership with them, despite their dependence on international support. International donors have raised concerns about corruption in the Afghan bureaucracy hindering project implementation. UNAMA is tasked with ensuring donors fulfill their commitments transparently. UNAMA works to align international support behind the financing and implementation of ANDS, emphasizing aid effectiveness and accountability measures to combat corruption. The international community reaffirmed its commitment to Afghan government priorities through the Kabul Process. The international community, Afghan government, and various organizations struggle to coordinate their efforts effectively for development. UNAMA plays a key role in coordinating activities, but some argue that complete coordination may not be necessary or effective due to differing priorities and strategies among stakeholders. The international community, Afghan government, and various organizations struggle to coordinate their efforts effectively for development. UNAMA plays a key role in coordinating activities, but some argue that complete coordination may not be necessary or effective due to differing priorities and strategies among stakeholders. Coordination is a complicated matter, with some suggesting that like-minded organizations should coordinate separately from political and military groups. The effectiveness of aligning resources behind the government of Afghanistan's priorities through the Kabul process remains uncertain. Some experts argue for greater U.S. attention to the United Nations' role in Afghanistan and its expanded priorities. Sustained support from the U.S. in the form of public statements, reporting, and oversight is crucial for UNAMA's mission. Concerns exist about UNAMA becoming \"Americanized\" or controlled by the U.S., which could undermine U.S. support. Congress generally supports the United Nations but has criticized its inefficiencies and lack of accountability. The 112th Congress may focus on U.N. reform efforts, particularly in Afghanistan, with increased oversight of UNAMA's activities. Questions on U.S. foreign assistance to Afghanistan, whether bilateral or through multilateral organizations like the United Nations, may also arise. The U.N. Security Council identified key priorities for UNAMA's work in Afghanistan, including promoting coherent support by the international community to the Afghan government, mobilizing resources, coordinating assistance, and directing contributions for counter-narcotics, reconstruction, and development. UNAMA's key priorities in Afghanistan include strengthening cooperation with ISAF, providing political outreach throughout the country, and promoting the implementation of development and stabilization initiatives. UNAMA's key priorities in Afghanistan include strengthening cooperation with ISAF, providing political outreach throughout the country, and promoting the implementation of development and stabilization initiatives. The organization also aims to support Afghan-led reconciliation programs, improve governance, combat corruption, and facilitate development initiatives at the local level to bring peace and deliver services effectively. The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) plays a central coordinating role in delivering humanitarian aid and assistance in accordance with humanitarian principles. It also monitors the human rights situation of civilians and coordinates human rights protection efforts in collaboration with various organizations. UNAMA works with local organizations to monitor and protect civilians, ensure human rights, especially for women, and support the electoral process in Afghanistan. They provide technical assistance for upcoming elections, coordinate donors, and promote regional cooperation for a stable and prosperous Afghanistan. Key Efforts in Afghanistan, 2002-2008: Significant progress has been made in various sectors including health, social protection, education, agriculture, natural resources management, infrastructure, national army and police, disarmament and demining, and democracy and governance. Notable achievements include increased access to health services, social support for millions of Afghans, enrollment of over 6 million children in school, development projects benefiting thousands of villages, rehabilitation of roads, recruitment and training of over 140,000 policemen and soldiers, clearance of millions of unexploded ordnances, and high voter participation in elections. Since 2001, millions of unexploded ordnances have been cleared in Afghanistan. In 2004, 75% of voters participated in the country's first democratic elections. The Constitution adopted in the same year emphasizes the protection of human rights. Afghanistan's GDP per capita has increased by over 70% since 2002. Additionally, 75% of Afghans now have access to telecommunications, with over 5 million cell phones in use."
