    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Improving Access to Workers' Compensation for Injured Federal Workers Act.\" It includes findings related to workers' compensation for federal workers. Congress finds that medical services provided by PAs, NPs, CNSs, CNMs, and CRNAs are not covered under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act, leading to denied claims for injured Federal workers in rural areas who may have to travel long distances for care. Federal workers in rural areas may have to travel over 100 miles for reimbursable care. PAs, NPs, CNSs, CRNAs, and CNMs are covered providers in various insurance plans and are legally regulated in all 50 states. Physicians can delegate prescriptive privileges to PAs and NPs can prescribe medications in most states. PAs, NPs, CRNAs, and CNMs have prescriptive authority in multiple states and work in various medical settings, including federal agencies. CNSs provide direct care in hospitals and clinics to promote health and alleviate illness. CRNAs administer millions of anesthetics annually in the U.S. and work in various healthcare settings. Amending the Federal Employees' Compensation Act to include PAs, NPs, CRNAs, CNSs, and CNMs as covered providers will align with standard practice. The Federal Employees' Compensation Act should include PAs, NPs, CNSs, CNMs, and CRNAs as covered providers to improve patients' access to medical care and reduce unnecessary costs for the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs. The Federal Employees' Compensation Act should include Physician Assistants and Advanced Practice Registered Nurses to enhance patient access to medical care and reduce costs for the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs. The Federal Employees' Compensation Act is amended to include other eligible providers like physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and nurse midwives within their scope of practice as defined by State law or credentialed by the Federal government. The Federal Employees' Compensation Act is amended to include other eligible providers like physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and nurse midwives within their scope of practice as defined by State law or credentialed by the Federal government.

The amendments made by this section will take effect on the first day of the second Federal fiscal year quarter following the enactment of this Act."
