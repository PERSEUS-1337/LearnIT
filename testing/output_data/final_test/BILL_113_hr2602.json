    "content": "The \"Timely Repatriation Act\" may be cited as the short title of this legislation. It focuses on timely repatriation procedures. The \"Timely Repatriation Act\" requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to publish a report every 6 months listing countries that have delayed repatriation of their nationals and those with excessive repatriation failure rates. Sanctions may be imposed on countries included in the report. Sanctions may be imposed on countries listed for delayed repatriation or excessive failure rates, including visa restrictions for officials and employees and their families. The Immigration and Nationality Act allows for visa number reductions for countries in a fiscal year, with a minimum level set at 20 percent of the baseline visa number. The Secretary of State can waive sanctions for national security reasons, with a minimum threshold of 80 percent of the baseline visa number. The Secretary of State can waive sanctions for temporary exigent circumstances, allowing a waiver of any reduction below 80 percent of the baseline visa number. The Secretary of Homeland Security can exempt a country from sanctions if the total number of nonrepatriations is less than 10 in a 3-year period. Any visa issued in violation of this section shall be void. If an alien's repatriation is refused or unreasonably delayed, they must be released from detention by the Secretary of Homeland Security. Notice must be provided to state and local law enforcement agencies, as well as crime victims and their immediate family members, especially in cases of violent crime. The term \"failure rate\" refers to the percentage of repatriation requests for aliens that a country refused or unreasonably delayed, while \"excessive repatriation failure rate\" is defined as a failure rate greater than 10 percent for a specific period. The term \"number of non-repatriations outstanding\" refers to the unique aliens whose repatriation a country has refused or unreasonably delayed for a period. The term \"baseline visa number\" represents the average number of visas issued to nationals of a country in the three fiscal years before their inclusion in a report. The GAO Report requires the Comptroller General to submit a report to Congress on the progress of implementing repatriation requests by the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of State."
