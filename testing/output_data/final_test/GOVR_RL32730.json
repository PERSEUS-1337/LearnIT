Fidel Castro's recovery after surgery was indicated to be lengthy. Condoleezza Rice encouraged positive change in Cuba, and President Bush reiterated U.S. support. On August 3, 2006, President Bush reiterated U.S. support for democratic change in Cuba. Cuban President Fidel Castro temporarily ceded power to his brother Ra\u00fal due to surgery. Ra\u00fal Castro assumed key leadership roles in Cuba. The House Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere held a hearing on assistance to a Free Cuba. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported on FY2007 Transportation/Treasury. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported its version of the FY2007 Transportation/Treasury appropriations bill, H.R. 5576, with a provision to prevent Treasury Department funds from being used to implement tightened restrictions on financing for U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba. The inter-agency Commission for Assistance to Free Cuba issued its second report with recommendations for political change in Cuba, including $80 million for democracy projects. The report received a mixed response from Cuba's dissident community. The House passed H.R. 5672, the FY2007 Science, State, Justice, Commerce and Related Agencies appropriations bill, funding Cuba broadcasting. The bill recommends $36.102 million for Cuba broadcasting, including $2.7 million for TV Marti. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported H.R. 5384, the FY2007 Agriculture appropriations bill, with a provision liberalizing travel to Cuba for agricultural and medical goods. On June 14, 2006, the House approved H.Amdt. 1049 to prevent Treasury Department funds from implementing tightened restrictions on financing for U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba. The House rejected amendments easing economic sanctions on Cuba, including H.Amdt. 1050 and H.Amdt. 1051. Another rejected amendment, H.Amdt. 1032, aimed to prohibit the use of funds to amend regulations related to Cuba. The State Department reported that the Cuban government cut off electricity to the U.S. Interests Section in Havana as a form of harassment towards U.S. diplomats, but electricity was restored the next day. The Senate passed a resolution condemning the beating of a Cuban dissident, and two Cuban dentists were released from a detention center in the Bahamas and taken into U.S. custody. The Cuban government denied exit visas to two dentists who had received U.S. visas while in Cuba. The Treasury Department asked a hotel in Mexico City to expel a Cuban delegation meeting with U.S. oil executives at an energy conference. Mexico fined the hotel $112,000 for complying with U.S. economic sanctions against Cuba. OFAC blocked retail services like hotel stays for Cuban nationals outside the U.S. La Estrella de Cuba, a major travel agency, was suspended from booking travel to Cuba. Major League Baseball was granted a license for a Cuban team to participate in a tournament in the U.S. to benefit hurricane victims. On January 9, 2006, the U.S. Coast Guard repatriated 15 Cuban migrants that had landed on a piling of an old bridge in the Florida Keys. This prompted a review of the \"wet foot/dry foot\" policy. A federal judge in Miami ordered the U.S. government to bring the 15 Cubans back to the United States. On January 6, 2006, a Florida International University professor and his wife were arrested for being covert agents for Cuba. Fidel Castro ruled Cuba as a communist state until recently stepping down temporarily. Fidel Castro ruled Cuba as head of state and government since the 1959 Cuban Revolution, proclaiming himself a Marxist-Leninist in 1961. He ruled by decree until 1976 when a Constitution established the Communist Party as the leading force in the state. Executive power was held by a Council of Ministers headed by Castro, with legislative authority in a National Assembly of People's Power. The Cuban Communist Party reaffirmed its commitment to a single-party state during its 5th Congress in 1997, reelecting Fidel and Ra\u00fal Castro as first and second secretaries. Direct elections for the National Assembly were held in 1998 and 2003, but voters had no choice of candidates. Ra\u00fal Castro, Fidel's designated successor, was set to take over as head of state and government. Ra\u00fal Castro assumed political power temporarily from Fidel in 2006 due to Fidel's health issues. Fidel appointed Ra\u00fal as First Secretary of the Communist Party, Commander in Chief of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, and President of the Council of State and Government. Additionally, Fidel assigned other officials to key roles in health, education, and energy projects. Jose Ramon Machado Ventura and Esteban Lazo Hernandez, both members of the Politburo of the Communist Party and Vice Presidents of the Council of State, were appointed by Fidel Castro to key roles in managing funds for health, education, and energy programs. Celebrations for Fidel's 80th birthday were postponed to December 2, 2006, but he was unable to attend, sparking speculation about his health and return to power. Speculation surrounds Fidel Castro's health, with some believing he has cancer. There are differing opinions on the future of Cuba's communist government, with some predicting collapse upon Castro's departure and others pointing to a plan for his brother Ra\u00fal to succeed him. Observers have considered various scenarios for Cuba's future post-Castro. The future of Cuba's government post-Castro is uncertain, with potential scenarios including a successor communist government led by Ra\u00fal Castro, a military-led government, or a democratic transition. Ra\u00fal Castro is seen as the most likely successor due to his designation by Fidel and his leadership of the FAR, which controls the security apparatus and plays a significant role in the economy. A military-led government is considered a possibility only if the communist government fails due to internal divisions or instability. The future of Cuba's government post-Castro is uncertain, with potential scenarios including a successor communist government led by Ra\u00fal Castro, a military-led government, or a democratic transition. Despite hopes for a democratic transition, the Castro government has tightly controlled civil society, restricted human rights, and cracked down on dissent. Government attacks on human rights activists and dissidents in Cuba have persisted since the Pope's 1998 visit, with a severe crackdown in 2003. As of December 2006, 59 political prisoners from the \"group of 75\" remained incarcerated. The Cuban government, labeled as one of the world's worst human rights violators, controls all aspects of life through the Communist Party. The Cuban Commission on Human Rights reported 333 political prisoners at the end of 2005. The Cuban government held 333 political prisoners at the end of 2005, including 39 detainees without formal charges. The State Department report for 2005 highlighted numerous serious abuses, such as arbitrary arrests, denial of fair trials, abuse of detainees, harsh prison conditions, and restrictions on freedoms of speech and assembly. The government also maintained a pervasive surveillance system and retaliated against dissenters. The Cuban government retaliated against peaceful political change efforts, including the Varela Project. Despite allowing some opposition gatherings in 2005, dissent was suppressed through harassment, threats, and detention. Over 50 Cubans were detained for organizing or participating in demonstrations. Three individuals were informed of charges for undermining the government. The Ladies in White human rights group faced scrutiny. The Ladies in White (Damas de Blanco) received the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought from the European Parliament for their peaceful protests demanding the release of political prisoners in Cuba. Independent journalist Guillermo Fari\u00f1as Hern\u00e1ndez received the 2006 Cyber Dissident award for his hunger strike advocating for broader Internet access in Cuba. The Cuban government cracked down on independent journalists, librarians, and democracy activists in 2003. Elizardo Sanchez, a human rights activist, heads the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation. In 2003, Elizardo Sanchez described the crackdown in Cuba as the most intense wave of repression in history. 75 activists, including journalists and democracy activists, were arrested, tried in summary trials, and sentenced to prison terms ranging from 6 to 28 years. Foreign journalists and diplomats were excluded from the trials. Notable activists sentenced included Ra\u00fal Rivero, Oscar Espinosa Chepe, Omar Rodr\u00edguez Saludes, Marta Beatriz Roque, Hector Palacios, and Luis Enrique Ferrer Garc\u00eda. Oscar El\u00edas Biscet, a prominent political prisoner, was also arrested after three years in prison. In April 2003, Cuban activist Oscar El\u00edas Biscet was sentenced to 25 years in prison. The Cuban government executed three men who hijacked a ferry to reach the United States. Analysts suggest the crackdown on democracy activists was a response to perceived U.S. support for dissidents. The Cuban government's crackdown on opposition movements is seen as a message to deter U.S. support for dissidents and to strengthen political control amidst economic challenges. Some analysts believe the regime is clearing potential opposition to ensure a smooth succession to power for Ra\u00fal Castro. The government's actions indicate a serious security threat perception towards the dissident movement. The Cuban government's crackdown on opposition movements is viewed as a serious security threat. Some believe that the government took harsh action to prevent any easing of the embargo under the Bush Administration. In 2004, 14 political prisoners were released for health reasons, including economist Marta Beatriz Roque. In late 2004, the Cuban government released seven prisoners, including prominent figures like Ra\u00fal Rivero and Oswaldo Alfonso Valdes, in a move seen as an attempt to improve relations with Europe. However, the prisoners were only released on parole, leading to concerns from human rights groups like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. The Varela Project, named after Felix Varela, aims to gather support for political reform through a national plebiscite. The Varela Project, led by Oswaldo Pay\u00e1, gathered thousands of signatures for a national plebiscite in Cuba, calling for political reform, respect for human rights, amnesty for political prisoners, private enterprise, and electoral law changes for free and fair elections. Over 11,000 signatures were submitted to the National Assembly, surpassing the required 10,000. Former President Jimmy Carter highlighted the project's significance in a 2002 address in Havana. The Varela Project, led by Oswaldo Pay\u00e1, aimed to bring political reform to Cuba through a national plebiscite. Despite government crackdowns, Pay\u00e1 continued his efforts, including delivering signatures to the National Assembly and initiating the National Dialogue for democratic transition. Thousands of Cubans have participated in discussions on democratic reforms. A group of Cuban activists met to discuss a transition program document covering various themes like economic, political, social issues, and reconciliation with the exile community. Led by prominent human rights activists, the Assembly to Promote Civil Society held meetings in Havana in 2005. Despite some restrictions, the meeting was significant as it coincided with Cuba's independence day. The Assembly of Cuban dissidents issued a ten-point resolution at a meeting in Havana, calling for political and economic change in Cuba. The resolution included demands for the release of political prisoners, respect for human rights, abolition of the death penalty, and endorsement of a dissident document on political and economic rights. In the 109th Congress, resolutions were passed urging Cuba to release political prisoners, legalize political parties and unions, and hold free elections. In the 109th Congress, resolutions were passed urging Cuba to release political prisoners, legalize political parties and unions, and hold free and fair elections. Additionally, resolutions expressed support for the Assembly to Promote Civil Society in Cuba and called for the international community to support its mission to bring democracy to the country. In the 109th Congress, resolutions were passed urging Cuba to release political prisoners, legalize political parties and unions, and hold free and fair elections. S.Res. 469 (Lieberman) condemns the beating and intimidation of Cuban dissident Martha Beatriz Roque in 2006. House subcommittees held a hearing on Cuba's human rights crackdown in 2005. Congress funds democracy and human rights projects for Cuba in annual appropriations measures. Cuba experienced severe economic deterioration from 1989-1993, with estimates of decline ranging from 35-50%. Economic growth averaged 3.7% annually from 1994-2000, with a high of 7.8% in 1996. Economic growth slowed in 2001 and 2002 due to Hurricane Michelle and the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Cuba's tourist industry was severely affected, with reports of hotel closures and empty restaurants. Hurricane Michelle damaged around 45,000 homes. Hurricanes caused significant damage in Cuba, with economic growth affected by drought and storms. In 2005, despite Hurricane Dennis and Wilma, growth reached 9.5%. Dennis killed 16 people and caused $1.4 billion in damages, while Wilma led to flooding in Havana and $700 million in damage. Cuba's economy was impacted by hurricanes causing damage, but economic growth benefited from tourism, nickel, and oil sectors. The country has a preferential oil agreement with Venezuela and promises of Chinese investment to boost nickel production. Cuba takes pride in achievements in health and education, with high literacy and life expectancy rates. The government began adopting market-oriented economic reforms in 1993 after facing economic decline. Cuba implemented economic reforms in 1993, allowing Cubans to use U.S. dollars, engage in self-employment, and open markets for agriculture and handicrafts. These reforms aimed to boost the economy and attract foreign investment. In 1995, Cuba approved a new foreign investment law allowing fully owned investments by foreigners in most sectors, established free trade zones in 1996, and reformed the banking system in 1997. Despite these measures, many Cubans still face challenges such as low wages, high prices, shortages of goods, and power outages. The government has also backtracked on some reform efforts, making it difficult for self-employed individuals and causing some businesses to close. Foreign investors have complained about the government reneging on deals. In April 2004, the Cuban government limited the use of dollars by state companies for non-core services. Fidel Castro announced in October 2004 that U.S. dollars would no longer be accepted in entities like stores and restaurants. Cubans had to exchange dollars for convertible pesos with a 10% surcharge. Dollar bank accounts could still be used, but new deposits were not allowed. By April 2005, convertible pesos were no longer equal to the U.S. dollar. In April 2004, the Cuban government limited the use of dollars by state companies. By October 2004, U.S. dollars were no longer accepted in stores and restaurants, leading to the use of convertible pesos with a 10% surcharge. By April 2005, convertible pesos were no longer on par with the U.S. dollar, affecting dollar remittances to Cuba. The U.S.-Cuban relationship has been marked by hostility, including covert operations, the Bay of Pigs invasion, the Cuban missile crisis, and Cuban support for insurgencies in Africa and the Western Hemisphere. Since the early 1960s, U.S. policy towards Cuba has involved isolating the nation through economic sanctions, strengthened by the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 and the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996. Key events include the Mariel boatlift in 1980, the 1994 exodus of Cubans to Guantanamo and Panama, and the 1996 shootdown of U.S. civilian planes by Cuban fighter jets. The Helms/Burton legislation, enacted in response to Cuba's shooting down of two U.S. civilian planes in 1996, imposes sanctions on vessels engaged in trade with Cuba and holds those trafficking in U.S. confiscated property liable for damages. Presidents Clinton and Bush have suspended the implementation of certain provisions, while U.S. policy also includes support measures for the Cuban people such as humanitarian donations and medical exports. The U.S. policy towards Cuba includes humanitarian donations, medical exports, democracy-building support, radio and television broadcasting, and agricultural exports with restrictions. Changes were made after the Pope's 1998 visit to support the Cuban people, such as resuming direct flights and cash remittances for close relatives. In response to the migration crisis with Cuba in August 1994, measures were taken to streamline procedures for the commercial sale of medical supplies. President Clinton announced additional measures in January 1999, including broadening cash remittances to Cuba for all U.S. residents, expanding direct passenger charter flights from more U.S. cities, and loosening travel restrictions for certain categories of travelers. The Bush Administration continued the policy of isolating Cuba economically. The Bush Administration continued the policy of isolating Cuba economically through sanctions and supporting the Cuban people. Tightening restrictions on travel, remittances, and humanitarian aid to Cuba were emphasized. President Bush stated in 2001 that sanctions would remain until Cuba meets certain conditions for political freedom. President Bush announced measures to support democratic change in Cuba, including enhancing enforcement capabilities, facilitating humanitarian assistance, providing direct aid through NGOs, resuming direct mail service, and establishing scholarships. President Bush announced measures to support democratic change in Cuba, including enhancing enforcement capabilities, facilitating humanitarian assistance, resuming direct mail service, and establishing scholarships for Cuban students and professionals. He stated that full normalization of relations would only occur when Cuba had a fully democratic government, respected the rule of law, and protected human rights. The President also emphasized that economic sanctions and the ban on travel to Cuba would continue until Cuba's government showed commitment to real reform. The President announced initiatives to hasten the arrival of a new, free, democratic Cuba, including increasing inspections, improving immigration processes, and establishing a Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba. The Bush Administration took measures in 2004 to tighten U.S. policies towards Cuba. In 2004, the Bush Administration tightened U.S. sanctions against Cuba by expanding policing of waters, denying visas to Cubans involved in \"show trials,\" and endorsing recommendations from the Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba. President Bush allocated up to $59 million for these efforts. In 2004, the Bush Administration tightened U.S. sanctions against Cuba by implementing key recommendations from the Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba, including support for democracy-building activities and airborne broadcasts to Cuba. The report also recommended tightening economic sanctions on family visits, travel, and humanitarian assistance. Subsequent regulations were issued to implement these sanctions. In 2005, the Administration further restricted how U.S. agricultural exporters could be paid for their sales. In July 2005, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice appointed Caleb McCarry as the State Department's new Cuba Transition Coordinator to direct U.S. government actions in support of a free Cuba. The Commission for Assistance to Free Cuba issued its second report in July 2006, calling for the United States to provide $80 million over two years to support Cuban civil society and fund education programs and exchanges. The Commission for Assistance to Free Cuba recommended funding of $10 million for university training in Cuba, $24 million to break the information blockade, and $15 million for civil society support. They also suggested an annual funding of at least $20 million for democracy programs until the dictatorship ends. The Commission for Assistance to Free Cuba outlined detailed plans for U.S. government assistance to a Cuba transition government, including humanitarian aid, free elections, and a market-based economy. Preparatory steps were recommended to be taken before Cuba's transition begins. The report received a mixed response from Cuba's dissident community. Some Cuban dissidents expressed concerns about the Commission's report, emphasizing the need for Cubans to solve their own problems without outside interference. Miriam Leiva of the Ladies in White criticized the report for potentially providing the government with reasons to imprison dissidents and for presuming what a Cuban transition should entail before receiving U.S. recognition or assistance. Leiva stressed that only Cubans should decide on such important matters. President Bush expressed strong support for the Cuban people's desire for democracy and freedom following Fidel Castro's announcement of ceding power to his brother Ra\u00fal. The United States pledged assistance in building a transitional government in Cuba and reiterated its commitment to supporting peaceful democratic change in the country. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice also emphasized U.S. support for Cubans seeking democratic reforms. The United States supports peaceful democratic change in Cuba and has plans to respond to any potential migration crisis. Secretary of State Rice encouraged positive change in Cuba, while Homeland Security officials announced measures to discourage risky sea travel. Ra\u00fal Castro expressed willingness to normalize relations but opposed current policies. Ra\u00fal Castro expressed willingness to normalize relations with the United States but opposed current U.S. policy towards Cuba as \"arrogant and interventionist.\" The Bush Administration offered to lift economic sanctions if Cuba made political reforms, including freeing political prisoners and respecting human rights. Ra\u00fal reiterated an offer to negotiate with the United States to resolve longstanding disputes. Ra\u00fal Castro expressed willingness to resolve the longstanding dispute between the United States and Cuba through negotiations, based on principles of equality, reciprocity, non-interference, and mutual respect. The Bush Administration established interagency working groups to manage U.S. policy towards Cuba, focusing on diplomatic actions, strategic communications, democratic promotion, and humanitarian aid in the event of a democratic transition government. The government requests assistance in managing U.S. policy towards Cuba. The Department of Homeland Security and the National Security Council lead a working group on migration. The U.S. Director of National Intelligence established a Mission Manager for Cuba and Venezuela to integrate intelligence collection and analysis. Different schools of thought exist on how to achieve the objective of promoting democracy and human rights in Cuba. Advocates for a shift in U.S. policy towards Cuba propose lifting sanctions to promote dialogue and peaceful change, emphasizing the need to avoid violent upheaval and mass migration. They argue for increased engagement through travel, trade, and diplomacy to encourage reform in Cuba. Advocates for changing U.S. policy towards Cuba suggest lifting sanctions to promote peaceful dialogue and reform, emphasizing the importance of engagement through travel, trade, and diplomacy. They argue for a more realistic approach to induce change in Cuba, citing international support for lifting the embargo, missed business opportunities, and increased suffering of the Cuban people. Opponents maintain that the current two-track policy of isolating Cuba while supporting the Cuban people is the best way to achieve political change. The Solidarity Act of 1996 outlines steps for Cuba to take for the U.S. to normalize relations, including lifting the embargo. Opponents argue that softening U.S. policy without Cuban reforms would benefit the Castro regime. They believe sustained sanctions can work and that Cuba's economic decline is due to failed policies, not the embargo. Fidel Castro's temporary transfer of power to his brother in 2006 could impact the situation. The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996 codifies existing embargo provisions without a presidential waiver, impacting U.S. policy towards Cuba. Fidel Castro's temporary transfer of power to his brother in 2006 could influence U.S. policy towards Cuba. The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996 imposes restrictions on U.S. policy towards Cuba, including the ability to sue for damages related to confiscated property. The President can delay implementation for six months if it serves the national interest and aids in Cuba's transition to democracy. President Clinton utilized this provision in 1996 to postpone lawsuits against those benefiting from confiscated U.S. property in Cuba. The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996 allows for the filing of lawsuits against those benefiting from confiscated U.S. property in Cuba. President Clinton initially suspended the implementation of Title III, citing the need for a transition to democracy in Cuba. Subsequent presidents continued to suspend the right to file lawsuits at six-month intervals. President Bush suspended Title III implementation in July 2001, citing efforts by U.S. allies for democratic change in Cuba. Assistant Secretary of State Roger Noriega justified the continued suspension in 2003 due to countries condemning Cuba for human rights violations. Title IV denies entry to the U.S. for those involved in confiscating U.S. property in Cuba. The State Department has banned executives and their families from three companies for investing in confiscated U.S. property in Cuba. The provision is mandatory but can be waived on a case-by-case basis for humanitarian or legal reasons. Grupos Domos, Sherritt International, and BM Group are among the companies affected. Executives of STET, an Italian telecommunications company, paid $25 million to ITT Corporation for the use of U.S.-claimed property in Cuba. Sol Melia, a Spanish hotel company, was investigated for investing in confiscated property in Cuba but settlement efforts failed. Jamaica's SuperClubs resort chain decided to disinvest from Cuban hotels due to potential denial of U.S. entry for top officials. The enactment of the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act in May led to strong criticism from U.S. allies like Canada, Japan, Mexico, and EU nations. The law allowed foreign persons to be sued in U.S. court, which was seen as an extraterritorial application of U.S. law. However, U.S. officials defended the law citing rights under NAFTA and WTO. A settlement was reached between the EU and U.S. on April 11, 1997, regarding the extraterritorial application of U.S. law. The EU-U.S. understanding on promoting democracy in Cuba and investment protection was reached on April 11, 1997. The EU suspended its WTO dispute settlement case and later let its challenge expire in mid-April 1998. Talks on investment disciplines were challenging, but a second understanding was reached on May 18, 1998, outlining EU disciplines on investment. The EU-U.S. understanding on investment in expropriated properties was established on May 18, 1998. It set out disciplines prohibiting future investment in expropriated properties and denying government support for past illegal expropriations. A Registry of Claims would be created to alert investors and government agencies. Mixed reactions from Congress members followed, with opposition from senior members preventing any changes to Title IV. The Bush Administration initially supported the agreement. The Bush Administration's efforts to amend Title IV of the Helms/Burton legislation were hindered by Congress. In 2003, there were discussions of a potential agreement with the EU regarding Cuba policy in exchange for waiver authority for Title IV and Title III. Additionally, a dispute between Pernod Ricard and Bacardi Ltd. in the World Trade Organization involved the production and export of Havana Club rum. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations measure (Section 211 of Division A, title II, P.L. 105-277) prevents the United States from accepting payment for trademark registrations and renewals from Cuban or foreign nationals used in connection with confiscated assets in Cuba without the original owner's consent. Pernod Ricard's joint venture with the Cuban government to produce Havana Club rum faces challenges from Bacardi over the rights to the Havana Club name in the U.S. market. Pernod Ricard's joint venture under the Havana Club label faced legal challenges from Bacardi in the U.S. federal court over the use of the Havana Club name. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled against the joint venture, leading to EU initiating WTO dispute settlement proceedings in 2000, citing violations of TRIPS agreement. WTO panel's ruling in August 2001 was mixed, with both sides claiming partial victory regarding U.S. law on intellectual property rights and trade names. The EU appealed a U.S. court ruling on Cuban trademarks to the WTO, which resulted in a mixed ruling in January 2002. The appellate panel upheld the U.S. position on trademark ownership criteria but found that Section 211 violated WTO provisions on national treatment and most-favored-nation treatment. The United States needed to amend Section 211 to comply with WTO rules on national treatment and most-favored-nation treatment. Despite access to courts for trademark rights enforcement, Section 211 discriminated against Cuban nationals and foreign successors-in-interest. The U.S. agreed to comply with the WTO ruling through legislative action by Congress by January 3, 2003, but the deadline was extended multiple times due to inaction. In a 2005 EU-U.S. agreement, the EU postponed retaliation authorization, while the U.S. agreed not to block future EU requests. Different approaches were proposed to bring Section 211 into WTO compliance. Advocates propose two approaches to address Section 211 compliance with the WTO ruling: amending it to include U.S. companies or repealing it altogether. The narrow fix would extend Section 211 to U.S. companies to prevent foreign compensation claims on U.S. property. Alternatively, repealing Section 211 is advocated to protect trademarks of over 500 U.S. companies in Cuba. The Senate Judiciary Committee discussed this issue in the 108th Congress. In the 108th and 109th Congress, various legislative initiatives were proposed to repeal Section 211 trademark provision, but no action was taken. Bills such as H.R. 3372 and S. 1604 aimed to repeal Section 211, while others like H.R. 208 and H.R. 579 included provisions to lift the overall embargo and repeal Section 211. Additionally, bills like H.R. 719 and S. 328, which aimed to facilitate U.S. agricultural sales to Cuba, also included provisions to repeal Section 211. The proposed amendment to the FY2006 and FY2007 Foreign Affairs Authorization Act included a provision to repeal Section 211. Two bills, S. 691 and H.R. 1689, aimed to amend Section 211 to apply to U.S. companies. The EU-U.S. bilateral agreement in July 2005 reduced pressure on Congress to comply with the WTO ruling. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 allowed for U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba with restrictions. The Trade Sanctions Reform Act of 2000 (TSRA) allows for one-year export licenses for selling agricultural commodities to Cuba, but no U.S. government assistance or financing is available. Transactions must be conducted in cash in advance or with financing from third countries. TSRA also authorizes travel to Cuba for business related to agricultural sales. Regulations were published in 2001, and in 2004, U.S. banks were instructed to stop transfers of funds for sales to Cuba. OFAC temporarily halted sales of agricultural and medical products to Cuba to investigate potential violations of the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000. They later clarified that \"payment of cash in advance\" means receiving payment before shipment. New regulations were implemented on March 24, 2005, causing concerns among U.S. agricultural exporters and some Members of Congress. OFAC clarified that for the commercial sale of U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba, vessels can leave U.S. ports once a foreign bank confirms receipt of payment from Cuba. This action aims to protect goods from seizure for unrelated claims while still at the U.S. port. Supporters of overturning OFAC's previous amendment are pleased with the clarification but still plan to work towards overturning the rule. Cuba has purchased over $1.4 billion in agricultural products from the U.S. since late 2001. Overall, U.S. exports to Cuba saw fluctuations in the early 2000s, with a significant increase in 2004 followed by a decline in 2005. The Cuban government attributed the decrease to stricter U.S. regulations, while others believed it was due to Cuba's lobbying efforts. The rebound in exports in the second half of 2005 coincided with a clarification on payment terms by OFAC. Some groups advocate for easing restrictions on agricultural exports to Cuba, citing harm to Cuban population's health and nutrition. U.S. agribusiness companies support lifting restrictions to access a market worth over $700 million annually. They argue that allowing financing for agricultural exports would benefit smaller U.S. companies expanding purchases to Cuba. Opponents of easing restrictions on agricultural exports to Cuba argue that U.S. policy already allows sales to Cuba, citing large sales since 2001. They believe that supporting such exports would prolong the Castro regime and its repressive policies. Some agricultural producers support the prohibition on financing for exports to ensure payment. In the 109th Congress, attention was on overturning Treasury Department regulations regarding \"payments of cash in advance\" for U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba. The House Agriculture Committee held a hearing on this issue, and both the House and Senate passed provisions in the FY2006 Treasury appropriations bill to prevent the implementation of tighter restrictions on these payments. In the 109th Congress, there was a focus on overturning Treasury Department regulations regarding \"payments of cash in advance\" for U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba. The Administration threatened to veto any bill containing such a provision. Ultimately, the provision was not included in the final conference report. Press reports indicated that the White House rejected language that would have denied funds to the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control. In the second session of the 109th Congress, both the House and Senate versions of the FY2007 Transportation/Treasury appropriation bill contained a provision similar to the one approved in 2005. In the 109th Congress, provisions were added to prevent the implementation of tightened restrictions on financing for U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba. The House provision was added by H.Amdt. 1049 (Moran, Kansas), while the Senate provision was added by an amendment offered by Senator Dorgan. Final action on FY2007 Transportation/Treasury appropriations was not completed by the end of the Congress. The FY2007 Agriculture appropriations bill, H.R. 5384 (S.Rept. 109-266), included a provision (Section 755) to ease travel to Cuba for the sale of agricultural and medical goods. Legislation introduced in the 109th Congress aimed to clarify terms related to the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act (TSRA). The bills introduced in the 109th Congress aimed to ease travel restrictions for the sale of agricultural products to Cuba and included provisions for general licenses for travel transactions. Proposed amendments sought to facilitate the entry of Cuban nationals for purchasing U.S. agricultural commodities. Additionally, some bills proposed lifting the overall embargo on Cuba. The bills introduced in the 109th Congress aimed to lift the overall embargo on Cuba, including restrictions on agricultural trade and travel. Restrictions on travel to Cuba have been a contentious issue for the past 40 years, with changes over time. Enforcement of travel restrictions increased under the Bush Administration, with tighter restrictions on travel and remittances to Cuba. In June 2004, the Bush Administration significantly restricted travel to Cuba, especially family visits and private humanitarian assistance in the form of remittances and gift parcels. Family visits are now limited to one trip every three years for immediate family members, with cash remittances further restricted to quarterly amounts of $300 for immediate family only. The regulations for remittances and gift parcels to Cuba have been tightened. Remittances are now limited to immediate family members and restricted from certain government officials and members of the Cuban Communist Party. The amount of remittances authorized travelers can carry has been reduced from $3000 to $300. Gift parcels are limited to immediate family members and certain individuals are denied gifts. The contents of gift parcels have also been restricted, excluding certain items like seeds, clothing, and fishing equipment. The per diem allowed for family visits has been reduced to $50 per day. Additionally, licensed travelers are no longer allowed to purchase merchandise in Cuba and bring it back to the United States. The tightening of Cuba travel and remittance restrictions has sparked mixed reactions. Supporters believe it will deny the Cuban government funds that maintain its control, while opponents argue it will cause more suffering for the Cuban people. Concerns have been raised about the consequences of the new restrictions, such as the impact on U.S. students receiving scholarships at the Latin American School. Members of the Congressional Black Caucus expressed concern about 70 U.S. students at the Latin American School of Medicine in Havana potentially having to abandon their studies due to new OFAC regulations. OFAC eventually allowed the students to continue their studies for two years. In 2005, OFAC cracked down on religious organizations promoting licensed travel to Cuba, warning them not to abuse their licenses. In 2005, the Afro-Cuban religion Santer\u00eda found ways to bypass U.S. travel restrictions to Cuba. Sgt. Carlos Lazo, a U.S. military member, was unable to visit his sons in Cuba due to travel restrictions. Major League Baseball initially faced denial for a license to allow a Cuban team to participate in the World Baseball Classic tournament in the U.S. due to concerns about financial benefits to the Cuban government. However, the license was later approved with the condition that proceeds would go to charity, specifically for Hurricane Katrina victims. Enforcement of travel restrictions continued in 2006. Strict enforcement of travel restrictions by OFAC, including letters sent to travelers from U.S. groups like Pastors for Peace and the Venceremos Brigade. OFAC suspended licensed travel service providers and agencies booking travel to Cuba, leading to concerns from religious organizations and Members of Congress about more restrictive licenses for religious travel. Arguments for lifting the Cuba travel ban include alleviating the suffering of Cuban families. Arguments for lifting the Cuba travel ban include alleviating the suffering of Cuban families, influencing conditions in Cuba, and allowing Americans to travel to other countries with authoritarian governments. Opposition to lifting the ban includes concerns about supporting Castro's rule financially, existing legal provisions for humanitarian travel to Cuba, and the President's ability to restrict travel for foreign policy reasons. In June 2005, the House rejected amendments to ease Cuba travel restrictions. In June 2005, the House rejected amendments to ease Cuba travel restrictions, including family travel, educational travel, and the overall embargo. An amendment on religious travel was withdrawn, and an amendment on travel by members of the U.S. military was ruled out of order. In Senate action, a motion to allow travel to Cuba for visiting immediate family members was rejected. The Dorgan amendment was prompted by the case of Sgt. Lazo and aimed to ease Cuba travel restrictions. The House rejected amendments to the FY2007 Transportation/Treasury appropriation bill that would have prohibited funds from implementing the economic embargo and restrictions on educational travel to Cuba. Another amendment regarding travel for religious activities in Cuba was withdrawn. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported a provision in the FY2007 Agriculture appropriations bill that would have liberalized travel to Cuba for agricultural and medical goods. Final action on the bill was not completed before the end of the 109th Congress. Other legislative initiatives aimed to lift overall restrictions on travel to Cuba. H.R. 1814, H.R. 2617, and H.R. 3064 aimed to prevent additional restrictions on travel to Cuba, while H.Con.Res. 206 called for temporary suspension of restrictions on remittances and family travel after Hurricane Dennis. Bills like H.R. 208 and H.R. 579 sought to lift the overall embargo on trade with Cuba. H.R. 208 and H.R. 579 aimed to lift restrictions on travel to Cuba and ease restrictions on exporting agricultural commodities. Bills like H.R. 719 and S. 328 provided for a general license for travel transactions related to the marketing and sale of agricultural products. Pending amendments to S. 600 would have added provisions for travel transactions related to agricultural products. Cuba's development of offshore oil reserves along its northwest coast, potentially holding over 5 billion barrels of oil, has raised concerns among some Members of Congress. Agreements with foreign oil companies for exploration have sparked worries about environmental damage to the Florida coast. Legislation was proposed to impose sanctions on Cuba's oil development, including nullifying the U.S.-Cuba maritime boundary agreement and restricting admission to the U.S. for investors in Cuba's petroleum resources. Legislation proposed by various Members of Congress aimed to impose visa restrictions and economic sanctions on investments in Cuba's petroleum resources. Some lawmakers introduced bills to allow U.S. companies to collaborate with Cuba for offshore oil development, citing potential environmental benefits. Cuba's offshore oil exploration has raised concerns about environmental damage and illicit drug trafficking through its waters and airspace. Cuban officials have expressed concerns over drug trafficking through their waters and airspace. The government has implemented measures to combat the issue, including legislation, training for counternarcotics personnel, and cooperation with other countries. Cuba has bilateral counternarcotics agreements with 33 countries and has launched nationwide anti-drug efforts. Cooperation with Cuba on anti-drug efforts has been mixed. Cooperation with Cuba on anti-drug efforts has had a mixed record. In 1996, Cuban authorities cooperated with the United States in seizing 6.6 tons of cocaine aboard a ship bound for Miami. Since 1999, there has been increased cooperation, including upgrading communication links and stationing a U.S. Coast Guard Drug Interdiction Specialist in Havana. Coordination has improved somewhat since then. The State Department's report in March 2006 highlights Cuba's cooperation on narcotics cases through the Coast Guard specialist. Cuba has provided information on drug trafficking cases and suspect vessels to the United States. However, Cuba seeks broader cooperation but is hindered by its totalitarian character and role as a state sponsor of terrorism. Cuba has expressed interest in a bilateral anti-drug cooperation agreement with the United States. In early 2002, Cuba deported a U.S. fugitive wanted on drug charges and arrested a convicted Colombian drug trafficker who escaped from jail in the U.S. While the U.S. appreciated Cuba's actions, cooperation was to continue on a case-by-case basis. The House-passed version of the FY2006 Foreign Operations appropriations bill had a provision prohibiting assistance to the Cuban government, while the Senate-passed version allocated $5 million for preliminary work to establish cooperation with Cuba. In early 2002, Cuba deported a U.S. fugitive wanted on drug charges and arrested a convicted Colombian drug trafficker who escaped from jail in the U.S. The House-passed provision of the FY2007 Foreign Operations appropriations bill included a provision that no INCLE assistance could be made available to the Cuban government. The report to the bill maintains full reporting and transparency by the Cuban government and U.S. monitoring of counternarcotics assistance in Cuba. The U.S. government faced challenges in monitoring counternarcotics assistance in Cuba due to Cuba's hostility. Cuba's history of supporting revolutionary movements and ties to international terrorism led to its inclusion on the State Department's list of states sponsoring terrorism in 1982. Despite this, in 1992, Fidel Castro stated that Cuba's support for insurgents abroad was no longer a policy. Cuba's change in policy regarding support for insurgents abroad was influenced by the breakup of the Soviet Union, leading to economic decline. Despite being on the State Department's terrorism list, Cuba continues to oppose the U.S.-led global war on terror and maintains relationships with state sponsors of terrorism like Iran and North Korea. Cuba also provides safe haven for members of various terrorist organizations. The State Department's reports acknowledged Colombia's mediation with FARC and ELN in Cuba. International facilitators oversaw talks between Colombia and ELN in Havana. Cuba permits U.S. fugitives to live legally in the country. The State Department report acknowledged that Cuba allows U.S. fugitives to live legally in the country, including those accused of hijacking or violent crimes in the U.S. Legislation in the 109th Congress aimed to disseminate the names of these fugitives and offer rewards for their capture. Cuba has stated it will no longer provide safe haven to new fugitives entering the country. Critics argue that keeping Cuba on the terrorism list is a Cold War relic driven by domestic politics, diverting attention from real terrorist threats. Despite offering support after 9/11, Fidel Castro suggested the attacks were partly justified. Cuba hosts U.S. fugitives and members of terrorist organizations, fueling the debate on its terrorism ties. Fidel Castro criticized the U.S. response to the 2001 attacks, calling it \"fascist and terrorist\" and warning of potential innocent casualties due to extremist actions. Despite objecting to the U.S. presence at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba had a muted reaction to the transfer of captured Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters there. The Cuban government opposes the U.S. presence at Guantanamo Bay as a national security threat but has not objected to housing detainees from Afghanistan. They have expressed concerns about the treatment of terrorist suspects at the base. The U.S. government has concerns about Cuba's capability to produce biological weapons, dating back to the 1990s. Cuba has invested heavily in its biotechnology industry since the 1980s, initially focusing on agriculture but also producing numerous other products. Cuba has invested in biotechnology since the 1980s, focusing on agriculture and producing vaccines and drugs. In 2002, the US accused Cuba of developing biological weapons. The US accused Cuba of providing dual-use technology to rogue states and called on Cuba to comply with the Biological Weapons Convention. Secretary of State Powell stated that the US believes Cuba has the capability for biological weapons research but did not claim they possess such weapons. Cuba's government responded to the accusations made by Under Secretary Bolton. Former President Jimmy Carter criticized the Bush Administration for allegations of Cuba sharing technology for terrorist purposes. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee's Subcommittee held a hearing where Assistant Secretary of State Carl Ford stated Cuba has a biological weapons effort, not a program. In late June 2003, a State Department employee disputed Undersecretary Bolton's claims about Cuba's biological weapons capabilities. In March 2004, Under Secretary of State John Bolton asserted that Cuba posed a terrorist and biological weapons threat to the United States. The Bush Administration expressed concerns about Cuba developing biological weapons, but later concluded that it was unclear if Cuba had an active offensive bio-weapons program. There is disagreement over whether Cuba currently has a biological warfare effort. There is disagreement over whether Cuba has an active biological warfare effort now or in the past. The State Department's Country Reports on Terrorism 2005 report maintained that there is dispute about the existence and extent of Cuba's offensive biological weapons program. Cuba has been the target of various terrorist incidents, including bombings in 1976 and 1997. Cuban officials attribute these incidents to Cuban exiles. In November 2000, four anti-Castro activists were arrested in Panama for a plot to kill Fidel Castro. One of them, Luis Posada Carriles, was allegedly involved in the 1976 bombing of a Cuban airliner. The activists were sentenced on weapons charges and pardoned by the Panamanian President in 2004. Posada Carriles reportedly traveled to another country, while the others received support from the Cuban American community in Florida. Posada entered the United States illegally from Mexico in 2005. Luis Posada Carriles, a Venezuelan citizen with a history of involvement in bombings, entered the United States illegally from Mexico in 2005. He sought asylum due to fear of persecution for his opposition to Fidel Castro. Posada was arrested by ICE for illegal entry and charged accordingly. ICE does not deport people to Cuba or countries acting on Cuba's behalf. Venezuela requested Posada's extradition but he cannot be deported there due to torture concerns. Posada remains detained in Texas as federal judges review his case for possible indictment. The United States naval facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, has been in operation since 1903 under a 1934 treaty. The base's mission has evolved over time, serving as a strategic location during the Cold War. Cuban government initially supported the base but later deemed its presence illegal as relations deteriorated. The Guantanamo Bay naval facility has had various missions over the years, including housing Cuban and Haitian refugees in the 1990s and potentially Haitian migrants in 2004. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, the base became involved in the U.S.-led global campaign against terrorism. After the 9/11 attacks, the US sent captured Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters to Guantanamo Bay for imprisonment. The Cuban government initially did not oppose this but expressed concerns about prisoner treatment. In 2005, they denounced \"atrocities\" at the base. Some US lawmakers want to close the detention facility, while others support its use. The future of the Guantanamo base is addressed in the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996, stating that negotiations will be considered once a democratically elected Cuban government is in place. Radio and TV Marti, U.S.-government sponsored broadcasting to Cuba, aim to support the Cuban people's right to information and open communication. The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) was established to promote open communication through radio and television broadcasting to Cuba. It includes entities like Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia, and the Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB) managing Radio and TV Marti. OCB is based in Miami, Florida. The Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB) is headquartered in Miami, Florida and was relocated from Washington D.C. to south Florida in 1996-1998. Radio Marti broadcasts on short and medium wave channels for 24 hours six days a week, and for 18 hours one day per week. TV Marti broadcasts 24/7 on the Hispasat satellite and online. TV Marti was previously broadcast via blimps from Cudjoe Key, Florida until destroyed by Hurricane Dennis in 2005. Since mid-2004, both Radio and TV Marti programming have been transmitted via airborne broadcasts by the Air Force. Since August 2006, a private aircraft has been used to transmit TV Marti Monday through Saturday evenings. The Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB) in Miami broadcasts Radio Marti on short and medium wave channels for 24 hours six days a week, and TV Marti 24/7 on the Hispasat satellite and online. TV Marti programs are also broadcasted by a private U.S. commercial television station and Radio Mambi in Miami. Both Radio and TV Marti have faced controversies and funding cuts due to Cuban jamming efforts. Various studies and audits have been conducted on these programs. The Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB) in Miami broadcasts Radio Marti and TV Marti. Recent reports have raised concerns about cronyism, patronage, and bias in OCB's operations. Approximately $493 million has been spent on broadcasting to Cuba from FY1984 to FY2005, with $300 million for Radio Marti and $193 million for TV Marti. Critics argue that only a few Cubans have access to TV Marti, mainly those visiting the U.S. Interests Section in Havana. Supporters of continued TV Marti funding argue that it is essential for the Cuban people, as stated by a congressionally mandated Advisory Panel in 1994. Critics believe that the $190 million spent on TV Marti is wasteful compared to the Cuban government's inexpensive jamming efforts. They also point out that the conversion to UHF transmission has not overcome Cuba's jamming. Supporters of TV Marti argue that eliminating it would signal a lack of commitment to freedom in Cuba and benefit the dictatorial Castro government. They believe that TV Marti is still accessible to many Cubans despite government jamming, and could be crucial in a future crisis. In May 2004, the Commission for Assistance for a Free Cuba called for the deployment of airborne broadcasts to overcome Cuban jamming. President Bush directed up to $18 million for regular airborne broadcasts to Cuba and the purchase of a dedicated airborne platform for Radio and TV Marti transmissions. The proposed platform would be operated by the Office of Cuba Broadcasting and not a military aircraft. The EC-130E/J Commando Solo aircraft, used for information operations worldwide, would be utilized for this purpose. In 2003, an aircraft was used to broadcast Radio and TV Marti to Cuba to overcome Cuban jamming. Since 2004, the aircraft has been periodically transmitting programming, with plans for a dedicated airborne platform for up to 5 hours of broadcasts daily. Political developments in Cuba delayed the operational date to August 2006. In 2006, U.S. officials announced the use of a private aircraft to transmit TV Marti and Radio Marti broadcasts to Cuba. The Administration requested $37.7 million for Cuba broadcasting in FY2006, with an increase to $37.1 million for acquiring an aircraft for dedicated airborne broadcasts. The goal is to overcome Cuban government jamming. In FY2006, H.R. 2862 allocated $27.9 million for Cuba broadcasting, below the Administration's request. The House approved the bill, while the Senate included $37.7 million for Cuba broadcasting in H.R. 3057, with funds for an aircraft for Radio and TV Marti programming. In November 2005, Congress included funding for television broadcasting to Cuba in H.R. 2862, signed into law as P.L. 109-108. The funded amount was reduced to an estimated $37.1 million due to across-the-board rescissions. Additionally, H.R. 2601 and S. 600 authorized the Office of Cuba Broadcasting to use additional frequencies for Radio Marti to overcome Cuban jamming. The funding for Cuba broadcasting in FY2006 was $37.7 million and $29.9 million for FY2007. S. 600 (Section 111) authorized funding for Cuba broadcasting without a specific earmark. The Administration requested $36.279 million for Cuba broadcasting in FY2007, including funds for an aerostat for TV Marti. The House passed H.R. 5672 in FY2007 to fund Cuba broadcasting with $36.102 million, including $2.7 million for TV Marti. The Senate also recommended full funding of $36.279 million for Cuba broadcasting in the FY2007 Foreign Operations appropriations bill. Assistance has been provided by the U.S. to increase information flow on democracy. The USAID and State Department work to increase information flow on democracy, human rights, and free enterprise to Cuba. USAID's Cuba program supports U.S.-based NGOs for a peaceful transition to democracy and civil society development. Funding for these projects ranged from $4.989 million in FY2001 to an estimated $10.9 million in FY2006. In FY2006, consideration was given to authorizing funds for democracy-building efforts in Cuba and supporting the OAS's work on Cuba's human rights situation. The House-passed version of H.R. 2601 included funding for U.S. government scholarship and exchange programs prioritizing human rights dissidents, pro-democracy activists, and independent civil society members. However, action was not completed on these measures in the 109th Congress. The Administration had requested $15 million in ESF assistance for democracy activities in Cuba. The Administration requested $15 million in ESF assistance for democracy activities in Cuba, supporting USAID programs with democracy and human rights groups. The House and Senate did not address this issue in the FY2006 Foreign Operations appropriations bill. Ultimately, $10.89 million was allocated for Cuba projects in FY2006, with $8.91 million in ESF and $1.98 million in development assistance. For FY2007, the Administration requested $9 million in ESF to support the recommendations of the President's Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba and USAID-administrated democracy and human rights programs. The House-passed version of the FY2007 Foreign Operations appropriations bill recognized USAID's work in promoting democracy and humanitarian assistance for Cuba. The Senate version recommended $2.5 million in ESF for Cuba democracy programs, $6.5 million less than the request. Final action on the bill was not completed before the end of the 109th Congress. The Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba recommended $80 million over two years for measures to hasten Cuba's transition to democracy, with additional annual funding of $20 million. The United States provides democratization assistance for Cuba through the National Endowment for Democracy, with funding steadily increasing in recent years. NED-funded democracy projects for Cuba have seen a significant increase in funding from FY2001 to FY2005. In response to Fidel Castro temporarily ceding power to his brother Ra\u00fal in 2006, legislation was introduced for assistance in Cuban human rights activities and civil-society building efforts. A bill proposed funding for a \"Fund for a Free Cuba\" and a \"Cuba Fund for a Democratic Future\" to support the Cuban people in transitioning to democracy. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported significant problems with U.S. democracy assistance for Cuba from 1996-2005, citing issues with internal controls and oversight of grantees. Representative William Delahunt promised hearings on the Cuba democracy funding in the 110th Congress. In response to the 1980 Mariel boatlift, U.S. officials changed migration policy in August 1994 to prevent another mass exodus of Cubans. President Clinton announced that Cubans rescued at sea would be taken to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Talks between Cuba and the United States led to a bilateral agreement on September 9, 1994, to stem the flow of Cubans fleeing to the United States. In a September 9, 1994 bilateral agreement, the United States and Cuba agreed to facilitate safe Cuban migration to the United States, with a minimum of 20,000 legal migrants per year. The US discontinued granting parole to Cuban migrants reaching its shores, while Cuba agreed to prevent unsafe departures. In May 1995, an accord was reached to parole over 30,000 Cubans from Guantanamo into the US but intercept future sea migrants and return them to Cuba. In January 1996, the last of 32,000 intercepted Cubans left Guantanamo, most were paroled into the US. The Elian Gonzalez case in late 1999 to June 2000 brought attention to Cuban migration policy. The Immigration and Naturalization Service ruled that the boy's father had sole legal authority to speak on his son's behalf. After legal appeals, the boy returned to Cuba with his father in June 2000, sparking mass demonstrations orchestrated by Fidel Castro. The case generated strong emotions in Cuba and south Florida. The U.S. Coast Guard has interdicted thousands of Cubans at sea since the 1995 migration accord, with some transferred to Guantanamo and granted asylum in a third country. Cubans who reach shore can apply for permanent resident status under the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966. The \"wet foot/dry foot\" policy for Cuban migrants has faced criticism for encouraging risky journeys to the U.S. The number of Cubans interdicted at sea by the U.S. Coast Guard has been increasing in recent years. There have been violent incidents involving Cuban migrants and Coast Guard officials. U.S. prosecution against migrant smugglers in Florida has also risen with numerous convictions. The U.S. has seen an increase in Cuban migrants being interdicted at sea, leading to violent incidents. Cuban nationals have been convicted for hijacking planes to reach Florida, with the Cuban government imposing strict penalties for alien smuggling. In response to ferry and plane hijackings, the Cuban government executed three men, sparking global condemnation. The U.S. \"wet foot/dry foot\" policy has been criticized for encouraging risky journeys. The U.S. government took action to prevent hijackings and monitors Cuban migrants' treatment upon return. The State Department reports to Congress on Cuban government enforcement of migration agreements. Instances of harassment and punishment of returnees have been noted. In response to Fidel Castro's temporary ceding of power, the Department of Homeland Security implemented measures to discourage Cubans from risking their lives at sea to reach the United States. They urged Cubans to stay on the island and announced steps to deter alien smuggling. Additionally, they increased the number of Cuban migrants admitted to the U.S. annually for family reunification purposes, while maintaining the overall annual admission number at around 21,000. The United States will maintain the annual admission of about 21,000 Cuban migrants. Cubans attempting to enter illegally will be ineligible under the new family reunification procedure. Cuban medical personnel working in third countries can now enter the U.S. with their families. Migration talks between the U.S. and Cuba have been canceled due to Cuba's refusal to discuss key issues. Cuban migration talks with the U.S. have been canceled due to Cuba's refusal to address key issues, including the repatriation of Cuban nationals and allowing U.S. diplomats to monitor returned migrants. Cuban officials criticized the U.S. decision as irresponsible and expressed readiness to discuss all raised issues. The last suspension of talks occurred in 2000 during the Elian Gonzalez case. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2005, P.L. 108-447 (H.R. 4818), was signed into law on December 8, 2004. It included nine regular appropriations bills and dropped provisions related to Cuba in Agriculture and Commerce, Justice, and State appropriations.
