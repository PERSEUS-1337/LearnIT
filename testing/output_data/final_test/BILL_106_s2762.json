    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Saving Humanities, Arts, and Resources for Education Networking Act of 2000\" (SHARE Net Act). The Congress acknowledges the importance of humanities, arts, and resources for education. The Morrill Acts of 1862 and 1890 led to the establishment of land grant colleges and universities in the United States, focusing on research, teaching, and outreach. These institutions play a key role in providing affordable access to high-quality education and driving advanced research for the country's economy and global competitiveness. The land grant colleges and universities, along with the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service, disseminate research findings and connect research to societal needs. Advanced telecommunications technologies have untapped potential to enhance educational resources. Local and regional organizations hold valuable knowledge and resources, but lack coordination. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 provide a framework for transition. The Budget Act of 1997 established a framework for the transition from analog to digital television and the auction of publicly-owned analog spectrum, expected to yield over $6 billion in revenues. Congress believes the auction proceeds should fund the development of a new educational and cultural infrastructure using modern technologies to expand existing high-quality community educational resources. The Budget Act of 1997 set up the transition to digital TV and auction of analog spectrum to generate over $6 billion. Congress aims to use auction proceeds to enhance educational and cultural resources with modern technology. The Secretary of Education may carry out a grant program called \"SHARE Net Grant\" to support the goal of developing a high-tech infrastructure of educational and cultural resources. Grants can be awarded to consortiums of at least 3 organizations for this purpose. The \"SHARE Net Grant\" program supports partnerships of at least 3 organizations from various categories to develop educational resources. Grant funds must be used to achieve program goals and survey available resources. The program aims to assess and improve the educational resources within partnerships and the community through technological linkage, strengthening resources, and increasing access. Grant funds can be used for cooperative programs with educational institutions. The program aims to assess and improve educational resources through partnerships with educational institutions. Grant applicants must submit an application detailing how they will survey resources and create technological linkages within the community. The partnership aims to enhance resources, develop educational programming, and reach out to the community to coordinate and link specialized resources and expertise through technology. The partnership receiving a grant must provide matching funds, prioritize low-income communities or diverse memberships, and ensure geographic diversity in grant awards. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the Department of Education to carry out this section. The Department of Education is authorized to receive $1.2 billion for fiscal year 2001 and additional funds for the next 4 years to implement the grant program."
