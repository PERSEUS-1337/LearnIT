    "content": "The \"World War I American Veterans Centennial Commemorative Coin Act\" commemorates the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I, highlighting the significant impact of the war on millions of people worldwide. The centennial of America's involvement in World War I offers an opportunity to commemorate the commitment of past veterans. Frank Buckles, the last American veteran from World War I, passed away in 2011, leaving no direct link to the \"war to end all wars.\" Despite other conflicts being memorialized on commemorative coins, there is currently no coin honoring World War I veterans. The 112th Congress established the World War I Centennial Commission to plan and execute programs for the centennial commemoration. The Act aims to mint $1 silver coins to commemorate America's involvement in World War I, honoring the 4 million veterans who served. The coins will weigh 26.73 grams, have a diameter of 1.500 inches, and contain 90% silver and 10% copper. They will be legal tender and considered numismatic items. The design of the $1 silver coins minted to commemorate America's involvement in World War I will be emblematic of the centennial event. The coins will feature inscriptions of the coin's value, the year \"2018\", and words like \"Liberty\", \"In God We Trust\", \"United States of America\", and \"E Pluribus Unum\". The design will be selected through a competition held by the Secretary. The competition for designing the obverse and reverse of the coins minted under this Act will be judged by an expert jury chaired by the Secretary. The winning design will receive compensation of at least $5,000. Coins minted under this Act will be issued in uncirculated and proof qualities, with only one facility of the United States Mint used to strike each quality. The Secretary may issue coins under this Act only during the calendar year beginning on January 1, 2018. The coins shall be sold at a price equal to the face value, surcharge, and cost of designing and issuing the coins. Bulk sales will be offered at a discount, and prepaid orders will be accepted before issuance. SEC. 7. SURCHARGES.\nAll sales of coins issued under this Act shall include a surcharge of $10 per coin. Surcharges received will be paid to the United States Foundation for the Commemoration of the World Wars to assist in commemorating the centenary of World War I. The Comptroller General of the United States will audit the Foundation's expenditures related to these payments. SEC. 8. FINANCIAL ASSURANCES. The Secretary must ensure that minting and issuing coins under this Act will not cost the US Government and no funds, including surcharges, will be disbursed until the total amount is verified. The funds will not be disbursed until the total cost of designing and issuing the authorized coins is recovered by the United States Treasury. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
