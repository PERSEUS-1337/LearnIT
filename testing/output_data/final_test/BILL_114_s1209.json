    "content": "The \"Pipeline Revolving Fund and Job Creation Act\" defines key terms such as Administrator and State. It also establishes State revolving loan funds for pipeline replacement projects. The Administrator offers capitalization grants to eligible States for repairing or replacing natural gas distribution pipelines. States must enter into agreements and establish pipeline replacement revolving loan funds to receive grants. The funds granted to a State shall be deposited in the State loan fund and available for obligation during the fiscal year. Funds allotted to States by the Administrator must be used for providing loans, loan guarantees, or as reserve for leveraged loans. Any unobligated funds by the end of the grant period will be reallotted. Loans made by a State must adhere to certain limitations. The funds allotted to States by the Administrator must be used for specific expenditures determined by guidance to facilitate compliance with a plan or further the replacement of leak-prone natural gas distribution pipelines. Real property acquisition is only allowed if integral to a submitted plan. The Administrator ensures that funds from State loans are used to repair or replace natural gas pipelines with American-made materials, unless a waiver is granted. The Administrator may waive the requirement to use American-made materials for pipeline repair or replacement if it is against the public interest, if the materials are not available in sufficient quantities and quality in the US, or if using US-made materials increases costs by more than 25 percent. The Administrator may waive the requirement for American-made materials in pipeline repair or replacement if not in the public interest or if materials are unavailable in the US. A detailed justification must be published in the Federal Register. This section must align with US obligations under international agreements. States with capitalization agreements must annually prepare Intended Use Plans after public review and comment. Each State with capitalization agreements must annually prepare an Intended Use Plan that identifies the projects to be carried out, criteria for fund use, and financial goals of the State loan fund. The plan must be published and updated periodically after public comment. The State loan fund under this section includes a list of eligible projects with priorities, expected funding schedules, and estimated reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The fund is managed to ensure availability in perpetuity and allows for investments in interest-bearing obligations. State contributions are required as part of the capitalization agreement. Each capitalization agreement under this section mandates that the State deposit at least 20% of the grant amount into the State loan fund. States can use up to 4% of allocated funds for program administration costs, including establishing the fund. The Administrator will provide necessary guidance and regulations. The Administrator will issue guidance and regulations to ensure efficient use of funds, prevent waste, fraud, and abuse, and enforce accounting standards for States receiving grants under this section. States administering a State loan fund must submit a report every 2 years on their activities, including audit findings. The Administrator will conduct audits of State loan funds and State allotments. Laborers and mechanics on projects funded by the Act must be paid prevailing wages. The Secretary of Labor has the authority over labor standards in accordance with relevant sections of the United States Code. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2016 through 2026 is provided for carrying out the Act, with a limitation that only funds from this authorization can be used."
