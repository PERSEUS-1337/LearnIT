    "content": "The Clean Water Act (CWA) requires states to establish water quality standards for different uses of water bodies, such as recreational or industrial. These standards determine cleanup efforts, discharge limits, and protection measures through permitting by states or the EPA. Pollution controls by industries and cities may not always be enough to meet water quality standards, as recognized by Congress in the act. Under CWA Section 303(d), states must set total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) for waterbodies to achieve water quality standards. TMDLs act as pollution budgets, limiting the amount of pollutants a waterbody can receive while maintaining water quality standards. Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) are scientific calculations that determine the necessary reduction of pollutant loads to meet water quality standards. They serve as a planning process to address pollution sources and allocate needed reductions among different categories of sources, such as point sources (WLA) and nonpoint sources (LA). The goal of TMDLs is to eliminate impairments in water quality, not just meet pollutant limits. TMDLs aim to eliminate water quality impairments by determining necessary pollutant load reductions. They do not establish new regulatory controls or discharge limits but may require upgrades to pollution control technology. Enforcement varies for point and nonpoint sources, with CWA permits for point sources and state-run programs for nonpoint sources. States have the option to implement TMDLs. States have the option to regulate nonpoint sources to achieve TMDL goals, such as implementing alternative methods for farmers to prevent pollution. EPA reviews and approves impaired waters lists and TMDLs, providing technical assistance and funding to help states develop and implement TMDLs. The EPA acknowledges the need for a strong TMDL program to address water quality issues in the nation's waters. Approximately 40% of assessed waters do not meet quality standards. States are responsible for developing TMDLs for impaired waters and implementing pollution control actions. TMDLs are part of state water quality management programs, along with standard setting, monitoring, permitting, and enforcement. Many states lack resources for TMDL analyses, which involve assessing environmental effects from discharge sources. The EPA has been hesitant to intervene in states' water quality monitoring, leading to limited data analysis on impaired waters and pollution sources. In 1992, regulations were issued requiring states to list waters not meeting quality standards and establish TMDLs for restoration. Environmental groups have filed lawsuits to enforce compliance with these requirements, emphasizing the importance of implementing Section 303(d) to address water quality impairments nationwide. The EPA has faced challenges in controlling water quality impairments nationwide. Lawsuits have led to court orders for expeditious TMDL development by states or EPA. The litigation falls into three categories: compelling EPA to fulfill TMDL requirements, challenging EPA's decisions, and disputing TMDL content. In 1997, EPA issued guidance for states to develop long-term schedules for TMDL implementation, recommending completion within 8 to 13 years of listing impaired waters. Development of TMDLs has increased since 1996, with over 51,000 established. However, many more TMDLs need to be completed as over 41,000 waterbodies were identified as not meeting water quality standards. Pathogens are the largest single cause of impairments, with nutrients, sediment, metals, and pathogens being the main contributors. Implementation of TMDLs is complex and relies heavily on state and local stakeholders. EPA aims to have 3,360 waters in compliance with water quality standards by 2015. Proposed revisions to TMDL regulations in 1999 included new requirements for listing methodologies, establishing TMDLs schedules, and implementing TMDL plans. States and industry groups criticized EPA's proposal for new TMDL regulations, citing concerns about resource burdens, tight deadlines, and disproportionate impacts on point sources. Farm groups and nonpoint dischargers also questioned the prioritization of TMDLs over other water quality management programs. Environmentalists, farm groups, and the forestry industry criticized EPA's TMDL program proposal for various reasons, including concerns about implementation timelines and the inclusion of nonpoint source pollution. Congressional interest was high, with multiple hearings held and legislative proposals introduced to modify the Clean Water Act. EPA attempted to address criticism by offering flexibility on contentious points. The final rule, published on July 13, 2000, acknowledged Congress's action in the legislation and delayed the effective date of the rule's changes until October 31, 2001. It built on the existing regulatory program, added specific requirements and deadlines for states to clean up polluted waters, and retained key elements of the 1999 proposal. The final rule, published on July 13, 2000, acknowledged Congress's action in the legislation and delayed the effective date of the rule's changes until October 31, 2001. It retained key elements of the 1999 proposal for more comprehensive identification of impaired waters, schedules and minimum elements for TMDLs, and new public participation requirements. EPA dropped controversial provisions in response to criticism, including those potentially affecting agriculture and forestry. The Bush Administration delayed the rule's effective date until May 2003 for further review, and in March 2003, EPA withdrew the rule to consider new options. In May 2003, EPA considered disrupting the ongoing review of TMDL rules. Some stakeholders preferred retaining the 1992 rules over a new rule that could weaken the program. EPA developed a draft revised rule in mid-2002 but did not propose it. In early 2009, there were discussions of reviving the review of the 2000 rule. The Obama Administration has not proposed any regulatory changes to the 2000 rule, so the 1992 regulations and court-sanctioned TMDL schedules remain in place. The TMDL program has evolved over the years, with EPA and states developing thousands of TMDLs annually to address water quality impairments. Since 2001, EPA and states have addressed complex TMDL issues, including nontraditional causes of impairment and multi-jurisdictional TMDLs. Legal challenges impact program implementation. CWA provisions require states to report periodically on water quality conditions, including identifying impaired waters. EPA has integrated reporting requirements into a single submission to streamline the process and create a national inventory of water quality conditions. The Integrated Report (IR) requirements categorize water segments based on water quality conditions, ranging from Category 1 to Category 5. EPA has issued guidance to support states in addressing TMDL issues, focusing on controlling both point and nonpoint sources of pollution. Nonpoint sources, including urban and rural areas, contribute to water quality impairments in the United States. The TMDL program faces challenges in addressing nonpoint sources alongside point sources, as limiting TMDLs to point sources may disproportionately impact municipalities and industries. Farming and forestry groups are concerned about how their activities might be addressed in TMDLs and CWA regulations, even though EPA lacks regulatory authority over nonpoint sources. EPA can influence nonpoint sources through grants like CWA Section 319. The interpretation is that nonpoint sources should be addressed in TMDLs, upheld in a 2002 court case. Addressing nonpoint pollution sources in TMDLs is challenging due to the intermittent nature of their contributions and the lack of regulatory programs. Demonstrating \"reasonable assurance\" of load reductions is difficult without enforcement mechanisms for nonpoint sources. Tracking and verifying implementation of pollution management practices, especially voluntary ones, is problematic. Some state officials believe TMDLs are ineffective when nonpoint sources are the main cause of impairment. Stormwater discharges, mainly from nonpoint sources, are a significant cause of water quality impairments in the United States. These discharges occur when precipitation flows over impervious surfaces, accumulating pollutants that can harm water quality. The most common pollutants in stormwater are nutrients and pathogens. Stormwater pollutants include nutrients, pathogens, sediment, and metals. Point sources are regulated under the federal stormwater program, while nonpoint sources are not. TMDLs can address impairments from both types of stormwater sources. TMDLs can address stormwater discharges from both regulated and unregulated sources. Data for regulated sources are available from CWA permitting programs, while data for unregulated sources can be harder to obtain. Assigning cleanup obligations to unregulated sources presents challenges. The TMDL must also consider other sources of pollutants in impaired waterbodies, such as mercury, which can accumulate in fish tissue as methylmercury and pose risks to human health. Mercury in waterbodies mainly originates from air sources like coal-fired power plants, waste combustors, and incinerators. It can also come from past practices like gold mining or geologic deposits. States and EPA have developed 7,000 mercury TMDLs since 1996 to address this issue. Coordination among multiple sources is needed to develop and implement TMDLs for mercury-impaired waters. Implementing TMDLs for mercury-impaired waters involves coordination among various programs and stakeholders. Challenges arise when mercury comes from atmospheric sources, as water management programs do not control air emissions. Notable examples of successful TMDLs include a statewide mercury TMDL in Minnesota and a regional mercury TMDL developed by seven northeast states. These TMDLs rely on existing and future regulatory controls outside of the Clean Water Act. The effectiveness of mercury reduction strategies is difficult to estimate due to regulatory controls outside of the Clean Water Act. Ocean acidification is primarily caused by increasing CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere, posing a risk to coral reefs and fisheries. CO2 emissions pose a risk to coral reefs, fisheries, and other natural resources. Activists have urged the EPA to address the impact of CO2 on climate change. The Center for Biological Diversity sued the EPA in 2009 over the agency's approval of Washington's 303(d) list, which failed to include marine pH impairment due to CO2. CBD also pushed for the revision of water quality criteria for pH in marine waters. EPA issues water quality criteria under the Clean Water Act, which states use to develop water quality standards. The Center for Biological Diversity sued the EPA in 2009 over marine pH impairment due to CO2 emissions. EPA agreed to consider using the Clean Water Act to address ocean acidification but did not commit to revising the marine pH water quality criterion. EPA lacks data to revise the national marine pH criterion. The EPA settled a lawsuit with the Center for Biological Diversity in 2009 regarding ocean acidification (OA) and marine pH impairment. EPA issued a memo advising coastal states to list waters not meeting marine pH standards, but did not prioritize OA assessment. EPA acknowledged limited data on OA parameters and impacts, expecting future research to provide better guidance. The Center for Biological Diversity continued to pressure EPA, suing in 2013 over impaired waters lists in Oregon and Washington that excluded ocean segments affected by acidification. The EPA settlement in 2009 with the Center for Biological Diversity led to a memo advising states to list waters polluted by acidification. Developing TMDLs for ocean waters would be complex and resource-intensive, requiring extensive data and modeling. Climate change adds further complexity, with uncertainties in future conditions and sources. EPA's 2011 draft report suggests that climate change could impact water quality parameters. The EPA recommends examining TMDLs and water quality standards to ensure they remain protective of aquatic life under changing climatic conditions. Most existing TMDLs likely do not consider climate change, but future TMDLs may incorporate projected climate impacts. Some TMDLs, like Vermont's phosphorus TMDL for Lake Champlain, already consider climate change. The EPA approved Vermont and New York's phosphorus TMDL for Lake Champlain in 2002, but it was challenged in a federal lawsuit citing various flaws. In 2010, EPA reached a settlement with environmental plaintiffs and in 2011, the agency reconsidered its approval. In January 2011, the EPA disapproved the Vermont portion of the Lake Champlain TMDL due to inconsistencies with margin of safety and reasonable assurance. EPA is now establishing a new phosphorus TMDL for the impaired Vermont segments in Lake Champlain. The EPA is addressing inadequate climate change considerations in the 2002 TMDL for Lake Champlain. They are collaborating with Vermont state agencies to study the potential effects of climate change and phosphorus loads. EPA encourages a watershed approach for TMDL development to efficiently organize restoration activities across the watershed. This approach has been used in Montana and other locations, including cases where multiple states are involved in developing TMDLs. Several states have developed statewide TMDLs for pollutants like mercury and bacteria, with some facing challenges due to differing priorities and institutional coordination. Multi-jurisdiction TMDLs are being developed to address sources of impairments, such as air deposition. New York and Connecticut have also developed TMDLs in collaboration with other states. The Northeast Regional Mercury TMDL was discussed, with New York and Connecticut developing TMDLs to improve water quality in Long Island Sound by reducing nitrogen discharges. Approximately half of the Ohio River is now impaired for recreational use, leading to the development of a bacteria TMDL to address various sources of pollution. Multiple stakeholders, including EPA regions, states along the river, and ORSANCO, are involved in the TMDL development process. EPA approved a TMDL in 2010. The TMDL approved by EPA in 2010 addresses nutrient enrichment in Lake Spokane, caused by algae blooms and low oxygen levels. It covers a 63-mile stretch of the Spokane River, involving point source reductions across state boundaries, including wastewater and stormwater sources in Idaho. Developing equitable allocations for dischargers in Washington and Idaho was a challenge. The largest multi-jurisdictional TMDL is for the Chesapeake Bay watershed, drawing attention and controversy. Despite efforts to improve the watershed, it remains in poor health with polluted water and reduced fish populations. Nutrients are the primary pollutants causing impairments. The Chesapeake Bay watershed faces pollution from nutrients and sediment discharged from various sources. President Obama declared the Bay a \"national treasure\" in 2009, leading to the establishment of a Federal Leadership Committee for the Chesapeake Bay. The resulting strategy in 2010 focused on clean water regulations, agricultural conservation practices, and habitat restoration. EPA also established a TMDL for the Bay. The EPA established a TMDL for Chesapeake Bay in response to insufficient restoration efforts by Bay states. The TMDL, issued in December 2010, is divided into three parts and aims to address nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment impairments by 2025 to improve water quality and support aquatic life. The TMDL for Chesapeake Bay aims to reduce nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment levels to improve water quality and support aquatic life. Reduction targets include 75.39 million pounds of nitrogen, 14.55 million pounds of phosphorus, and 3.7 million tons of sediment from 2009 levels. Jurisdictions in the watershed are tasked with developing detailed plans to achieve these reductions through Watershed Implementation Plans (WIPs). The Watershed Implementation Plans (WIPs) aim to reduce pollutants from point and nonpoint sources in the Chesapeake Bay. Phase I WIPs outlined controls and best management practices to achieve water quality standards by 2017. Phase II WIPs focus on reducing impairment sources over the next five years. Phase III WIPs, due by 2017, will aim to have 100% of necessary practices in place by 2025. The use of WIPs in the Chesapeake Bay restoration strategy allows states flexibility in choosing controls to meet reduction goals by 2025. EPA has identified potential \"backstop\" actions under the CWA if states fail to meet commitments in the WIPs, including expanding permit coverage, requiring offsets, conditioning grants, or increasing federal enforcement. EPA's use of these authorities has been controversial and marks a shift from stakeholder agreements in Bay restoration efforts. The EPA's review of the Phase I WIPs for the Chesapeake Bay TMDL led to discussions with jurisdictions to ensure allocation targets will be met. The TMDL requires states to commit to short-term milestones every two years to track progress. Progress has been made in nutrient reduction efforts, but improvements are still needed in various areas. The review of the Chesapeake Bay TMDL showed progress in nutrient reduction efforts, with states ahead in some actions but behind in others. The TMDL also supports nutrient trading as a cost-effective strategy for meeting load limits. Nutrient trading programs in the Bay watershed allow entities to meet abatement goals at a reduced cost by purchasing load reductions from other sources. EPA supports trading to meet nutrient reduction targets in the Bay TMDL, but implementation has been limited. Trading is seen as a way to achieve cost savings, but actual outcomes depend on various factors and uncertainties. Nutrient trading programs in the Bay watershed aim to reduce costs by purchasing load reductions from other sources. Trading encourages agriculture's participation in Bay restoration and can generate revenue for the agricultural sector. USDA awarded $2.35 million in FY2012 to promote water quality trading in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Some observers are cautious about the role of water quality trading in restoring impaired waters, as states face challenges in setting parameters for credits. Nutrient trading in the Bay watershed has positive aspects like using market forces but also negative aspects such as technical complications and interstate trading hurdles. Legal challenges have been raised against water quality trading programs due to uncertainty and vulnerability to nonpoint source owners. Legal challenges have been raised against water quality trading programs due to uncertainty and vulnerability to nonpoint source owners selling credits based on unverified pollution reductions. A federal court dismissed a challenge in December 2013, ruling that the trading provisions within the TMDL plan for the Bay were not a final agency action being forced upon states. Concerns exist about the mandatory nature and costliness of EPA's TMDL and federal Bay restoration strategy, with critics noting the lack of a cost-benefit analysis for restoring the watershed. EPA is now preparing such an analysis based on Phase I WIPs. EPA is preparing a cost-benefit analysis for the Chesapeake Bay TMDL, expected to be completed by the end of 2012. Critics are concerned that the TMDL may set a precedent for similar large-scale TMDLs in other areas. Legal challenges have been brought by agricultural and home builder groups, arguing that EPA has exceeded its authority under the Clean Water Act. The EPA faced legal challenges for its Chesapeake Bay TMDL, with critics questioning its authority and the accuracy of computer models used. Despite this, a federal court upheld the TMDL in September 2013. Environmental activists support the federal government's leadership in restoring the Bay and endorse legislation to codify TMDL requirements in the Clean Water Act. Legislation was introduced in Congress to codify requirements of the Bay TMDL in the Clean Water Act and provide grants for implementation. The House Agriculture Committee approved a bill to expand the Department of Agriculture's role in Chesapeake Bay restoration. Congress has shown interest in the impact of the plan on agriculture through oversight hearings. Recommendations have been made to strengthen the TMDL program, including a Government Accountability Office report on water quality data. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that limited water quality data, especially for nonpoint sources, may lead to unsound TMDL decisions. Inconsistent monitoring and data collection by states have hindered effective TMDL programs. GAO also criticized some states for using approaches with no scientific basis to identify impaired waters. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found inconsistencies in states' approaches to identifying impaired waters, leading to questionable reliability of EPA's database of impaired waters. EPA cannot reliably tally the number of TMDLs that must be completed nationwide. EPA's responses are reflected in the Integrated Report guidance since 2004, providing guidance on documenting scientific rationale and recommending elements for state water monitoring programs. EPA also published a document recommending basic elements for state water monitoring programs. Following EPA's revisions of the TMDL program regulations in 2000, a study by the National Academies of Sciences recommended changes for the program. EPA's review after 2001 considered these recommendations, leading to the allowance of adaptive management techniques in more recent TMDLs. In 2007, EPA's Inspector General reported on TMDL implementation, highlighting the need for better information and systems for tracking and evaluating implementation. The Inspector General found that EPA lacks information to track TMDL implementation and assess water quality improvement. EPA is urged to provide more management direction to improve program assessment. EPA has taken steps to measure results and improve program data, but faces challenges in implementing new monitoring and reporting requirements. EPA concurred with many of the IG's conclusions but highlighted limited authority to enforce new post-TMDL monitoring. The EPA faces challenges in monitoring, tracking, and reporting on TMDL implementation. A 2014 GAO report showed that while over 80% of reviewed TMDLs met targets for point source pollution, only 20% achieved targets for nonpoint source pollution. Reporting annually on nationwide TMDL implementation activities was deemed costly and logistically challenging by the EPA. The GAO report highlighted that only 20% of TMDLs achieved targets for nonpoint source pollution due to the lack of legal authority and funding. GAO recommended new rules for TMDL development and suggested Congress revise the CWA's voluntary approach to restoring impaired waters. EPA and stakeholders argue that TMDLs are not the sole solution for water quality restoration. TMDL implementation is just one factor in improving water quality, with other influences like new monitoring data or changes in standards. States note advantages and disadvantages of using TMDLs, such as transparency for unknown sources of impairment or assurance for certain types of sources like agriculture. Alternative approaches to TMDL implementation, such as \"straight to implementation\" in Washington, involve working directly with landowners to prevent pollution without the need for developing a TMDL. These non-TMDL options are a relatively new idea and are seen as more challenging to achieve than traditional TMDLs. When a TMDL is developed, implementation is a significant gap in the program due to varying state strategies. Some states require TMDL implementation plans, while others complete them based on state guidance. The survey found that states have varying levels of development in their TMDL implementation plans, with some states having more detailed plans than others. Funding is identified as a major barrier to TMDL implementation, as the CWA does not provide dedicated funding for this purpose. After 40 years of implementing upgrades such as wastewater treatment plants, abandoned mine land restoration, staffing, and technical expertise, challenges remain in addressing technical impediments like insufficient scientific data on pollutant removal performance and linking water quality impacts to sources. Effective implementation factors include stakeholder involvement, diverse approaches, watershed plans, targeted implementation, and adequate resources for corrective measures and monitoring. Despite efforts to improve water quality over 40 years, a significant portion of the nation's waters are still polluted. Nearly 40% of surveyed water bodies are too polluted for designated uses like fishing and swimming. TMDL assessments provide more precise information, but many waters still require additional measures to meet water quality standards. States are facing new challenges in addressing complex TMDLs, larger scale impairments, and nonpoint pollution. The TMDL program faces challenges in addressing complex TMDLs, larger scale impairments, and nonpoint pollution. Efforts to improve water quality have been ongoing for over 40 years, but a significant portion of the nation's waters remain polluted. Discussions have been held to reform the program, including the option for states to prioritize healthy waters and integrate TMDLs with other water quality programs. Congress has not shown active interest in the TMDL program for more than a decade, but stakeholders believe there are opportunities for examination. The challenges facing the TMDL program include integrating TMDLs into a comprehensive clean water program, balancing water quality restoration with pollution prevention, shifting focus from point sources to nonpoint sources, and addressing resource and funding needs."
