    "title": "AB 2337",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 230.1 of the Labor Code is amended to protect employees with 25 or more employees from discrimination or retaliation for taking time off due to domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking. This includes seeking medical attention, accessing services from shelters or counseling, and engaging in safety planning. Employees must provide advance notice to their employer when taking time off for specific reasons, unless it is not feasible. Employers cannot penalize employees for unscheduled absences if they provide certification within a reasonable time. Employers must maintain confidentiality for employees requesting leave under this section. An employee who is retaliated against for taking time off for specific reasons is entitled to reinstatement, lost wages reimbursement, and other benefits. Employers who willfully refuse to rehire or promote such employees are guilty of a misdemeanor. An employee who faces retaliation for exercising their rights can file a complaint with the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement within one year of the violation. An employee can use vacation, personal leave, or compensatory time off for specified purposes, not exceeding unpaid leave allowed by the Family and Medical Leave Act. Domestic violence is defined as per the Family Code. Employers must inform employees of their rights regarding sexual assault and stalking as defined by specific penal codes. This information must be provided in writing to new employees upon hire and to other employees upon request. The Labor Commissioner will develop a form for employers to use in informing employees of their rights under specific penal codes. The form must be posted on the commissioner's website by July 1, 2017. Employers are not required to comply until the form is available online."
