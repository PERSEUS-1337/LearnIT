    "content": "The Act titled \"Prosecutors and Defenders Incentive Act of 2005\" amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to include loan repayment for prosecutors and public defenders. Grant authorization is provided under this new section. The section aims to incentivize qualified individuals to work as prosecutors and public defenders. A prosecutor is a licensed attorney who handles criminal cases at the state or local level, while a public defender is also a licensed attorney working for a state agency or nonprofit organization providing legal services. The term 'student loan' refers to loans under specific parts of the Higher Education Act of 1965. The Attorney General will establish a program to repay student loans for prosecutors and public defenders not in default. To be eligible for loan repayment benefits, a borrower must agree to work as a prosecutor or public defender for at least 3 years. If the borrower leaves employment due to misconduct or voluntarily before the agreed period, they must repay the benefits received. The Attorney General may recover amounts owed by an employee if they fail to repay benefits received under this section. Recovery can be waived if it goes against equity or public interest. Loan payments will be made for the specified period. The agreement allows for payments subject to appropriations. Any repayments or recoveries will be credited back to the original account. The credited amount will merge with other funds in the account for the same purposes and limitations. The Attorney General can make student loan repayments up to $10,000 per borrower per year or a total of $60,000. The borrower and Attorney General must agree on terms. No reimbursements for repayments made by the borrower are allowed. The Attorney General can provide repayment benefits up to $10,000 per borrower per year or a total of $60,000.
