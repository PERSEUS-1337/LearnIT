    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Military Tribunal Authorization Act of 2002\". Congress finds that the al Qaeda terrorist organization has committed attacks against the United States, including the bombings of embassies and the USS Cole, and has threatened further attacks and the use of weapons of mass destruction. The Taliban of Afghanistan provided a safe haven for al Qaeda to operate and sponsor international terrorist operations. The United Nations Security Council declared the Taliban's actions as a threat to international peace and security in Resolution 1267. They also declared the September 11 attacks as a threat in Resolutions 1368 and 1373. The US is justified in self-defense under international law and the UN Charter. Congress authorized the President to use force against those involved in the September 11 attacks. The United States and its allies are in armed conflict with al Qaeda and the Taliban. Military trials of terrorists may be necessary to protect public safety, use classified information as evidence, and safeguard national security interests while ensuring fairness under international law. The Constitution grants Congress the power to establish tribunals, define offenses against international law, and make laws necessary for executing these powers. Congressional authorization is required for military trials of terrorists to ensure fairness and compliance with international law.
