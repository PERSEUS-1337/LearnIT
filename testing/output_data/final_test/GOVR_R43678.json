    "content": "The annual Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill includes funding for the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) in the Department of the Interior (DOI). For FY2015, the Administration proposed accounting changes, some accepted and others rejected by the committee. Comparisons of FY2015 funding with previous years are challenging due to various changes in accounts and subaccounts. The House Committee on Appropriations noted some figures as \"incomparable\" due to budget restructuring. Table 1 displays FY2014 levels and FY2015 funding recommended by the committee for comparison. This report provides an overview of the committee's actions, compares them with the previous year, and discusses relevant programs. The committee reported H.R. 5171 (H.Rept. 113-551) on July 23, 2014, approving $1.40 billion for the Fish and Wildlife Service, down 2.0% from the FY2014 level. The President had requested $1.48 billion, an increase of 3.4%. The committee proposed changes in accounts and subaccounts, ranging from elimination to an increase of 187.8%. They aimed to protect certain subaccounts from fund transfers by lifting three programs out of Resource Management. The Fish and Wildlife Service budget in H.R. 5171 includes separate accounts for Partners for Fish and Wildlife, National Wildlife Refuge System, and Fisheries and Aquatic Resources. The largest portion of the budget is the Resource Management account, where structural changes were proposed by the Administration and the committee. The Administration suggested consolidating funding for Endangered Species, Habitat Conservation, and Environmental Contaminants into new accounts, but these changes were not implemented. The FY2015 Budget Justification proposed changes to the Resource Management account, including restructuring the funding for Endangered Species. The House committee approved $169.5 million for the Ecological Services program, a 1.6% decrease from the previous year. The House committee approved $169.5 million for the Ecological Services program in FY2015, down 1.6% from FY2014. The committee reduced some subaccounts, with the listing program showing the largest drop at 13%. Critics argue that FWS has proposed and listed very few domestic species on its own initiative. The House committee approved $62.6 million (+1.6%) for consultation under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), with language added to commend FWS for delaying the listing of the long-eared bat and directing consideration of a special rule if listed as threatened. Limits on critical habitat designation and funding for petitions have been a feature of appropriations bills for over 15 years, supported by each Administration. The House committee approved $62.6 million for consultation under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), with language added to commend FWS for delaying the listing of the long-eared bat and directing consideration of a special rule if listed as threatened. The committee report contained language to encourage FWS to proceed with efforts to delist remaining populations of gray wolves and allocated $1 million for a program to compensate ranchers for livestock losses due to wolf depredation. The House committee approved $49.2 million for the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund (CESCF), a decrease of 1.7% from the previous year. The program assists states in preparing habitat conservation plans (HCPs) for non-federal actions that may affect listed species. This funding, along with consultation under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, would result in a 0.8% decrease in endangered species funding compared to the previous year. The House committee approved $66.7 million for the Law Enforcement program, an increase of 3.8% from FY2014. Funding includes $1.2 million for the FWS forensics laboratory in Oregon and $0.7 million for new agents to combat wildlife trafficking. The committee has historically criticized the Administration's science and climate programs. The House committee approved $66.7 million for the Law Enforcement program, including funding for the FWS forensics laboratory and new agents to combat wildlife trafficking. The committee has historically criticized the Administration's science and climate programs, particularly for duplication and lack of coordination. The FWS science programs work with partners to address climate impacts on wildlife through Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs). Despite eliminating funding for LCCs, $5.10 million was provided for science support in an existing program under Conservation and Enforcement, representing a 70.4% reduction in that program. The committee praised the National Fish Hatchery System's science programs but criticized the Administration's restructuring efforts. Partners for Fish and Wildlife assists landowners in improving wildlife habitat through various means. Demand for the program exceeds resources, and it was previously funded through the Resource Management account. The committee recommended moving the program to its own account to prevent unauthorized fund use, providing $52.1 million with sage grouse protection as the top priority. Funding for the National Wildlife Refuge System was moved to a separate account for better spending control. The House committee approved $476.9 million for the NWRS, a 1.0% increase from FY2014. Operations costs have risen on many refuges due to various challenges. The committee recommended moving refuge funding to a separate account for better control, with $52.1 million allocated for sage grouse protection. Funding has not kept pace with challenges like maintenance backlog and increased use on refuges. A provision in the text requires specific congressional approval for establishing or expanding refuges, potentially affecting funds from the Migratory Bird Conservation Account. The committee approved $147.9 million for the Fisheries and Aquatic Resource Conservation program, a 9.3% increase over FY2014. They commended the program's work and provided detailed spending recommendations, including limiting funding for species listed under ESA but allowing transfers to aid species' recovery. This move gives Congress greater control over spending levels for the program. The Secretary of the Interior is directed to secure reimbursement from other Federal agencies for up to 100 but not less than 50 percent of the annual costs for mitigation responsibilities. The House committee provided $14.5 million for land acquisition, a decrease of 73.4% from FY2014. The Administration requested $55.0 million for land acquisition, an increase of 1.1% over FY2014. The committee proposed no new funding for general land acquisition, directing new acquisitions only to inholdings, acquisition management, and overhead. The committee allocated $3.5 million for the Highlands Conservation Act (HCA), which aims to preserve high priority conservation land in the Highlands region. The Migratory Bird Conservation Account (MBCA) provides mandatory funding for FWS land acquisition, funded by the sale of duck stamps and import duties on certain arms and ammunition. This funding has become increasingly important as annual appropriations have declined. The MBCA has grown in importance for waterfowl habitat conservation, with estimated funds of $70.4 million for FY2015. H.R 5069 proposes raising duck stamp prices to $25, with additional funds designated for easement acquisition. The Migratory Bird Conservation Commission oversees expenditures, including representatives from various government agencies and states. The National Wildlife Refuge Fund compensates counties for federal lands under FWS jurisdiction. The fund is supported by receipts from activities on the Refuge System but additional appropriations are needed. The committee approved $38.1 million for the fund. The committee approved $38.1 million for the National Wildlife Refuge Fund, with counties receiving 55.9% of the authorized level. The Administration argued for no funding in FY2015, which would result in counties receiving only 7.4% based on receipts. FWS plays a role in conserving species across international boundaries, including migratory birds and other species of international interest. The committee questioned the proposed elimination of NWRF funding compared to full funding for a similar program called Payments in Lieu of Taxes. The Multinational Species Conservation Fund (MSCF) benefits various species of international interest, such as elephants, tigers, and marine turtles. The House committee increased funding for the program by 10.4% compared to FY2014. The Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Fund received level funding, with grants supporting bird conservation projects between North and South America. State and Tribal Wildlife Grants help conserve species of concern to states, territories, and tribes, including nongame species. The State and Tribal Wildlife Grants program, established in the FY2001 Interior appropriations law, provides formula grants to states and territories for conservation projects. Funding can also be used for state conservation plans and competitive grants to tribal governments and states. The program has garnered support from state and tribal governments, with a shift towards more emphasis on competitive grants in the FY2014 budget. The President requested a $50.0 million budget for competitive grants, a 14.8% reduction from FY2014. H.R. 5171 included provisions on ivory trade, conservation of species, and lead content regulation in ammunition. Section 426 regulates lead content in ammunition and fishing tackle under the Toxic Substances Control Act. Section 431 impacts hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting on Forest Service and BLM lands. Section 115 addresses the import of elephant ivory, with the Fish and Wildlife Service issuing orders to enforce laws on ivory trade. The authority of FWS to create new regulations on elephant ivory trade would be restricted under this section. The Fish and Wildlife Service proposed delisting the threatened valley elderberry longhorn beetle in 2012, but a review panel found the delisting was not supported by scientific information. Various groups argued against delisting the beetle, leading to a provision preventing FWS from finalizing the delisting rule in FY2015. The controversy over listing and recovery of sage-grouse populations in western states continues due to habitat threats. The Fish and Wildlife Service listed three species of amphibians under the ESA, including the Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog, the northern distinct population segment of the mountain yellow-legged frog, and the Yosemite toad. Threats to these species include habitat degradation, predation, climate change, and introduced diseases. The Fish and Wildlife Service listed three amphibian species under the ESA due to threats like habitat degradation, predation, climate change, and introduced diseases. Recovery efforts for these species may impact recreational fishing, dams, grazing, timber management, and other activities. Section 118 requires FWS to release draft recovery plans by December 30, 2015, including analyses of social and economic impacts. Section 426 seeks legislative certainty for a denied citizen petition regarding lead regulation in ammunition and fishing sinkers by the EPA. The EPA denied a petition regarding lead regulation in ammunition and fishing tackle under TSCA. A lawsuit challenging the denial was dismissed in 2012. Another suit was filed in 2012, but the court rejected the case in 2013. Section 426 aims to prevent federal regulation through TSCA, but lead shot has been banned for hunting migratory waterfowl since 1991 under other laws. Section 431 of the House committee's bill prohibits funds from being used to restrict access to federal lands. Section 431(b) of the bill allows the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior to close federal lands for up to 30 days for special events or public safety, with a possible 90-day extension for extraordinary weather conditions. This provision applies to lands managed by the Forest Service and BLM, and could impact hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting activities on these lands. The bill allows for the closure of federal lands for up to 30 days for special events or public safety, with a possible 90-day extension for extraordinary weather conditions. The closure provision applies to lands managed by the Forest Service and BLM."
