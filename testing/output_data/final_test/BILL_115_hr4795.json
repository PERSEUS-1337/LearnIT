    "content": "The Act titled \"Communications Facilities Deployment on Federal Property Act of 2018\" allows for the deployment of communication facilities on federal property. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 is amended to allow entities to apply for easements, rights-of-way, or leases on federal property for communication facility installations. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 allows entities to apply for easements, rights-of-way, or leases on federal property for communication facility installations. The Administrator of General Services will develop a common form for applications within 30 days of the enactment of the Communications Facilities Deployment on Federal Property Act of 2018. Executive agencies cannot require applicants to use any form other than the common form and cannot ask for additional information beyond what is required by the common form. The Administrator of General Services will establish a common fee for processing applications under the Communications Facilities Deployment on Federal Property Act of 2018, based on direct cost recovery and competitively neutral with other users of federal property. Exceptions to the fee amount may be established. Services may establish exceptions to the fee amount required for granting easements, right-of-ways, or leases in consideration of public benefit and expanding wireless and broadband coverage. Fees collected by an executive agency can be used to cover the costs of granting these permissions. Master contracts for communication facility installations can be established regardless of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 allows for exceptions to fees for granting easements, right-of-ways, or leases to expand wireless and broadband coverage. The Administrator of General Services must develop master contracts for communication facility installations on federal property, with lease terms of at least 10 years and automatic renewals. Standardized treatment for placement of communication facilities on federal buildings is required. The Administrator of General Services must develop master contracts for communication facility installations on federal property, covering placement on rooftops, inside buildings, technology used, and other key issues. These contracts apply to all publicly accessible federal buildings and properties, prohibiting executive agencies from entering separate contracts for communication facility placement. The master contracts for communication facility installations on federal property must be followed by executive agencies, ensuring consistency and no significant deviations in their contracts. Definitions for communication facility installations include various infrastructure components and antennas. The Act defines communication facility installations as antennas designed for emitting or receiving radio frequency, operated from a fixed location with authorization, and added to a tower or structure. The effective date for this Act and its amendments is 30 days after enactment. The Act defines communication facility installations as antennas for emitting or receiving radio frequency, added to a tower or structure. Existing applications for easements, rights-of-way, or leases under section 6409 of a previous Act will continue as before the effective date of this Act."
