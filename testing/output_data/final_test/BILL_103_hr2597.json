    "content": "The \"Worksite Wellness Act of 1993\" may be cited as the official title of this Act. It includes a statement of findings. The Worksite Wellness Act of 1993 acknowledges the increasing trend of businesses promoting disease prevention and wellness programs. These programs can lead to cost savings, reduced absenteeism, and higher productivity. The Act aims to have health promotion programs in the majority of worksites with 50 or more employees. In 1992, companies with 50 or more employees had at least 1 health promotion activity, compared to 66 percent in 1985. Small businesses have less money for employee benefits, so they need greater incentives to invest in wellness programs. SEC. 45A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows for credits on expenditures to implement wellness programs for employees. This aims to incentivize small businesses with limited resources to invest in health promotion and disease reduction programs. The wellness program credit under section 38 allows eligible small employers to claim 50% of qualified wellness program expenses, not exceeding $10,000. An eligible small employer is defined as having gross receipts under $3,500,000 or employing no more than 500 full-time employees in the previous taxable year. For the taxable year, an employer can elect the application of this section if an employee is considered full-time by working at least 30 hours per week for 20 or more calendar weeks in the year. Qualified wellness program expenses refer to expenses paid for providing services to employees under a wellness program, including depreciation allowances treated as expenses. Qualified wellness program expenses are only eligible if services are provided in the United States. A qualified wellness program includes benefits like physical fitness programs, nutrition programs, and mental health programs for employees. The plan benefits employees who qualify under a non-discriminatory classification set up by the employer. Eligible employees cannot choose between plan benefits and other taxable income. Special rules apply for discrimination considerations. The Secretary of Labor identifies a collective bargaining agreement for employees. Employer business practices and rules from section 44(d) are considered. Eligible small employers receive a credit as part of the general business credit. The amendments made by this section deny a double benefit for eligible small employers by disallowing a deduction for qualified wellness program expenses equal to the wellness program credit determined under section 45A(a). This change applies to taxable years beginning after the enactment of the Act."
