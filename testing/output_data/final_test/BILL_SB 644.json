    "title": "SB 644",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Persons with developmental disabilities face challenges in finding employment, with a 90 percent statewide unemployment rate. Those employed earn an average of $5,500 annually. The autism population within this group is rapidly growing, comprising 50 percent of new cases in some areas. After leaving the K-12 system, one in three adults with autism lacks work experience or further education. Nationally recognized employment internship training models like Project SEARCH show that individuals with developmental disabilities can succeed in jobs with a living wage. Key elements include real work exposure, on-the-job training, and employer experience with the quality of work. The state hiring process for people with disabilities, known as LEAP, is not suitable for assessing qualifications and abilities of those with developmental disabilities. The Governor and Legislature need to address the lack of employment opportunities for individuals with developmental disabilities and strive to become a model employer to showcase their potential in the workforce. The Legislature aims to increase access to state employment for individuals with developmental disabilities by allowing successful internship performance to serve as meeting minimum qualifications for entry-level positions in California state agencies. This measure also grants flexibility to hire individuals with developmental disabilities based on specific agency needs without requiring them to perform the full range of tasks typically required for the job classification. The Legislature intends to provide model employer practices for individuals with developmental disabilities aged 18-30 eligible for supported employment services. The Department of Rehabilitation will administer the Limited Examination and Appointment Program to facilitate hiring persons with disabilities in the state civil service. The terms related to disabilities and developmental disabilities are defined in this article, including the meaning of \"Developmental disability,\" \"Disability,\" \"LEAP,\" and \"Person with a developmental disability.\" The federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990's definition of \"disability\" prevails over conflicting provisions in the state's definition, providing broader protection for individuals with mental or physical disabilities. This section will be repealed on January 1, 2021. The department will administer the Limited Examination and Appointment Program to facilitate hiring persons with disabilities in the state civil service. \"Disability\" is defined as in Section 12926. The definition of \"disability\" in the state civil service will incorporate broader protection from the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 if it offers more extensive civil rights. This amendment to Section 19241 of the Government Code will be effective on January 1, 2021. The department will implement the chapter with eligibility criteria, job classifications, examination techniques, and an internship program for persons with developmental disabilities. Section 19241 will be repealed on January 1, 2021, and a new Section 19241 will be added to the Government Code. The department will implement the chapter with eligibility criteria, job classifications, examination techniques, and an internship program for persons with developmental disabilities. Section 19241 will be repealed on January 1, 2021, and a new Section 19241.5 will establish the Limited Examination and Appointment Program as a voluntary method for state employment. Section 19242 of the Government Code is amended to conduct competitive examinations for persons with disabilities for state employment. Persons with developmental disabilities can choose to complete a written examination, readiness evaluation, or internship to qualify for the Limited Examination and Appointment Program. The internship requires successful completion of at least 512 hours with a state agency. Successful completion of a 512-hour internship with a state agency certifies the employee's skills for the position. A person with a developmental disability who completes the required examination or internship meets the minimum qualifications for the position. Examination results may be ranked or unranked. This section is effective until January 1, 2021. Section 19242 of the Government Code mandates competitive examinations for persons with disabilities for state employment, including on-the-job evaluations. Section 19242.05 establishes a LEAP internship program for individuals with developmental disabilities to qualify for LEAP classification exams after completing a 512-hour internship. The LEAP internship program allows individuals with developmental disabilities to qualify for state employment exams without a written exam or evaluation. The internship can be unpaid or paid if funding is available. This section is in effect until January 1, 2021. Section 19242.2 of the Government Code is amended to allow persons with disabilities who meet eligibility criteria to be referred for examination appointments. The department will refer names of persons with developmental disabilities for selection in internship examinations. The department may refer names of persons with developmental disabilities who completed an internship examination for consideration for appointment in the same job classification. This section will be in effect until January 1, 2021, and then repealed. Section 19242.2 of the Government Code requires the department to refer eligible candidates with disabilities to appointing powers for examination appointments. All candidates meeting referral requirements are eligible for appointment. This section will be effective from January 1, 2021. Section 19242.3 of the Government Code allows state agencies to finance internships or positions for individuals with developmental disabilities using available funds without eliminating vacant positions. State agencies providing internships or positions for individuals with developmental disabilities must allow on-the-job support as a reasonable accommodation. Support services may include time with a job coach for job analysis, training, and supervision during the internship. The job coach provides skills-building training, works with families for internship adjustment, evaluates intern performance, and is not the responsibility of the state agency unless they are the direct payor. Internships must be successfully completed in the same job classification as the desired position. If a job examination period is needed before hiring a qualified person with a developmental disability, internship hours can be used to fulfill this requirement. On-the-job supportive services are allowed but not the responsibility of any state agency involved in the internship process. This section will be in effect until January 1, 2021, and will be repealed after that date."
