    "content": "The \"Campus Care and Counseling Act\" may be cited as the short title of this Act. The findings section is included in the Act. Congress finds a significant increase in college students experiencing psychological problems, with 85% of counseling centers reporting higher numbers. Additionally, 61% of students feel hopeless, 45% are severely depressed, and 9% feel suicidal. Freshmen depression rates have nearly doubled to 16.3%. Without treatment, depressed adolescents are at risk for various negative outcomes. According to research, college students are facing increased stress, anxiety, and depression compared to a decade ago. A significant percentage of full-time undergraduate students use illicit drugs, and a high number of young adults are dependent on or abusing drugs and alcohol. The study found a high correlation between serious mental illness and substance abuse. In 2001, 20.3% of adults with serious mental illness were dependent on alcohol or drugs, compared to 6.3% of those without. A survey of counseling center directors in 2003 showed concerns about the increasing number of students with psychological problems and a need for more psychiatric services. The International Association of Counseling Services recommends 1 counselor per 1,000 students. Accreditation standards suggest 1 counselor per 1,000 to 1,500 students. However, the ratio can be as high as 1 counselor per 2,400 students at larger institutions. SEC. 3. MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES ON CAMPUS. Part B of title I of the Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended by inserting section 120A for mental and behavioral health services on campus. The purpose of this section is to increase access to mental and behavioral health services for college students to support their academic success. Grants will be awarded to institutions of higher education to create or expand these services for a period of 3 years. Any institution providing such services is eligible to apply for a grant. Institutions seeking grants for mental health services must submit applications describing student needs. Treatment providers may include college counseling centers, mental health centers, and other entities offering mental and behavioral health services to students. The institution of higher education must provide a description of available resources, program objectives, anticipated outcomes, coordination with existing programs, and the impact of funds on improving students' mental and behavioral health. Outreach strategies to reach students and promote access to services are also required. The institution of higher education must provide a description of available resources, program objectives, anticipated outcomes, coordination with existing programs, and the impact of funds on improving students' mental and behavioral health. Outreach strategies to reach students in need, evaluate program outcomes, and additional information required by the Secretary are also necessary for funding consideration. A peer review panel will evaluate applications and recommend them for funding or disapproval. The peer review panel, consisting of experts in mental and behavioral health, will evaluate proposals from higher education institutions to improve mental health services. Priority will be given to applications that show a clear plan for enhancing current and future mental health initiatives on campus. The majority of panel members must not be federal government employees. Priority in funding recommendations will be given to proposals that provide direct service to students, improve mental and behavioral health at institutions with a counselor to student ratio greater than 1 to 1,500, or have a projected impact on mental health at the institution of higher education. Grants under this section must be used for the specified purposes. Funds from grants can be used for activities like prevention, screening, treatment, and education of mental health issues in students. This includes hiring trained staff, expanding training programs, and promoting evidence-based practices. Each institution of higher education receiving a grant must support evidence-based practices, evaluate outcomes, and provide reports to the Secretary on fund usage and program objectives. Additional evaluations may be required, such as expanding services offered. The grant funds provided under this section must be used to supplement existing funds, not replace them. There are limitations on the percentage of grant funds that can be used. Grant funds received under this section must be used for administrative costs (5%) and training costs (20%), with a prohibition on using the funds for construction or renovation. $10,000,000 is authorized for grants in fiscal year 2005, with additional appropriations for the following 4 years."
