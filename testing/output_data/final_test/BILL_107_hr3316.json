    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Computer Security Enhancement and Research Act of 2001\". The Congress acknowledges the importance of the National Institute of Standards and Technology in developing security standards for Federal computer systems, the application of best security practices for protecting sensitive information, the role of the Federal Government in supporting research for future networked information systems, and the availability of technology like cryptography from private sector companies. The Act aims to establish research programs for improving networked information system security, promote academic research on computer security, and strengthen the role of the National Institute of Standards and Technology in securing Federal computer systems. Encryption technologies should be driven by market forces, not government requirements. The Act aims to establish research programs for improving networked information system security and promote technology solutions from the private sector to protect Federal computer systems. The National Institute of Standards and Technology Act is amended to include a new research program focused on the security of networked information systems. The Director will establish a program to support research at institutions of higher education, for-profit research organizations, or consortia to enhance networked information system security. The program will involve multidisciplinary, long-term research, directed research based on Computer System Security and Privacy Advisory Board findings, and the development of an academic research community in relevant subject areas. The Director will provide support for post-doctoral and senior research fellowships in the field of networked information system security. Senior fellowships are for established researchers changing fields to study networked information systems security. The Director supports post-doctoral and senior research fellowships in networked information system security. Eligible individuals and institutions can apply for stipends and grants to conduct research in this field. The Director supports post-doctoral and senior research fellowships in networked information system security. Applicants must submit detailed information on the number of graduate students, post-doctoral research fellowships, and senior research fellows involved in the project, along with the level of support for each. Emphasis and commitment to meeting program requirements are key factors in award decisions. Program Managers designated by the Director oversee the process. The Director designates program managers at the Institute to establish research goals, solicit project applications, and select projects based on novelty, scientific merit, and applicant capabilities. The Director designates program managers to establish research goals, solicit project applications, select projects based on merit, and monitor progress. Periodic reviews of research awards are conducted, and advice is sought from the Computer System Security and Privacy Advisory Board on research quality and relevance. The Director contracts with the National Research Council for a comprehensive review of the research program, assessing scientific quality, research relevance, and program progress. A report on the review results is submitted to Congress within six years of program initiation. SEC. 4. INTRAMURAL SECURITY RESEARCH. The National Institute of Standards and Technology will conduct research on emerging technologies for networked computer systems and improve the security of networked information systems. SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of appropriations for the National Institute of Standards and Technology includes funding for activities related to security research on emerging technologies for networked computer systems. Funding amounts range from $25 million to $85 million for fiscal years 2003 to 2007, and $5 million to $5.8 million for fiscal years 2003 to 2007. SEC. 6. COMPUTER SECURITY REVIEW, PUBLIC MEETINGS, AND INFORMATION. The National Institute of Standards and Technology Act is amended to include a new subsection requiring recommendations from the Computer System Security and Privacy Advisory Board on standards and guidelines. Funding is authorized for the Board to address emerging issues in computer security, privacy, and cryptography. The Computer System Security and Privacy Advisory Board is tasked with making recommendations on standards and guidelines related to computer security, privacy, and cryptography. They will hold public meetings, receive presentations, and publish reports for public distribution on these subjects."
