    "content": "The Act titled \"Federal Milk Marketing Improvement Act of 2007\" amends pricing regulations for milk under milk marketing orders and addresses Class II milk pricing. Section 8c(5) of the Agricultural Adjustment Act is amended to include Class II milk pricing based on the national average cost of production in the 48 contiguous states. The national average cost of milk production is determined by the operating and overhead costs, excluding unpaid labor and custom services. The Secretary conducts surveys among producers to gather necessary data for this purpose. The Secretary announces the minimum price for Class II milk for the next calendar year by November 1, adjusted using the national average cost of production on April 1, July 1, and October 1. The Secretary sets the minimum price for Class II milk for the upcoming calendar year on November 1, based on the national average cost of production on April 1, July 1, and October 1. This price serves as the basic formula price for all Federal and State milk marketing orders and unregulated milk production areas. The price of Class I milk is determined by this basic formula price. The Secretary estimates annual milk production and consumption, considering import projections for all milk products, to determine the quantity of milk to be produced and marketed in the next 12 months. The Secretary manages the inventory of milk in the US based on the dollar value of exported and imported milk products. Production totals are determined by each producer annually. The Secretary may determine excess milk production for the national market every 2 months if the maximum quantity of excess milk has been purchased. The Secretary may reduce the price received by producers for excess milk production by up to 5% of all milk in the 48 contiguous States. The reduction amount cannot exceed half the minimum price of Class II milk. Additional reductions may be implemented if necessary. The Secretary may further reduce the price received by producers who increase milk production in a calendar year compared to the previous year, if initial reductions are insufficient. This reduction applies only to the excess milk quantity. The Secretary may reduce the price for excess milk production compared to the previous year. New producers are exempt from additional reductions. Appeals can be made by affected producers. Appeals can be made by producers subject to additional reductions in milk production to provide evidence that they did not increase production in the current year compared to the previous year. Federal or State milk marketing administrators can consider extraordinary circumstances when deciding on these appeals. Reductions in milk prices due to weather or disease are collected by Federal and State milk marketing administrators to offset excess milk product costs. The Secretary shall collect reductions in milk prices from unregulated areas to offset excess milk product costs. Producers will not be charged for hauling milk or converting raw milk to manufactured products. Milk handlers purchasing milk from producers must assume title for the milk. The milk handler must assume title for the milk at the time of delivery and cover all transportation costs. This applies to all producers and handlers of milk in the 48 contiguous States. SEC. 4. AMENDMENTS TO FEDERAL MILK MARKETING ORDERS. Amendment to Section 8c(17) of the Agricultural Adjustment Act allows for disapproval of an amendment to a milk order without affecting the order itself or other terms."
