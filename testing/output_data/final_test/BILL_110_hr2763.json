    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Biofuels Research and Development Enhancement Act\". It includes a section on the Biofuels and Biorefinery Information Center. The Biofuels Research and Development Enhancement Act establishes an information center for biofuels and biorefineries, in cooperation with the Secretary of Agriculture. The center provides information on technologies for making fuels from lignocellulosic feedstocks, biotechnology processes for biofuels, and other advanced technologies. The Secretary of Energy administers the center and continually updates the information provided. The Biofuels Research and Development Enhancement Act establishes an information center for biofuels and biorefineries. The center provides information on technologies for making fuels from lignocellulosic feedstocks, biotechnology processes for biofuels, and other advanced technologies. The Secretary of Energy administers the center and continually updates the information provided. The center's tasks include updating information, making it available to interested parties, and providing assistance through a toll-free number and website. The Biofuels Research and Development Enhancement Act establishes an information center for biofuels and biorefineries, providing information on technologies for making fuels from lignocellulosic feedstocks, biotechnology processes for biofuels, and other advanced technologies. The center is administered by the Secretary of Energy and offers assistance through a toll-free number and website. Section 932 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to include a new subsection focusing on research, development, and demonstration of biofuels and advanced biofuels infrastructure. The program aims to address issues such as corrosion, sediment dissolution, and filter clogging in transportation fuel distribution infrastructure. The new subsection in Section 932 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 focuses on research, development, and demonstration of biofuels and advanced biofuels infrastructure. It addresses issues such as filter clogging, contamination, flow properties, instability, volatile emissions, microbial contamination, electrical conductivity problems, and increased nitrogen oxide emissions. The Secretary must report to Congress on challenges in increasing biodiesel to 5% of diesel fuel sales. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to establish bioresearch centers focusing on biofuels in specific districts. Grants for biofuel production research and development in certain states are established. The Secretary will provide grants to eligible entities for biofuel production research and development in states with low ethanol production rates. Eligible entities include higher education institutions or consortia with relevant technology experience. Authorization of Appropriations: $25,000,000 for each fiscal year 2008-2010 to carry out biofuel production research and development grants for eligible entities with relevant technology experience. SEC. 7 amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to establish a program for increasing energy efficiency in biorefinery facilities. SEC. 8 calls for a study on the increased consumption of ethanol-blended gasoline with higher ethanol levels. The Secretary, in collaboration with other agencies, will conduct a study on increasing ethanol-blended gasoline consumption in the US with ethanol levels between 10% and 40%. The study will assess production constraints, economic impacts, and effects on retailers and consumers. The Secretary will conduct a study on the impacts of ethanol blends on vehicle engines, safety, and the environment. A report will be submitted to Congress within 1 year of the Act's enactment. The Secretary will conduct a study on optimizing flexible fueled vehicles to use E-85 fuel for increased efficiency and engine durability associated with biodiesel use. A report will be submitted to Congress within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Secretary will initiate a study on the effects of biodiesel on engine durability, including assessments on biodiesel blends at varying concentrations. A report must be submitted to the Committee on Science within 1 year of the Act's enactment. The Secretary will submit a report to the Committee on Science and Technology of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate detailing the results of the biodiesel study and any recommendations. SEC. 11. BIOENERGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATION. Section 931 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to allocate specific funding amounts for fiscal year 2010 in subsections (b) and (c). This includes $963 million in subsection (b)(4) and $377 million in subsection (c)(2), among other allocations."
