    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Alaska Adjacent Zone Safe Oil Transport and Revenue Sharing Act\". Congress finds that the United States is an Arctic nation with a 700-mile border with the Arctic Ocean, over 100,000,000 acres of land above the Arctic Circle, and a broader Arctic area including the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands. The Arctic region is home to an indigenous population that has relied on marine mammals, fish, and wildlife unique to the region for millennia, with over 16,000,000,000 barrels produced. The United States Arctic region has produced over 16 billion barrels of oil and may hold an additional 30 billion barrels of oil and 220 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Temperatures in the region have warmed significantly, the Arctic ice pack is rapidly diminishing, and indigenous people are being impacted. The United States Arctic region has significant oil and gas reserves, but warming temperatures are causing the ice pack to diminish, impacting indigenous communities and ecosystems. This is opening up new areas for potential development in offshore oil and gas, fishing, shipping, and tourism. SEC. 3 amends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to require oil produced from Arctic offshore leases to be transported by pipeline to onshore facilities. It also allows for the transportation of oil from these leases in preproduction phases by means other than pipeline. SEC. 4 addresses revenue sharing from areas in Alaska adjacent zone. Section 18 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act is amended to include revenue sharing from areas in Alaska adjacent zone, defining terms like 'coastal political subdivision' and 'distance'. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act is amended to include revenue sharing from areas in Alaska adjacent zone. Terms like 'Indian tribe', 'leased tract', and 'State' are defined. The State of Alaska will receive 37.5 percent of bonus bids after 5 years. The State of Alaska will receive 37.5 percent of bonus bids for leasing rights in the Alaska Adjacent Zone, as well as a share of lease rental payments, royalty payments, royalty proceeds, and other revenues from the leasing area. 20 percent of the State's share will be allocated among coastal political subdivisions. The Secretary will allocate a portion of the State's share of leasing revenues to coastal political subdivisions based on their distance from the leased tract within 300 miles. The Secretary will allocate qualified outer Continental Shelf revenues among coastal political subdivisions based on their distance from the leased tract, with payments inversely proportional to the distances determined. Additionally, 33 percent of the State's allocable share will be paid directly to certain regional corporations. The Secretary will allocate outer Continental Shelf revenues among coastal political subdivisions based on distance from the leased tract, with payments inversely proportional to distances. 33% of the State's share will be paid directly to certain Regional Corporations under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. The Secretary will allocate outer Continental Shelf revenues among qualifying Regional Corporations based on distances from the leased tract, with payments inversely proportional to the distances of Native villages within each qualifying region. Each Regional Corporation must treat revenue as subject to distribution requirements under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act and divide it annually among all 12 Regional Corporations. Additionally, a Regional Corporation receiving revenues must further distribute 50 percent of the revenues received. The Secretary shall pay 7 percent of any allocable share of the State directly to Indian tribes based on the relative distance of the headquarters of the Indian tribes from the leased tract. The Secretary determines distances between Indian tribe headquarters and leased tract center, then allocates revenues inversely proportional to distances. A conservation royalty of 6.25% is distributed after other payments. The Secretary allocates revenues based on distances between Indian tribe headquarters and leased tract center, with a conservation royalty of 6.25% distributed for land and water conservation fund or direct Federal deficit reduction."
