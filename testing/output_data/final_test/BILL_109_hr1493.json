    "content": "The \"Boutique Fuels Elimination Act of 2005\" aims to reduce the proliferation of boutique fuels. The Clean Air Act allows for temporary waivers of fuel or fuel additive regulations during supply emergencies if extreme circumstances prevent adequate distribution to consumers. The Clean Air Act permits temporary waivers of fuel or fuel additive regulations in cases of extreme supply emergencies caused by natural disasters, equipment failures, or unforeseen events, when it is in the public interest to do so. The Administrator must make specific determinations before granting such waivers. The Clean Air Act allows temporary waivers of fuel regulations in extreme supply emergencies, with specific conditions such as geographic limitations, a 20-day duration (or shorter if sufficient), and a transitional period for wholesalers and retailers to adjust inventory after the waiver ends. The Clean Air Act allows temporary waivers of fuel regulations in extreme supply emergencies, with specific conditions such as geographic limitations, a 20-day duration, and a transitional period for wholesalers and retailers to adjust inventory. The waiver applies to all persons in the motor fuel distribution system, with public notice required. The Administrator will define the term 'motor fuel distribution system' and promulgate regulations within 180 days. This waiver authority does not limit other waiver authorities of the Administrator. The Clean Air Act allows temporary waivers of fuel regulations in extreme supply emergencies, with specific conditions. The Administrator is restricted from approving any fuel that would increase the total number of approved fuels in a State implementation plan or revision. The Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, will determine and publish a list of fuels approved under the Clean Air Act by September 1, 2004, in all State implementation plans for public review and comment within 90 days of enactment. The Administrator will remove a fuel from the approved list if it is no longer in a State implementation plan or if it matches a Federal fuel formulation. However, the total number of authorized fuels will not be reduced. The Administrator has the authority to approve controls or prohibitions for new fuels in State implementation plans. The Administrator can approve controls or prohibitions for new fuels in State implementation plans without reducing the total number of authorized fuels. If a new fuel completely replaces a listed fuel or does not increase the total number of fuels on the list, it can be considered for approval. The Administrator may approve control or prohibition for a new fuel after consultation with the Secretary of Energy, if it will not cause fuel supply interruptions or impact fuel producibility. The Administrator cannot approve a fuel with a Reid Vapor Pressure of 7.0 pounds per square inch unless it was already approved in at least one State implementation plan in the applicable Petroleum Administration for Defense District. This does not prevent a State from mandating the use of registered alcohol or bio-diesel fuel additives. (c) Sense of the Congress.--Congress believes that States should maximize environmental benefits from authorized fuels. (d) Study and Report on Boutique Fuels.--The Administrator will conduct a joint study on boutique fuels and report to Congress. The Administrator of the EPA and the Secretary of Energy will conduct a study on the effects of State plan provisions on air quality, fuel blends, availability, fungibility, and costs. The focus is on developing a Federal fuels system to maximize motor fuel supply, preserve air quality, and reduce price volatility from boutique fuels. Recommendations for legislative changes will be made to Congress. The study will assess the impacts of legislative changes on energy supply, distribution, and use, as well as the need for cleaner motor fuel reformulations to meet air quality standards. The Administrator will coordinate input from affected parties and use sound scientific practices, while the Secretary will also play a role in conducting the study. The Secretary will coordinate obtaining comments from affected parties interested in fuel availability, blends, fungibility, and costs. A task force will be appointed to provide information and assist in developing recommendations for the report to Congress. The Administrator and the Secretary will jointly submit the results of the study. The Secretary and Administrator will submit a report to Congress within 12 months of the Act, including recommended regulatory and legislative changes. $500,000 is authorized for the study. Definitions include the Administrator as the EPA head and the Secretary as the Energy Secretary. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy, while \"fuel\" encompasses gasoline, diesel fuel, and other liquid petroleum products used in vehicles. \"A control or prohibition respecting a new fuel\" pertains to regulations on fuel formulation, composition, or emissions characteristics that may impact gasoline or diesel fuel constituents."
