    "content": "Prior to 1970, road construction and maintenance in the territories were mainly funded by local fuel taxes. Federal involvement was limited to military roads and disaster relief. The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1968 initiated a highway study for Guam, American Samoa, and the Virgin Islands due to increasing traffic congestion. The study revealed high traffic volumes in these island territories. The study recommended that territorial governments finance an expanded highway development program by raising gasoline tax rates by five cents, instead of new federal highway grant programs. Additional studies were suggested to develop suitable highway improvement programs for each territory, with technical guidance from the Department of Transportation. The report authors were hesitant to recommend significant federal funds for territorial roads. The authors were hesitant to recommend significant federal funds for territorial roads due to the constrained fiscal environment and the nature of the federal highway trust fund. Despite the Department of Transportation's recommendation against it, the Territorial Highway Program was established in 1970 to assist the territories in highway construction and improvement. The Territorial Highway Program (THP) was established in 1970 to assist the territories (Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa) in constructing and improving arterial highways and inter-island connectors. The program provided federal assistance for road projects, with funds not to be used for maintenance but for building and improving roads only. Federal aid was granted based on a 70% federal contribution of total project costs, with annual funding amounts specified for each territory. The Territorial Highway Program (THP) was established in 1970 to assist the territories in constructing and improving arterial highways. The 1973 and 1976 Acts authorized funding for the Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa. STAA78 added the Northern Mariana Islands to the program and increased the federal contribution from 70% to 100%. The STAA82 Act made significant changes to the Territorial Highway Program (THP) funding. It grouped the four territories together for Federal-Aid Primary (FAP) funds, ensuring they received a minimum of \u00bd % of FAP funds annually. Funding allocation was based on urban and rural population, public road mileage, and area. Territories contested population figures, leading FHWA to refer to funding from STAA78 for guidance. In 1983, FHWA used funding from STAA78 to allocate THP funds among territories based on specific ratios. STURAA extended these authorizations, maintaining funding levels. ISTEA designated territories as states under the NHS Program, setting aside 1% of NHS funds for them. In 1992, FHWA reviewed the funding distribution ratios. In 1992, FHWA reviewed the 1-5-5-1 allocation for territories, concluding that American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands were not receiving their fair share. A new 1-4-4-1 formula was implemented in 1993, adjusting the funding ratios. Territories classified their highways under ISTEA, establishing the Federal-Aid Territorial Highway System for Federal-aid eligibility. The Federal-Aid Territorial Highway System, eligible for Federal-aid funds under THP, had its set-aside changed to $36.4 million per fiscal year by TEA-21. Despite initial Senate opposition, the $36.4 million set-aside was agreed upon in conference. Project eligibility was expanded to include Surface Transportation Program projects, airports, and seaports in the territories. FHWA continues to distribute funds according to the 1-4-4-1 formula. The funding for transportation projects under the THP has evolved over the years in line with surface transportation authorization acts. Significant increases in funding occurred in FY1974, FY1977, and FY1992. Funding for American Samoa and the Virgin Islands doubled in FY1974, while Guam's funding increased to $5 million in FY1977, bringing it into parity with the Virgin Islands. Funding dropped in FY1983 due to changes in federal aid primary contract authority. Another major increase happened in FY1992-1993 under ISTEA, with funding for American Samoa and the Northern Marianas more than tripling by FY1993. Under TEA-21, funding for transportation projects in American Samoa and the Northern Marianas tripled by FY1993, while Guam and the Virgin Islands saw a doubling of funding. Territories may also receive highway funding from sources like the Emergency Relief Program and High Priority Projects Program, but are not eligible for Federal Highway Administration discretionary programs. The largest source of federal highway funding for territories is the Emergency Relief Federal-Aid Highway program (ER), which can be requested in case of storm damage or natural disasters to restore damaged roads. Since FY1990, territories like American Samoa, Guam, and the Virgin Islands have received a total of $72.9 million in Emergency Relief (ER) funds to restore roads damaged by natural disasters. Additionally, they have participated in programs like the High Priority Project Program (HPP) and received federal highway funding under Title 23 of the U.S. Code. The territories receive formula and incentive grants for highway safety programs administered by NHTSA. They are ineligible for certain FHWA safety grants but participate in the MCSAP for truck and bus safety enforcement. The territories receive grants for truck and bus safety enforcement. Arguments for federal aid to territories focus on transportation needs, benefits to the US, and limited enfranchisement. Traffic congestion has increased due to population growth and more vehicles on territorial roads. Some roads are still under stress despite improvements under the THP. Despite improvements made under the THP, some territorial roads are still under stress from inadequate capacity and others remain substandard and hazardous. The territories, being islands, face higher construction costs compared to the 50 U.S. states, with remoteness from suppliers posing a challenge, especially for the Pacific territories. Advocates argue that federal assistance is necessary as the territories have lower per capita domestic product and higher prices for basic goods, making it difficult for them to fund their road infrastructure needs. Federal highway assistance is seen as a way to bring the territories into economic parity with the states. Advocates of assistance argue that the territories, including Guam, American Samoa, and the Virgin Islands, are strategically valuable to the United States. Limited representation in Congress is linked to low levels of federal assistance. The main objection to territorial participation in the federal-aid highway program is their lack of contribution through taxes. Highway user taxes from the 50 states fund the program. Under TEA-21, each state's share of highway program spending is adjusted annually to ensure a 90.5% return on their fuel tax contributions. This \"minimum guarantee\" links taxes paid to federal assistance, leading to debates on restricting funding to states supporting the Highway Trust Fund. Opponents argue that territories should raise their own fuel taxes for highway funding due to their small size and population compared to states. The territories' small size and population compared to states are key arguments against their expanded participation in federal highway programs. Some argue that the territories would qualify for excessively generous program minimums due to their size. Additionally, the federal-state partnership assumed by the FAHP does not align with the relationship with territories, suggesting that highway assistance to territories should be separate from existing programs and not funded by the Highway Trust Fund. The debate over federal highway funding for territories outside existing FAHP programs may lead to modest changes, as full participation is unlikely due to territories not contributing to the HTF. Elimination of the THP is improbable, but expanding territorial participation to match states is also a consideration. Federal highway assistance to territories is limited due to their non-state status, excluding them from most federal highway programs. The territories can only participate in programs that specifically include them or define them as a state. While full participation in core highway programs is unlikely, territorial projects could be eligible for other FAHP programs controlled by the FHWA. The FHWA controls smaller discretionary programs for territories, which are competed for on a project basis or designated by earmarking. Congress could make territories eligible by defining them collectively as a state under Title 23 U.S.C. However, there is no guarantee of grants for territorial projects. TEA-21 reduced THP funding to a fixed annual amount of $36.4 million through FY2003, lower than the previous 1% NHS set-aside. Restoring the 1% set-aside could be considered. The possibility of restoring the 1% set-aside for territories under the NHS program is being considered during the reauthorization debate. One option is to define the territories as a state for allocation purposes, qualifying them for a minimum allocation. Another option is to argue for a higher dollar amount set-aside to approximate the outcome of a 1% set-aside. The federal revenue outlook may hinder increasing aid to territories. SAFETEA proposes changes to the THP, including technical changes to Title 23 of the U.S. Code. The bill proposes changes to the THP, broadening project eligibility by allowing \"collector roads\" and participation in ferry projects. It also ends the prohibition on tolls on territorial roads but adds limitations such as excluding seaports and airports from eligibility. Funding remains at $36.4 million annually with a 100% federal share. The bill proposes changes to the THP, broadening project eligibility by allowing \"collector roads\" and participation in ferry projects. The federal share is maintained at 100% and territories must negotiate new agreements within 12 months of enactment."
