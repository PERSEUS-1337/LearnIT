    "content": "The report discusses appropriations for the components of DHS included in the homeland security appropriations bill for FY2017, focusing on Research and Development, Training, and Services. The Administration proposed moving the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office into a new office, and the report provides an overview of the FY2017 request and appropriations proposed by the Senate. The report on homeland security appropriations for FY2017 includes information on Research and Development, Training, and Services. It tracks legislative action related to DHS appropriations, focusing on discretionary funding amounts. The reports do not analyze mandatory funding issues or other legislation related to DHS programs. The Appendix to CRS Report R44621 explains key budget concepts related to Department of Homeland Security appropriations for FY2017. It includes terms such as budget authority, obligations, outlays, discretionary and mandatory spending, and adjustments to spending caps under the Budget Control Act. All amounts in CRS reports are rounded to the nearest million for budget authority, with precision in percentages and totals for calculations. The data used in this report for FY2016 amounts are derived from two sources, including the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2016 and additional information from H.Rept. 114-668. This report relies on unrounded data for precision in percentages and totals. S.Rept. 114-264 provides funding levels for FY2016 and FY2017, including the rejection of the new Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosives Office by the Senate Appropriations Committee. DHS was authorized to submit its FY2017 appropriations request under the new common appropriations structure. DHS requested funding under the new common appropriations structure (CAS) for FY2017, with four categories of appropriations. The Coast Guard was an exception due to migrating financial information. DHS proposed realigning its Programs, Projects, and Activities (PPA) structure. The House Appropriations Committee used CAS for funding recommendations, while the Senate Appropriations Committee did not. The Senate Appropriations Committee drafted its annual DHS appropriations bill using the same structure as FY2016, while the House used the CAS structure. Differences between the two structures need to be resolved in the final legislation for FY2017 appropriations. The homeland security appropriations bill allocates resources to every departmental component, with discretionary appropriations providing the majority of funding for DHS operations. The DHS budget is primarily funded by appropriations, with the majority of funding coming from discretionary appropriations. The budget is divided into five thematic titles, with the first four focusing on different components of the department. The remaining funding comes from fee revenues, trust funds, and mandatory spending. The appropriations bill for DHS allocates resources to every departmental component. The DHS appropriations bill is divided into five thematic titles, with Title IV focusing on Research and Development, Training, and Services. In FY2017, $1.63 billion was requested for components in Title IV, representing an increase from FY2016. The growth in funding was partly due to the inclusion of the newly proposed CBRNEO, which incorporated DNDO and other components from different titles. The Senate Appropriations Committee-reported S. 3001 and House Appropriations Committee-reported H.R. 5634 proposed different funding amounts for components in Title IV of the DHS appropriations bill. The Senate bill would have provided $1.50 billion, $132 million less than requested, while the House bill would have provided $1.63 billion, $1 million more than requested. The House bill included funding for the new CBRNEO, but neither bill was voted on before the end of the fiscal year. The President signed a continuing resolution into law to fund the government at the same rate as FY2016, with reductions, through December 9, 2017. Another resolution funded the government through April 28, 2017. Details on the impact on DHS can be found in CRS Report R44621. Funding levels for components under the Research and Development, Training, and Services title for FY2016, as well as amounts requested for FY2017, are listed in Table 1. The USCIS is primarily responsible for processing immigration applications, naturalization petitions, and refugee/asylum claims. Funding for these activities comes mainly from fee revenues. The USCIS receives annual appropriations from the Treasury for specific projects like reducing backlogs and operating the E-Verify program. Most revenue comes from adjudication fees. The Administration requested $129 million for USCIS in FY2017, including $119 million for E-Verify and $10 million for Immigrant Integration. The request projected $4,018 million in new budget authority, with $3,234 million for adjudication services and $139 million for information and customer services. The Senate Appropriations Committee-reported bill recommended a gross budget authority of $3,625 million for USCIS in FY2016, $393 million below the requested amount. It included $119 million for the E-Verify Program and allowed USCIS to use up to $10 million of fee revenue for immigrant integration grants. The committee directed USCIS to allocate at least $29 million for converting paper immigration records to digital format and specified that appropriations should not be used for granting immigration benefits without proper verification. The House-reported bill directed USCIS to use funds for immigrant integration grants only for lawful permanent residents and prohibited funding for certain employee occupation titles. It recommended a budget authority of $3,625 million for FY2017, $393 million below the requested amount. The House-reported bill allocated $119 million for USCIS, with provisions for the E-Verify Program and immigrant integration grants. USCIS could use up to $10 million of fee revenue for grants, and accept gifts for citizenship promotion. Funds were prohibited from expanding DACA or DAPA. The House-reported bill allocated $119 million for USCIS, with provisions for the E-Verify Program and immigrant integration grants. It specified that USCIS appropriations could not be used to grant immigration benefits without a criminal background check. Additionally, funds were prohibited from providing services to aliens not lawfully admitted for permanent residence. The Senate-reported bill addressed concerns about the accuracy of the E-Verify system, which helps employers verify employees' legal status. E-Verify usage has increased significantly, and the Senate committee supported DHS efforts to improve its effectiveness. USCIS was directed to provide national-level E-Verify statistics on its website. The House committee report supports the agency's efforts to independently review the accuracy of E-Verify. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center provides training to federal, state, and local law enforcement entities to promote consistency and collaboration. FLETC administers four training sites and employs approximately 1,100 personnel. For FY2017, the Administration requested $243 million in discretionary budget authority for FLETC, which was $3 million less than the previous year. Both Senate and House Appropriations Committees included the requested funding level. The Senate report highlighted retirements in senior leadership and turnover among instructional staff, endorsing direct hire authority and timely hiring campaigns. The House report encouraged a review of pay and benefits to recruit and retain skilled staff to support FLETC's mission. The House and Senate Committees support FLETC's efforts to address active shooter threats by evaluating response technology. The Science and Technology Directorate is tasked with assessing these technologies for integration into training programs. The Directorate is responsible for research and development in various laboratories and funds R&D by other entities. The Administration requested $759 million for the Directorate in FY2017. The Administration requested $759 million for the Science and Technology Directorate in FY2017, a $28 million decrease from FY2016. Funding for Research, Development, and Innovation would have decreased by $18 million. R&D on border security technologies would have increased by 71%, while R&D on detection of explosives and bioagents would have decreased by 31% and 28% respectively. Funding for University Programs would have decreased by almost $9 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee included $790 million for S&T in S. 3001, $31 million more than requested. The committee's recommendation for Science and Technology Directorate in FY2017 was $31 million more than the Administration's request and $2.8 million more than FY2016. The recommendation for Research, Development, and Innovation was $22 million more than the request and $4 million more than FY2016. The recommendation for University Programs was $9 million more than the request and almost $1 million more than FY2016. H.R. 5634 included $767 million for S&T, $9 million more than requested by the Administration and $20 million less than FY2016. The Administration's request for Science and Technology Directorate in FY2017 included no further funding for the ongoing construction of the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF). An appropriation of $300 million for this project in FY2015 completed its planned construction budget. Both the House and Senate committee recommendations included funds for NBAF operational stand-up activities, with the Senate report directing DHS and the Department of Agriculture to work together on a plan for future NBAF operations. The Science and Technology Directorate was directed to update the committee on the operation of the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) by either the government or a contractor. Congress established the S&T Directorate as the primary R&D organization for DHS, allowing other components to conduct R&D activities coordinated through the Under Secretary for Science and Technology. However, coordinating R&D activities among DHS components has been challenging, as highlighted in a 2012 GAO report that found a lack of department-wide policies for R&D. The GAO report identified DHS's lack of department-wide policies for defining and reporting R&D activities, leading to an unknown total investment in R&D. Recommendations were made for DHS to develop policies, guidance, and a mechanism to track R&D projects. Progress was noted in updating guidance and coordinating R&D efforts, with GAO stating concerns were partially addressed in 2015. The GAO report highlighted DHS's lack of department-wide policies for defining and reporting R&D activities, resulting in an unknown total investment in R&D. Recommendations were made for DHS to develop policies, guidance, and a mechanism to track R&D projects. Progress was noted in updating guidance and coordinating R&D efforts, with concerns partially addressed in 2015. The Department lacks a mechanism for capturing and understanding research and development activities conducted across DHS, as well as coordinating R&D to reflect departmental priorities. The proposed Common Appropriations Structure includes Research and Development as one of its standardized account titles, but ongoing concerns about coordination and prioritization remain unresolved. The President's budget request suggested consolidating offices and activities into a new Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosives Office. The House passed H.R. 3875, The Department of Homeland Security CBRNE Defense Act of 2015, which would restructure DHS CBRNE activities into a new office. This office would coordinate CBRNE capabilities for homeland security and be headed by an Assistant Secretary. The Senate has not passed a similar bill yet. The House appropriation bill and the Senate bill differed in their approach to funding CBRNE capabilities for homeland security. The Administration requested $501 million for the new CBRNE Office in FY2017, while the Senate Appropriations Committee did not fund the proposed office. Instead, it recommended funding levels for components within the current DHS structure, including $348 million for DNDO. In FY2017, funding for CBRNE capabilities for homeland security varied between the House and Senate bills. The Senate bill allocated $108 million for OHA, $12 million less than the Administration's request. The House bill included $504 million for the CBRNE Office, $3 million more than requested by the Administration. Congress directed DHS in 2013 to review programs related to CBRNE threats for potential improvements and cost savings. In June 2015, a review was completed on the consolidation of the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) and the Office of Health Affairs (OHA) into a new office for DHS-wide coordination of CBRNE activities. The President's FY2017 budget request reflected this reorganization, and the House passed H.R. 3875 to restructure DHS CBRNE activities. The Senate has not passed a similar bill. The BioWatch program, which detects bioterrorism pathogens in U.S. cities, is a major part of OHA's budget. There are debates on consolidating CBRNE activities in DHS for better coordination, with concerns about costs, agency cultures, and research focus. The BioWatch program, aimed at detecting bioterrorism pathogens in U.S. cities, faced challenges in replacing its existing system. Despite unsuccessful efforts to procure a new system, DHS terminated further procurement activities in April 2014. Funding for BioWatch in FY2017 was recommended to be $12 million less than requested, with the Senate committee suggesting redirecting the funds to speed up the development of new bio-detection technology. The House committee, on the other hand, recommended providing the requested amounts for BioWatch, including support for system replacement and recapitalization. The committee recommended funding for BioWatch in FY2017, including $1 million for equipment replacement. Concerns were raised about the current system's effectiveness and DHS's progress in improving it. DHS was directed to clearly communicate future technology requirements to the private sector and innovators."
