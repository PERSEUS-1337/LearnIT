    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Preventing Tragedies Between Police and Communities Act of 2016\" and includes training on de-escalation for law enforcement. Training Requirement: States or local governments receiving grants under part E of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control Act must mandate de-escalation training for law enforcement officers annually, focusing on non-lethal force methods, prevention of escalation, and communication tactics. The training requirement mandates annual de-escalation training for law enforcement officers, emphasizing communication, negotiation, and using the lowest level of force necessary to address threats. It also includes techniques for mental health awareness, teamwork in de-escalation, and principles for approaching critical incidents. The training requirement for law enforcement officers includes de-escalation strategies such as creating a \"reaction gap\" with distance and cover, crisis intervention for mental health and substance abuse issues, and evidence-based approaches like the Critical Decision-Making Model. Training sessions vary in length for academy participants and other officers to ensure effective training. The training for law enforcement officers emphasizes de-escalation techniques and practical scenarios. Cross-training principles should be applied to other academy training. States must certify completion of training sessions to the Attorney General within a year of this Act. Each State or local government receiving a grant must comply with subsection (a) of this Act, with the possibility of a 6-month extension for good faith efforts. Failure to comply may result in up to a 20% reduction in allocated funds under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. The Edward Byrne Memorial State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Programs require compliance with evidence-based practices for enhancing de-escalation skills of law enforcement officers. Failure to comply may result in reallocation of funds to compliant States and local governments. The Attorney General will collect data on de-escalation training efforts by Federal fund recipients. There is an affirmative duty to use de-escalation tactics when available. If a State or local government fails to implement de-escalation training policies for law enforcement officers, their grant funding will be reduced by 15% in the following year. Failure to comply with de-escalation training policies will result in a 15% reduction in grant funding, which will be reallocated to compliant States and local governments. The Attorney General must issue guidance within 180 days of the Act's enactment for States and local governments to comply with the requirements."
