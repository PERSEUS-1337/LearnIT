    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Scott Campbell, Stephanie Roper, Wendy Preston, Louarna Gillis, and Nila Lynn Crime Victims' Rights Act.\" It amends Title 18 of the United States Code to include a new chapter on Crime Victims' Rights. The \"Crime Victims' Rights Act\" outlines various rights for crime victims, including protection from the accused, notice of public proceedings, the right to be heard, confer with the government attorney, restitution, timely proceedings, and fair treatment. The \"Crime Victims' Rights Act\" ensures that crime victims are treated with fairness, dignity, and privacy in court proceedings. Government officials must make best efforts to notify and provide victims with the rights outlined in the Act, even in cases of conflict of interest between the prosecutor and the victim. The \"Crime Victims' Rights Act\" requires prosecutors to advise crime victims of conflicts of interest and provide legal referrals. Notice of release may be withheld if it endangers safety. Victims, their representatives, and the government attorney can assert rights under the Act, but accused individuals cannot benefit from it. In cases with multiple victims, the court may find it impracticable to address all their rights. If the number of crime victims makes it impracticable to accord all rights under the Crime Victims' Rights Act, the court can create a procedure to implement the chapter. A Federal court's denial of a crime victim's right can lead to an application for a writ of mandamus to the court of appeals. The Government can challenge a district court's denial of a crime victim's right in a criminal case on appeal. The Crime Victims' Rights Act ensures crime victims' rights in legal proceedings related to the appeal. Failure to provide these rights does not warrant a new trial, and the act does not allow for a cause of action for damages. A crime victim is defined as someone directly harmed by a federal offense, with provisions for underage, incapacitated, or deceased victims. Legal guardians or representatives can assume the victim's rights, but the defendant cannot be named as such. Procedures are in place to promote compliance with the act. The Crime Victims' Rights Act mandates regulations to enforce and ensure compliance with crime victims' rights. This includes establishing an administrative authority to handle complaints and requiring training for Department of Justice employees who violate these rights. The Department of Justice must enforce Federal laws regarding the treatment of crime victims, provide training for employees, and impose disciplinary sanctions for non-compliance. The Attorney General has the final say on complaints with no judicial review. The Attorney General has the final say on complaints with no judicial review. SEC. 3.
