In 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act authorized $2.4 billion for lithium-ion battery manufacturing. President Obama proposed expanding R&D funding and increasing the electric vehicle tax credit to $10,000, aiming to reduce oil consumption and air pollution through promoting electric vehicles. The initiative for electric vehicles, including plug-in hybrids and all-electric vehicles, aims to reduce operating costs compared to gasoline-powered vehicles. However, upfront costs are higher, and battery technology remains a challenge for widespread adoption. The U.S. Department of Energy funds research to address issues related to size, cost, weight, durability, and safety of batteries for hybrid and electric vehicles. The report examines efforts to strengthen U.S. capacity for manufacturing batteries and components for hybrid and electric vehicles. Americans have traditionally used internal combustion engines in vehicles for the last 100 years. The combustion process in an internal combustion engine drives the piston down, which is connected to a crankshaft that powers the vehicle. Modern vehicles use gasoline or diesel as fuel sources. The engine's exhaust valves remove gases and heat from the combustion process is used for heating in the winter. The battery powers the electric engine starter to crank the engine. Electric vehicles operate differently from those with internal combustion engines. An all-electric vehicle operates using electricity from a rechargeable battery, an electric motor, and a controller. These components replace the traditional IC engine, fuel tank, and exhaust system in a regular car. The rechargeable battery is essential for the operation of an electric vehicle, which can be recharged by plugging into an electrical outlet or charging station. Electric vehicles come in different types, including all-electric and hybrids that use both electricity and gasoline as fuel sources. Batteries are essential for electric vehicles, storing and releasing energy through electrochemical processes. Power density affects acceleration, while energy density impacts range. There is a trade-off between the two characteristics in battery technologies. High power and energy density are desirable for vehicle applications to compete with gasoline. The first rechargeable lead-acid battery was invented in France in 1859, with French inventors improving the design by the 1880s. Despite advancements, lead-acid batteries remain popular due to their simplicity, low cost, and compatibility with IC engines. Lead-acid batteries are small, durable, and require minimal maintenance. They provide bursts of energy to start engines and can be recycled at a rate of 98%. The typical automotive lead-acid battery generates 12 volts of electricity through six interconnected compartments, each containing 16 metal plates in an electrolyte solution. The positive anode side of each plate is coated in lead oxide, while the negative cathode side is coated in lead, generating up to 2 volts of electricity within each cell. Lead-acid batteries generate up to 2 volts of electricity within each cell, arranged in a series to produce 12 volts. The battery powers the car and recharges through the alternator when the engine is running. Charging and recharging occur automatically while driving. New battery technologies are being developed for electric vehicles due to the limitations of lead-acid batteries, which are bulky, heavy, and have low energy density. Researchers have been seeking better battery options since the 1970s, with nickel metal-hydride (NiMH) batteries becoming popular for early hybrid vehicles due to their higher energy density and lighter weight compared to lead-acid batteries. New battery technologies are being developed for electric vehicles to overcome the limitations of lead-acid batteries. NiMH batteries are currently used in many hybrid vehicles, including the Toyota Prius and Honda Insight. Toyota announced in 2009 that it would continue using NiMH batteries in its hybrid vehicles. Other advancements include lead-carbon batteries and the \"Zebra\" battery, which offer higher energy density and better performance in extreme temperatures. The most prominent new battery technology for electric vehicles is based on lithium, known for its high energy and power densities. Lithium can be recycled from depleted batteries for reuse in new ones. Ford Motor Co. started using lithium ion batteries in hybrids in 2012. Different automakers use various lithium-based battery technologies with similar energy and power densities. Li-ion batteries share structural components with lead-acid batteries. Li-ion batteries have components like cathode, anode, separator, electrolyte solution, and a durable case. They also have a safety structure for chemical leakage and flammability. During discharge, lithium ions and electrons move from the anode to the cathode through the electrolyte. Li-ion cells can be cylindrical or rectangular with gel electrolyte, enclosed in laminated film for efficiency in battery pack assembly. Li-ion batteries have a T-shaped design in the Chevrolet Volt, with a 6-foot long pack weighing 435 pounds. The cost of Li-ion batteries ranges from $375-$750 per kWh, making a 16 kWh battery cost up to $12,000. Vehicles would need a capacity of 100 kWh for a 300-mile range on battery power. Li-ion batteries are widely used in small consumer products and automotive applications, with the Asia Pacific region leading in production and consumption. The market for lithium-ion batteries in light duty transportation is projected to grow significantly, reaching almost $22 billion by 2020. Japan and South Korea currently hold an estimated 80% share of the global market. The Asia Pacific region leads in production and consumption of Li-ion batteries, with Japan and South Korea holding an estimated 80% global market share. While the U.S. market share is currently low, it could increase in the next decade with the rise in demand for electric vehicles. Congress has allocated $2.4 billion in grants to encourage the development of a domestic battery supply chain. The U.S. market for Li-ion batteries is growing due to the demand for electric vehicles. Factors favoring a domestic supply chain include just-in-time manufacturing, proximity to auto plants, and cost-effectiveness of assembling batteries near assembly plants. The supply chain includes research, raw material mining, equipment manufacture, assembly, marketing, financing, shipping, and customer service, which was not present in the U.S. before the passage of ARRA. The Li-ion battery supply chain in the United States was established after the passage of ARRA. The supply chain includes automakers, Tier 1 suppliers, Tier 2 and 3 suppliers, and U.S.-based suppliers of lithium compounds and graphite. FMC Lithium and Chemetall Foote are two of the largest U.S. suppliers of lithium. Chemetall sources lithium from brine deposits in Chile and ore from a mine in North Carolina. The United States primarily sources lithium from brine deposits, which are more cost-effective than mining lithium-bearing minerals. While the U.S. has 760,000 tons of lithium resources, the rest of the world has an estimated 12 million tons. The U.S. is the leading consumer of lithium, with Chile and Argentina being the top producers and exporters of lithium ore materials. China and Russia also have lithium resources but import from Chile due to cost considerations. Industry analysts predict an excess supply of lithium by 2020, leading to lower prices and impacting current producers. Various minerals like manganese, nickel, cobalt, copper, and aluminum are used in Li-ion batteries, with some sourced from specific regions like the Democratic Republic of Congo for cobalt and China for rare earth minerals. U.S. suppliers play a significant role in battery manufacturing, with companies like Novolyte producing electrolytes in Louisiana. U.S. suppliers like Novolyte in Louisiana produce electrolytes for battery manufacturing. Tier 2 suppliers provide components and chemicals for Li-ion cells, including separators from Celgard, active materials from ConocoPhillips and Superior Graphite, and electronics from DuPont and Applied Materials. Various companies like 3M, Dow Kokam, and SouthWest NanoTechnologies produce materials for cathodes. Li-ion battery electronics manage battery functions like voltage and cell balance. Electronic components from companies like Texas Instruments, Atmel, and Maxim Integrated Products are used to manage battery functions such as voltage, cell balance, and charging status. These components also regulate the temperature of Li-ion batteries to prevent overheating. Other components in the battery include the steel or aluminum can, insulators, safety vents, gaskets, and center pins. Tier 1 suppliers assemble these components into batteries, with cell and battery-pack manufacturers being the most visible part of the U.S. electric battery supply chain. However, prior to ARRA, only EnerDel operated a domestic high-volume anode and cathode coating and cell manufacturing facility. Many U.S. pack manufacturers still import cells. Many U.S. pack manufacturers import Li-ion cells, including those used in GM Volt's batteries made by LG Chem in South Korea. U.S.-based facilities like LG Chem, Johnson Controls, A123 Systems, and Dow Kokam are building Li-ion manufacturing capacity to compete with Asian facilities. U.S. makers of Li-ion vehicle batteries aim to achieve high-volume production for cost efficiency, facing challenges in reaching adequate volume. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology emphasize the importance of scale in manufacturing EV battery packs for commercial success. Achieving low cost requires large-volume, highly automated factories. Attention to both R&D and manufacturing is crucial for successful EV development. Understanding economies of scale in manufacturing is key to battery technology development. Battery manufacturing may not necessarily happen in the country that creates the technology, posing a political challenge in the US. The government's role in supporting EV development is crucial, as high-tech manufacturing of batteries often occurs abroad, particularly in Asia. Automakers play a significant role in integrating batteries into vehicles, requiring proprietary technologies for hybrid and electric vehicles like GM's Chevy Volt. The Volt's battery pack design is closely integrated with the vehicle design to ensure complete integration. An electric heater warms the coolant and pre-heats the battery in cold weather, while a chiller dissipates heat from the battery in hot temperatures. The management system monitors feedback from thermal sensors to maintain optimal temperature levels. Automakers are heavily involved in designing and producing Li-ion batteries for their vehicles. Some automakers form partnerships with battery manufacturers for sourcing batteries for specific vehicle models, ensuring optimal performance. U.S. automakers, however, prefer to shop for batteries independently, seeking competitive bids for selection. For instance, General Motors chose LG Chem over A123 Systems for its Volt Li-ion battery. The transition to larger batteries for motor vehicles may open the door for new entrants into the industry. Success in consumer Li-ion battery production does not guarantee dominance in the automotive market. Lithium, primarily mined in Chile, is refined into a white powder for battery manufacturing. The lithium mined in Chile is refined into a white powder at Chilean plants and shipped to manufacturers. Tier 2 and 3 suppliers convert the powder into lithium metal for battery cells through an automated extrusion process. The metal is flattened into thin strips, laminated, wound into spools, divided into cells, heated, and tested for electrical transmission capabilities before being cut into sizes needed for batteries. The Li-ion battery manufacturing process involves cutting cells to size for various applications, with 70% of the value added in cell development. Cells are then shipped to a Tier 1 plant for anode and cathode establishment. Cathodes play a crucial role in battery function, with manufacturers developing unique compositions and partnering with specialized companies for advanced materials. Tier 1 manufacturers and automakers assemble cells into battery packs with 250-500 cells. GM does final battery pack assembly at its Brownstown, MI, plant for more control. In 2009, ARRA provided $2.4 billion for Li-ion battery manufacturing in the US. The Obama Administration enacted ARRA to support Li-ion battery manufacturing in the US, aiming to lower costs and increase production. DOE funded 48 projects for PHEVs and EVs to accelerate US manufacturing capacity for batteries and electric drive components. $1.5 billion in grants were provided to develop a domestic battery supply chain. The Obama Administration enacted ARRA to support Li-ion battery manufacturing in the US, aiming to lower costs and increase production. $1.5 billion in grants were provided to accelerate the development of a domestic battery supply chain, including funding for lithium supplies, Li-ion cell components, diverse cell chemistries, pack assembly facilities, and a lithium recycling facility. The largest grants totaling over $1.2 billion went to companies in Table 3. Additional funding was allocated for U.S. production of electric drive components and the purchase of PHEVs for demonstration purposes. The Obama Administration allocated $400 million for the purchase of PHEVs, installation of charging stations, and workforce training related to transportation electrification. ARRA aimed to increase US advanced battery manufacturing capability and reduce costs, with DOE reporting a drop in Li-ion battery costs from $1,000/kWh in 2008 to $500/kWh in 2012. DOE aims to further lower costs to $300/kWh by 2014 and $125/kWh by 2022. The DOE aims to reduce battery costs to $300/kWh by 2014 and $125/kWh by 2022. In 2013, the DOE inspector general reported inappropriate payments to LG Chem. President Obama proposed raising the tax credit for electric vehicles to $10,000 as a rebate at the time of purchase to make them more affordable. The President's plan aims to increase funding for electric drive technologies and battery research. The DOE requested $420 million for the Vehicles Technologies program in FY2013. Additionally, a $2 billion energy trust fund using revenues from offshore oil and gas leases is proposed to support these initiatives. The Administration proposed a $2 billion energy trust fund to support development of electric, biofuel, and natural gas vehicles. The EV Everywhere Challenge aims to cut costs for batteries and drivetrain systems, increase fast-charge rates, and promote workplace charging. Congress first supported electric and hybrid vehicle technologies in 1976. In 1976, Congress overrode President Ford's veto to support electric vehicles, initiating DOE's research program on battery technology. By 1978, a new schedule mandated the introduction of a limited number of electric vehicles annually. In 1978, a limited number of electric vehicles were introduced annually, with the program expanding in the 1980s. President Reagan cancelled the program in 1981 due to a critical report by the General Accounting Office. The report highlighted the need for significant improvements in electric vehicle technology, industry strength, market establishment, and infrastructure development. Despite this setback, research on vehicle energy storage options continued. California's mandate for zero emission vehicles in 1990 sparked new interest in hybrid and electric vehicles. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 directed DOE to develop a project for fuel cells and electric vehicles. The U.S. Council for Automotive Research (USCAR) was established in 1992 as a research consortium for advanced vehicles, housing the U.S. Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC). In 1993, the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV) was created as a public-private partnership to develop advanced manufacturing technologies and triple vehicle fuel efficiency to 80 miles per gallon. The Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV) focused on developing advanced auto manufacturing technologies to produce vehicles with low gasoline consumption and emissions. The program aimed to build diesel-powered, hybrid-electric vehicles (HEV) and researched NiMH and Li-ion batteries for energy storage in HEVs. In its final year of 2001, the National Research Council confirmed the choice of NiMH and Li-ion batteries for development in the PNGV program. The Bush Administration replaced PNGV with the FreedomCAR and Fuel Partnership in 2002, focusing on commercial and passenger vehicles, as well as fuel cell research. USCAR remained the private sector partner, while other federal agencies previously involved were no longer part of the initiative. The FreedomCAR and Vehicle Technologies initiative, established in 2002 to replace PNGV, involved major oil companies and utilities in developing more efficient IC engines and hybrid electric vehicles. The program focused on high-power Li-ion batteries for hybrid electric vehicles, with a significant portion of funding allocated to national laboratories for research and development. FCVT allocated most of its spending towards developing high power density batteries for hybrid vehicles, with the remaining funds supporting long-term research for high energy density technologies in Li-ion batteries for electric vehicles. The Obama Administration continued DOE's Vehicle Technologies program and promoted battery manufacturing, focusing on reducing costs and improving performance of Li-ion batteries. Research also includes assessing new cathode materials like manganese oxides and iron phosphates as alternatives to lithium cobalt oxide, aiming to lower costs for electric vehicles. Federal spending on battery research increased by 86% between 2008 and 2012. The ATVM program at DOE was established in 2007 to raise fuel economy standards and promote domestic production of fuel-efficient vehicles. It has awarded $8.4 billion in loans to five companies for hybrid and electric vehicle development. The U.S. battery industry's growth is tied to the hybrid and electric vehicle market. The hybrid and electric vehicle market has seen significant interest, with most automakers offering some form of electric vehicle. In 2012, over 434,000 hybrid and 52,000 electric vehicles were sold in the US, making up 3.38% of total sales. President Obama aimed to have 1 million fully electric vehicles on the road by 2015, with leading manufacturers planning for production capacity of over 1.2 million electric vehicles by that year. The DOE's goal of 1 million electric vehicles sold by 2015 may be ambitious, as past projections have been optimistic. The Administration remains committed to this pledge, with the FY2013 budget focusing on meeting the electrification goal. Factors like battery cost, currently around $500/kWh for Li-ion batteries, will impact the development of a domestic advanced battery industry. The cost of Li-ion batteries is around $500/kWh, with the 16kWh Volt battery costing $8,000 and the 24kWh Leaf battery costing $12,000. The U.S. Advanced Battery Consortium aims for $250/kWh in the mid-term and $100/kWh in the long term. Electric vehicles need frequent recharging, with Level 1 charging taking over 12 hours and Level 2 charging requiring six hours or more. Level 3 charging stations can charge a vehicle in 30 minutes. Electric vehicles have a shorter driving range compared to vehicles with internal combustion engines, which may deter some consumers from buying them. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that the Leaf can travel 73 miles before recharging, and the Volt, 37 miles. The availability of charging stations is also a concern, with 5,612 accessible to the public as of March 2013. ChargePoint and ECOtality announced a joint venture to make access to chargers easier for motorists. The Leaf can travel 73 miles before recharging, while the Volt can travel 37 miles. The Volt has a small gasoline tank that extends its total range to 379 miles. Ranges are affected by the use of heater or air-conditioning, as power for these accessories comes from the battery. Regenerative braking systems may help extend range. High gasoline prices could increase demand for fuel-efficient vehicles, including hybrids and electric vehicles. Low-cost vehicles with internal combustion engines offer fuel efficiency of 40 mpg or more, with the Toyota Prius hybrid rated at 51 mpg. Fuel-efficient cars with IC engines sell for $14,000 to $23,000. The most fuel-efficient cars with IC engines sell for $14,000 to $23,000, below the cost of the Volt or Leaf even with the $7,500 federal tax credit. Improved fuel efficiency in IC engines may reduce the appeal of electric vehicles. Other governments like Japan, South Korea, and China are also investing in Li-ion battery supply chains. Japan leads in advanced automobile battery manufacturing, while South Korea and China have ambitious plans for dominating the battery market in the next decade. European manufacturers are focusing on improving IC engines. European manufacturers are increasingly embracing electric vehicles, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel emphasizing the importance of electromobility. BMW, Daimler, and Volkswagen have electric vehicles ready for market. However, the poor performance of European auto sales post-recession has led to a reemphasis on conventional technology over electric vehicles. Without government intervention in the US in 2009, there would be little foundation in the Li-ion battery supply chain. Without government intervention in the US in 2009, there would be little foundation in the Li-ion battery supply chain. Automakers have increased capacity in the domestic battery supply chain, with nearly all offering electric vehicles. Sales of electric vehicles are still in their infancy, with a gap between the Administration's goal and consumer demand. GM and Nissan's electric vehicle sales have fallen short of forecasts. The United States faces obstacles in creating a significant electric vehicle industry due to international competition and lack of profitability in the near term. Additional government support and public education are needed to promote alternative fuel systems like hybrid and electric vehicles. Despite capacity exceeding current demand, a domestic battery industry may not be self-sustainable without federal support. The domestic battery industry may not be self-sustainable without federal support. Battery technology needs to advance further to address cost, range, and recharging issues. There is uncertainty if Li-ion batteries will be the ultimate solution, and policymakers should consider increasing federal R&D investments in innovative battery technologies. Advanced battery manufacturing is still an infant industry with uncertain technology and market potential. The development of the domestic battery industry in the United States is uncertain and heavily reliant on federal support for building a battery supply chain and advancing battery technologies."
