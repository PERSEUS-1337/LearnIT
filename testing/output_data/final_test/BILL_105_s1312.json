    "content": "The \"Child Passenger Protection Act\" may be cited as the short title of this Act. The Act includes findings related to child passenger safety. Congress finds that annual losses in the United States from motor vehicle collisions exceed 800 deaths and 80,000 injuries to children under 5. Properly used child restraints can reduce serious or fatal injuries by 69% for infants and 47% for children under 5. Common seating designs in vehicles make secure installation of child restraints difficult. Regional clinics show that 70-90% of child restraints are not installed correctly. There is a high rate of improper installation or misuse of child restraints, largely due to the complexity and variations in seat belt and child restraint designs. It is crucial to expand national, State, and local education programs to effectively educate the public on proper child restraint use. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\nChild restraint education program includes publication, audiovisual presentation, demonstration, or computerized program. Secretary refers to the Secretary of Transportation.
