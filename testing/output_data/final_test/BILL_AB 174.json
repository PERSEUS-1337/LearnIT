    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges the impact of the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act on increasing access to healthcare for previously uninsured Californians. There is a projected statewide physician shortfall of 17,000 for 2015, with the San Joaquin Valley being disproportionately affected due to its high population growth and cultural diversity. Access to healthcare in the valley is 31 percent lower than the rest of California. Several regions of the San Joaquin Valley are federally designated Medically Underserved Areas (MUAs) based on primary care physician ratio, infant mortality rate, poverty level, and elderly population percentage. The University of California Regents approved planning for a possible medical school at UC Merced to address physician shortages in California. UC Merced's potential School of Medicine and existing San Joaquin Valley Program in Medical Education aim to address physician shortages in California, particularly in underserved areas like the San Joaquin Valley. The programs also work to reduce health disparities, build relationships with local healthcare providers, and enhance healthcare in the region. PRIME provides students with hands-on experience in interdisciplinary healthcare in underserved communities, but lacks funding for current enrollment and expansion. It is crucial for California to support PRIME to address the healthcare needs of the San Joaquin Valley and potentially establish a medical school at UC Merced. The California General Fund appropriates $1,855,000 annually to the University of California for the expansion of the San Joaquin Valley PRIME program, allowing for up to 12 new students per year and a total of 48 participants across the four-year curriculum. The California General Fund appropriates $1 million to the University of California for a two-year planning effort to establish a traditional medical school at the University of California, Merced. The planning includes determining program components and submitting a report to the Legislature by March 1, 2019."
