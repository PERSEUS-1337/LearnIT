The Congress acknowledges the IPCC's findings that human emissions of greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide, are causing global climate change. IPCC estimates a 3.2-7.2 degree Fahrenheit temperature rise in the next century without significant carbon dioxide emission reductions. This increase could lead to adverse impacts like rising sea levels, extreme weather events, species extinction, and water scarcity. The US contributes nearly 24% of global carbon dioxide emissions, around six billion metric tons annually. To stabilize the earth's climate and prevent catastrophic global climate change, worldwide carbon dioxide emissions must be reduced by 80% by 2050. Implementing a tax on fossil fuels based on carbon content can help reduce emissions and generate revenue for various purposes such as decreasing taxes on low and middle-income taxpayers, funding research on alternative green energy sources, and supporting other domestic social priorities. SEC. 3. IMPOSITION OF CARBON TAX ON PRIMARY FOSSIL FUELS. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to add a new subchapter imposing a carbon tax on primary fossil fuels. A tax is imposed on taxable fuel based on carbon content, starting at $10 per ton and increasing annually. The rate freezes after the target attainment year. The tax on taxable fuel is based on carbon content, starting at $10 per ton and increasing annually. The amount in effect after the target attainment year is the same as the first year after the target attainment year. The target attainment year is when carbon dioxide emissions in the US do not exceed 20% of the 1990 levels. Taxable fuel includes coal, petroleum, and natural gas. The tax on taxable fuel is based on carbon content, starting at $10 per ton and increasing annually. Taxable fuel includes coal, petroleum, and natural gas that is extracted, manufactured, or produced in the United States or entered into the United States for consumption, use, or warehousing. Definitions for terms like 'United States', 'importer', and 'ton' are provided. No tax is imposed on the sale or exchange of taxable fuel for deposit in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is established under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. Special rules include only one tax imposed on a product, fractional ton tax calculation, and treating use as a sale by manufacturers. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is established under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. Special rules apply to manufacturers, producers, or importers of taxable fuel who use the fuel, making them liable for tax as if the fuel were sold by them. Inventory exchanges of taxable fuel are not treated as sales, and the other party in the exchange is treated as the seller for tax purposes. For tax purposes, inventory exchanges of taxable fuel do not require registration if both parties are registered as manufacturers, producers, or importers of taxable fuels. The receiving party must notify the seller of their registration number. Inventory exchanges of taxable fuel do not require registration if both parties are registered as manufacturers, producers, or importers of taxable fuels. The receiving party must notify the seller of their registration number and internal revenue district. Inventory exchange refers to exchanging property described in section 1221(a)(1). Refunds or credits may be available for taxable fuel used in the manufacture or production of another taxable fuel. A credit or refund can be allowed to a person who used taxable fuel in the manufacture of another substance that is also a taxable fuel. Regulations allow for a credit if carbon from the fuel is embedded or sequestered during the manufacturing process. A credit or refund may be allowed to a person for using taxable fuel in the manufacture of another taxable fuel if carbon is embedded or sequestered during the process. The amount of the credit or refund is based on the tax imposed on the fuel for that calendar year. The credit or refund cannot exceed the tax imposed on the fuel used in the manufacturing process. Exemption for exports of taxable fuels under subsection (h) allows tax-free sales by manufacturers or producers for export or resale for export by the purchaser to a second purchaser. Rules similar to section 4221(b) apply for proof of export. Credit or refund is available if tax was paid on the fuel and it was exported. The provision allows for a credit or refund of tax paid on fuel that was used in the manufacture of exported taxable fuel, provided certain conditions are met. The Secretary may allow a credit or refund of tax on exported taxable fuel under certain conditions, including the exporter providing required information and the person who paid the tax waiving their claim. Regulations will be prescribed to facilitate this process. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, shall conduct a study every 5 years on the environmental, economic, and revenue impacts of the carbon tax on primary fossil fuels. The results will be submitted to the relevant congressional committees. A clerical amendment will be made to the Internal Revenue Code to reflect this. The amendments for the carbon tax on primary fossil fuels will be effective on January 1, 2008."
