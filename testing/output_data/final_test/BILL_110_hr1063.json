    "content": "The \"Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act\" is cited as the short title. Title 18, United States Code, is amended to include a new chapter on transportation of minors in circumvention of certain laws relating to abortion. The \"Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act\" introduces regulations on transporting minors across state lines for abortions, aiming to prevent the circumvention of parental involvement laws. Offenders face fines or imprisonment for knowingly facilitating a minor's abortion without parental consent. The \"Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act\" prohibits minors from getting abortions in a different state without parental consent, except in cases where the minor's life is at risk due to a physical condition caused by the pregnancy. Transporting a minor for abortion in violation of this law will not result in prosecution of the minor or her parents. The \"Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act\" provides an affirmative defense for a defendant if they reasonably believed that parental consent or notification had taken place before a minor's abortion, based on information obtained directly from the minor's parent. The \"Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act\" allows a minor to procure an abortion if a court in their state waived parental notification. Parents can seek civil action for violations, except in cases of incest. Definitions include abortion as the intentional termination of pregnancy. The \"Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act\" allows minors to have abortions without parental involvement in certain cases, such as ectopic pregnancies or spontaneous abortions. Parental involvement laws require notification or consent from a parent before a minor can have an abortion, with no alternative options. The term 'minor' refers to an individual who is below the maximum age requiring parental notification or consent for abortion. The term 'parent' includes a parent, guardian, legal custodian, or a person designated by the law requiring parental involvement in the minor's abortion decision. The term 'State' encompasses the District of Columbia. Sec. 2432 addresses the transportation of minors across state lines for abortion in cases of incest, with penalties of fines or imprisonment. The terms 'State', 'minor', and 'abortion' are defined in section 2435. SEC. 3. CHILD INTERSTATE ABORTION NOTIFICATION. Title 18, United States Code, amended with CHAPTER 117B--CHILD INTERSTATE ABORTION NOTIFICATION. Child interstate abortion notification requires physicians to provide 24 hours notice to a parent before performing an abortion on a minor from a different state. Failure to comply can result in fines or imprisonment. Exceptions to the notification requirement for child interstate abortion include parental involvement laws in the state, court waivers, and declarations of abuse by the minor. The physician must notify authorities of child abuse or neglect, or a parent if the abortion is necessary to save the minor's life. The parent of a minor seeking an abortion must be physically present or provide documentation proving parentage. Parents can take civil action for harm caused by a violation, except in cases of incest. Abortion is defined as intentionally terminating a pregnancy for reasons other than live birth or preserving the child's life. The term 'actual notice' means written notice given in person by the physician or their agent. 'Constructive notice' is notice given by certified mail with delivery deemed to occur 48 hours after mailing. 'Law requiring parental involvement in a minor's abortion decision' refers to a law that mandates parental consent for a minor's abortion. A minor's abortion decision law requires parental notification or consent before the procedure, with no alternative options. A minor is defined as an individual under 18 years old who is not emancipated. The term \"parent\" includes a parent, guardian, legal custodian, or person standing in loco parentis. The term \"physician\" in the context of a minor's abortion decision law refers to a doctor of medicine authorized to practice in the state or any other person legally allowed to perform an abortion. The term \"State\" includes the District of Columbia, commonwealths, possessions, territories of the United States, and Indian tribes or reservations. SEC. 4. CLERICAL AMENDMENT. The table of chapters in title 18, United States Code, is amended to include new items related to transportation of minors in circumvention of abortion laws and child interstate abortion notification. SEC. 5. SEVERABILITY AND EFFECTIVE DATE. The provisions of this Act are severable, and if any provision is found unconstitutional, it will not affect the rest of the Act. The Act and its amendments will take effect 45 days after enactment."
