    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\" is a condensed summary of the section title and findings. The \"Congressional Foreign Travel Reform Act of 2010\" governs procedures for foreign travel by members of Congress and their staffs. A recent CRS memorandum highlights the lack of disclosure requirements for international travel by Congress members, making it difficult to assess the amount spent on foreign travel. The lack of disclosure requirements for Congressional foreign travel raises concerns about accuracy and reliability in reporting expenditures, destinations, and participants. This could impact the suitability and reliability of data on the number of trips, travelers, and destinations. In April 2010, Roll Call reported that State Department accommodations for congressional travel are billed back to a government account with no spending limit. The Wall Street Journal also noted in March 2010 that unused per diem for congressional travel is rarely paid back, and the Official Foreign Travel Guide for the U.S. Congress allows members to keep excess funds from a per diem allowance. The House of Representatives significantly increased spending on foreign travel from 1994 to 2009, with costs nearly doubling since 2006. Members of Congress have been failing to report millions of dollars in expenses on foreign trips, leading to a substantial rise in total spending over the past decade. Congress must now obtain and pay for local currencies for per diems on official foreign travel. Congress may obtain local currencies for per diems on official foreign travel for Members, officers, and employees with proper authorization. Members, officers, and employees of Congress can receive local currencies for per diems on official foreign travel with authorization from specific officials. The amount provided is limited. Members, officers, and employees of Congress can receive local currencies for per diems on official foreign travel with a limit of $75 per day per person or the maximum per diem allowance for US Government employees. Unused amounts must be repaid. Members, officers, and employees of Congress can receive local currencies for per diems on official foreign travel with a limit of $75 per day per person or the maximum per diem allowance for US Government employees. Any unexpended amount must be returned and transferred to the Secretary of the Treasury for deficit reduction. Authorization of appropriations is provided for obtaining local currencies under this subsection. Authorization is given for obtaining local currencies for per diems on official foreign travel for Members, officers, and employees of Congress. The maximum per diem allowance is $75 per day per person. Unused amounts must be returned for deficit reduction. Definitions for \"Member\" and \"official foreign travel\" are provided in this subsection. The text chunk discusses amendments to the Mutual Security Act of 1954 related to Congressional foreign travel. It repeals existing authority and maintains reporting requirements under the Congressional Foreign Travel Reform Act of 2010. The effective date for these changes is fiscal year 2011 and onwards.
