    "content": "Under current federal law, social media users may face barriers when suing a platform for content decisions due to the state action requirement of the First Amendment and Section 230 of the CDA providing immunity to service providers. Federal law does not currently provide a recourse for users challenging social media sites' content decisions due to Section 230 immunity and the First Amendment's limitation to government action. The Supreme Court has allowed First Amendment claims against private parties in limited circumstances, such as in Marsh v. Alabama where the Court extended the First Amendment to a company-owned town. The Supreme Court extended the First Amendment to a company-owned town in Marsh v. Alabama, stating that the public has an identical interest in the functioning of the community. This decision has been limited to the facts of the case but was extended in 1968 in Amalgamated Food Employees Union v. Logan Valley Plaza, where a private shopping mall could not restrict individuals' fundamental liberties. In Logan Valley Plaza, the Supreme Court disclaimed its previous decision in Marsh v. Alabama, stating that private shopping centers are not the functional equivalent of a municipality. The Court held that the constitutional guarantee of free expression does not apply in cases where shopping center managers restrict picketers from entering the premises for advertising purposes. The Court in Logan Valley Plaza distinguished the distribution of handbills from the company town in Marsh, stating that private shopping centers do not perform municipal functions. The fact that a shopping center is open to the public does not automatically grant First Amendment rights. The Court has applied the First Amendment against private parties with a close relationship to the government, such as those subject to extensive state regulation. The Supreme Court has applied the First Amendment against private parties subject to extensive state regulation, requiring a close nexus between the State and the regulated entity. This was seen in a 2001 case involving a state athletic association, deemed subject to First Amendment standards due to its entwinement with public institutions. Plaintiffs have argued that internet companies, including social media sites, should be treated as state actors under the First Amendment when restricting speech, but courts have rejected these claims. Lower courts have held that social media sites do not meet the \"exclusive public function test\" and are not considered state actors subject to First Amendment scrutiny. Simply providing a platform for public use does not make them subject to the First Amendment. The court in Cyber Promotions v. American Online (AOL) rejected the argument that AOL's provision of Internet e-mail constituted a public function. The challengers claimed AOL performed an exclusive public function, but the court disagreed, stating that simply connecting to the Internet did not make AOL a state actor subject to First Amendment scrutiny. The court rejected the argument that AOL performed an exclusive public function by providing Internet e-mail, stating that the company had alternative avenues to send advertising to members. In another case, Google's restriction of access to videos on YouTube did not constitute a state action. Trial courts have also found social networks did not meet the criteria for state action. Lower courts have consistently ruled that the government's involvement was not present in cases involving social media sites like Yelp and AOL, as the state did not participate in the specific actions challenged in the lawsuits. The courts emphasized that the government's use of these websites for communication with citizens did not constitute state action, as they were used in the same manner as other users. Lower courts have ruled that the First Amendment does not prevent social media providers from restricting users' content. Legal commentators argue that social media platforms could be viewed as state actors in certain functions. Social media users have brought various claims challenging content decisions, such as unfair competition and discrimination. Many lawsuits against online platforms are barred by Section 230 of the CDA, which grants broad immunity. This section distinguishes between \"interactive computer services\" and \"information content providers,\" with platforms like Facebook and Twitter considered as the former. Section 230 of the CDA grants immunity to interactive computer service providers like Facebook and Twitter. It distinguishes between interactive service providers and information content providers, stating that they cannot be held liable for content provided by others. The section also allows providers to restrict access to objectionable material in good faith. It preempts state civil lawsuits and criminal prosecutions that are inconsistent with its provisions. Section 230 of the CDA provides immunity to interactive computer service providers, distinguishing between content creators and access providers. It exempts certain federal civil lawsuits but not criminal prosecutions. The immunity does not apply in cases related to intellectual property or sex trafficking violations. The critical factor for immunity under Section 230(c)(1) is whether the service provider developed the content in question. Courts have ruled that providers can be liable if they also act as content creators. The application of Section 230(c)(1) immunity depends on whether the interactive computer service provider was merely a publisher or creator of content. Courts have held that a site's ability to control posted content does not make it an internet content provider. Making small editorial changes does not negate immunity. A \"website operator\" can be liable for content they create. Courts have applied a \"material contribution test\" to determine if a service provider is liable for content they create or develop. Section 230 immunity may not apply if the provider augments the content, as seen in a case involving Snapchat where CDA immunity was not granted due to a graphic overlay created by the company. The plaintiff's claim proceeded because they sought to hold Snapchat accountable for its own conduct. The federal appellate court ruled that Roommates.com could be sued for discrimination as it required users to provide personal information and preferences, making it more than just a passive transmitter of information. The court ruled that Roommates.com could be held liable for discrimination as it was involved in developing user information on personal pages, making it more than just a passive transmitter of information. Section 230(c)(1) applies broadly to holding providers liable as publishers, while Section 230(c)(2) applies to voluntary actions to restrict access to objectionable content. Section 230(c)(2) requires service providers to act in good faith for immunity, unlike Section 230(c)(1). Courts may not dismiss lawsuits involving the good-faith requirement, as it creates a question of fact. Allegations of selective enforcement or pretextual policies can lead to claims of lack of good faith. Google was accused of bad faith for falsely accusing a company of policy violations and trying to punish them for refusing to allow advertising in their videos. Section 230(c)(2) requires good faith actions for immunity, while Section 230(c)(1) applies when providers refrain from filtering content. Interpreting Section 230(c)(1) to bar suits for removing content would undermine the specific immunity in (c)(2). The court emphasized that (c)(2) only immunizes actions taken in good faith, making it necessary to distinguish between the two sections. The Court distinguishes between Section 230(c)(1) and Section 230(c)(2) immunity in lawsuits challenging content removal decisions by websites. While (c)(1) applies to filtering content, (c)(2) requires good faith actions for immunity. This distinction is not always clear-cut in court decisions, with some cases applying (c)(1) immunity to bar suits based on content restriction decisions. Section 230(c)(2)(B) provides immunity for providers who offer technical means to restrict access to objectionable material, such as adware and malware filters. This immunity is separate from Section 230(c)(1) and offers broad protection to interactive computer service providers. It shields them from liability for publishing or not publishing user-generated content. Section 230 provides immunity for social media sites from liability for hosting content and for restricting access to objectionable material. Lawsuits holding these platforms liable for user content decisions have been largely barred under Section 230. Courts have dismissed such lawsuits citing the First Amendment or Section 230(c)(2) of the CDA. Section 230(c)(1) may prevent lawsuits holding social media platforms liable for content decisions. Federal and state laws do not govern how these platforms present user content, leaving moderation policies as the primary regulation. Calls for federal regulation aim to protect users' speech while requiring platforms to manage certain content. A federal law regulating internet content decisions could be considered state action. A law regulating internet content decisions would likely qualify as state action under the First Amendment. Social media platforms may raise First Amendment objections to laws regulating their own speech. They may argue that their content moderation decisions are protected speech rights. The First Amendment allows for some regulation of speech and conduct, not every government regulation on social media content is analyzed the same way. Courts consider factors like the nature of the action being regulated and whether it is speech or conduct. Laws targeting conduct with incidental speech burdens may be permissible, as speech can be difficult to identify. Lower courts have recognized that computer code and programs may be protected under the First Amendment. Computer code and programs may be entitled to First Amendment protection if they communicate information comprehensible to humans. Domain names could also be considered protected speech. The Supreme Court has stated that inherently expressive conduct can receive First Amendment protections. Courts analyze the type of speech being regulated to determine the level of scrutiny. Commercial speech, like advertisements on social media, receives less protection than political advocacy. Certain categories of speech receive even less protection than commercial speech. Certain types of threatening or violent speech posted on social media may not be entitled to First Amendment protection, as states may prohibit speech advocating violence if it incites imminent lawless action. The Court has held that criminal statutes targeting disfavored speech must include a mental state requirement to determine protected speech. For example, in United States v. X-Citement Video, criminal liability for distributing child pornography depended on the age of the performers, impacting First Amendment protection for materials involving persons over the age of 17. The Supreme Court has ruled that laws targeting certain types of speech must include a mental state requirement to protect First Amendment rights. In a case involving child pornography, the Court held that distributing materials involving persons over the age of 17 is protected unless the distributor knew the performers were underage. Additionally, the Court found a federal statute prohibiting sexually explicit images that appear to depict minors to be unconstitutionally overbroad. The Court ruled that a statute violated the First Amendment by restricting speech that was not obscene or child pornography. The regulation's nature is crucial, as content-based laws are subject to strict scrutiny. Content-neutral regulations undergo intermediate scrutiny. When analyzing restrictions on speech, a court applies intermediate scrutiny to determine if the restriction is narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest and allows for alternative channels of communication. In Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Corley, government restrictions on decryption computer programs were deemed permissible content-neutral regulations. Content-based laws are subject to strict scrutiny, while content-neutral regulations undergo intermediate scrutiny. In Universal City Studios, Inc., the court determined that government regulations targeting the functional aspects of computer code were content-neutral. The Court has also stated that laws regulating speech may still be considered content-neutral, such as restrictions on sound trucks in residential areas. Each medium of expression must be evaluated for First Amendment purposes based on its unique characteristics. The Court has extended First Amendment protections to new mediums like video games and the internet, but recognizes the need for different standards in these contexts. Social media is seen as the modern public square, but regulations for government oversight are unclear, especially regarding platforms hosting others' speech. In Reno v. ACLU, the Supreme Court stated that factors justifying greater regulation of other media do not apply to the internet. In Reno v. ACLU, the Supreme Court found unconstitutional provisions of the CDA that regulated indecent material on the internet, stating that the internet is not subject to the same level of government regulation as broadcast media. The Court emphasized that the internet is a vast democratic forum that does not require the same level of scrutiny under the First Amendment. Some scholars argue that Reno v. ACLU, decided in 1997, does not specifically address government regulation of modern social media sites. Social media sites act as platforms for user-generated content, making decisions on hosting and presentation. The question of whether these editorial functions are protected speech under the First Amendment is complex. Entities that exercise editorial discretion in selecting which speech to transmit may receive First Amendment protection, while those that transmit content indiscriminately may not be considered First Amendment speakers. Some argue that social media sites' publication decisions may not be protected under the First Amendment if they transmit all users' speech indiscriminately. Academic debate has focused on whether search engines' algorithms qualify for First Amendment protection, with one scholar suggesting that search engines communicate content and therefore deserve protection. Another scholar disagrees, stating that indexing search results does not equate to communicating protected ideas. Court decisions on this matter are limited. The limited court decisions evaluating whether social media sites exercising free speech rights by reprinting, organizing, or editing protected speech are not precedential beyond the facts of those cases due to Section 230 of the CDA, which often prevents lawsuits holding social media providers liable for publishing others' content. Section 230 is seen as an attempt to protect freedom of speech on the internet. Section 230 is seen as protecting freedom of speech on the internet by providing immunity even beyond the scope of the First Amendment. Scholars have analyzed whether social media sites' publication decisions are protected by the First Amendment through various frameworks, such as treating them as state actors bound by the First Amendment when regulating speech. Social media sites can be viewed through different frameworks for regulation, such as common carriers or news editors. The analogy used will depend on the specific activities being regulated, as some platforms exercise more editorial control than others. The First Amendment generally applies only to government action, but in special cases, private actors may need to comply with constitutional standards. Courts have ruled that social media providers do not meet the First Amendment's state action requirement, but there are arguments suggesting otherwise based on Supreme Court dicta. Some argue that Supreme Court dicta imply social media sites should be treated differently, citing Marsh's suggestion that privately owned property open to the public may be subject to the First Amendment. This could mean online forums should be regulated similarly to public facilities. Marsh suggests that online forums should be treated as the \"functional equivalent\" of traditional public forums in a First Amendment analysis. However, courts have generally rejected this idea, stating that public access to a private space does not automatically grant First Amendment protections. Another scholar argues that social media sites should be considered as performing a \"public function\" under Marsh, despite the narrower interpretation of the public function exception. Social media sites are argued to perform a \"public function\" by providing a forum for public communication and expression, traditionally done by the government. However, trial courts have not extended this view, disagreeing that social media sites exclusively serve public functions. Some suggest a shift in state action analysis based on the Packingham v. North Carolina case. The Court's decision in Packingham v. North Carolina struck down a law prohibiting a sex offender from accessing social networking sites, stating that social media is the modern public square protected by the First Amendment. This may lead to a shift in state action analysis regarding social media companies as state actors for First Amendment purposes. Justice Alito expressed concerns about the broad language used in the Packingham case, suggesting that it could be misinterpreted to limit the government's ability to regulate online activities of dangerous individuals. However, a court noted that Packingham did not address whether private social media companies like YouTube should be considered state actors under the First Amendment. If social media sites were treated as state actors under the First Amendment, Congress could enact legislation to remedy violations of free speech rights by these entities. For example, Title III of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 authorizes the Attorney General to bring civil actions against facilities that deny equal access based on race, color, religion, or national origin. Similarly, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 allows individuals deprived of rights secured by the Constitution to bring civil actions to vindicate those rights. Under this framework, social media sites hosting too much speech could exacerbate problems like misinformation and hate speech. If these companies were considered state actors, their ability to regulate speech would be limited, as would the government's ability to require platforms to take down certain content. This could result in all but the very basest speech being explicitly allowed and protected, potentially worsening issues with online hate speech, bullying, and terrorism. The First Amendment question arises when federal regulation infringes on speech attributed to social media sites, potentially including their editorial decisions. State and local governments are constrained by the First Amendment, but it is unclear if they can assert First Amendment rights against the federal government. One scholar argues for protection of government speech in certain circumstances, while the Supreme Court has ruled that a private party cannot force a state to include certain messages in its own speech. The Supreme Court has ruled that a private party cannot force a state to include certain messages in its own speech, indicating that governments have the right to speak for themselves. Justice Stewart argued that the government has no First Amendment rights, suggesting that treating social media sites as state actors could strip them of their own First Amendment rights. Lower courts have followed this view, assuming that state actors cannot claim First Amendment protection. Alternatively, courts could compare social media sites to industries like broadcast media, where greater regulation of protected speech is allowed. The common law doctrines related to common carriers historically subject carriers to heightened legal duties and restrictions on refusing paying customers. Modern regulations treat providers of telecommunications services as common carriers, allowing for government regulation of communications industries. While these companies have First Amendment rights, the Supreme Court has permitted some regulation in light of government interests. The Supreme Court has permitted some regulation of telecommunications providers as common carriers, allowing for government oversight in light of government interests. In Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, the Court approved the FCC's \"fairness doctrine\" requiring broadcasters to provide political candidates with a reasonable opportunity to respond to personal attacks or endorsements. The Supreme Court upheld regulations on broadcasters endorsing or opposing candidates, citing the unique nature of the broadcast industry and the public's right to receive diverse ideas. The Court emphasized the viewers' rights over the broadcasters' freedom of speech. The Supreme Court upheld regulations on broadcasters endorsing or opposing candidates, emphasizing the public's right to diverse ideas in broadcasting. The Court recognized that broadcasting has limited First Amendment protection and that broadcasters engage in protected speech when exercising editorial discretion. The Supreme Court gives great weight to Congress and the FCC's decisions when evaluating broadcasters' First Amendment claims. However, this special deference does not extend to other forms of media, as seen in the case of Turner Broadcasting Systems v. FCC regarding cable television regulation. The Court concluded that cable television should not be subject to the same \"less rigorous\" First Amendment scrutiny as broadcast regulation. The Supreme Court distinguishes cable television from broadcast media in terms of First Amendment scrutiny. While cable is not subject to the same level of scrutiny as broadcast, the Court recognizes unique problems in cable that may justify certain restrictions. The Court has applied a lower level of scrutiny to regulations concerning cable due to its special characteristics. The Supreme Court applies different levels of scrutiny to regulations on cable television compared to broadcast media, citing unique characteristics of cable that may justify restrictions. The Court has sometimes interpreted this to mean that certain regulations on cable TV receive less scrutiny than those affecting speech in traditional public forums. The Court upheld the FCC's must-carry provisions using intermediate scrutiny, but the specific rationale remains unclear. The Court applied intermediate scrutiny to the must-carry provisions for cable television, considering them as content-neutral restrictions that do not depend on the content of the programming. The decision to use intermediate scrutiny may have been based on the unique characteristics of the cable medium rather than a broader First Amendment principle. The Supreme Court has ruled that the internet is not subject to the same level of government regulation as broadcast media, citing differences in invasiveness and scarcity of expression. This led to the conclusion that the factors justifying regulation of broadcast media do not apply to the internet. Several legal scholars argue that the internet should be subject to greater regulation similar to broadcast media, despite the Supreme Court's ruling in Reno that the internet is not subject to the same level of government regulation. They believe that the internet has replicated the speech-hierarchy of broadcasting, with a few commercial giants dominating user attention and speech mediums, creating scarcity. The internet has become more invasive in everyday life, similar to television and radio. Search engines and social media sites exercise editorial discretion over user-generated content. In Zhang v. Baidu.com, Inc., a lower court rejected arguments that Baidu violated federal regulations. In Zhang v. Baidu.com, Inc., the plaintiffs accused the Chinese search engine of violating civil rights laws by blocking information on the Democracy movement in China. Baidu claimed First Amendment protection for its search result decisions. The court ruled in favor of Baidu, stating that the First Amendment shielded the search engine from the lawsuit as it sought to punish Baidu for favoring certain political expression in its search results. The court in Zhang v. Baidu.com, Inc. ruled that the search engine was protected by the First Amendment from a lawsuit accusing it of blocking information on the Democracy movement in China. The court found that Baidu was not just a conduit for others' speech and that penalizing it for its search results would not be content-neutral. This case suggests that treating social media sites like broadcast media or cable providers could lead to more government regulation of social media platforms. A court may consider whether social media platforms, like cable companies or broadcast media, have characteristics that justify regulations. This includes examining if they have monopoly power, scarcity issues, or invasive qualities that warrant government intervention to increase information availability. Courts may approve regulations for social media sites if they pose problems for communication, especially if the regulations are content-neutral. Lower courts are likely to follow Reno in applying First Amendment scrutiny to the internet. The analogy of a newspaper editor may be used to analyze whether social media platforms moderating content are exercising protected speech rights. In Co. v. Tornillo, the Supreme Court ruled that newspapers have the right to exercise editorial control and judgment, including deciding what content to publish, which is protected by the First Amendment. The case involved a state law that required newspapers to allow political candidates to respond to criticism, which the newspaper argued violated their free speech rights. The government defended the law as necessary to ensure fairness and accuracy in a marketplace dominated by a few news outlets. The Supreme Court unanimously rejected the argument that state laws requiring newspapers to print replies from political candidates ensured fairness and accuracy. The Court ruled that such laws violated the First Amendment by interfering with the editorial control and judgment of newspapers. The state law imposed penalties on newspapers based on content and infringed on the function of editors. The Supreme Court has recognized First Amendment protection for editorial judgments, stating that compelling a private corporation to provide a forum for views other than its own may infringe on freedom of speech. This protection extends to public broadcasters and utility companies in their selection and presentation of content. The Supreme Court has upheld First Amendment rights for private entities, such as utility companies, by ruling that they cannot be compelled to grant access to entities with differing views. This was seen in cases like Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, where private parade organizers were allowed to exclude certain groups despite state antidiscrimination laws. The Supreme Court ruled in Hurley v. GLIB that private parade organizers have the right to exclude certain groups, even if it violates state antidiscrimination laws. The Court held that parades qualify as protected expression under the First Amendment, allowing organizers to select participants as a form of protected activity. In Hurley v. GLIB, the Supreme Court ruled that private parade organizers have the right to exclude certain groups, even if it violates state antidiscrimination laws. The Court emphasized that parades are protected expression under the First Amendment, allowing organizers to choose participants as a form of protected activity. The Court rejected the argument that the parade organizers were merely conduits for speech, stating that their participation indicated support for the message presented. The Court compared cable programming to a newspaper, emphasizing the distinction between individual segments and the overall message of a parade. The Supreme Court has rejected applying Tornillo in cases where compelling a private entity to grant access to third parties would not impact the entity's own speech, as seen in PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins. In a suit brought by students, the California Supreme Court ruled that PruneYard's actions violated state law by allowing the students to conduct their activity on the property. PruneYard argued that this violated their free speech rights as private property owners. The Court disagreed, stating that PruneYard could disavow any connection with the speech and that the public's views would not likely be associated with the owner. The Court distinguished this case from Tornillo in Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc. In the case of Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc. (FAIR), a group of law schools challenged the Solomon Amendment, which required equal access for military recruiters on campus. The schools argued that this violated their First Amendment rights by compelling them to assist in recruiting. The Court ruled that the Solomon Amendment primarily regulated conduct and only incidentally compelled speech, such as recruiting assistance. The Court ruled in Rumsfeld v. FAIR that law schools must allow military recruiters on campus, stating that accommodating the military's message does not affect the schools' speech. The decision to bar recruiters was not inherently expressive, and schools remained free to disagree with the military's policies. Several federal trial courts have applied this ruling to protect search engines' editorial judgment under the First Amendment. Search engines exercise editorial judgment protected by the First Amendment when deciding how to present websites or advertisements in search results. Courts have ruled that holding search engines accountable for their editorial judgments violates the First Amendment. Some scholars argue that search engine results are protected speech because search engines make editorial judgments. Search engines exercise editorial judgment protected by the First Amendment when deciding how to present websites or advertisements in search results. Some scholars argue that search engine results are protected speech because they make editorial judgments, which is constitutionally protected speech. However, others argue that search results may not be protected under the First Amendment if they are automated and experienced as 'objective', as their dominant function is to channel users to websites rather than express meaning. The court in Zhang stated that the creation and dissemination of information, even if factual, is considered speech under the First Amendment. The First Amendment protects editorial judgment in search engine results, as they involve making subjective decisions about presenting information. Social media sites, like search engines, also engage in protected speech by making editorial judgments on what information to display. The Supreme Court's decision in FAIR suggests that allowing third parties to use platforms may not always express a particular view. Content presentation decisions on social media sites may not be seen as expressive, as users are unlikely to attribute speech to the sites. The Supreme Court's decisions on extending First Amendment protection to groups hosting others' speech depend on whether listeners would attribute the speech to the host. Courts may be less likely to protect social media sites' content decisions if third parties wouldn't attribute users' speech to the sites themselves. The attribution of user-generated content to social media platforms will vary depending on the platform and its activities. Platforms that aggregate or alter user content may be seen as expressing the platforms' speech. When social media platforms aggregate or alter user-generated content, courts may consider it as the platforms' speech. The way content is presented can influence whether viewers perceive it as individual segments or as contributing to a common theme. If a site aggregates content into a single story, it may be seen as more than just a conduit for others' speech. On the other hand, if a site publishes all user content without restrictions, users' views may not be attributed to the platform owner. Social media sites, if considered equivalent to newspaper editors, would have their editorial decisions protected by the First Amendment. Government regulations that restrict social media sites' autonomy to choose the content they transmit may be subject to strict scrutiny. Such regulations must further a compelling interest and be narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. The government may regulate speech to address extraordinary problems with appropriately tailored regulations. Even in a traditional public forum, reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions on speech are allowed. The government can regulate speech with tailored regulations to address specific issues, but cannot restrict speech solely because it may be annoying to some individuals. Federal regulation of social media platforms may raise constitutional concerns if it targets speech or content decisions. Lower courts have ruled that search engines making decisions on search results are engaging in speech-related activities. Search engines and social media sites exercise editorial functions protected as speech under the First Amendment. Congress's ability to regulate social media companies' decisions on users' content would be limited. Regulation of commercial speech like advertisements may face lower scrutiny. Certain categories of speech, like obscene or defamatory, can be more easily regulated for the social interest in order and morality. The government may violate the First Amendment by engaging in content or viewpoint discrimination within certain categories of speech, such as libel critical of the government. Criminal liability laws may require a mental state requirement for speech like obscenity. Content-neutral regulations on the time, place, or manner of protected speech must be narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest. The government must ensure that regulations on the time, place, or manner of protected speech are narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest, even if they impose only an incidental burden on speech. The Supreme Court has upheld regulations under intermediate scrutiny when they are content-neutral and further an important governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of free expression. The Court upheld the Solomon Amendment under intermediate scrutiny, stating it regulated conduct not inherently expressive and only incidentally burdened speech. Special characteristics of social media may justify heightened regulation, with courts potentially upholding such regulations. No courts have addressed this issue to date. No courts have found special justifications for new regulations on social media providers. Congress must consider how any new regulation would align with Section 230 of the CDA, which grants immunity to service providers for content created by users and for restricting access to objectionable content. New regulations may conflict with Section 230, subjecting social media providers to liability. Courts are hesitant to imply that new statutes repeal prior laws unless there is an irreconcilable conflict or the latter act covers the whole subject of the earlier one. If new regulations conflict with Section 230 of the CDA, Congress may need to clarify the relationship between the two. Creating an express exception from Section 230 would require defining the scope of liability for specific activities. The trial court decision ruled that an internet service provider could be sued for libel as a \"publisher\" of defamatory statements posted by a third party on its moderated message boards. Congress later sought to overturn this decision by specifying that providers of interactive computer services should not be treated as publishers. This provision was interpreted to protect providers from liability for various legal claims, not just defamation suits. Section 230, enacted in 1996, provides broad immunity for internet service providers from various legal claims, not just defamation suits. It is considered crucial for the development of the modern internet, with one scholar stating it has created significant value. Congress may consider modifying this immunity, but it is important to understand how it currently operates and why it was established."
