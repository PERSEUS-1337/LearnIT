It amends the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act to modernize the role of clearinghouses in healthcare. The Act promotes patient access to healthcare information, including real-world outcomes and economic data, in a convenient and non-burdensome manner. It aims to update policies and develop technology solutions to support access to information related to care. The Act aims to provide patient access to healthcare information, develop patient engagement tools based on outcomes data, and promote transparency in the use of health information by clearinghouses. The Act aims to promote transparency in the use of health information by clearinghouses. The Secretary shall not consider health care clearinghouses engaging in certain functions as business associates under HIPAA, but rather as covered entities for all purposes. Clearinghouses are not considered business associates for data translation purposes. The Act promotes transparency in health information use by clearinghouses. Clearinghouses must be certified for data accuracy and security. They are authorized for treatment, quality improvement, research, and public health efforts. The clearinghouse is allowed to use and disclose protected health information without individual authorization for various purposes, including treatment, payment, operations, research, public health, and creating de-identified information. The health care clearinghouse is authorized to provide access to an individual's protected health information as described in subsection (d) and all covered entities, including a health care clearinghouse, are permitted to access protected health information on behalf of covered individuals. The health care clearinghouse can disclose protected health information for operations purposes without considering the recipient's relationship with the individual. Covered entities can also benchmark their operations upon request. The covered entity can use and disclose protected health information for benchmarking against other entities and for clinical trial recruitment with opt-in consent. The covered entity can use protected health information for benchmarking and clinical trial recruitment with opt-in consent, but must have a prior relationship with the individual before contacting them for clinical trials. This does not expand the authority for marketing purposes. The Secretary allows health care clearinghouses to aggregate protected health information for HIPAA-related provisions. The health care clearinghouse can aggregate protected health information without individual authorization for specific functions. Reports provided to third parties must only include de-identified data. The health care clearinghouse can aggregate protected health information without individual authorization for specific functions, subject to a qualifying data use agreement. Individuals have the right to access claims and payment records in HIPAA standard format, with the clearinghouse permitted to charge a reasonable fee for providing such records. The health care clearinghouse must provide a comprehensive record of an individual's protected health information upon request, unless deemed technologically infeasible. The clearinghouse can aggregate information from various sources with permission, and may charge a reasonable fee for providing records. The health care clearinghouse can purchase an individual's protected health information from other clearinghouses with permission, and may charge a fair market value fee. Breach notification and individual rights regulations apply if the clearinghouse has direct interaction with the individual. The clearinghouse must notify the covered entity of any breach of unsecured protected health information involving direct interaction with the individual. Breach reporting is not required if the information is made unreadable to unauthorized persons. Additionally, the clearinghouse must display a notice of privacy practices on its website. This section does not grant clearinghouses exclusive rights or greater authority over protected health information than other covered entities. The Health Care Clearinghouse must notify the covered entity of any breach of protected health information. Existing agreements conflicting with HIPAA regulations are not legally binding. Only the clearinghouse can be held liable for violations, not the covered entity providing data. Enforcement follows Section 13410(a)(2). Enforcement of HIPAA regulations follows Section 13410(a)(2) and is applicable to this section. State laws prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts are not preempted by HIPAA. Definitions include 'de-identified' health information. The curr_chunk defines terms related to health information, fair market value, health care clearinghouse, and HIPAA-related provisions. The curr_chunk defines terms related to protected health information, including the meaning of \"individual\" and \"qualifying data use agreement\" for disclosures under specific regulations.
