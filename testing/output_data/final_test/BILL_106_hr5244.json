The \"Tribal-State Tax Fairness Act of 2000\" defines \"covered State tax\" as a non-discriminatory tax on purchases of tobacco products or motor fuels from a tribal retail enterprise by nonmembers of a tribe. \"Indian country\" includes lands within Indian reservations and those held in trust for Federally recognized tribes or individuals. The \"Tribal-State Tax Fairness Act of 2000\" defines terms such as \"Indian tribe,\" \"person,\" \"Secretary,\" and \"Service\" in relation to tribal retail enterprises and governmental powers. The \"Tribal-State Tax Fairness Act of 2000\" defines terms related to tribal retail enterprises, including \"tribal retail enterprise\" and \"tribal-state agreement.\" A tribal retail enterprise is a store in Indian country selling tobacco products or motor fuels, owned by a person or Indian tribe. A tribal-state agreement is a compact between a State and an Indian tribe regarding State taxes on these products. The \"Tribal-State Tax Fairness Act of 2000\" outlines the applicability of the Act to covered State taxes and the collection process through State petitions. The Act does not apply if a State law exempts tax collection, if the tax falls on a tribe or its members, or if the tax is preempted by Federal law. It only applies to taxes due after the enactment date. The Tribal-State Tax Fairness Act of 2000 addresses the collection and remittance of covered State taxes by tribal retail enterprises. The Secretary determines compliance with State tax laws or tribal-State agreements. Non-compliance results in direction to collect and remit taxes to the Secretary. The Secretary collects State taxes monthly by the 15th day after collection. If a tribal-State agreement exists for a tribal retail enterprise, the amount of taxes remitted cannot exceed the agreement terms, even if the agreement is no longer in effect. The Secretary collects State taxes monthly by the 15th day after collection. If a tribal-State agreement exists for a tribal retail enterprise, the amount of taxes remitted cannot exceed the agreement terms, even if the agreement is no longer in effect. In the absence of a tribal-State agreement, the Secretary consults with the State to determine the appropriate amount of covered State taxes to be remitted based on sales to nontribal members at the tribal retail enterprise. If necessary, mediation with the Service is conducted to establish the remittance amount. The Secretary consults with the Service to mediate between the Indian tribe and the State to determine the appropriate amount of taxes to be remitted. The Service must complete the mediation within 180 days and provide their determination to the Secretary. This determination is used by the Secretary to establish the remittance amount, unless a tribal-State agreement specifies otherwise for a tribal retail enterprise. The enterprise does not remit covered State taxes collected from tribal members on tobacco products and motor fuels. The Secretary must return the balance of taxes collected to the State fund specified by the Governor within 30 days. Before returning the funds, an administrative fee equal to the direct cost of administering the Act is deducted from the amount remitted by the tribal retail enterprise. The Act specifies that an administrative fee, not exceeding one percent, will be deducted from amounts remitted. Amounts remitted to the Secretary will be applied by the State to obligations under the tribal-State agreement. The Secretary is required to establish regulations for the Act's implementation within 180 days. Tribal retail enterprises are not mandated to sell motor fuels or tobacco products at specific prices. SEC. 5. MEDIATION OF DISPUTES BETWEEN TRIBES AND STATES UNDER TRIBAL-STATE AGREEMENTS. SEC. 5 allows a State or Indian tribe to request mediation by the Secretary for disputes over tribal-State agreements. The Secretary must mediate within 60 days and report conclusions within 180 days. Once a determination is made, parties are notified and urged to adopt it. If a tribal retail enterprise fails to comply with section 4(a) within 60 days of the Secretary's determination, they will be notified of the violation. Failure to comply within 30 days of notification will result in a referral to the Department of Justice, which will initiate a civil enforcement action within 60 days. If a tribal retail enterprise owned by an Indian tribe or a tribal member fails to comply with tax obligations, a civil enforcement action will be taken, including injunctive relief and penalties for unpaid state taxes. The Secretary may initiate an administrative action to determine if a tribe is not remitting the appropriate state tax, based on information provided by any person, including a State. The action must be concluded within 60 days. If the Secretary determines that a tribal retail enterprise violates the Act, a notice of violation will be issued. The Secretary can only take administrative action if the information directly relates to state tax amounts due. Judicial review can be sought in Federal district court, but unsuccessful challenges may result in liability for attorney's fees and court costs."
