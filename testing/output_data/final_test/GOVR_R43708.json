    "content": "The Take Care Clause in the U.S. Constitution imposes a duty on the President to faithfully execute laws. It has been interpreted as requiring compliance with statutory directives from Congress and also as granting Presidential control over law enforcement decisions. Courts typically do not review the President's enforcement choices, such as initiating criminal prosecutions or administrative actions. The Take Care Clause in the U.S. Constitution mandates that the President must faithfully execute laws, giving him the authority to recommend legislation, communicate his stance on bills, and either sign or veto them. Once a bill becomes law, the President's legislative role ends, and he is obligated to ensure the law is faithfully executed. The Take Care Clause in the U.S. Constitution requires the President to faithfully execute laws, preventing him from suspending or disregarding enacted laws. This Clause represents a rejection of the royal power to suspend laws historically held by English monarchs, as interpreted by scholars and the executive branch. The Take Care Clause in the U.S. Constitution prevents the President from disregarding or suspending laws enacted by Congress, contributing significantly to the separation of powers. It establishes clear boundaries between the President's duty to faithfully execute laws and Congress's role in creating laws. The President cannot unilaterally amend or repeal valid statutes, as the power to legislate belongs solely to Congress. Permitting the President to disregard laws would give the executive branch excessive power. The Take Care Clause in the U.S. Constitution imposes a duty on the President to ensure that executive branch officials obey Congress's commands and prohibits the President from frustrating legal requirements imposed by law. This duty was established in the seminal case of Marbury v. Madison in 1803, emphasizing the obligation of executive branch officials to comply with the law. In the final hours of his Presidency, John Adams appointed William Marbury as Justice of the Peace for the District of Columbia. Marbury's commission was not delivered, and President Thomas Jefferson instructed Secretary of State James Madison to withhold it. Marbury sued, asking the Supreme Court to compel Madison to deliver the commission as required by law. Chief Justice Marshall established that when an executive officer fails to perform a duty assigned by law, the courts may enforce it through a writ of mandamus. The Marbury opinion recognized Congress's authority to impose specific duties on the executive branch. The Marbury opinion acknowledged Congress's power to assign duties to executive officials, with the obligation to carry out those directives. The distinction was made between enforceable ministerial requirements and non-enforceable political acts. The President's duty to execute the law was emphasized in Kendall v. United States ex rel. Stokes, where a federal law directed the Postmaster General to provide back pay to mail carrier contractors, but the President intervened to prevent payment. The Supreme Court ruled that the President cannot direct an executive officer to ignore a valid duty imposed by Congress. The duty to execute the law is controlled by the law itself, not by the President's direction, to prevent the President from having unchecked power over legislation and justice administration. The Kendall opinion rejected the government's claim that the Take Care Clause gives the President power to block laws. The Court stated that the President's duty is to faithfully execute laws, not to prevent their execution. This legal reasoning has been cited to refute any presidential power to block valid laws. The Supreme Court in Youngstown reinforced the separation of Congress's law creation role and the President's law execution role. In Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, the Supreme Court invalidated President Truman's Executive Order to seize steel mills during the Korean conflict, stating that the President's power is limited to executing laws, not making them. Justice Jackson's concurring opinion was influential in reinforcing the separation of powers between Congress and the President. In response to President Nixon's attempt to disregard congressional enactments, courts rejected his authority to impound appropriated funds, emphasizing the President's limited legislative power. Courts rejected President Nixon's attempt to impound funds, stating that the President cannot substitute his spending choices for those established by Congress. The Supreme Court and U.S. District Court both ruled against impoundments, emphasizing the President's obligation to operate programs as intended by Congress. The Supreme Court has emphasized the President's duty to execute the law, stating that judicial enforcement is dependent on clear statutory mandates. If Congress legislates broadly or ambiguously, courts are unlikely to intervene in the President's actions. The executive must be allowed discretion within the legislation's parameters. The Take Care Clause ensures presidential control over law execution and enforcement, with the Supreme Court invalidating laws that undermine this authority. This principle stems from the President's appointment and removal power, as seen in cases like Bowsher v. Synar and Buckley v. Valeo. The Supreme Court has consistently ruled against laws that undermine the President's authority over law execution and enforcement, as seen in cases like Buckley v. Valeo and Printz v. U.S. The Court emphasized that the responsibility to ensure laws are faithfully executed lies with the President, not Congress. In Printz v. U.S., the Court questioned the Brady Act's requirement for state and local law enforcement officers to conduct background checks, suggesting it could infringe on the President's duty to faithfully execute laws. The Act was seen as transferring presidential responsibility to CLEOs without adequate control. The Framers emphasized unity in the Federal Executive to ensure vigor and accountability, which would be compromised if Congress could act effectively without the President. Recent cases like Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB and Myers v. U.S. highlight the importance of the President retaining control over those executing the laws. The President must oversee the faithfulness of law enforcement officers to execute laws, as seen in Morrison v Olson where Congress provided independence to a prosecutor with \"for cause\" removal protections. This ensures the President's control over law enforcement without interfering impermissibly with his executive power. The Take Care Clause ensures the President retains control over law enforcement to faithfully execute laws, as seen in Morrison v Olson. This limitation on executive branch enforcement discretion is essential for the President's obligation to enforce federal laws. The Take Care Clause limits the President's enforcement discretion to decisions directly related to enforcing federal law on third parties. The Supreme Court has not recognized the Clause as a justification for suspending federal law or refusing to comply with mandates. The question of whether enforcement discretion is a presidential power or a rule of judicial restraint remains unanswered. The Obama Administration has used enforcement discretion as the legal basis for its actions. Federal prosecutors traditionally have broad latitude in making investigatory and prosecutorial decisions. The doctrine of prosecutorial discretion allows prosecutors to make determinations on when, against whom, and whether to prosecute criminal violations of federal law. This concept has historical roots dating back to English common law, where the nolle prosequi allowed the government to terminate criminal actions deemed frivolous or against royal interests. Prosecutorial discretion permits prosecutors to avoid unwarranted prosecutions or cases they choose not to pursue. The modern doctrine of prosecutorial discretion is derived from constitutional principles such as the separation of powers and the duties of a prosecutor as an appointee of the President. Courts generally do not review prosecutorial decisions in criminal matters or force the executive branch to initiate a specific prosecution. Judicial review of prosecutorial decisions is considered improper due to the discretion that comes with the prosecutorial function. Judicial deference to prosecutorial decisions by federal prosecutors is justified as the decision to prosecute is not suited for judicial review. Courts recognize that factors like evidence strength, deterrence value, and enforcement priorities are not easily analyzed by the courts. The exercise of prosecutorial discretion in initiating criminal proceedings or dismissing charges is considered unsuitable for judicial review. The Supreme Court has emphasized that the Executive Branch holds exclusive authority and absolute discretion in deciding whether to prosecute a case. Lower courts have also upheld this principle, with one case stating that a district court cannot compel a U.S. Attorney to sign an indictment. This highlights the strong judicial deference to prosecutorial decisions in initiating criminal prosecutions. The court held that prosecutors have discretion in deciding whether to prosecute a case, and courts should not interfere with this power. This principle was exemplified in a case where prison inmates sued a U.S. Attorney for not taking action after a prison revolt. The court dismissed the claim, stating that federal courts traditionally refrain from overturning prosecutorial decisions. This is due to the separation of powers and the complexity of prosecutorial choices. The executive branch asserts control over prosecutorial decisions to enforce laws effectively. The President's constitutional duty is to enforce laws, giving the Executive Branch exclusive authority to prosecute. The DOJ emphasizes that Judicial and Legislative branches cannot interfere with prosecutorial discretion. However, this discretion is not unlimited, as it cannot be used to cover up constitutional violations or discriminate based on arbitrary classifications like race or religion. In cases of selective prosecution, the judiciary must protect against unconstitutional deprivations of individual rights. Courts may review prosecutorial decisions for compliance with statutory requirements. Maintaining a claim of selective prosecution is challenging for defendants, as clear evidence is needed to displace the presumption of lawful actions by prosecutors. In cases of selective prosecution, courts may review prosecutorial decisions for compliance with statutory requirements. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit suggested that prosecutorial discretion is subject to statutory and constitutional limits enforceable through judicial review. The judiciary has the responsibility to ensure that congressional enactments are not negated when Congress has established a statutory framework altering prosecutorial discretion. Courts may review prosecutorial decisions to ensure compliance with federal law, but they are hesitant to limit the executive's discretion in initiating prosecutions without clear evidence of Congress's intent. In Powell v Katzenbach, the D.C. Circuit dismissed a challenge to the Attorney General's decision not to prosecute a national bank, stating that special legislation would be required to force prosecutions in certain circumstances. The circuit court found that congressional intent did not alter the traditional scope of the prosecutor's discretion in certain circumstances. The Fourth Circuit and the U.S. District Court also held that federal prosecutors were not stripped of their normal discretion in prosecuting civil rights crimes, as the use of the word \"require\" was not sufficient evidence of a broad congressional purpose to limit executive discretion. The court found that congressional intent did not change the prosecutor's discretion. The separation of powers concerns from a law removing prosecutorial discretion will be explored further. Agency civil enforcement decisions are similar to prosecutorial decisions. Administrative enforcement discretion allows for setting priorities and making enforcement decisions. The judicial reluctance to review agency enforcement decisions arises from the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Take Care Clause. Courts generally will not review discretionary agency enforcement decisions due to the traditional discretion exercised by agencies in enforcing statutes they administer. Courts are cautious in reviewing agency nonenforcement decisions, considering them committed to agency discretion and not subject to judicial review under the APA. The seminal case Heckler v. Chaney established this principle when the Supreme Court upheld the FDA's decision not to block the use of certain drugs in lethal injection. The Supreme Court held that agency enforcement decisions are within the agency's discretion, considering factors like resource allocation, likelihood of success, and overall policies. Agencies are better equipped than courts to prioritize enforcement actions. The Supreme Court established that agency nonenforcement decisions are generally not subject to judicial review, but there are exceptions. Judicial review may be allowed if the substantive statute provides guidelines for enforcement or if the agency has clearly adopted a general policy. Nonenforcement decisions by agencies are typically not reviewable, but exceptions exist. Judicial review may be permitted if the statute provides enforcement guidelines or if the agency has clearly adopted a general policy. Congress can limit an agency's enforcement discretion by setting priorities or providing standards for defining limits. This overrides the agency's inherent enforcement discretion. Congress can limit an agency's enforcement discretion by providing standards for defining limits, which overrides the agency's inherent enforcement discretion. The Court in Heckler v. Chaney stated that if Congress has indicated an intent to circumscribe agency enforcement discretion and has provided meaningful standards, courts may require the agency to follow that law. The exercise of agency discretion may be influenced by congressional controls, but Congress's intent to curtail agency enforcement discretion must be explicit. The Heckler opinion held that the FDA's discretion in nonenforcement determinations could not be reviewed due to the lack of explicit limitations in the FFDCA. The Act granted complete discretion to the Secretary on how and when to enforce violations, without mandating action for every violation. In his concurrence, Justice Brennan emphasized that agencies should not disregard legislative direction and that the presumption against reviewability applied only to individual nonenforcement decisions. Brennan's reasoning was more limited and had prevailed in a previous case. The Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act requires the Secretary of Labor to investigate complaints and bring civil actions if probable cause of a violation is found. The Supreme Court rejected the agency's argument that the Secretary's decision to bring a civil action was unreviewable, stating that prosecutorial discretion does not apply in this case. The appellate court provided two reasons for this conclusion. The appellate court concluded that the Secretary's decision to bring a civil action under the L-MRDA is reviewable, unlike prosecutorial discretion in criminal cases. The court found that the factors considered by the Secretary are more limited and clearly defined, requiring a determination of probable cause for violations affecting election outcomes. The appellate court found that the Secretary's decision to file a civil action under the L-MRDA is reviewable based on a determination of probable cause for violations affecting election outcomes. The Secretary retains discretion in deciding whether to bring suit, with the Supreme Court confirming the validity of this approach in Heckler. The court in Heckler distinguished the L-MRDA from the FFDCA, stating that the L-MRDA clearly withdrew agency discretion and provided guidelines for enforcement. Federal statutes lacking guidelines for enforcement discretion are generally not held to override agency discretion. Mandatory language without specific enforcement guidelines is insufficient for review of nonenforcement decisions, as seen in the Heckler case. The Florida district court applied Heckler's reasoning to a statute related to the Endangered Species Act, stating that the provision does not mandate pursuing every violation. The court highlighted the lack of criteria or guidelines for investigating noncompliance. In a separate case, the U.S. District Court in Texas applied Heckler and Dunlop in a challenge to the Secretary of Homeland Security's discretion in granting deferred action relief in immigration cases. In Crane v. Napolitano, ICE agents challenged the DACA memorandum, arguing that the INA requires them to initiate removal proceedings against unlawfully present aliens not clearly entitled to admission. The district court ruled that officers must start removal proceedings for any alien not clearly entitled to admission. The court held that judicial review of agency nonenforcement policy was appropriate under the INA, which provides defined factors for initiating removal proceedings against arriving aliens. The district court dismissed the case, stating that employment-related claims by ICE agents fall under the jurisdiction of the Merit Systems Protection Board. Agency nonenforcement decisions are generally unreviewable, but Congress can restrict this discretion. When Congress provides clear guidelines or standards for how an agency should enforce laws, the presumption of nonreviewability of agency decisions may be overcome. Establishing criteria or conditions for enforcement actions allows for potential judicial review of nonenforcement decisions. Courts may review nonenforcement decisions to ensure compliance with statutory requirements under the \"arbitrary and capricious\" test. The reviewing court cannot substitute its judgment but can assess if the agency's discretion was exercised in a non-arbitrary manner. The agency may need to provide a statement of reasons for the nonenforcement decision. The court can evaluate agency decisions based on grounds and essential facts. If a rational basis is found, the court should not interfere. Nonenforcement decisions may be reviewed if the agency abdicates its responsibilities. The court can review agency decisions based on essential facts and grounds. Nonenforcement decisions may be subject to review if the agency abdicates its responsibilities. The Court cited Adams v. Richardson in a case involving the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare's failure to enforce Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The court affirmed the district court's decision that the agency must enforce Title VI of the Civil Rights Act through specific procedures, distinguishing it from past cases of enforcement discretion. The court emphasized the breadth of the Secretary's nonenforcement actions and the duty to accomplish statutory purposes. The court found that HEW's reliance on voluntary compliance instead of formal enforcement procedures was a dereliction of duty reviewable in the courts. The court emphasized the nature of the relationship between the agency and the institutions receiving federal funds. HEW is supplying segregated institutions with federal funds against Congress's intentions. The Adams exception may not apply to traditional enforcement actions, and the level of nonenforcement that constitutes an \"abdication of statutory responsibilities\" is unclear due to sparse case law. The Fifth Circuit has ruled that \"inadequate\" enforcement does not override the Heckler presumption of nonreviewability. In Texas v. United States, the court rejected the claim that the federal government's failure to control immigration constituted a reviewable abdication of duty. Nonenforcement decisions are deemed not subject to judicial review. The Fifth Circuit ruled that inadequate enforcement of immigration laws does not constitute a reviewable abdication of duty. Nonenforcement decisions are not subject to judicial review, as seen in the case of Texas v. United States. The FDA settled with an animal drug manufacturer, agreeing not to enforce for 18 months. A rival manufacturer challenged the settlement's validity, but the court dismissed the claim, citing enforcement discretion. Agency delays are hard to enforce without clear statutory language. Courts generally do not review prosecutorial or agency nonenforcement decisions, as they are considered within the agency's discretion. However, the mere invocation of enforcement discretion does not shield arbitrariness. Courts may be more willing to review established agency policies of nonenforcement rather than individual decisions. Justice Brennan emphasized this distinction in the Heckler concurrence. The court distinguishes between \"single-shot nonenforcement decisions\" and \"an agency's general enforcement policy.\" Review of a general enforcement policy is allowed if the agency has expressed it formally, articulated it universally, or outlined a policy that applies broadly. The court finds it appropriate to review such policies as they are abstracted from specific cases and more likely to interpret substantive statutes directly. The court distinguishes between \"single-shot nonenforcement decisions\" and \"an agency's general enforcement policy.\" Review of a general enforcement policy is allowed if the agency has expressed it formally, articulated it universally, or outlined a policy that applies broadly. The court finds it appropriate to review such policies as they are abstracted from specific cases and more likely to interpret substantive statutes directly. Agencies are more likely to provide clear reasons for their actions when articulating a broadly applicable enforcement policy, compared to individual decisions to forego enforcement which may have cursory or post hoc explanations. In Nader v. Saxbe, the D.C. Circuit distinguished between judicial review of discretionary enforcement decisions and compliance with statutory and constitutional limits. The case involved a nonprofit corporation seeking to compel the Attorney General to initiate criminal prosecutions under the Federal Corrupt Practices Act. The plaintiffs argued that despite allegations of violations, the DOJ had a policy of only responding to violations referred by the Clerk of the House. The court in Nader v. Saxbe distinguished between judicial review of enforcement decisions and nonenforcement policies. The plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the claim but the court acknowledged the possibility of judicial review of nonenforcement policies. The complaint sought a judicial determination of whether certain Justice Department policies exceeded constitutional and statutory limits of prosecutorial discretion. The court may be more open to reviewing a nonenforcement policy rather than an individual decision due to the potential remedy involved. Mandamus, an extraordinary remedy, is typically only granted in cases of a clear duty to act. Courts are hesitant to order enforcement actions, as seen in the criminal context where prosecution decisions are within the discretion of the Attorney General. The Attorney General has discretion over prosecution decisions, and mandamus cannot control this discretion. However, courts may have more flexibility in addressing invalid agency nonenforcement policies, as seen in the case of Smith v. Meese where a court invalidated a policy affecting constitutional rights. The court addressed the challenge to nonenforcement policies that deprived plaintiffs of their constitutional rights. It clarified that judicial review of prosecutorial decisions does not threaten separation of powers. The court noted that the remedy would likely involve ordering defendants to make prosecutorial decisions based on constitutional factors, rather than targeting specific races or political parties. The Executive branch has discretion in prosecutorial decisions based on constitutional factors, with Congress able to guide or restrict this discretion through statute. The Supreme Court emphasizes that Congress determines how rights are enforced, as seen in the Heckler case. In the Heckler case, the Supreme Court ruled that Congress can establish guidelines for agencies' enforcement powers and limit their discretion. This principle may also apply in criminal cases, as shown in early Supreme Court cases like U.S. v. Morgan. The Supreme Court's ruling in the Heckler case established that Congress can set guidelines for agency enforcement powers, including in criminal cases. In U.S. v. Morgan, the Court indicated that federal prosecutors must act upon agency determinations of violations under the Pure Food and Drug Act, without mentioning prosecutorial discretion or separation of powers. The Court's dicta suggested that the law compels prosecutors to act promptly, influencing prosecutorial decisions. The Supreme Court's ruling in Heckler case established Congress's authority to set guidelines for agency enforcement powers, including in criminal cases. While the executive branch has discretion over prosecution, the Court suggested that this control may be limited by statute. Little judicial discussion exists on Congress's ability to restrict executive enforcement discretion, but it is clear that the judiciary respects the executive branch's prosecutorial decisions. The presumption against court review of enforcement decisions made by the executive branch is based on respect for each branch's roles, the Take Care Clause, statutory principles, limitations on judicial review, and Congress's intent to grant discretion to agencies. Congress has the authority to modify statutory principles and alter enforcement discretion. The Supreme Court has not directly addressed the limits of Congress's power in this regard or whether Congress can remove enforcement discretion entirely. It is unclear if Congress's authority to restrict administrative enforcement discretion differs from its authority to restrict criminal prosecutorial discretion. The language used in cases addressing the executive's discretionary authority in initiating criminal prosecutions suggests that Congress may have more control over civil or administrative enforcement actions than federal criminal prosecutions. Justice Marshall distinguished between prosecutorial and administrative discretion in Heckler, stating that arguments about prosecutorial discretion do not necessarily apply to agency refusals to act. The Fifth Circuit also made a similar distinction based on presidential power in Riley v. St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital. Intrusions into the executive's control over criminal cases were deemed more concerning than intrusions into civil cases. The Riley court upheld the qui tam provision of the False Claims Act, distinguishing between the executive's control over criminal and civil cases. It emphasized that criminal prosecution is essential to the Executive's duty to faithfully execute laws, while civil litigation involves lesser uses of executive power. This distinction requires two different types of control to ensure constitutional duties under Article II are upheld. Types of control require different tests, with Congress potentially having more authority over administrative enforcement discretion. Legislation restricting executive branch enforcement decisions could raise separation of powers issues. The Supreme Court has limited precedent on Congress's authority to impinge on executive enforcement decisions, with the executive branch historically opposing interference as a violation of the Take Care Clause. General limits exist on Congress's authority to intrude on the executive's powers. Congress's authority to intrude upon the executive's enforcement power is limited. It cannot directly enforce federal law or appoint/remove officers involved in law enforcement. The separation of powers principle prohibits Congress from both making and enforcing laws. The Supreme Court has emphasized the distinction between legislative and executive powers to prevent tyranny. The President plays a crucial role in selecting and controlling those who execute and enforce the law. The President must have control over those engaged in enforcement, with Congress able to place limits through \"for cause\" removal restrictions. Congress likely cannot direct the executive to bring a criminal prosecution against a specific individual, as it is considered within the executive branch's prosecutorial discretion. Such a directive would be seen as an intrusion into Presidential power. Legislation targeting an individual for punishment may violate the constitutional prohibition on bills of attainder. If Congress enacts such a law and the executive does not comply, it is unlikely that a court would enforce it by ordering prosecution. The separation of powers could be at risk if Congress uses less restrictive means to influence enforcement discretion. This legislation would be evaluated based on the standards set by the Supreme Court in Morrison v. Olson. The Supreme Court in Morrison v. Olson addressed a constitutional challenge to the independent counsel provisions of the Ethics in Government Act. The Act allowed for the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate and prosecute high-ranking executive branch officials for federal law violations. The Attorney General had to conduct a preliminary investigation upon receiving specific and credible information of serious offenses. If reasonable grounds were found, the Attorney General had to apply to a special three-judge panel for the appointment of an independent counsel with full power. The Supreme Court in Morrison v. Olson upheld the constitutionality of the independent counsel provisions of the Ethics in Government Act, granting the counsel full investigative and prosecutorial powers. The court rejected arguments that the law intruded on the President's enforcement power, expanded the judicial function, infringed on the President's removal power, or violated the separation of powers. The Supreme Court in Morrison v. Olson upheld the constitutionality of the independent counsel provisions of the Ethics in Government Act, granting the counsel full investigative and prosecutorial powers. The Court emphasized that the law did not undermine the Executive Branch's powers or disrupt the balance between branches, as Congress retained no control or supervision powers over the President. The law reduced the President's control over certain criminal investigations but did not do so impermissibly. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the independent counsel provisions, granting full investigative and prosecutorial powers. The Executive Branch still retained control over the counsel's appointment and removal, ensuring the President's ability to perform constitutional duties. Justice Scalia's dissent argued for exclusive executive enforcement powers. The Supreme Court upheld the independent counsel provisions, granting investigative and prosecutorial powers while the Executive Branch retained control over appointment and removal. Justice Scalia's dissent argued for exclusive executive enforcement powers, rejecting the notion that the President's control over investigations and prosecutions is constitutionally required. The majority opinion in the Supreme Court case acknowledged that the Act reduces control over investigations and prosecutions by the Attorney General and the President, but deemed this reduction not unconstitutional. The Morrison standard has been used by appellate courts to uphold the qui tam provision of the False Claims Act, allowing private individuals to initiate civil proceedings on behalf of the government. The False Claims Act allows private individuals to initiate civil proceedings on behalf of the government, giving them the authority to file qui tam actions for violations. The government has 60 days to investigate and decide whether to take control of the enforcement action. If the government assumes responsibility, the relator may continue as a party but the DOJ can make enforcement decisions independently. Appellate courts have upheld this provision, rejecting arguments that it violates the separation of powers. The False Claims Act allows private individuals to initiate civil proceedings on behalf of the government, giving them the authority to file qui tam actions for violations. Appellate courts have upheld this provision, rejecting arguments that it violates the separation of powers. The courts generally focused on the degree of control that the executive branch exercises over the relator, including the government's authority to intervene, place limits on the relator's participation, restrict the relator's power in discovery, and ultimately decide whether to settle or dismiss the case. Although the provision may diminish Executive branch control over a defined class of civil litigation, the Executive retains sufficient control over the relator's conduct to ensure the President can perform his constitutionally assigned duty. Congress's authority to counter agency policies of nonenforcement remains an open question. Congress can use its legislative powers to influence the executive branch to enforce laws according to its will by prohibiting certain factors in enforcement decisions or setting enforcement priorities. The Supreme Court has emphasized that agency actions can be rejected if they consider factors not intended by Congress. Congress can also establish enforcement priorities, as recognized in the Heckler case. The Supreme Court has acknowledged that Congress can set \"substantive priorities\" for agencies to follow in enforcement. In TVA v. Hill, the Court emphasized Congress's exclusive role in establishing legislative policies and priorities. If Congress sets enforcement priorities, the judiciary can ensure executive compliance with statutory requirements. In situations where agency enforcement policies conflict with statutory requirements, concerns may arise regarding Congress's ability to limit executive discretion in initiating enforcement actions. This is particularly relevant in criminal cases where courts have discussed the executive's power to decide on prosecutions. The Supreme Court has noted that the Executive Branch has exclusive authority and absolute discretion in prosecutorial decisions, suggesting that congressional attempts to require prosecutions may be problematic. The executive branch has previously determined that Congress lacks the authority to compel prosecutions in the criminal context. The Department of Justice argued that prosecutorial discretion may be regulated by Congress and the Constitution, but the decision not to prosecute an individual may not be compelled. The Department of Justice (DOJ) argued that the decision not to prosecute an individual is fundamental to the executive's prerogative and cannot be controlled by Congress or the Constitution. This position was taken before the Supreme Court's decision in Morrison, which evaluated the separation of powers concerns related to the President's duty to faithfully execute the laws. The Morrison analysis focused on preventing the Executive Branch from accomplishing its functions by considering \"aggrandizement\" and \"control.\" The Court upheld independent counsel provisions as they did not seek to increase Congress's powers and the President still had supervision over the counsel. It is unclear how these principles would apply to a law compelling criminal prosecutions, potentially replacing prosecutorial discretion with congressional determination. Congress may have the power to limit executive control over enforcement decisions, without removing it entirely. This could be seen as a permissible legislative restriction that does not aggrandize Congress's power or undermine Presidential control. The conduct of a prosecution, once initiated, remains in the hands of the executive branch. The qui tam cases suggest that Congress can reduce executive branch control over enforcement actions, while ensuring the executive branch retains discretion. Heckler's approval of Dunlop's reasoning supports mandatory enforcement frameworks, but obtaining court orders for enforcement can be challenging. The Supreme Court found in Dunlop that prosecutorial discretion didn't apply because Congress mandated enforcement under specific conditions. The Supreme Court in Heckler v. Dunlop confirmed that if Congress has provided clear guidelines for agency enforcement power, courts can require agencies to follow those guidelines. The Court did not mandate enforcement action but required the agency to provide reasons for not taking action. The Supreme Court in Heckler v. Dunlop confirmed that courts can review the Secretary's decision not to sue if it is deemed \"arbitrary and capricious.\" If the Secretary's reasons are found to be irrational, the court may order a civil suit against the union. The Supreme Court in Heckler v. Dunlop confirmed that courts can review the Secretary's decision not to sue if it is deemed \"arbitrary and capricious.\" The court is empowered to order the Secretary to bring a civil suit against the union to set aside the election, but the issue of court coercion is not addressed at this time. The separation of powers argument regarding court orders requiring the executive branch to file a lawsuit was also mentioned. The district court found the reasons for agency inaction inadequate and ordered a reconsideration of the decision, prohibiting the Secretary from using a method deemed inconsistent with congressional intent."
