    "content": "Shinzo Abe has been Japan's prime minister since December 2012 and extended the LDP's term-limit rules for party president to three consecutive terms in 2017. In September 2018, he won the LDP leadership vote, securing a three-year term. With control of Japan's legislature, Abe is set to become the longest-serving prime minister if he remains in power beyond November 2019. Abe's new Cabinet shows continuity in foreign and trade policy, with one woman member. Abe's new Cabinet includes one woman, down from two, despite his campaign to increase women's representation in government. The LDP's approval ratings remain high, with Abe winning the party leadership vote in September 2018. The upcoming electoral test will be in July 2019 for Japan's Upper House seats. At the beginning of Trump's presidency, the U.S.-Japan relationship was strong in confronting the North Korean threat. Abe and Trump showed unity in dealing with Pyongyang's nuclear tests and missile launches. However, concerns arise as Trump pursues a friendly approach with North Korea, leading to skepticism among many Japanese about Pyongyang's willingness to denuclearize and fears of Tokyo's interests being sidelined. Key issues include the abduction of Japanese citizens by North Korean agents in the past. Japanese Prime Minister Abe's political career was built on the issue of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korean agents in the 1970s and 1980s. Abe expressed willingness to meet with Kim Jong Un to resolve the abduction issue, but doubts remain about Kim's intentions. Trump's changing stance on North Korea, including suspending military exercises with South Korea, has raised concerns among Japanese policymakers about the U.S. commitment to Japan's security. U.S. trade policy under Trump has strained relations with Japan, particularly in the auto trade sector. In 2017, the U.S. had a deficit in auto trade of over $50 billion. The Administration has implemented increased tariffs and import restrictions to reduce the trade deficit and promote domestic manufacturing. These actions have caused tensions with U.S. trading partners, including Japan. Japan has raised concerns over steel and aluminum tariffs imposed under Section 232 of the Trade Act of 1962, which may also impact the Japanese economy due to the ongoing Section 232 investigation on motor vehicles. U.S. imports of Japanese autos and parts were nearly $56 billion in 2017. The United States and Japan announced new bilateral trade negotiations, with Japan agreeing to avoid potential U.S. motor vehicle tariffs. The negotiations may not be as comprehensive as a typical free trade agreement, and Japan had initially urged the U.S. to rejoin the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Japan led negotiations to revise the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) after the U.S. withdrawal in 2017. The new agreement, called the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) or TPP-11, was signed in July 2018. Several countries have ratified the agreement, with Canada in the final stages. Japan and China are working towards stability in their relationship, with a leaders' summit scheduled for October to deepen economic cooperation. The upcoming leaders' summit between Japan and China aims to deepen economic cooperation and increase people-to-people exchanges. Both countries have established measures to manage tensions in the security realm, such as a hotline for senior defense officials. Japan has shown willingness to cooperate with China's Belt and Road Initiative under certain conditions, possibly driven by trade friction with the United States. Japan's relations with South Korea remain precarious due to historical grievances, particularly regarding comfort women from the World War II era. Despite efforts to improve ties, public mistrust continues to be a diplomatic challenge. Relations between Japan and South Korea are strained due to historical grievances, with recent incidents such as the Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force pulling out of an international fleet review in South Korea. Abe has expressed a desire to improve ties with South Korea, possibly influenced by Seoul's role in diplomacy with North Korea. Moon's government plans to shut down the foundation overseeing compensating comfort women after a 2015 agreement, reflecting public criticism of the arrangement. Seoul plays a central role in international diplomacy with North Korea, impacting relations between U.S. allies. Japan is cautious of Seoul's engagement with North Korea, concerned about tangible reductions in North Korean nuclear capabilities. Despite initial concerns, relations between Japan and the U.S. have remained strong, with Abe being the first foreign leader to visit after Trump's victory. After Trump's victory, Abe was the first foreign leader to visit the President-Elect and the second leader to visit the White House after the U.S. inauguration. Abe and Trump displayed a strong personal rapport and issued a joint statement echoing tenets of the bilateral alliance. Despite Trump's wariness of Japan's trade practices, Abe remains committed to the U.S. alliance while also championing regional trade deals and stabilizing relations with China and other partners. Security cooperation between Japan and the U.S. remains robust, with Abe's political position secured. In some ways, U.S. pressure may boost Abe's efforts to increase Japan's military capabilities. The Japanese public is wary of moving away from self-defense and altering the constitution. The Trump Administration reaffirmed key statements crucial to Japan, including support for Japanese administration of the Senkaku Islands. The United States reaffirmed its commitment to Japan and support for Japanese administration of the Senkaku Islands. Concerns have been raised about differences in global approaches between the Trump Administration and Tokyo, despite their history of cooperation on various international issues. Japan strongly supports the United Nations as a platform for addressing global disputes and has collaborated with the U.S. in forums like the East Asia Summit and ASEAN Regional Forum.\u5171 The Trump Administration's skepticism of multilateral organizations has raised concerns in Japan about the durability of the alliance. If the United States shifts away from its traditional security role, Japan may seek other partnerships to pursue its national interests independently. Abe is expected to remain in office through November 2019, becoming the longest-serving leader. Abe is set to become the longest-serving prime minister in post-war Japan, having stabilized Japanese politics and strengthened defense ties with the United States. He increased the defense budget, reformed security policies, and secured approval for a new U.S. Marine Corps base on Okinawa. Abe also led Japan into TPP FTA negotiations and pursued economic reforms to revitalize the economy. Abe's cabinet selections have included politicians with nationalist views, some of which glorify Imperial Japan's actions. While some of his positions, like allowing Japanese participation in collective self-defense, are welcomed by the U.S., others suggest a revisionist view of Japanese history that denies Imperial Japanese aggression. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been associated with groups that argue Japan has been unfairly criticized for its actions as a colonial and wartime power. These groups, like Nippon Kaigi Kyokai, believe Japan should be praised for liberating East Asia from Western colonial powers and dispute the legitimacy of the Tokyo War Crimes tribunals. Abe's visit to Yasukuni Shrine in 2013, which honors Japanese war dead including convicted Class A war criminals, was criticized by the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo. The United States is disappointed with Japan's leadership for actions that worsen tensions with its neighbors. Despite US statements, many LDP lawmakers have visited the Yasukuni Shrine, including on sensitive dates like August 15. Prime Minister Abe has avoided visiting since 2013, but other officials have paid respects. Abe has refrained from actions that could upset regional relations since 2013, reaffirming government expressions of remorse after pressure. Japan's Prime Minister Abe responded to criticism by reaffirming government expressions of remorse after pressure from various sources, including U.S. officials. The territorial dispute between Japan and China over the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea continues, with both countries also disputing maritime rights in the region. Despite attempts at joint development, tensions persist. China and Japan are in a dispute over the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea, with China rejecting Japan's proposed \"median line\" dividing their exclusive economic zones. Tensions have been ongoing since 2010 when a Chinese fishing vessel collided with Japanese ships, leading to a diplomatic standoff. In 2012, Japan purchased land features to prevent their sale to a nationalist governor, causing objections from Beijing. In response to Japan's actions regarding the Senkaku Islands, China issued sharp objections and saw a drop in Sino-Japanese trade. China declared the islands a \"core interest\" in 2013, indicating their unwillingness to compromise on sovereignty. China increased patrols near the islands, leading to escalated encounters with Japan, including fighter jet scrambles and radar lock-ons. The number of Chinese vessels in the area decreased over time. The number of Chinese vessels near the Senkaku Islands varied over the years, with patrols conducted by the China Coast Guard. Tensions between China and Japan also extended to airspace activities, leading to increased scramble takeoffs by Japan Air Self Defense Force aircraft. In Fiscal Year 2010, Japan Air Self Defense Force aircraft had 96 scramble takeoffs, which increased to 842 in 2016. The number decreased to 602 in 2017 and 278 in the first half of 2018. China's establishment of an air defense identification zone in the East China Sea in 2013 caused tension and raised the risk of conflict due to overlapping ADIZs. Tensions in the East China Sea have somewhat subsided since 2016, with China and Japan taking steps to prevent conflicts over the Senkaku Islands. Efforts to defend their claims have mainly involved non-military actors in the \"gray zone\" between peace and conflict. China's strategy aims to gradually strengthen its control and influence in the region. Japan is prioritizing countering gray zone activities and enhancing military capabilities in response to China's efforts to consolidate control over contested space without armed conflict. The U.S. has a treaty commitment to defend the Senkaku Islands, but maintains a neutral position on territorial disputes. Congress addressed this gap in the FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act. In FY2013, Congress addressed the issue of third-party actions affecting the U.S. acknowledgment of Japan's administration over the Senkaku Islands. The conflict in the East China Sea highlights Japan's security challenges, including its dependence on the U.S. security guarantee. Japan and Taiwan agreed to jointly share fishing resources in their overlapping claimed areas. Taiwan and Japan agreed to jointly share and administer fishing resources in their overlapping claimed EEZs Senkakus (Diaoyu/Diaoyutai) after 17 years of discussions. The agreement did not address conflicting sovereignty claims or fishing rights in the islands' territorial waters. The Senate passed S.Res. 167, praising the pact as a model for similar agreements. Japan's relationship with South Korea has been fluctuating between troubled and tentatively cooperative in the 21st century, with Washington encouraging closer ties between Tokyo and Seoul due to shared security concerns and commitment to regional stability. The strained relationship between Seoul and Tokyo hinders trilateral cooperation on North Korea policy and responding to China's rise, impacting U.S. interests. Despite historical tensions, North Korean provocations have driven closer coordination between South Korea and Japan, such as joint military exercises focused on tracking missile launches. Persistent discord between Japan and Korea complicates the potential creation of a U.S.-Japan-South Korea ballistic missile defense system. The Japan-Korea discord stems from historical issues, including Japan's actions during its annexation of the Korean Peninsula in 1910. Tensions persist over the comfort women issue, WWII depiction in textbooks, and a territorial dispute over the Dokdo/Takeshima islands. The Japan-South Korea discord is fueled by historical issues, including the comfort women controversy and territorial disputes over the Dokdo/Takeshima islands. Japanese statements on the disputed territories and history textbooks often provoke criticism from South Korea. Abe's stance on the comfort women issue further strained relations, as he denied claims of coercion by the Japanese military. In 2015, Abe and then-President Park Geun-hye of South Korea reached an agreement that included a new apology from Abe and 1 billion yen from Japan to a Korean foundation supporting surviving victims of comfort women. Despite the agreement being implemented in 2016, it remains unpopular in South Korea. The issue continues to strain bilateral relations, with Japan objecting to a comfort woman statue in Seoul and Seoul considering disbanding the foundation established by the agreement. The issue of comfort women has gained visibility in the United States, with Korean-American activist groups successfully advocating for monuments and resolutions commemorating the victims. In 2007, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution calling on Japan to acknowledge and apologize for forcing young women into military prostitution. Since 2009, Washington and Tokyo have been united in their approach to North Korea due to missile launches and nuclear tests. Japan has a hardline policy towards North Korea, including a trade embargo and vocal leadership at the United Nations. They were a key actor in the Six-Party Talks for Korean peninsula issues, but the talks have been dormant since 2009. Japan is directly threatened by North Korea's missile capabilities, with missiles flying over Japanese territory in 2017. North Korea holds animosity towards Japan for its colonialism of the Korean peninsula. Japan's animosity towards Japan stems from its colonialism of the Korean peninsula. U.S. bases in Japan could be targeted by North Korea. Japan prioritizes the issue of Japanese citizens kidnapped by North Korean agents. Abe has been a strong advocate for the abductees' families. President Trump also raised the abductee issue with Kim Jong-un. The Abe Administration's foreign policy emphasizes democratic values, international laws, and norms. Abe's strategy \"Asia's Democratic Security Diamond\" aims to cooperate with Japan, Australia, India, and the United States to deter Chinese aggression. Japan has strengthened relations with Asian countries through high-level meetings and focused on freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. Abe's foreign policy focuses on freedom of navigation in the South China Sea to protect Japan's trade and address the East China Sea dispute. He has worked to strengthen maritime capabilities of Southeast Asian countries, supported by the Obama Administration. Abe aims to balance China's influence with a coalition of Asia-Pacific powers, emphasizing international laws and democratic values. His outreach has led to positive results, including robust ties with Australia and new economic and security agreements. Canberra yielded new economic and security arrangements, including defense equipment transfer agreement. Japan-India ties have strengthened under Abe and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, with expanded military exercises and defense export negotiations. Abe has also worked to maintain Japan-Philippines defense relations amidst cracks in the U.S.-Philippines alliance. His international diplomacy includes reaching out to Russia due to the unresolved territorial dispute over the Northern Territories. Japan and Russia may be seeking a partnership to counter China's economic and military power. Japan's attempts to revitalize relations with Russia have not made progress due to Russia's aggression in Ukraine. Tokyo signed onto a G7 statement condemning Russia's actions and imposed mild sanctions despite pressure from Western powers. Russia and China have grown closer as many Western countries isolate Moscow. U.S. soldiers held captive by Imperial Japan during WWII seek official apologies from the Japanese government. In 2010, the Japanese government financed a Japanese/American POW Friendship Program for former American POWs to visit Japan, receive apologies, and travel to their POW camps. Congressional resolutions thanked Japan for the apology and program. The resolutions thanked Japan for its apology and visitation program for former American POWs. They urged Japan to do more for the POWs, including expanding visitation programs and WWII education efforts. Japanese companies were called upon to apologize for using forced laborers during the war. Mitsubishi Materials Corporation was the first major Japanese company to apologize to U.S. POWs and made a $50,000 grant to a library in West Virginia. Japan and the United States collaborated on environmental initiatives under the Obama Administration. Japan collaborated with the United States on environmental initiatives under the Obama Administration, aligning closely in international climate negotiations for a legally binding agreement. However, concerns arose about Japan's global partnership due to the shutdown of its nuclear reactors. President Trump's decision to withdraw from the UNFCCC Paris Agreement further impacted international climate efforts. The United States' withdrawal from the UNFCCC Paris Agreement impacted its cooperation with Japan on climate issues. Japanese officials expressed disappointment and anger at the decision, emphasizing the importance of global action on climate change. However, some experts criticize Japan's greenhouse gas reduction plan as insufficiently ambitious. Despite this, the two countries continue to collaborate on energy issues under a strategic partnership. The partnership between Japan and the United States focuses on advanced nuclear energy technologies, clean coal technologies, natural gas market development, and energy infrastructure in the developing world. This aligns with the Trump Administration's Asia-EDGE initiative to enhance energy security in the region and promote U.S. energy products, particularly liquefied natural gas (LNG). Japan, the world's largest LNG buyer, is a key destination for U.S. LNG exports. Japan is also undergoing a national debate on the future of nuclear power, which has implications for businesses and U.S.-Japan nuclear energy cooperation. The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011 led to a reversal in Japan's nuclear power policy, with public trust in nuclear power collapsing and an anti-nuclear movement emerging. This movement tapped into Japan's historical sentiment as a victim of atomic bombing in 1945. As a result, Japan's 54 nuclear reactors were shut down for safety inspections, and the government did not restart them. The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011 led to the shutdown of Japan's 54 nuclear reactors for safety inspections. Despite a temporary reactivation of two reactors, no reactors were operating from September 2013 until August 2015. Currently, only eight reactors are in operation, leading to consequences such as rising electricity costs, heightened risk of blackouts, energy conservation efforts, losses for utility companies, and increased fossil fuel imports. The direct cost of decommissioning the Fukushima Daiichi plant and compensating victims is estimated to be $187 billion. The cost of decommissioning the Fukushima Daiichi plant and compensating victims is estimated to be $187 billion. The shutdown of Japan's nuclear reactors led to the loss of 420,000 jobs in 2012. The government aims for nuclear energy to account for 20-22% of Japan's power supply by 2030, despite public opposition. About half of Japan's operable nuclear reactors may never operate again, with 55% of the public opposing their restart. The Abe Cabinet faces a challenge balancing energy security, renewable sources, utility companies, economy, and safety concerns. Analysts question Japan's role in nuclear safety if the industry closes. The U.S.-Japan alliance, established post-WWII, supports U.S. military presence in Asia with 50,000 troops stationed in Japan. The U.S.-Japan alliance supports Japan's security with approximately 90 facilities and extended deterrence. The alliance may have a new rationale in shaping the environment for China's rise. There have been debates over Japan's contribution to the cost of security, with defenders pointing to strategic benefits and cost savings. Japan's increased defense spending and evolving defense policy reflect a new focus on operational readiness and flexibility, as the U.S.-Japan alliance continues to enhance its operational capability despite constraints. Japan's increased defense spending and evolving defense policy reflect a new focus on operational readiness and flexibility. The U.S.-Japan alliance has transitioned to a more balanced security partnership, with Japan engaging in collective self-defense since 2014. The Japan Self-Defense Force is now active in overseas missions, supporting global operations like counter-piracy patrols and contributing to relief efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq. The colocation of U.S. and Japanese command facilities has improved coordination and communication, as demonstrated during joint responses to natural disasters. Bilateral cooperation between the United States and Japan continues to strengthen in various aspects. The United States and Japan have enhanced bilateral cooperation in various aspects of the alliance, including ballistic missile defense, cybersecurity, and military use of space. Japan pays nearly $2 billion annually to support U.S. forces stationed in Japan. In April 2015, the two countries completed the revision of their defense guidelines, updating the framework for defense cooperation to address modern security threats and improve military interoperability. The 2015 guidelines between the United States and Japan expanded security cooperation to include defense of sea lanes and potential Japanese contributions to U.S. military operations outside East Asia. Despite opposition, the Abe Administration passed legislation to provide a legal basis for these defense reforms. Japan's implementation has been slow due to controversy surrounding the new security legislation. The new bilateral defense guidelines aim to enhance alliance coordination by establishing a standing Alliance Coordination Mechanism (ACM) involving relevant U.S. and Japanese agencies. This mechanism removes past obstacles and allows for coordinated responses to various contingencies, including disaster relief efforts and security threats like North Korea's nuclear tests. Japan's potential participation in collective self-defense has been a significant security reform under the Abe Administration. Despite Article 9 of the Japanese constitution giving up the right of collective self-defense, Japan has interpreted it to allow for maintaining a military for national defense purposes and participating in noncombat roles overseas since 1991. The Abe Administration allowed Japan's Self-Defense Forces (SDF) to participate in noncombat roles overseas since 1991. In 2014, a new interpretation allowed for collective self-defense under certain conditions, but institutional obstacles may hinder full implementation. The security legislation passed in 2015 enables Japan to engage in more cooperative security activities. Japan is shifting towards more cooperative security activities, including noncombat logistical operations and defense of sea lanes. This change could lead to a stronger defense partnership with the U.S. However, there is criticism from Chinese, South Korean media, and some Japanese groups, who view collective self-defense as aggressive. Okinawa hosts a significant portion of U.S. military presence in Japan, with negative attitudes from native Okinawans towards the bases. The negative attitudes of native Okinawans towards U.S. military bases reflect a complex history and relationships with Japan and the United States. The sustainability of the U.S. military presence in Okinawa is a critical challenge due to widespread concerns. Delays in relocating a Marine Air Base to Henoko from Futenma pose risks of accidents and opposition from Okinawans. Most Okinawans oppose the construction of a new U.S. base at Henoko for political, environmental, and quality-of-life reasons. The completion of the base has been delayed to 2025. Tokyo and Okinawa agreed to mediation in 2016, suspending construction of the Futenma replacement facility. A Japanese Supreme Court decision in 2016 ruled against revoking a landfill permit for offshore runways at Camp Schwab. The U.S. returned land to Japan in 2016. Okinawa Governor Takeshi Onaga passed away in 2018, leading to a special election won by Denny Tamaki. Denny Tamaki, son of an Okinawan woman and U.S. Marine, won a special election by a large margin to replace the late Okinawa Governor Takeshi Onaga. He vowed to pursue obstruction tactics to prevent the construction of a new U.S. base at Henoko. Calculating Tokyo's contributions to defray the cost of hosting the U.S. military in Japan is complex, with differing data and political aims affecting estimations. Assessing the value and costs of the U.S. military presence in Japan is challenging due to questions about the purpose and benefits of American bases in the country. The cost-sharing arrangement between Japan and the United States for hosting American military bases in Japan is complex and contentious. Estimates vary widely, with figures ranging from Japan covering 74.5% to over 86% of the total cost. The strategic advantage of forward-deploying advanced American military capabilities in the Asia-Pacific is often cited as a key benefit of the U.S. bases in Japan. The Japanese government contributes nearly $2 billion per year to offset the cost of U.S. forces stationed in Japan. This includes funding for utility and labor costs of U.S. bases and relocating training exercises. The United States also spends $2.7 billion annually on nonpersonnel costs for troops in Japan. Japan's host nation support for U.S. forces in Japan is set at \u00a5189 billion ($1.6 billion) per year under the SMA, with an additional \u00a520.6 billion ($175 million) per year for the FIP. The total support, including FIP funding, is estimated to be between $1.7-$2.1 billion annually. Japan also spends \u00a5128 billion ($1.2 billion) yearly on measures to support base-hosting communities. Japan pays for the majority of costs associated with international military base construction projects, including the Futenma Replacement Facility in Okinawa, Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, and facilities on Guam. This is in addition to its annual support for U.S. forces in Japan and measures to subsidize base-hosting communities. Japan pays $3.1 billion, about a third of the cost of construction for international military base projects. Japan procures over 90% of its defense acquisitions from U.S. companies, with annual U.S. Foreign Military Sales valued at about $11 billion. Recent major acquisitions include Lockheed Martin F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, Boeing KC-46 Tankers, Northrup Grumman E2D Hawkeye aircraft, General Dynamics Amphibious Assault Vehicles, and Boeing/Bell MV-22 Ospreys. Growing concerns in Tokyo about North Korean nuclear weapons and China's nuclear arsenal modernization in the 2000s led to renewed attention on the U.S. policy of extended deterrence, known as the \"nuclear umbrella.\" The U.S. and Japan initiated the Extended Deterrence Dialogue in 2010 to address Japanese perceptions of the credibility of U.S. extended deterrence. The Extended Deterrence Dialogue between the U.S. and Japan is crucial for strategic assessments and assurance. Japanese policymakers influenced the 2010 U.S. Nuclear Posture Review, discouraging declarations on the sole purpose of nuclear weapons and a no first use policy. Concerns about U.S. security guarantee could prompt Japan to reconsider its non-nuclear status. Despite Trump's openness to Japan developing nuclear weapons, Japanese leaders have consistently rejected the idea. Japanese leaders have rejected developing their own nuclear weapons despite potential negative consequences such as high costs, reduced international standing, and the risk of triggering economic sanctions. Encouraging Japan to pursue nuclear weapons could lead to diminished U.S. influence in Asia and destabilize the region by sparking a nuclear arms race. Japan's role in extended deterrence is highlighted through its ballistic missile defense capabilities, with close cooperation with the United States in BMD technology development. The U.S. and Japan have collaborated on BMD technology development since the 1980s, with Japan having the second-most potent BMD capability globally. Both countries have ground-based BMD units in Japan and BMD-capable vessels near its waters. In 2017, a joint test off Hawaii marked a milestone when a new interceptor hit a medium-range missile. The economic ties between the U.S. and Japan are crucial, as they are the world's largest and third-largest economies, accounting for nearly 30% of the global GDP. The economic relationship between the United States and Japan is significant, with Japan being a major economic partner of the U.S. Japan was the fifth-largest export market for the U.S. in 2017, accounting for 5% of total U.S. exports. Japan is also a major investor in the U.S., with more than 10% of the stock of inward U.S. direct investment coming from Japan in 2017. The economic relationship between the United States and Japan is significant, with Japan being a major economic partner of the U.S. However, the relative significance of the bilateral economic relationship has declined as other countries, like China, have become more important global economic actors. U.S. goods exports to the world grew by nearly 20% over the past decade, while exports to Japan grew by less than 2%. U.S. goods imports from the world grew by 10%, but imports from Japan fell. Structural changes in the global economic landscape, such as the growth of global supply chains, have influenced these trade patterns. The global economic downturn post-2008 financial crisis impacted U.S.-Japan trade, with trade flows peaking in 2012 and fluctuating since then. The decline in the value of the Japanese yen since 2012 has affected trade. Under the Trump Administration, U.S. trade policy has focused on \"unfair\" trading practices and bilateral trade deficits, straining economic relations with Japan. Issues include market access for U.S. products like autos. The recent shift in U.S.-Japan economic relations includes concerns over market access for U.S. products and nontariff barriers favoring Japanese goods. The trend over the past two decades has been a decrease in tension, attributed to factors such as Japan's economic slowdown and Japanese investment in the U.S. The successful conclusion of the multilateral Uruguay Round agreements in 1994 led to further market openings in Japan, established the World Trade Organization (WTO) with enhanced dispute settlement mechanisms, and shifted U.S. policymakers' focus from Japan to China as a primary trade concern. The growth in global supply chains has diffused concerns over import competition, reducing the bilateral trade deficit. Japan experienced high economic growth post-World War II until the 1980s. Japan experienced high economic growth post-World War II until the 1980s, leading to the country being dubbed an \"economic miracle.\" However, the collapse of an economic bubble in the early 1990s brought an end to rapid growth. Despite government efforts, Japan has struggled to fully recover from the crisis, facing chronic deflation and low growth. The economy was further impacted by the global financial crisis in 2008, the 2011 earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear reactor meltdowns. This prolonged economic stagnation, coupled with a shrinking and aging population, has resulted in Japan's average GDP growth consistently lagging behind the United States since the 1980s. The demographic challenge of Japan's shrinking and aging population has led to a narrative of decline, prompting Prime Minister Abe to implement \"Abenomics\" in 2012. This economic program aims to boost growth and eliminate deflation through monetary stimulus, fiscal stimulus, and structural reforms. Progress across the three arrows has been uneven, with the first arrow of monetary stimulus being implemented most aggressively. In 2013, Japan's central bank announced a loose monetary policy with 0% interest rates, quantitative easing, and a 2% inflation target. Additional measures included negative interest rates and targeting 0% interest on 10-year government bonds. Despite challenges, the Bank of Japan maintained its loose monetary policy, with inflation rates at 0.5% in 2017 and a predicted 1.2% in 2018. This contrasts with the Federal Reserve's tightening of U.S. monetary policy. The Japanese government implemented fiscal stimulus packages to stimulate the economy, including infrastructure spending after the 2011 disaster. Concerns about high public debt levels led to a sales tax increase in 2014, which some economists believe caused a recession. A planned second sales tax increase to 10% was postponed twice and is now scheduled for October 2019. The IMF urges Japan to implement fiscal policies to minimize the short-term downward pressure on demand expected from the tax hike scheduled for October 2019. Progress on structural reforms has been uneven, with more reforms needed in labor market, private investment, and labor supply diversification. Abenomics faced challenges initially with Japan slipping into recession in 2014 due to a sales tax increase. Despite doubts about its effectiveness, recent momentum suggests moderate success. The IMF recommends reinvigorated policies to stimulate long-term growth, emphasizing the need for additional productivity-enhancing measures. The IMF urges Japan to implement structural reforms in the labor market, establish a long-term plan for debt consolidation, and maintain accommodative policy for inflation targets. Japan's economy grew at 1.7% in 2017, with unemployment at 2.9%, the lowest in over two decades. Abe's economic reform includes \"womenomics\" to boost growth through women's workforce participation. Japan lags in gender equality compared to other high-income countries. In 2014, a strategist estimated that closing the gender employment gap could boost Japan's GDP by nearly 13%. The government has proposed policies to advance its \"womenomics\" initiative, such as expanding day care availability and increasing parental leave benefits. Japan's female labor force participation rate reached a record high of 66% in 2016, surpassing the United States, attributed to high demand for workers and specific initiatives. However, a lack of women in top positions has led to disappointment in the results. The Abe government has implemented \"womenomics\" initiatives like expanding day care and parental leave, but progress in increasing women in management roles has stalled. Japan ranks poorly in gender equality, with low political empowerment for women. The government has revised its target for women in senior positions to 15% in the private sector and 7% in government. Analysts suggest further policy reforms to encourage women to join and stay in the workforce. The Trump Administration imposed tariffs on U.S. steel and aluminum imports from Japan, drawing criticism from Japan due to its close security relationship with the United States. Japan argues it should be exempt from tariffs imposed for national security reasons. The Trump Administration imposed tariffs on Japanese steel and aluminum imports, causing Japan to consider retaliatory tariffs in the WTO. Washing machines and solar panels from Japan are also subject to temporary U.S. tariffs under Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974. Japan has announced retaliation in response to these safeguard measures, scheduled to take effect in 2021. Japan has not initiated WTO dispute settlement procedures regarding U.S. Section 201 or Section 232 tariff measures but is involved in disputes as a third party. The Trump Administration is conducting a national security investigation into U.S. auto imports. Tariffs on Japanese auto imports are on hold during bilateral trade negotiations, which could have a significant negative economic impact on both Japan and the U.S. Autos and auto parts make up a large portion of U.S. imports from Japan. Tariffs could disrupt Japan's auto production facilities in the U.S. Japan and the United States are in bilateral trade negotiations, with Japan hesitant due to its commitments in the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Japan will not open its agriculture market beyond TPP commitments, while the U.S. aims to increase production and employment in the motor vehicle industry. This could potentially disrupt Japan's auto production facilities in the U.S. The U.S. and Japan are in bilateral trade negotiations focused on exempting Japanese imports from increased U.S. motor vehicle tariffs. The negotiations will initially focus on goods and services before moving on to investment and other trade issues. This approach represents a shift from previous comprehensive U.S. trade agreements. The Trump Administration notified Congress of new trade talks and released proposed modifications to NAFTA, now called USMCA, raising questions about meeting U.S. trade negotiating objectives set by Congress in 2015. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), formerly NAFTA, requires implementing legislation for entry into force. Some commitments in the agreement, such as enforceable currency commitments, could pose challenges for Japan. USMCA includes stricter auto rules of origin, with 75% North American content required for duty-free treatment. U.S. interest in new talks with Japan is partly in response to Japan's recent trade negotiations. Japan led efforts to conclude the CPTPP, signed on March 8, 2018, excluding the United States. Japan also signed an FTA with the EU on July 17, potentially disadvantaging U.S. exporters in Japan's market. Prime Minister Abe's LDP holds a dominant position in Japanese politics. Prime Minister Abe's coalition with the smaller party Komeito holds a strong majority in Japan's parliament, giving them the votes to potentially amend the Constitution. Abe aims to submit a proposal for constitutional amendment within the year, but faces challenges from opposition within Komeito and the need to prioritize various provisions for change. The Abe-led LDP coalition's dominant victories in consecutive parliamentary elections from 2012 to 2017 have ended a period of political turmoil in Japan. Constitutional changes must be approved by a nationwide referendum, and public opinion polls show skepticism towards revision. The LDP and its coalition partner, the Komeito party, regained power in Japan's Lower House after three years in the minority. The LDP has ruled Japan for most of the time since 1955. Abe's strength is attributed to disarray among opposition parties and government influence on the media. The Act on Protection of Specially Designated Secrets passed in 2013 has faced criticism for its impact on freedom of the press. Since Abe took office in December 2012, Japan's press freedom ranking has dropped significantly. The government denies any attempts to influence or restrict the press. Japan faces challenges due to a low birth rate, strict immigration policies, and an aging population. The fertility rate is below the sustainable level, leading to a negative population growth rate. Japan's population growth rate is -0.2%, with a current population of 125 million projected to decrease to about 95 million by midcentury. Concerns about a labor force shortfall have risen as the elderly population increases, leading to a decrease in the working age population compared to retirees. Japan's strict immigration policies limit potential new workers, impacting resources for the government social safety net."
