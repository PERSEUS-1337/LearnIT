    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Cigars Are Not a Safe Smoking Alternative Act\". The findings are also included in the Act. Congress finds that regular cigar smoking causes cancer, pulmonary heart disease, and coronary heart disease. Cigar use in the US has increased significantly, especially among high school students. Smoking cigars is not a safe alternative to smoking. Smoking cigars is not a safe alternative to smoking cigarettes due to significantly higher levels of harmful substances emitted, including ammonia, cadmium, methylethylnitrosamine, nitrosamines, tar, and nicotine. SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON DISTRIBUTION TO YOUTH. No person may sell or distribute cigars to individuals under 18 years of age. Retailers must ensure cigars are not easily accessible to customers. Cigars can only be sold face-to-face. Restrictions on marketing and advertising of cigars to youth will be imposed to limit sales to those 18 and older. Advertising on electronic media is prohibited. The Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission are urging cigar manufacturers to stop paying for or participating in placing cigars in movies or on TV where a large portion of the audience is under 18. The definition of a cigar includes any tobacco roll wrapped in leaf tobacco or any tobacco-containing substance, including small cigars weighing less than 3 pounds per thousand and large cigars weighing more than 3 pounds per thousand. SEC. 4. HEALTH WARNINGS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in collaboration with the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, will mandate health warnings on cigar labels, packaging, and marketing materials to inform users about the health risks associated with cigars. SEC. 5. STUDIES AND REPORTS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct a study to determine the health effects of occasional cigar smoking, nicotine dependence in cigar smokers, and the biological uptake of toxic constituents in cigars. Manufacturers must report tar, nicotine, and other additives in cigar smoke to the Secretary. A report is due within one year of the Act's enactment. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will transmit a report to the President and Congress with findings from a cigar health study and recommendations for legislation. The Federal Trade Commission will also provide a report on cigar sales practices and recommendations for legislative or administrative actions. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, along with other agencies, will monitor youth access to and use of cigars. If cigars become too accessible to children or if they become a popular alternative to cigarettes for youth, the Secretary will notify Congress and recommend adjustments to tax rates or regulations to prevent this."
