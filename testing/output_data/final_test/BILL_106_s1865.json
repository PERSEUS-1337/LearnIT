Congress finds that a significant percentage of inmates in State prisons and local jails suffer from mental illness, with estimates indicating that a large number of mentally ill individuals come into contact with the criminal justice system annually. Additionally, a high percentage of mentally ill inmates have prior involvement with the justice system. Broward County, Florida, and King County, Washington, have established Mental Health Courts for nonviolent mentally ill individuals. Mental Health Courts were created to place nonviolent mentally ill offenders into treatment programs with positive results. SEC. 3. MENTAL HEALTH COURTS.

The Attorney General will provide grants for programs involving judicial supervision and services for offenders with mental illness or substance abuse disorders, including specialized training and mental health treatment. The court determines treatment in the least restrictive manner, with the possibility of dismissal or reduced sentencing upon successful completion. Centralized case management includes coordinating all cases and treatment plans for mentally ill defendants. Continuing supervision of treatment compliance is required for a term not exceeding the maximum sentence or probation. The court mandates treatment in the least restrictive way, with the chance of dismissal or reduced sentencing upon successful completion. Centralized case management oversees all cases and treatment plans for mentally ill defendants. Continuing supervision of treatment compliance is necessary for a term not exceeding the maximum sentence or probation, with a focus on continuity of psychiatric care at the end of the supervised period. \"SEC. 2202. DEFINITIONS.\" The term 'mental illness' refers to a diagnosable disorder that meets specific criteria and results in functional impairment. A 'preliminarily qualified offender with mental illness, mental retardation, or co-occurring disorders' is someone diagnosed by a mental health professional with these conditions. Designated judges can deem individuals eligible for diversion programs if they show signs of mental illness, mental retardation, or co-occurring disorders during arrest or confinement. \"SEC. 2203. ADMINISTRATION.\" The Attorney General will consult with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and other officials, utilize Department of Justice components, issue regulations for program evaluation, and require grant applicants to submit long-term strategies and funding explanations. The Attorney General will consult with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and other officials, issue regulations for program evaluation, and require grant applicants to submit long-term strategies and funding explanations. Grant applicants must certify that Federal support will supplement existing funding, identify related initiatives, consult with all affected agencies, have designated judges for supervision, and have plans for program continuation after Federal support ends. The proposed program will require methodology and outcome measures for evaluation, as well as a certification that first-time offenders without a history of mental illness will receive a mental health evaluation. To request funds under this part, the chief executive or chief justice of a State or the chief executive or chief judge of a unit of local government or Indian tribal government must submit an application to the Attorney General with required information. The federal share is outlined in Section 2205. The Federal share of a grant under this part is limited to 75 percent of total costs, unless waived by the Attorney General. Funds can only be used for new program expenses. In-kind contributions can count towards the non-Federal share. The Attorney General must ensure equitable geographic distribution of grant awards, considering rural communities, Indian tribes, and Alaska Natives. The State, Indian tribal government, or local government receiving funds must submit a report on the effectiveness of the program to the Attorney General. Technical assistance, training, and evaluation are also provided under this part. The Attorney General may provide technical assistance, training, and evaluations for programs under this part, either directly or through collaborations with other entities. Additionally, a technical amendment is made to the table of contents of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. Part V of the document outlines the establishment and funding of Mental Health Courts, including grant authority, definitions, administration, applications, federal share, geographic distribution, reporting requirements, and provisions for technical assistance, training, and evaluation. An authorization of appropriations of $10,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2001 to 2004 is included in the legislation."
