    "content": "In 2007, pharmaceutical companies spent $4.774 billion on DTC advertising, the first year of a decline in spending. This amount was six times higher than in 1996. DTC advertising of prescription drugs raised concerns in Congress, leading to proposed bills and discussions in the 110th and 111th Congress. Proponents argue that DTC ads educate consumers about medical conditions, treatments, risks, and benefits, while critics claim they minimize important information. Critics of DTC advertising argue that the ads downplay medication risks, promote expensive drugs over cheaper alternatives, and persuade patients to ignore safer options. They also suggest that information from non-industry sources would be more credible and that marketing needs can compromise objective presentations. Congress is considering arguments for and against DTC advertising of prescription drugs, highlighting the importance of context due to the inherent risks associated with all pharmaceuticals. Consumers can take drugs that interact with each other in ways not yet understood, leading to potential risks. The 2005 Vioxx controversy highlighted the incomplete data available when drugs are first approved, with approximately 100,000 excess heart attacks and sudden cardiac deaths attributed to unanticipated side effects before withdrawal from the market. Critics and supporters of DTC ads agree that the ads should meet four criteria: accessible, understandable, accurate, and up-to-date. There is consensus that the information in DTC ads should be presented in a way that average Americans can understand, and that the ads should be accurate and up-to-date. There is disagreement over the meaning of terms in DTC ads and the need for balanced discussion of risks and benefits. DTC ads are an anomaly in federal regulation, regulated by the FDA without enforcement authority similar to the FTC. The FDA regulates DTC ads without enforcement authority similar to the FTC, leading to concerns about oversight and misleading information. Critics also point to FDA's organizational structure and funding as factors in lax enforcement. Despite industry and consumer support for DTC ads, concerns raised by Congress are ongoing. An outright ban on DTC ads is unlikely due to industry interests, consumer empowerment, and free speech considerations. Interest in DTC advertising in Congress has been ongoing, with discussions in the 109th, 110th, and 111th Congresses focusing on drug safety, tax treatment of advertising expenses, risk communication, and FDA oversight. The FDA Amendments Act of 2007 included provisions for new industry fees, expanded authority for disclosures, and penalties for false ads. Members of Congress have shown interest in these issues in the broader context of healthcare costs. This report examines the current status of DTC drug advertising in the United States, analyzes issues surrounding it, and discusses potential options for Congress. It describes the types, history, and extent of direct-to-consumer drug advertising, reviews FDA's authority to regulate DTC advertising, and discusses major issues debated by proponents and opponents. Potential oversight and legislative options for Congress are also discussed. The curr_chunk discusses DTC drug advertising and its relation to larger issues in U.S. healthcare. The World Health Organization defines drug promotion as activities that induce the use of medicinal drugs. DTC advertising is described as promotional efforts by pharmaceutical companies to present drug information to the public. The FDA regulates prescription drug advertising, but Congress did not define the term in the law. DTC print advertising for prescription drugs appears in various media such as magazines, newspapers, and television. The ads fall into categories like help-seeking and reminder ads, targeting consumers without mentioning specific drugs. Reminder ads for prescription drugs focus on the product's name without mentioning the health condition it treats. These ads are primarily directed towards healthcare professionals and do not include full risk information. On the other hand, product-claim ads include the product's name and a therapeutic claim, requiring full risk information to be presented. The FDA's regulatory oversight is minimal for reminder ads and product-claim ads, but they pay more attention to product-claim ads to ensure they are not false or misleading. The pharmaceutical industry promotes drugs to physicians through various methods such as direct advertising, reminders, industry-funded seminars, and visits by drug company representatives. DTC spending increased significantly from 1996 to 2007, surpassing the growth in advertising costs. This influence on prescribing patterns is not the focus of the report, but the data shows a substantial increase in DTC advertising spending. Table 1 displays pharmaceutical industry spending on DTC advertising over the past decade, along with spending on other categories of prescription drug promotion. In 2007, drug companies allocated 41.7% of their promotional budget to DTC advertising, amounting to $4.774 billion out of $11.453 billion. However, manufacturers may actually spend more on consumer-directed promotion through methods like coupons and rebates. In May 2006, an online news reporter highlighted the prevalence of promotional tools like coupons and rebates in marketing top-selling prescription drugs. DTC advertising primarily targets television and magazines, accounting for over 90% of spending in 2007. Despite predictions of increased Internet ad spending, it only represented about 3% of DTC drug ad spending. As drug companies explore social marketing techniques, the definition of DTC advertising may evolve. The data does not cover all areas where industry promotion may occur. Product placement is a marketing tool used to promote cars and computers in TV shows and movies. There is a potential for its use with pharmaceutical products, as shown by an increase in prescription drug mentions on TV shows. However, there is a \"regulatory void\" that the FDA and FCC have yet to address regarding this practice. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act sets requirements for pharmaceuticals before they can be marketed in the US, with restrictions on labeling and advertising materials. The FDA gained authority to regulate prescription drug advertising, including DTC advertisements, and other printed material, after the 1962 Kefauver-Harris amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Congress prohibited FDA from requiring prior approval of advertisement content, but FDA needed to issue regulations and guidelines for the industry producing prescription drugs. In 1969, the FDA issued regulations governing drug advertising, requiring ads to be truthful, balanced in presenting risks and benefits, contain relevant facts, and include every risk listed in approved labeling. Companies had to submit promotional materials to the FDA for review, supported by scientific evidence and consistent with approved labeling. Ads could not recommend any unapproved uses of a drug. In 1981, the FDA allowed companies to direct ads to consumers, but regulations required all risk information to be included in product-claim print ads. However, it was unclear how TV and radio ads could comply with these regulations. The drug industry argued that including all details in a 30-second broadcast ad was challenging. The FDA allowed companies to direct ads to consumers in 1981, but regulations required all risk information to be included in product-claim print ads. The drug industry found it challenging to include all details in a 30-second broadcast ad. In 1997, the FDA issued guidance on how pharmaceutical companies could meet regulatory requirements for advertising drugs on radio and television, clarifying that DTC broadcast advertisements had to include the \"major statement\" of the product's most important information. The FDA's 1999 guidance required DTC advertisements to include the \"major statement\" of a product's key risks in the audio portion, with the option to include it in the video portion as well. The ads also had to provide information on how consumers could access the full package labeling, such as through an Internet site or toll-free number. This approach aimed to ensure consumers with different information-seeking needs could easily access product information. The FDA changed its policy on print ads due to concerns about consumers understanding the long and technical risk descriptions. Prescription drug ads must include a brief summary of side effects, contraindications, and effectiveness. The brief summary must disclose all risk-related information from the drug's labeling. In January 2004, the FDA issued three draft guidances on disclosing risk information in consumer-directed print ads. In 2004, the FDA issued draft guidances on disclosing risk information in consumer-directed print ads for drug and device firms. The guidance aimed to improve the required formats for disseminating truthful, non-misleading, and scientifically accurate information to consumers and healthcare practitioners. The draft guidance outlined the requirements for compliance with the statutory brief summary, including printing contraindications, warnings, major precautions, and common nonserious adverse reactions. The FDA issued draft guidance on disclosing risk information in consumer-directed print ads for drug and device firms in 2004. The guidance aimed to improve the formats for disseminating truthful information to consumers and healthcare practitioners. It outlined requirements for compliance with the brief summary, including contraindications, warnings, precautions, and common nonserious adverse reactions. Manufacturers were given three options for presenting this information in DTC print ads. Supporters of the draft guidance believe shorter ads would reduce costs and improve consumer understanding. Critics argue this approach may only work for certain products and suggest FDA develop guidelines for risk disclosures in discussions with healthcare professionals. The FTC recommended presenting risk information in simpler language and conducting consumer research on effective ways to provide drug risk information in DTC print ads. The FDA draft guidance addresses the presentation of risk information in print ads and clarifies jurisdiction over help-seeking ads. It provides recommendations on making disease awareness ads distinct from product advertising. Congress included provisions on DTC advertising in the FDAAA, allowing for voluntary pre-dissemination review of DTC television drug ads. Manufacturer requests for review would be advisory. The FDAAA authorized voluntary pre-dissemination review of DTC television drug ads, with manufacturers requesting reviews being assessed new fees. FDA would collect user fee funds for advisory review only if appropriated. However, FDA announced in January 2008 that it would not begin the DTC television advertisement advisory review fee program. The FDAAA authorized the Secretary to require a pre-review of television drug ads, with recommendations made to protect consumers and ensure consistency with prescribing information. The Secretary may also recommend statements addressing the drug's efficacy for specific population groups. The amended law did not authorize the Secretary to make or direct user fee funds for the program. The FDAAA authorized the Secretary to require pre-review of television drug ads and make recommendations for consumer protection. The Secretary can require specific disclosures in ads to prevent false or misleading information. The FDAAA established standards for DTC drug advertising, including clear presentation of side effects and contraindications. Civil penalties of up to $250,000 for first violation and $500,000 for subsequent violations were authorized. Repeated dissemination of the same ad before notification is considered one violation. The FDAAA established standards for DTC drug advertising, including civil penalties for violations. The law outlines procedures for notifications, reviews, subpoenas, modifications, and judicial review. Civil penalties may not be assessed if the sponsor incorporates feedback from the Secretary. The Secretary must report to Congress on DTC advertising within two years. The FDAAA established standards for DTC drug advertising, including civil penalties for violations. The law outlines procedures for notifications, reviews, subpoenas, modifications, and judicial review. Civil penalties may not be assessed if the sponsor incorporates feedback from the Secretary. The Secretary must report to Congress on DTC advertising within two years. Risk Communication must study DTC advertising as it relates to increased access to health information and decreased health disparities for these populations, and make recommendations in a report that the Secretary must submit to Congress. The Commissioner must submit to Congress, within a year of enactment, a report on how best to communicate to the public the risks and benefits of new drugs and the role of the FDAAA-required risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) in assessing such risks and benefits. As part of such study, the Commissioner shall consider the possibility of including in the labeling and any DTC advertisements of a newly approved drug or indication a unique symbol indicating the newly approved status of the drug or indication for a period after approval. Any published DTC advertisement must include the following statement printed in conspicuous text: \"You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit\" The Secretary, in consultation with the Advisory Committee on Risk Communication, must study if the statement required in published DTC advertisements is suitable for television ads and report findings to Congress. FDA received around 38,000 promotional items in 2003, with over 6,000 being consumer ads. Manufacturers submit ads to FDA for notification purposes, not for approval. FDA decides if an ad needs review. The FDA has the authority to review ads for false or misleading information and can respond with steps like untitled letters, warning letters, and injunctions. The agency can issue a Notice of Violation for misleading ads and a warning letter for more serious violations. Manufacturers submit ads to FDA for notification, not approval. The FDA can issue warning letters to advertisers who fail to respond by a deadline, and if necessary, can seek injunctions with the Department of Justice. This can lead to criminal prosecution, seizure of drugs, or withdrawal of FDA approval. In rare cases, companies have been fined for misleading advertising. The FDA views warning letters as a powerful regulatory tool and sent 21 letters in 2008. In 2008, the FDA sent 21 letters to companies regarding non-compliant promotional labeling, broadcast ads, or print ads. The FDA demands corrections such as stopping the offending ad, disseminating corrective information, and running corrective ads in the same media. Courts have ruled that the FDA should not impose unnecessary restrictions on \"commercial speech,\" leading the agency to question its authority in regulating DTC advertisements. In 2002, the FDA published a notice requesting comments on \"commercial speech\" issues under the First Amendment. The FDA requested comments on \"commercial speech\" issues under the First Amendment to ensure compliance with the law. The Government Accountability Office highlighted FDA's lack of criteria for reviewing DTC drug ads and the increasing time taken to issue regulatory letters, exposing consumers to false information. The FDA lacks criteria for reviewing DTC drug ads, leading to delays in issuing regulatory letters. The agency proposed a new user fee program to fund DTC television ad reviews, indicating limited resources. The 111th Congress will likely assess FDA's actions with its enhanced authority and potential new directions from a new administration. The FDA can review draft materials voluntarily submitted by drug manufacturers for comments on ads aimed at consumers, despite not being able to require prior approval. In 2007, the agency issued 520 advisory letters to companies regarding their proposed promotional pieces, allowing FDA to object to ads that omit or minimize risks, promote unapproved uses, or make unsubstantiated claims about drug effectiveness. The Division of Drug Marketing, Advertising, and Communications (DDMAC) within FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) handles review and enforcement activities for drug promotion. DDMAC's budget for FY2008 was over $9 million, with 63% allocated for DTC advertising review. Congress increased direct appropriations by $6 million for DTC advertising review in FY2009. Funding for regulating DTC advertising could come from fees collected under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA). In 2002, P.L. 107-188 expanded FDA's authority to include drug safety activities and authorized additional funds for DDMAC. Despite the authorization, Congress did not appropriate the funds. FDA committed to doubling staff to monitor drug side effects and provide information on new drugs. Critics argue that relying on PDUFA funding for employees has created a \"cozy relationship.\" The reliance on PDUFA funding for employees has created a \"cozy relationship\" between the FDA and drugmakers, leading to less scrutiny of ads and other activities. PDUFA IV authorized $6.25 million per year in new user fees to fund the review of DTC television ads, doubling the DDMAC budget and increasing the review of DTC ads sevenfold. The appropriators increased direct appropriations for DTC advertising review instead of allowing the collection of the new user fee. The American Medical Association and Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America have implemented ethical standards for DTC prescription drug advertising. Controversy surrounds DTC ads regarding consumer information and communication effectiveness. DTC advertising aims to inform consumers about prescription drugs, but the extent of adequate information is debated. Ads describe real conditions and symptoms, with FDA-reviewed labeling information. Surveys show high awareness of DTC ads among patients. The study on DTC ads for prescription drugs found that 96% of respondents had seen at least one ad, but concerns remain about consumer understanding and information accuracy. Only 10% read the full risk and benefit details, and not all consumers comprehend the ads they see or hear. Half of American adults read at or below an eighth-grade level, impacting health literacy and behavior. A 1995 Emory University study found that 42% of patients couldn't understand basic medication instructions. Health literacy researchers now see how reading levels affect care-seeking and medication adherence. The historical development of DTC drug advertising adds to these challenges. The FDA regulations require drug ads to contain FDA-approved labeling language for doctors. This language is often too complex for consumers to understand. Studies show that DTC ads may not provide accurate or balanced information, with few acknowledging competing treatments or drug effectiveness rates. The American Medical Association has reviewed ad content due to concerns about information accuracy. The AMA Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs reviewed studies on ad content accuracy and physician attitudes towards DTC advertisements. They found that 44% of promotional material to physicians could lead to improper prescribing. The Council recommended physicians educate patients, resist pressure to prescribe unnecessary drugs, and remain vigilant against misleading DTC advertising. Language and persuasion experts discuss the use of celebrities in pharmaceutical ads as experts, despite lacking expertise. The American Medical Association issued guidelines in 2006 to address concerns about misleading direct-to-consumer drug advertisements featuring celebrities and non-expert physicians. The guidelines urged advertisers to avoid casting actors as physicians and to include prominent disclaimers if they do. Additionally, the AMA advised its members to refrain from appearing in direct-to-consumer promotions. The growing body of scientific research suggests that direct-to-consumer drug advertising may not be as educational as proponents claim. Consumers want more quantitative information about side effects in drug ads. Health economist Frank notes that DTC ads for depression have led more people to seek treatment. Recommendations for specific changes to FDA regulations are made. PhRMA, representing U.S. pharmaceutical companies, views DTC advertising as a powerful educational tool. Despite positive effects, challenges remain, with critics questioning the adequacy of consumer information provided in ads. Tauzin introduces PhRMA's guidelines on DTC advertising, emphasizing responsibilities beyond legal compliance. Concerns about understandability, completeness, and accuracy persist, suggesting the need for more informative ads. DTC ads prompt discussions among patients and clinicians, but opinions on their usefulness vary. Surveys show that 43% of respondents seek more information about a drug or medical condition from their physicians after seeing an ad. Additionally, 32% of respondents discuss advertised drugs with their doctors. Articles have raised concerns about \"disease mongering\" and the impact of drug ads on perceptions of illness. In a 2002 survey, FDA found that DTC ads can influence physicians' practices and patient relationships. While 72% of physicians believed that DTC ads increased patient awareness of treatments, 75% thought it led to overestimation of drug efficacy. Some physicians, especially primary care doctors, viewed the overall influence of DTC ads as negative. The 2002 FDA survey found that DTC ads can improve patient compliance with physician advice, particularly if physicians remind patients to take the medication as prescribed. Little research on the clinical consequences of DTC advertising was noted. DTC ads encourage patients to seek medical advice for underdiagnosed conditions like urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction. Some evidence supports that DTC ads influence diagnoses and treatment decisions. DTC ads influence diagnoses and treatment decisions. A Harvard/Harris survey found that 35% of consumers discussed advertised drugs with their doctors, leading to new concerns, possible treatment changes, and new diagnoses, with 41% being for \"high priority\" conditions. However, another Harvard health researcher criticized the study's industry funding and conclusion that DTC advertising is benign, pointing out that those heavily influenced by ads were not more likely to have new conditions diagnosed or confirmed. The Harvard/Harris group found that patients requesting advertised drugs led to prescriptions 39% of the time, even when doctors believed another drug would be equally effective. Little statistical evidence exists on the harm from DTC ads, but adverse effects can occur due to harmful reactions in a small proportion of patients. DTC ads for heavily advertised drugs can lead to prescriptions for patients, even when doctors believe another drug would be equally effective. Adverse effects can occur in a small proportion of patients, with risks often not identified until after extensive use. This poses a risk for individuals with characteristics or conditions not carefully researched for the drug. Once approved, a physician can prescribe the drug for any purpose, including off-label uses such as in children or for different diseases. Safety and effectiveness for these uses may not be well understood. Off-label use of drugs, not FDA-approved, can be beneficial but poses risks as effects on unresearched groups or conditions are not fully understood. DTC ads may lead patients to request drugs for symptoms of a different disease, potentially causing harm due to incorrect treatment. The persuasive power of DTC ads can lead patients to request prescription drugs for minor health issues, contributing to the \"medicalizing of health.\" Patients may insist on advertised drugs over more appropriate options, potentially leading to ineffective treatment choices. Marcia Angell criticizes DTC drugs as expensive me-too drugs with questionable benefits. DTC advertising has a positive ROI for most drugs, with one brand showing a return of $6.50 per advertising dollar. Studies suggest that DTC ads influence consumer behavior, but precise data on their impact is hard to come by. A study of 1996-1999 data found that DTC advertising yielded an additional $4.20 in sales per dollar spent. Economists believe that DTC advertising has led consumers to choose more expensive drugs over lower-priced ones. Factors influencing drug spending include increased prescriptions for an aging population, new medical practices, and treating previously untreated patients. Assessing appropriate spending levels involves more than just considering drug prices. To assess appropriate spending levels, it is important to consider more than just the amount consumers spend on advertised drugs. DTC advertising supporters argue that it can increase drug spending but reduce healthcare spending in other areas. Studies suggest this can be the case, with clot-busting drugs saving money by reducing hospitalization and other care needs. However, the cost-effectiveness of pharmaceuticals depends on the context and comparison. Consumer expectations from DTC ads may lead to inaccurate conclusions about drug safety. A 1999 study found that many people incorrectly believed that only \"completely safe\" drugs could be advertised and that such ads had FDA approval. However, FDA-approved drugs carry risks and may be harmful if used improperly. Despite lacking FDA endorsement, both industry and consumers support direct-to-consumer (DTC) ads. Industry aims to boost sales, while consumers want to be involved in their health decisions. Due to advancements in technology and free speech considerations, a complete ban on DTC ads is unlikely. Members of Congress have shown interest in regulating DTC advertising in relation to drug safety, tax treatment, risk communication, and FDA oversight. Legislators have options to address concerns about DTC advertising, including urging FDA to be more aggressive in reviewing ad content and enforcing regulations. FDAAA directed FDA to increase dissemination of drug safety information to the public, including clinical trial results and labeling decisions. FDA is prohibited from requiring pre-publication review of ads but must study how to communicate risk and benefit information effectively. The FDA is prohibited from requiring pre-publication review of ads but must review them post-publication to identify inaccurate or imbalanced risk and benefit information. Critics suggest alternatives to consumers relying solely on DTC advertisement for drug information. Experts have proposed alternatives to consumers relying on DTC ads for drug information. Suggestions include FDA or independent sources countering misinformation, coordinating information dissemination with other agencies, providing greater access to post-marketing data, and clarifying control over ad content. The FDA should clarify its control over ad content to the public and conduct public education campaigns to explain the risks and benefits of different drug classes. Additionally, the FDA should study consumer reactions to ads and create drug information to counter any biased or unbalanced information. The FDA could establish an advisory panel to recommend standards for prescription drug ads or encourage self-regulation in the drug industry. Some in the industry believe another panel is unnecessary and that they can voluntarily adopt their own standards. Until FDAAA granted expanded authority, the FDA could only object to ads without taking further action. Until the expanded authority from FDAAA, the FDA had limited options when objecting to drug ads, such as sending untitled letters or seizing products. Congress could encourage the FDA to use new tools for increased enforcement. Options include a total ban on DTC drug advertising or increasing the FDA's authority for stronger action. The FDA's current authority may exceed its resources for consumer education and DTC advertising enforcement. To increase funds for FDA enforcement activities, Congress could amend the user fee statute, require industry to bear the cost of direct-to-consumer advertising oversight through user fees, create an industry-financed fund for independent activities, or provide appropriations that match the task. The most extreme approach would be to ban DTC advertising, but opponents have raised constitutional issues. Opponents have raised constitutional issues regarding the ban on DTC advertising. Some members of the federal drug advisory panel recommended banning DTC ads for COX-2 inhibitors, with some suggesting a ban on all DTC advertising. Various organizations have proposed a draft Public Health Protection Act to ban DTC advertising, including additional warnings for consumers. Opponents argue that a ban on DTC advertising is unconstitutional. Suggestions include adding warnings about limited testing, FDA not certifying effectiveness, and changes to tax code. Congress could require FDA approval of DTC ads before release, categorizing them based on potential harm. FDAAA authorized the Secretary to take action. FDAAA expanded the Secretary's authority to require labeling changes and allowed FDA to impose punitive sanctions against companies that violate the law. Congress may review FDA's implementation of FDAAA provisions and assess the need for more explicit authority regarding changes to advertisements. The FDA has the authority to impose penalties for false advertising. Congress may need to assess if the penalties are sufficient to ensure compliance. Drug companies must report potential issues with drugs regularly. FDA scientists have raised concerns about the overwhelming amount of data submitted by companies. Congress could direct FDA to improve the process for flagging safety data. Currently, FDA lacks the authority to require studies that closely monitor patients and their treatments and outcomes. Congress, through FDAAA, increased FDA authority for postmarket studies. FDA may need additional authority to enhance post-market study requirements, strengthen risk evaluation strategies, and require specific surveillance and studies for initial drug approval. Ray Woosley emphasized the importance of improving a new drug's benefit-risk ratio. The FDAAA increased FDA authority for postmarket studies and may require additional authority to enhance post-market study requirements. Suggestions were made to improve understanding of a new drug's benefit-risk ratio before widespread use, including data collection on all new drugs and potential bans on consumer advertising for a period after approval. Some suggest limiting the number, type, or content of drug ads to prevent false or misleading information. There are concerns about the placement of ads, with proposals to restrict adult-themed ads to adult programming. Suggestions include changes to tax laws to decrease drug companies' incentive to advertise, such as prohibiting tax deductions for DTC advertising expenses. Some propose denying tax deductions for drug ad expenses for manufacturers not participating in rebate agreements with the government. This is to align rebates with advertising costs and protect public health. As chemical and manufacturing knowledge advances, societal standards for drug safety and effectiveness are questioned. The government is tasked with ensuring drug safety, but complexities arise regarding the level of safety and effectiveness desired, information transparency for consumers and doctors, and the role of direct-to-consumer advertising in the healthcare landscape. The healthcare landscape includes issues such as drug approval, comparative effectiveness research, off-label prescribing, drug research and development, risk communication, and access to medical care."
