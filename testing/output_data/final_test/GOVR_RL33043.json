    "content": "Federal officials, policy analysts, and homeland security experts are concerned about the current state of chemical facility security, labeling them as the greatest danger of a potential terrorist attack in the country. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has identified chemical facilities as a high priority critical infrastructure sector. However, the current security efforts, which involve a mix of local, state, and federal laws, industry requirements, voluntary actions, and outreach programs, are deemed insufficient by the DHS. Stakeholders face challenges in creating uniform and effective security measures due to various costs and requirements. Many debate whether federal legislation is necessary for chemical facility security, with some arguing for state or local control while others emphasize the national importance due to the potential catastrophic impact of a terrorist attack. Policymakers may view chemical facility security as a matter of national homeland security best addressed at the federal level. Critical issues surrounding chemical facility security legislation include determining which facilities should be protected based on risk analysis, prioritizing risks, and enhancing security activities. Selection criteria may involve assessing terrorist threats, chemical hazards, quantities, and proximity to populations. Security regulation for some facilities is governed by specific statutes. Regulation of chemical facilities is established under statutes like the MTSA and SDWA. Some states have their own laws addressing chemical facility security. Potential security enhancements include grants, vulnerability assessments, federal standards, and technology use. Proposed legislation in the 109th Congress aims to address concerns regarding chemical facility security. Several bills have been introduced in both chambers addressing chemical facility security, including S. 2145, S. 2486, H.R. 1562, H.R. 2237, H.R. 4999, and H.R. 5695. These bills require vulnerability assessments and security plans, with varying details. Contention exists over the consideration of inherently safer technologies, with S. 2486 and H.R. 2237 explicitly addressing this issue. Many organizations are working to secure chemical facilities through voluntary or semi-voluntary efforts, state or local regulations, and federal security legislation. Industry trade associations have also been involved in developing and promoting security measures. Industry trade associations have developed security best practices for their member companies, including vulnerability assessments, security plans, and external auditing. The American Chemistry Council's Responsible Care program is a widely discussed security requirement, recognized by DHS as an Alternative Security Program for MTSA compliance. ACC companies represent a significant portion of chemical production, with other manufacturers and distributors participating in different trade associations. Approximately 20% of high-risk chemical facilities identified by DHS do not participate in voluntary security programs, with concerns raised about the adequacy of such programs in preventing terrorist attacks. Critics argue that profit-driven corporations in the chemical industry may not prioritize security measures effectively. Some experts find voluntary security plans vague and difficult to verify, while others doubt their ability to deter determined attackers. Supporters of voluntary efforts in chemical facility security cite the large investments made in site security since 2001, with over $2 billion invested by ACC member companies. Some facilities have voluntarily made changes such as switching chemicals, altering manufacturing processes, or reducing chemical quantities on-site. Industry representatives argue that government mandates are not necessary to prompt effective security measures. New Jersey, Maryland, and New York have enacted security laws specifically targeting chemical facilities. The New Jersey Domestic Security Preparedness Task Force and Maryland's Hazardous Material Security Act mandate chemical facilities to comply with security standards and perform vulnerability assessments. Facilities must report to the respective state departments for oversight. Under New York's Anti-Terrorism Preparedness Act of 2004, the state Office of Homeland Security reviews chemical plant vulnerabilities and can recommend security improvements. The law excludes certain facilities and is enforced by the Department of Environmental Conservation. Policymakers may prefer local development of chemical facility security measures, but industry concerns about potential regulatory inconsistencies exist. A patchwork of regulations could lead to varying security standards for chemical facilities across states, potentially creating uneven security costs for out-of-state competitors. Policymakers may prefer a national standard to ensure consistent security measures, especially for facilities near state borders that pose risks across state lines. Congress has passed environmental and safety statutes that may offer additional security benefits, but security requirements for chemical facilities vary among different laws. The federal government, including the Department of Homeland Security, collaborates with the private sector on security measures. The Department of Homeland Security and other agencies work with the private sector to enhance chemical facility security through a public/private partnership. The 107th Congress enacted the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002, assigning the Coast Guard the responsibility of securing U.S. ports, including chemical facilities within ports. 238 chemical facilities must comply with the MTSA. The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act (P.L. 107-188) amended the Safe Drinking Water Act to require vulnerability assessments and emergency response plans for community water systems serving more than 3,300 people. Plans for addressing vulnerabilities were not required, and assessments must be submitted to the EPA. Some federal funding is provided to aid in assessing and addressing critical vulnerabilities. Drinking water systems storing large quantities of chemicals may be considered chemical facilities under the SDWA. The emergency response plans required under the SDWA are not equivalent to the security plans required under MTSA. Federal regulations for chemical facilities have been developed to address environmental releases, public health, and worker safety. Some activities to meet these regulations may also enhance security by reducing consequences of a release or vulnerabilities. Specific security regulations exist for certain chemical facilities, focusing on protection against criminal activities rather than terrorist attacks. Examples include regulations for liquified natural gas storage facilities, hazardous liquids pipeline pumping stations, and storage sites for hazardous materials shippers. Federal regulations for chemical facilities address environmental releases, public health, and worker safety. Specific security regulations focus on protection against criminal activities. The EPA and DHS work on increasing chemical facility security through vulnerability assessment tools. The EPA developed RAM-W for water systems, while the DHS developed RAMCAP for critical asset protection in the chemical industry. The DHS, as the lead federal agency for the chemicals sector, visits selected chemical facilities to prioritize outreach efforts. Directive 7 prioritizes outreach to chemical facilities by dividing them into four tiers based on DHS metrics. Only 272 facilities are in the top two tiers, with visits conducted by U.S. Coast Guard or DHS representatives. Site assessments have been done at 38 high-consequence facilities, with plans for 50 more in FY2006. The Buffer Zone Protection Program provides funding to enhance security around critical infrastructure facilities. The Chemical Sector Coordinating Council (CSCC) was formed in May 2004 as a point of contact for DHS to communicate with the chemicals sector. It is comprised of 16 chemical associations. DHS has identified 259 chemical facilities eligible for buffer zone protection under the 2005 BZPP criteria. The Chemical--Buffer Zone Protection Grant Program, established in 2006, provides $25 million in funding to nine states to enhance buffer zone protection planning for chemical manufacturing facilities. The DHS is collaborating with the Chemical Sector Coordinating Council (CSCC) on a Chemical Sector-Specific Plan as part of the National Infrastructure Protection Plan. They are also piloting the Homeland Security Information Network -- Chemical for information sharing. Policymakers may consider new legislation for additional chemical facility security, addressing issues like coverage, overseeing agency, and security measures. Establishing a definition of chemical facilities is crucial for potential legislation on security measures. The definition will determine the scope of facilities included and the level of security regulations needed. Different interpretations exist, ranging from facilities involved in chemical manufacture to any site containing chemicals. This section explores various methods for selecting chemical facilities for security measures. This section discusses mechanisms for selecting chemical facilities for security regulation based on a list of chemicals, potential consequences of a terrorist attack, or industrial classification. A comprehensive definition may require a combination of approaches. Environmental legislation often lists chemicals for regulation and requires facilities containing them to be regulated. Examples include the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act and the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. The challenge in selecting chemicals for security regulation lies in determining which ones to include, as existing federal lists may not be suitable. For example, the Department of Transportation list contains thousands of chemicals, not all of which pose a security risk. The OSHA process safety standard focuses on highly hazardous chemicals, while the EPCRA lists hundreds of chemicals for first responder safety in case of accidents. The Clean Air Act requires a risk management plan for facilities with certain thresholds. Section 112(r) mandates a risk management plan for facilities with threshold quantities of 140 chemicals due to their potential for acute offsite consequences. The plan requires estimating the potentially affected population in a worst-case scenario release, although not for terrorist incidents. Hazardous chemical lists are based on inherent hazards like toxicity or flammability. The hazardous chemical lists used for risk management plans are based on inherent hazards like toxicity or flammability. However, these lists may exclude certain chemicals, such as explosives, and exempt materials already regulated under other safety regulations. Congress may need to consider including these exempted materials in terrorism contexts. Editing the lists to focus on a shorter list of chemicals or adjusting them to meet security needs may be necessary. To enhance chemical facility security, policymakers may need to develop a new, shorter list of chemicals specifically for security purposes. This list could be maintained by federal agencies like EPA or DHS, with the option for Congress to specify particular chemicals in statute. Another criterion for addressing chemical facilities could be the potential consequences of a terrorist attack. The severity of adverse consequences in a terrorist attack on chemical facilities is a key concern. Experts debate on how to assess the likelihood and severity of these consequences, their relative importance, and whether they can be compared or ranked. Prioritizing chemical facilities by risk could maximize security spending benefits, as suggested by DHS Secretary Chertoff. A risk-prioritization approach may help define risk thresholds for chemical facilities. The risk-prioritization approach may help define thresholds for chemical facilities, determining which ones should receive federal resources or attention based on factors like potential security increase and program cost. The complexity of determining risk thresholds involves deciding on appropriate metrics, such as considering worst-case scenarios or more probable releases. DHS uses a different methodology to assess potentially affected people in different scenarios. The DHS and EPA use different methodologies to assess potentially affected populations in various scenarios. The EPA's worst-case scenario predictions are conservative and used for planning by emergency response organizations. Some analysts believe these figures are a good starting point for prioritizing chemical facility risks, while others argue they overestimate casualties. DHS modeling has shown lower potential affected numbers than regulatory calculations. There are also concerns that RMP figures may underestimate casualties in a terrorist attack. Some argue that RMP figures may underestimate casualties from a terrorist attack due to modeling based on a single chemical release. Extensive modeling of facility location, population distribution, and other factors may be needed to determine likely casualties. Defining chemical facilities by industrial classification aligns with national security directives. Key Assets and Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD-7) categorize critical infrastructure into specific sectors with federal agencies assigned lead roles. For example, the \"energy\" sector and \"chemical and hazardous materials\" sector are identified. However, the classification of chemical facilities may not align neatly with industrial categories or infrastructure sectors. The Department of Labor uses the North American Industrial Classification System. The Department of Labor uses the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) to classify employment and economic data by industry. NAICS codes are hierarchical, with subsets of codes containing fewer digits. Facilities self-assign NAICS codes, which may lead to errors. Federal agencies use industry classification schemes to assess economic activity. Defining chemical facilities by industry classification may result in a \"one size fits all\" approach to security. Various industry groups criticize the \"one size fits all\" approach to chemical facility security, as it may force low-risk facilities to increase security based on industry classification rather than actual risk. This could be counterproductive, impacting economic efficiency without enhancing security. Smaller facilities may struggle to meet requirements designed for larger ones, potentially hindering operations. The representation of chemical-using industries depends on legislative definitions, with some experts advocating for all facilities posing a risk to surrounding populations to be included in security legislation. Others suggest a tiering system based on consequences. Some experts advocate for including all facilities posing a risk to surrounding populations in security legislation, while others propose a tiering system based on consequences. Using EPA RMP data as a case study, this section discusses the types of infrastructure sectors found in the RMP program and the impacts of applying a consequence threshold to reduce the number of affected facilities. The EPA RMP program includes infrastructure sectors grouped by NAICS codes. Lowering consequence thresholds increases the number of facilities in water, food, and agriculture sectors. The entire population may not be affected by a single chemical release, as meteorological factors determine the direction of the release. Lowering consequence thresholds increases the number of facilities in various sectors, such as water, food, and agriculture. The direction of a chemical release is influenced by meteorological factors, and worst-case scenarios may not consider emergency response measures. Sector-specific legislation may leave some security risks unaddressed, requiring flexibility in chemical facility security regulations. Lowering consequence thresholds increases the number of facilities affected by chemical facility security regulations. The number of facilities rises non-linearly as the threshold decreases, as shown in Table 1 from the EPA RMP National Database. Worst-case scenarios do not account for emergency response measures or the specific direction of a chemical release. Chemical facility security legislation with a low threshold may impact smaller facilities like agricultural retailers or water treatment systems. The water sector's significant presence in the RMP chemical facility universe raises concerns about the adequacy of existing security measures under the SDWA. The water sector comprises a large portion of facilities under lower consequence thresholds, prompting questions about the sector's security. The water sector, comprising a large portion of facilities under lower consequence thresholds, raises concerns about the adequacy of existing security measures. Including all chemical facilities equally in a security program may burden low-risk facilities, as smaller ones may struggle to meet security requirements due to fiscal limitations. The debate over which federal agency should possess chemical facility security oversight responsibilities continues. Some analysts argue that the EPA's historical relationship with the chemical industry and specific facilities makes it well-suited for overseeing chemical facility security. However, others believe that the EPA may not be the best oversight body due to potential conflicts with the industry. The debate over the appropriate regulatory authority for chemical facility security continues. Some argue for DHS oversight of chemical facility security, citing expertise and existing relationship. Opponents fear security measures without environmental considerations may have adverse effects. Analysts suggest a combined approach involving DHS and EPA for oversight. The extent of security measures at chemical facilities is a contentious issue, with debates on auditing vulnerability assessments, federal inspection of security measures, and consideration of alternative approaches like safer technologies. Existing laws have varied approaches to vulnerability assessments, with some requiring remediation of identified vulnerabilities while others do not. Under the MTSA, the DHS has authority to inspect port facilities, assess security plans, and ensure compliance with security standards. Policymakers may consider requiring vulnerability assessments for all chemical facilities and granting federal oversight agencies the authority to validate security plans and assess compliance. The MTSA covers a broad definition of chemical facilities, posing a logistical burden for federal agencies to inspect them regularly. Current staffing may be insufficient for this task, leading to challenges in implementing federal auditing and validation of security. Delegating auditing responsibilities to state or local officials or authorizing third-party auditors could alleviate the burden on federal agencies. DHS Secretary Chertoff supports considering third-party validation, with fees from such a program potentially offsetting auditing costs. Critics question the impartiality of outside auditing for chemical facility security. Experts suggest owner/operator certification with criminal liabilities for noncompliance. Chemical trade associations advocate for risk-based security requirements with clear federal guidelines. The DHS has requested federal assistance and access to records for background checks to meet security standards. Secretary Chertoff emphasizes risk-based prioritization in homeland security. Core principles for chemical facility security include risk levels, performance standards set by DHS, and flexibility in security measures. Some argue for stringent standards like repelling armed assaults. Some experts advocate for performance-based security standards in chemical facilities, similar to those in the nuclear power industry. Current regulations for certain facilities are prescriptive, covering procedures, enclosures, communications, and more. There is debate on whether security requirements should be prescriptive or performance-based, and if they should be mandated by legislation or left to the implementing agency's discretion. The use of Inherently Safer Technologies is also being considered. Inherently Safer Technologies involve altering chemical processes to reduce hazards and security risks. Advocates argue for their application to minimize hazardous materials and increase safety. They suggest federal legislation should mandate consideration of these technologies to address vulnerabilities in chemical facilities. Industry trade associations resist legislation mandating the use of inherently safer technology, citing potential negative impacts on process safety if incorrectly implemented. Concerns include the need for more connections and smaller shipments, leading to greater risks for workers. Trade associations express concern about the implementation of inherently safer technology decisions by process safety experts. There is a potential risk transfer between chemical facilities when implementing process changes, such as converting chlorine to sodium hypochlorite for wastewater treatment. This may reduce risks at one facility but increase risks at another point in the supply chain. Experts in process engineering have raised concerns about the development and implementation of inherently safer technology in chemical processes. They argue that while some examples exist, there is a lack of defined metrics for comparing technologies for inherent safety. Safety regulations at the state and local level, such as in New Jersey, require the consideration of inherently safer technology in chemical facilities. The Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act and recent chemical facility security standards in New Jersey mandate the consideration of inherently safer technology for new and existing processes. Contra Costa County, California also requires this consideration. Policymakers should assess if new processes or facilities differ from existing ones and may benefit from security requirements for inherently safer technologies. The consideration of inherently safer technologies is mandated by the Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act and recent chemical facility security standards. Penalties for noncompliance with new security requirements may include fines or prevention of facility operation by the federal agency implementing the program. The U.S. Coast Guard has the authority to stop the operation of a chemical facility if it is not compliant with security requirements under MTSA. Stakeholder concerns may focus on the appeal process for such authority. This could impact the facility's financial viability, creating an incentive for compliance. Policymakers should align chemical facility security measures with existing state and federal regulations to avoid duplication and determine the relationship between federal and state standards. Legislation such as MTSA and SDWA mandate different security requirements for chemical facilities. MTSA, enforced by the U.S. Coast Guard, requires both vulnerability assessment and remediation, with the authority to close non-compliant facilities. On the other hand, SDWA, implemented by the EPA, only requires vulnerability assessment. Aligning regulations for all chemical facilities could bridge these differences and ensure consistent security standards. Facilities that qualify as a chemical facility may need to increase their site security activities. Options include aligning security standards for all chemical facilities or exempting facilities regulated under MTSA or SDWA. States have their own chemical facility security legislation, and policymakers need to consider how federal regulations align with state requirements. The perception of the likelihood and consequence of a terrorist attack on chemical facilities varies by state. Some argue that these facilities pose a homeland security threat, while others believe they generally reside within acceptable risk levels. Industry associations suggest that new federal legislation should supersede state laws to avoid a patchwork of regulations and increased compliance costs. Some argue that federal regulation on chemical facility security may preempt state laws, while others believe states should be able to impose stricter security requirements. Voluntary efforts are also considered in enhancing chemical facility security. Some chemical facilities engage in security activities voluntarily, and policymakers may consider rewarding these actions. Potential mechanisms for recognizing voluntary efforts include economic offsets, exemptions from regulations, and equivalency with regulatory requirements. However, some analysts argue that voluntary efforts should not be rewarded, as there is already a business incentive for facilities to improve security. Four legislative approaches for chemical facility security emerge, including maintaining the current approach and increasing regulations. Some analysts and industry representatives believe that the current mix of voluntary and mandatory activities in chemical facility security is sufficient. DHS Secretary Chertoff also acknowledges the power of market forces in enhancing security. Supporters of the status quo do not advocate for new legislation but suggest that current security activities focusing on public/private partnerships are effective. The current security activities, based on public/private partnerships with the DHS and federal support for local first responders and law enforcement, are deemed effective by some analysts and industry representatives. However, critics argue that the voluntary measures may not adequately address the risk posed by chemical facilities, leaving those not participating vulnerable to attack. The absence of federal legislation could lead states to regulate chemical facilities based on perceived risk levels. States may regulate facilities at risk to increase security measures. Federal support for chemical facilities could be enhanced through various funding options like tax incentives or direct support from DHS. Policymakers could consider directing resources to high-risk or smaller facilities to improve security. Some suggest that chemical facilities should bear the costs of security measures as they are for-profit companies using hazardous materials. Uneven security levels across industry sectors may persist due to voluntary participation, leading to debates on federal mandates for higher protection levels. Some argue that for-profit companies using hazardous materials should bear the costs of security measures, potentially passing on the expenses to consumers. Policymakers may need to strengthen laws to ensure national security needs are met, with debates on whether the Clean Air Act provides sufficient authority for regulating chemical facilities for security issues. Codifying security language into existing environmental and safety programs could provide statutory authority for the EPA to oversee chemical facility security. The conflicting regulatory relationship between the EPA and OSHA may hinder effective security measures due to historical disagreements. Augmenting current laws with additional authorities may not address concerns about accurately assessing the number of people at risk from chemical facilities. The EPA's oversight of chemical facility security may not cover all facilities, leading to concerns about the accuracy of risk assessments. Questions arise about the expertise of EPA and OSHA in homeland security, as well as the readiness of DHS staff to assess chemical risks. One approach to enhancing chemical security is to establish a federal agency with statutory authority to oversee chemical facility security. This new security program could be modeled after existing programs like MTSA or SDWA, addressing industry concerns about the scope of security measures. Coordination with existing programs and outreach efforts would be essential. In establishing a new chemical facility security program, Congress could mandate security measures or leave details to the implementing agency, allowing for flexibility in addressing changing threats. Critics may argue that statutory standards are either too rigorous or not rigorous enough. In designing a new federal chemical facility program, policymakers must consider aligning requirements with existing security legislation to ease coordination. Questions arise regarding precedence between programs, compliance exemptions, and potential preemption of state and local laws. Efforts could incorporate current state standards or establish new ones, with the possibility of creating a federal program with less stringent requirements than existing state programs. Creating a new federal chemical facility security program raises concerns about preempting state regulations, potentially reducing security standards. Policymakers must decide whether to incorporate current voluntary efforts or establish new standards, balancing uniformity with state autonomy. Critics may challenge the program if it allows exemptions for facilities already engaged in security efforts. Critics may challenge the new federal chemical facility security program for not setting stringent enough standards or penalizing facilities already taking steps to reduce vulnerability. Developing an assessment methodology for voluntary security efforts could help compare them with new program requirements. The EPA RMP*INFO database provides information on industrial classification and worst-case scenario data reported by facilities. The EPA RMP database contains data on industrial classification and worst-case scenario information reported by facilities. CRS used NAICS codes to identify infrastructure sectors potentially affected by chemical processes, converting codes from 1997 to 2002 for clarity. Different approaches to sorting NAICS codes into sectors can impact policy decisions regarding infrastructure sectors. See Table 2 for a list of NAICS codes used for modeling infrastructure sectors. The EPA RMP database provides data on industrial classification and worst-case scenario information reported by facilities. CRS used NAICS codes to identify infrastructure sectors potentially affected by chemical processes."
