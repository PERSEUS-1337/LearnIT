    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Improving Care for Vulnerable Older Citizens through Workforce Advancement Act of 2014\". Congress finds that a significant number of Americans age 65 and older require person-centered, coordinated care due to chronic conditions. Direct-care workers play a crucial role in providing hands-on long-term care and personal assistance to elders and individuals with disabilities or chronic conditions in the United States. Eldercare and disability services positions make up nearly one-third of healthcare jobs in the US, with over 4 million direct-care workers. By 2020, home- and community-based DCWs are expected to outnumber facility workers by more than 2 to 1. A 2008 report called for new care delivery models to address the aging population. The Institute of Medicine report on nursing recommended nurses practice to the full extent of their education and training, emphasizing collaborative team-based care models. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act highlights the importance of improving care coordination and integration to lower costs. Lowering costs through better coordination and integration of services, especially for individuals with multiple chronic conditions, necessitates the development of new care models for long-term services and supports. SEC. 423. DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM ON CARE COORDINATION AND SERVICE DELIVERY. A new program is added to the Older Americans Act for demonstrating care coordination and service delivery. The Assistant Secretary will establish a demonstration program under the Older Americans Act to award grants for projects focusing on care coordination and service delivery redesign for older individuals with chronic illness or at risk of institutional placement. This includes testing new models of care coordination, deploying advanced aides for improved care efficiency, and providing career advancement opportunities for direct-care workers. The demonstration program under the Older Americans Act will include 6 projects focusing on utilizing direct-care workers to promote smooth transitions in care, prevent hospital readmissions, and improve care efficiency. Two demonstration projects will focus on maintaining and improving the health of individuals with multiple chronic conditions and long-term care needs. Direct-care workers will assist in monitoring health status, ensuring compliance with care, and educating the individual and family caregivers.
