    "content": "Experts predict that Afghanistan will continue to be a major global producer of opium poppy, opium, heroin, and cannabis resin. In 2012, Afghanistan cultivated over 94% of the world's opium poppy and produced around 95% of the world's opium. The country has been designated as a major illicit drug-producing or drug-transit country due to its significant role in drug production and trafficking. Counternarcotics efforts in Afghanistan are described as challenging, with wide-ranging consequences for economic, political, and regional security priorities. The Taliban in Afghanistan is heavily involved in drug trafficking to finance their operations, generating an estimated $100 million to $155 million annually from the drug trade. The government relies on foreign donors for assistance in addressing the drug problem. The U.S. government has spent over $7 billion in counternarcotics assistance to Afghanistan since 2002, with funds appropriated by Congress for civilian, military, and law enforcement programs. Concerns have been raised by some Members of Congress about the future direction of U.S. counternarcotics efforts in Afghanistan as coalition combat operations come to an end in 2014. The U.S. government has allocated significant funds for counternarcotics efforts in Afghanistan since 2002. Concerns have been raised about the future direction of these efforts as coalition combat operations end in 2014. President Obama highlighted key challenges facing Afghanistan's drug situation in 2014. The withdrawal of international forces from Afghanistan requires continued international support for counternarcotics programs to curb illegal drug cultivation and production of opium. Concerns have been raised about the sustainability of U.S. counternarcotics efforts following the military transition. The U.S. updated its counternarcotics strategy for Afghanistan in late 2012 to address transition-oriented objectives, including transferring security and counternarcotics responsibilities to the Afghan government. Key priorities include strengthening Afghan government capacity for counternarcotics efforts and disrupting drug-related funding to the insurgency. Implementation plans beyond 2014 are uncertain due to ongoing negotiations on the Afghanistan Bilateral Security Agreement. The Afghanistan Bilateral Security Agreement is being negotiated, with changes in counternarcotics efforts expected. The NATO-led Resolute Support Mission will have reduced capacity for counternarcotics, and military resources for counternarcotics operations are anticipated to diminish in 2014. The transition in counternarcotics operations in Afghanistan in 2014 has led to reduced support functions from U.S. and coalition forces, impacting DEA operations. DEA plans to adjust its operational profile and limit activities to Kabul, with decreased security and support for high-risk operations. The transition in counternarcotics operations in Afghanistan in 2014 has led to reduced support functions from U.S. and coalition forces, impacting DEA operations. State Department-funded counternarcotics programs are transitioning to full Afghan responsibility, with some already fully implemented by the Afghan government. USAID's field presence may be affected by the transition, potentially impacting program monitoring and oversight. After 2014, the State Department does not plan to have a permanent counternarcotics presence outside Kabul. USAID's monitoring programs in Afghanistan are affected by the reduced U.S. government presence. The creation of the Regional Narcotics and Analysis and Illicit Trafficking Task Force aims to address counternarcotics threats post-2014. This mechanism will bridge current activities in Afghanistan with regional efforts after the drawdown of U.S. and coalition forces. Some observers question if counternarcotics will remain a priority in Afghanistan post-transition, with concerns about reduced coalition participation and U.S. pressure for actions. Policy makers may not be prepared for consequences like decreased security forces in drug-producing provinces and limited resources for counternarcotics programs. The transition could revive debates on controversial policies like aerial eradication and alternative development linked to eradication commitments. Key U.S. counternarcotics programs in Afghanistan include interdiction, eradication, alternative development, demand reduction, public awareness, counter-threat finance, prosecution, institutional development, and international cooperation. Efforts to disrupt drug trafficking through interdiction operations are a core tenet of counternarcotics policy in Afghanistan. The NATO Training Mission Afghanistan expects to transition this responsibility to Afghan forces as part of overall security efforts. Counternarcotics plans and policies may continue to evolve as the transition progresses through 2014. The U.S. government has played a significant role in developing Afghan capabilities for successful interdictions through various resources. This includes funding for CNPA facilities, infrastructure, mentoring, and specialized units like SIU, TIU, and NIU. Other programs like DEA's FAST also support interdiction efforts in Afghanistan. Interdiction-related programs in Afghanistan, supported by various U.S. agencies like DEA, DOD, and DHS/CBP, have been successful in capturing key drug traffickers, such as Haji Bagcho in 2009. Interagency entities like JIATF-N and IOCC have integrated law enforcement and military information to support counternarcotics operations. The U.S. has had some success in developing Afghan counternarcotics capabilities, but faces challenges like limited institutional capacity and corruption. The number of coalition-supported counternarcotics operations decreased by 17% in FY2013, with declines in heroin and opium seizures. DOD reported limited effectiveness in interdiction efforts, causing temporary disruptions to narcotics networks. In mid-2009, Special Representative Richard Holbrooke criticized western counternarcotics policies in Afghanistan, labeling them as a \"failure.\" He questioned the effectiveness of U.S. involvement in opium poppy eradication and raised concerns about the Afghan government's ability to take full responsibility for interdiction programs. The U.S. government stopped direct support for opium poppy eradication in Afghanistan due to unintended consequences. Instead, they now focus on the Afghan-run Governor-Led Eradication program, which reimburses provincial governors for eradicating poppy fields using manual or mechanical methods in communities with alternative livelihoods. The Governor-Led Eradication program in Afghanistan prohibits financial compensation for destroyed farmland and is MCN-led. The program's scope is expected to remain unchanged, with a memorandum of understanding renewed annually. Questions persist about the program's effectiveness in reducing opium poppy cultivation, as eradication efforts have resulted in fatalities and injuries. Security forces may be less available to support eradication in 2014, potentially leading to a decline in eradication numbers. The Governor-Led Eradication (GLE) program in Afghanistan has raised concerns about its effectiveness in reducing opium poppy cultivation and its potential to strengthen the insurgency. The Department of Defense (DOD) reports that GLE has not proven to decrease insurgent funding and may lead to a shift of cultivation to areas beyond government control. Corruption within the program results in selective eradication of poppy fields. Some policymakers suggest reallocating U.S. resources to other counternarcotics efforts. Additionally, the Good Performers Initiative (GPI) rewards provinces that successfully reduce poppy cultivation. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) verifies poppy cultivation eradication in Afghanistan. Provinces eligible for Good Performers Initiative (GPI) funding receive money for local development projects. In 2012, 21 out of 34 provinces were eligible for $18.2 million in funding. Previous projects funded by GPI include schools, infrastructure, hospitals, and drug treatment centers. State Department officials expect the program to continue under Afghan leadership. Some question the effectiveness of the development projects. Some observers question if development projects in Afghanistan provide sustainable incentives for farmers to switch to licit crops and contribute to alternative livelihoods. Local perceptions suggest misallocation of funding for GPI projects, leading to doubts about rewarding good governance. Research shows opium poppy cultivation thrives in insecure areas lacking alternative livelihoods. Alternative development programs aim to address this issue as part of counternarcotics strategies. Development programming in Afghanistan aims to steer households away from opium poppy cultivation by increasing income and employment opportunities while reducing expenditures and risks. USAID-funded projects like IDEA-NEW, CHAMP, ADF, and ACE are ending in 2014 and 2015 after targeting 314,268 hectares between FY2008 and FY2012. USAID's alternative development programs in Afghanistan have targeted poppy cultivation, increased sales of licit products, and created jobs. Efforts are shifting towards long-term development goals like economic growth and capacity building. The Kandahar Food Zone program builds on past initiatives to address opium farming. The Kandahar Food Zone program, a collaboration between USAID and the State Department's INL Bureau, focuses on counternarcotics programming in Afghanistan. It includes alternative development, GLE, demand reduction, and public awareness initiatives, with a $20 million investment in alternative development. Additional USAID-funded programs like RADP are also being implemented in different regions of Afghanistan. The \"food zone\" model has been expanded to other provinces independently, with the goal of combating opium farming. The INCB expects that alternative development programs in Afghanistan could help prevent illicit cultivation of opium poppy and cannabis plants. However, these programs are not widely available, with only 30% of rural households dependent on illicit crops receiving agricultural assistance in 2011. Progress in reducing opium cultivation in areas like the Helmand Food Zone may not be sustainable if alternative development efforts are reduced, security deteriorates, or opium prices increase. According to surveys, 30% of household income in the Helmand Food Zone comes from opium cultivation. The area has caused a \"balloon effect\" pushing poppy cultivation into insecure Taliban-controlled areas. USAID faces challenges in implementing alternative development programs in Afghanistan due to insecurity, low crop production, and limited food processing opportunities. Insurgents have targeted USAID implementers, with attacks reported in the past. The Afghan government and international donors, including the U.S. government, have supported the development of health services for specific populations in Afghanistan to address drug abuse. This includes prevention programming in schools and mosques, as well as the expansion of treatment facilities reaching 3-5% of estimated opiate users in the country. Treatment services in Afghanistan currently reach only 3-5% of estimated opiate users, mainly in key population centers like Kabul. The State Department is working with the Afghan Ministry of Public Health to take over 76 drug treatment programs previously funded by INL. INL also supports prevention programs and is developing protocols to treat opium and heroin-addicted children. INL is funding a National Rural Drug Use Survey to establish a national prevalence rate. Challenges in demand reduction efforts include a lack of data on drug prevalence rates, treatment effectiveness, and accessible treatment options. Debate continues on the use of methadone for opioid users in Afghanistan. The methadone maintenance treatment project was initiated in Kabul in 2010 by a France-based NGO for high-risk injecting drug users, facing challenges in importing methadone. Counternarcotics efforts in Afghanistan include public information campaigns to deter involvement in the drug trade, supported by the State Department and international donors. U.S.-funded programs, like those by Sayara Media, aim to educate and dissuade the population from drug-related activities. The State Department and international donors support public information campaigns in Afghanistan to deter involvement in the drug trade. U.S.-funded programs by Sayara Media aim to educate and dissuade the population from drug-related activities. Initial steps were taken in 2013 to transition public awareness campaign programs to Afghan control, with assessments indicating some influence on household decisions to cultivate opium. The U.S. government's counter-threat finance operations in Afghanistan, led by the Afghanistan Threat Finance Cell (ATFC), have targeted insurgent and terrorist funding from the narcotics trade. The ATFC, established in 2008, has implemented financial sanctions against narcotics traffickers and exposed corruption in high-level financial networks, notably in the Kabul Bank investigation. The ATFC, established in 2008, has targeted insurgent and terrorist funding from the narcotics trade, implementing financial sanctions and exposing corruption in high-level financial networks. The future of the ATFC is uncertain as staffing has been reduced, and there are debates about whether to close the unit or integrate it into existing structures like the IOCC. It is unclear if the Afghan government will have the capacity to conduct complex operations. The Afghan government's ability to conduct complex financial investigations like the ATFC is uncertain. Efforts are being made to develop Afghan financial investigators independently. The State and Justice Departments are supporting the development of Afghan capacity to investigate and prosecute major narcotics and corruption cases through mentoring and the establishment of specialized facilities in Kabul. The Criminal Justice Task Force (CJTF) at the CNJC in Afghanistan, supported by U.S. assistance, facilitates linkages between Kabul-based investigations and provincial justice centers. Despite the lack of a formal extradition treaty with the United States, drug-related extraditions could be made under the 1988 U.N. Convention. The CJTF, established in 2005, is considered a model of excellence within the Afghan justice system. The Counter Narcotics Justice Task Force (CNT) in Afghanistan has achieved high conviction rates above 90% and heard over 700 cases annually, including the conviction of U.S. narcotics kingpin Haji Lal Jan Ishaqzai in 2013. Despite progress, the Afghan justice system faces challenges in capacity and effectiveness, with corruption hindering high-level investigations. The provincial police chief of Nimroz, Mohammad Kabir Andarabi, was arrested on drug charges in 2013 but cleared of drug corruption charges and convicted of obstruction of justice. Some aspects of the Counter Narcotics Justice Task Force (CNT) and Counter Narcotics Justice Center (CNJC) in Afghanistan could change, including reducing the annual caseload. The timeline for transitioning CNJC operations and maintenance costs to Afghan control is unclear. A capacity building project was initiated by the State Department in late 2010 at the Ministry of Counter Narcotics, focusing on technical capacity building, procurement support, and policy development. The program, based in Kabul, is expected to continue beyond the security transition in 2014. The U.S. government has been involved in initiatives to address Afghanistan's drug production, including the Central Asia Counternarcotics Initiative. Funding has been requested for specialized training and equipment to enhance regional law enforcement capacity. DOD is also supporting counternarcotics capacity building in the region. The U.S. government is involved in counternarcotics efforts in Afghanistan, including establishing a Regional Narcotics and Analysis Task Force. International cooperation efforts include support for UNODC, INCB projects, Paris Pact Initiative, Colombo Plan, and U.S.-Russia Bilateral Commission Working Group on Counternarcotics. International and regional cooperation is expected to play a significant role in counternarcotics efforts in Afghanistan post-transition. The INCB highlighted the ongoing drug issue in Afghanistan and emphasized the importance of international cooperation in addressing it. Suggestions have been made for a regional approach to combat drug production, but concerns exist regarding corruption, enforcement capacities, and political sensitivities. Ambassador William R. Brownfield acknowledged these challenges in congressional testimony. The Obama Administration acknowledges the challenges in counternarcotics cooperation in Central Asia and Russia. Concerns exist about Afghanistan's drug problem affecting its future trajectory post-transition. Experts predict an increase in drug cultivation and production in Afghanistan, potentially impacting its economy. Drug trafficking in Afghanistan is a significant risk to U.S. and international investments in the country's reconstruction efforts. Counternarcotics efforts are resource-intensive, and the Afghan government relies on international donors for funding. There are concerns about the potential impact of drug cultivation on the country's economy and political stability. The FY2014 omnibus appropriations for Afghanistan cut overall assistance by 50% and prioritized counternarcotics programs with a \"record of success.\" Funding for counternarcotics assistance must have adequate monitoring and oversight, as per the FY2014 appropriations (P.L. 113-76). Key questions for consideration regarding counternarcotics policy in Afghanistan include preserving gains, preventing backsliding post-transition, risks of increased opium production, impact on economic growth, U.S. assistance duration and cost, monitoring and evaluation challenges. Metrics and benchmarks for evaluating success or failure of U.S. counternarcotics efforts in Afghanistan under security constraints on personnel mobility."
