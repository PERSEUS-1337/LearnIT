    "content": "Funding for new border barrier construction was the focus of a 34-day government shutdown starting on December 22, 2018. Congress did not agree to President Trump's request for $5.7 billion, providing $1.375 billion instead for pedestrian fencing. Trump declared a national emergency on February 15, 2019, allowing for the redirection of military funds for border projects. The White House proposed transferring $6.7 billion for southwest border barriers, with $6.1 billion from the Department of Defense. The President's attempt to secure more funding for border barrier projects led to a national emergency declaration on February 15, 2019. Congress passed a joint resolution to terminate the declaration, but it was vetoed by the President. A subsequent attempt to override the veto failed in the House. In September 2019, Congress made another attempt to terminate the national emergency with a joint resolution that has yet to be considered by the President. The report outlines the Administration's FY2020 border barrier funding plans using defense funds, describes authorities involved, details budgetary actions, and identifies recent congressional actions related to the national emergency at the southern border. It does not cover DHS funding for border barriers or the deployment of military personnel for border service. President Trump declared the national emergency on February 15, 2019, requiring the use of the Armed Forces. The White House released a Fact Sheet outlining plans to allocate $6.7 billion for new border barrier projects outside of the regular legislative process. The FY2020 budget proposal included an additional $7.2 billion in military construction funding, with $3.6 billion allocated to replenish accounts affected by the border security plan and the remaining $3.6 billion for future border barrier projects. The Administration allocated $3.6 billion for backfilling MILCON projects in '20 instead of '19 and $3.6 billion for new border construction. This funding is part of a larger plan that includes realigned DOD program savings, unobligated military construction funds, and new defense appropriations for FY2020. Additionally, there is an extra $2 billion in non-DOD appropriations and $1.375 billion from previously enacted FY2019 DHS appropriations for border security. The Administration allocated $15.3 billion for defense and non-defense funds, with 87% coming from DOD funds. $242 million from the Treasury Forfeiture Fund has been transferred to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, with $359 million to follow. $1.9 billion of the $2.5 billion designated for the defense Drug Interdiction account has been obligated. The U.S. Supreme Court allowed DOD border barrier construction to proceed by striking down lower court injunctions. The Secretary of Defense invoked emergency construction statute 10 U.S.C. 2808 to transfer funds from military construction projects to barrier projects. Approximately $2.1 billion of the $6.7 billion in newly introduced funds has been obligated. The $1.375 billion in FY2019 DHS appropriations included in the President's Border security factsheet announcement do not represent a plan for future actions. The Secretary of the DHS is responsible for preventing terrorists from entering the country and enforcing immigration laws. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is chiefly responsible for securing the borders and enforcing trade and immigration laws. Congress has not generally provided DOD with significant funds for border security, instead authorizing the military to support DHS or local authorities in certain situations. Congress has authorized the military to support DHS or local authorities in specific situations, such as drug interdiction and terrorist incidents involving weapons of mass destruction. DOD personnel have been involved in counterdrug activities since the early 1990s, with recent missions executed by U.S. Northern Command's Joint Task Force-North. Funding commitments for drug interdiction and counterdrug activities have been made by DOD, with special flexibility for military construction projects during certain periods. The National Emergencies Act allows the President to declare a national emergency, granting flexibility for military construction projects during crises. Emergency military construction has historically supported troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Administration plans to use funds for border barriers through military construction and transfer authorities. The Administration has invoked 10 U.S.C. 284 for military construction activities along the border to support counterdrug and counter transnational organized crime efforts. This statute allows DOD to reprogram funds for roads, fences, and lighting in drug smuggling corridors. The Administration has not invoked 10 U.S.C. 2803 for emergency construction. The Administration has used 10 U.S.C. 284 to reprogram $50 million for military construction projects related to border security, not included in the wall funding plan. This authority relies on General Transfer Authority (GTA) transfers from DOD funds. GTA sets the maximum amount for DOD's base reprogramming actions, usually around $4 billion. Section 9002 is the equivalent for war-related funds, usually around $2 billion. Reprogramming must be done within a specified timeframe and meet additional requirements. Reprogramming authority allows for shifting funds among accounts to address unforeseen military needs within a specified timeframe. Congress views this authority as a privilege granted to executive branch agencies to ensure essential functions can be carried out despite budget uncertainties. Reprogramming and transfer authorities granted by Congress allow for shifting funds among accounts to address unforeseen military needs. The President can invoke statutory authorities during a national emergency to fund military construction projects supporting the national response, with limitations on the total amount of funds that may be used. In a 2019 proclamation, the President invoked 10 U.S.C. 2808 Construction authority for military projects in a national emergency, allowing the Secretary of Defense to use unobligated balances for new projects. The President did not invoke 33 U.S.C. 2293 for reprogramming during emergencies, which allows the Secretary of the Army to defer nonessential civil works projects for national defense. The Department of Defense utilizes various statutory and non-statutory authorities for military construction projects essential to national defense. This includes 10 U.S.C. 2808 providing $3.6 billion, 10 U.S.C. 284 transferring $2.5 billion, and Treasury Forfeiture Funds contributing $601 million for border security. These funds are allocated when the President declares a national emergency requiring the use of the Armed Forces. President Trump declared a national emergency using 10 U.S.C. 2808 to authorize military construction projects for border security on February 15, 2019. This allowed the Secretary of Defense to use unobligated appropriations for necessary projects, deferring them until Congress provides replenishing appropriations. The Secretary of Defense used emergency construction authority under U.S.C. 2808 to approve 11 construction projects along the southern border, transferring $3.6 billion in military construction funds. This decision deferred 127 previously authorized projects, with half of them being overseas, including those supporting the European Deterrence Initiative. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper suggested allies reimburse the United States for funding shortfalls to increase U.S. forces' capability in Europe against non-NATO regional adversaries. The largest share of deferred funds for military construction projects would come from Puerto Rico ($403 million) and Guam ($257 million). The Department of Defense (DOD) plans to defer $1.8 billion in non-U.S. projects to prioritize funds for border barrier projects. This action has raised concerns among Members of Congress about military construction. DOD's actions have raised concerns among Members of Congress over potential impacts on military construction projects in their states. Critics worry about the President's use of emergency powers bypassing congressional appropriations. DOD implemented additional criteria to limit military construction projects eligible for deferment under emergency powers. Assistant Secretary of Defense Robert McMahon explained the reasoning behind these guidelines to protect military readiness. The Department of Defense has implemented criteria to limit military construction projects eligible for deferment under emergency powers. Projects that pose minimal operational risks if deferred, those scheduled for award in the last six months of the fiscal year, and recapitalization projects can be temporarily deferred. DOD plans to replenish funding for deferred projects with funds from its FY2020 budget if approved by Congress. If the Department's FY2020 budget is enacted on time as requested, no military construction project used to source section 2808 projects would be delayed or cancelled. DOD has requested $3.6 billion in additional Army military construction funds for this purpose. Congressional opponents argue against replenishment, stating DOD transfers would cancel affected projects. The current DOD decision-making process for construction during a national emergency differs from internal directives, driven by DHS requests. The current process for construction during a national emergency appears to have been driven by DHS requests, not internally generated by Military Departments. DOD requested a prioritized list of construction projects from DHS to improve troop effectiveness at the border, resulting in a $5 billion proposal for projects along 220 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff evaluated the DHS proposal for border barriers and identified $3.6 billion in funding from existing military construction projects. The final report concluded that all DHS-identified projects were necessary to support the use of the Armed Forces in securing the border. The Assistant Secretary of Defense recommended an action plan to execute 11 DHS projects and defer $3.6 billion in military construction. The Secretary of Defense approved these recommendations on September 3, 2019. Requests for emergency construction projects are initiated by the Secretaries of the Military Departments and COCOMs, who assess the need for 10 U.S.C. 2808 authorities. Detailed justifications, cost estimates, and timelines are required for each project. The CJCS certifies project consistency with basing plans, and the list is forwarded to the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment for review. The Secretary of Defense makes final decisions on projects recommended by the ASD (Sustainment) office. $2.5 billion was reprogrammed from defense programs for border security, with funds transferred to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for border barrier construction. Multiple authorities permitted this two-stage fund transfer process. The Department of Defense transferred $2.5 billion from defense programs to the defense Drug Interdiction account using various authorities, including Section 8005 General Transfer Authority and Section 9002 Special Transfer Authority. This allowed for a larger pool of appropriations to be tapped for border barrier construction without diminishing ongoing programs in the Drug Interdiction account. DOD officials clarified that no counter-narcotics funding would be used for wall-related projects. The Department of Defense transferred $2.5 billion from defense programs to the defense Drug Interdiction account without seeking prior approval from congressional defense committees. Despite the House Armed Services and House Committee on Appropriations denying the request, DOD proceeded with the transfer. The Department of Defense transferred $2.5 billion to the defense Drug Interdiction account, despite congressional denial. The transfer occurred in two reprogramming actions, with the first one on March 25, 2019, for high priority projects in Arizona and Texas managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The Department of Defense transferred $1 billion to an Army Operation and Maintenance appropriation for border barrier projects managed by the Army Corps of Engineers. A second reprogramming action of $1.5 billion was notified to congressional defense committees for additional border barrier projects in California and Arizona. Base and OCO funds were transferred for these projects. The Department of Defense transferred funds for border barrier projects managed by the Army Corps of Engineers, including research and development technologies, savings related to retirement contributions, and the cancellation of a National Security Space Launch mission. Overseas Contingency Operations funds were drawn from training of Afghan security forces and reimbursement to Pakistan. DHS requested DOD to undertake construction projects on the U.S.-Mexico southwest border. The Department of Defense funded border barrier projects in Arizona and New Mexico to block drug-smuggling corridors along the U.S.-Mexico border. DOD initially agreed to fund seven out of 11 projects, managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. One project was cancelled and later funded through emergency authority. The Department of Defense reprogrammed $1.9 billion out of $2.5 billion for border wall construction under 10 U.S.C. 284. Construction was delayed due to legal challenges, but the U.S. Supreme Court lifted all injunctions in July 2019, allowing work to resume. The government faces pressure to complete reprogrammed appropriations for border wall construction before funds expire on September 30, 2019. USACE must take action within 100 days of contract award to avoid unobligated funds becoming unavailable. The Treasury Forfeiture Funds (TFF) were established in 1992 to manage seized assets for law enforcement purposes. The funds are managed by the Treasury Executive Office of Asset Forfeiture (TEOAF) and can be used for wall funding. If funds are not obligated in time, projects may have to be scaled back or terminated. The Treasury Forfeiture Fund (TFF) managed by TEOAF influences asset forfeiture use by law enforcement to disrupt criminal enterprises. In 2019, $601 million was approved for CBP border security, with $242 million available in March and $359 million pending additional forfeitures. Funds can be used for various security aspects, not just wall construction. The congressional response to the Administration's border security plan has divided by chamber, with the House committees moving to block the President's actions while the Senate committees show some support. A settlement on annual budget caps for FY2020 and FY2021 may exclude restrictions on federal funds for border barriers, allowing transfer authority unless bipartisan language is adopted. The House-passed version of the FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act contains provisions limiting DOD funds for border barriers and reducing transfer authority limits. This contrasts with Senate committees showing support for the President's actions on border security. Section 1011 of the FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act would remove fence construction as a permitted type of support authorized under 10 U.S.C. 284 and impose additional congressional notification requirements. Section 2802 would limit the total amount of funds that could be used under emergency authorities to $500 million for construction outside the U.S. or $100 million for domestic projects. Section 1046 would prohibit the use of national defense funds appropriated between FY2015-FY2020 for physical border barriers along the southern border. The FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act includes provisions to limit funds for emergency military construction projects and restrict the use of national defense funds for physical border barriers along the southern border. H.R. 2762 proposes a $250 million cap on emergency military construction projects and additional requirements for congressional notification. The Senate version of the bill supports the President's Border security plan with $3.6 billion in military funding. The Senate bill supports the President's Border security plan by providing $3.6 billion in military construction funds to replenish projects deferred by the Administration's use of 10 U.S.C. 2808. However, it does not authorize the additional $3.6 billion requested for future border barrier projects. Transfer Authority is also provided with $4 billion in general transfer authority and $2.5 billion in special transfer authority. Section 2906 would provide $3.6 billion to replenish military construction projects affected by 10 U.S.C. 2808 transfers. The House sought to limit the Administration's funding actions in FY2020 appropriations bills, including provisions in H.R. 2740 and H.R. 2960 that would affect funding for border barrier construction. Section 8005 would limit transfer authority of base funds to $1 billion and require certification for transferred funds. Authorization for fund transfers into depleted accounts would end on September 30, 2020. The FY2019 legislation includes a special transfer authority for war funds up to $500 million, with restrictions on use for border barrier construction. General prohibitions are in place for defense appropriations and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers civil works funds for border barrier construction. The House passed H.R. 3055 containing restrictions on funding for border barriers along the southern border. Section 122 of the bill requires DOD to follow reprogramming guidelines for military construction funds, limiting significant transfers without congressional approval. The House passed H.R. 3055 with restrictions on funding for border barriers, including limitations on reprogramming military construction funds without congressional approval. The bill also prohibits using previously appropriated projects for wall funding. Section 612 further prohibits military construction for border barriers. Section 612 prohibits the use of military construction funds for designing or constructing border barriers along the southern border from FY2015-FY2020. The provision in H.R. 3351 and S. 2474 also restricts the use of Treasury Forfeiture Funds for these purposes, potentially blocking $601 million in funds approved by the Treasury Department. The Defense Appropriations Act, 2020 (S. 2474, S.Rept. 116-103) maintains transfer authorities at FY2019 levels and does not include additional wall-related provisions. President Trump's use of emergency powers to expedite wall construction has raised concerns about executive authority and potential violations of the constitutional separation of powers. Supporters argue the President lawfully reallocated funds to address a national crisis, despite a lawsuit by the House of Representatives being dismissed for lack of standing. Provisions in annual legislation aim to prohibit defense funds for border wall construction, with potential retroactive application since FY2015. DOD's recent reprogramming transfers bypass congressional approval requirements. DOD's recent reprogramming actions have sparked concerns about oversight of defense appropriations by congressional committees, leading to potential limitations on the Department's budget flexibility. Some view the reprogramming notifications for border wall construction as a deviation from established agreements, while others see it as a justifiable anomaly. Congress may need to consider legislative action to address DOD reprogramming actions that do not align with congressional intent. Limiting the Department's budget flexibility could impact its ability to carry out congressionally directed policies. DOD plans to apply its own criteria to military construction projects under 10 U.S.C. 2808 to maintain readiness, prompting Congress to assess the adequacy of these guidelines for future decisions. The tables below contain selected communications and documents relevant to the use of 10 U.S.C. Section 2808 and Section 284, detailing reprogramming requests totaling $2.5 billion to the Drug Interdiction and Counterdrug Activities account. The Department reallocated funds from the active duty army pay and allowances and used general and special transfer authority for these actions in March and May 2019. The Department reallocated $2.5 billion in reprogramming actions, with $1.8 billion from base and $.7 billion from OCO defense funds. Funds were mainly taken from Army personnel accounts and programs supporting Afghanistan Security Forces. The actions were sourced from FY2019 appropriations with a one- to three-year lifespan. Savings were transferred to Drug Interdiction and Counter-drug activities FY2019 appropriations, becoming one-year appropriations. All appropriations were merged with an FY2019 Army Operations and Maintenance appropriations account. On February 25, 2019, DHS requested DOD support for border security projects including new fencing with ground detection systems, road construction, and lighting with embedded cameras. The projects aim to impede illegal entry and drug smuggling activities along the U.S.-Mexico border. DHS requested DOD to undertake 11 projects on federal lands along the Southwest border, including Yuma Sector Arizona and El Paso Sector Texas. The projects involve vehicle barrier replacement, pedestrian fencing, and lighting to impede illegal entry and drug smuggling activities. DHS requested DOD to undertake projects in the U.S.-Mexico borderland, including El Centro California, Tucson Sector Arizona, and Yuma Sector Arizona. Projects involve vehicle barrier, pedestrian fencing, and lighting to impede illegal entry and drug smuggling activities. In August 2019, DHS requested DOD to fund projects in the U.S.-Mexico borderland, including El Centro California, Tucson Sector Arizona, and Yuma Sector Arizona. One approved project, Yuma 2, was terminated due to contract issues. DOD agreed to undertake modified projects (Yuma 4-5, Tucson 4) using surplus funds, but later terminated them due to insufficient savings. Some projects were funded by 10 U.S.C. 2808 after not being funded by 10 U.S.C. 284. In a letter to Acting DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, Acting Secretary of Defense Shanahan stated the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers would undertake planning and construction of approved projects on the U.S.-Mexico border. Court injunctions temporarily suspended construction of border barrier projects funded by DOD's first tranche of $1 billion. On April 9, 2019, $389,999,999 remained unobligated from the court's injunction. An undefinitized contract for Yuma 1 was awarded on May 15 with $35,000,000 unobligated. A second reprogramming action of $1.5 billion was executed by DOD on May 25. However, on June 28, 2019, a second injunction from the California district court prohibited the use of $2.5 billion in funding. Approximately $752,750,000 remained unobligated from the second funding tranche. Tucson Sector Projects 1-3 had $646,000,000 unobligated, and El Centro Sector Project 1 had $106,750,000 unobligated at the time of the court's injunction. At the time of the court's injunction, $106,750,000 remained unobligated. Project delays incurred additional costs to the government. DOD regulations acknowledge compensation for contractors during suspensions. Late payments incur penalties. If a contract is terminated, DOD compensates contractors for sunk costs. The U.S. Supreme Court lifted injunctions on July 26, 2019, allowing construction to proceed. On September 3, 2019, the Secretary of Defense directed border barrier construction to reduce DHS's demand for DOD personnel and assets. The Acting Secretary of the Army was directed to proceed with the construction of 11 border barrier projects along the international border with Mexico, with an estimated total cost of $3.6 billion. These projects aim to deter illegal entry, increase the vanishing time of those crossing the border illegally, and channel migrants to ports of entry, ultimately reducing the demand for DoD personnel and assets. The barriers constructed along the border will reduce the demand for DoD personnel and assets, allowing for their redeployment to high-traffic areas without barriers. These projects are considered force multipliers, with seven of the eleven selected projects requiring administrative transfer of land from the Department of the Interior to the Department of Defense for construction to proceed. The Department of Defense (DOD) has selected eleven projects for border barrier construction, with two projects on non-public lands needing purchase or condemnation before construction can start. USACE expects this process to finish by April 2020. The remaining projects are on the Barry M. Goldwater Range (BMGR) and can begin construction immediately. DOD provided a list of these projects to congressional defense committees on September 3, 2019. The Department of Defense provided defense committees with a list of military construction projects selected for deferral under 10 U.S.C. 2808. The list included projects vulnerable for selection due to not having received contract awards, with updates on contract award dates for some projects, making them newly eligible for selection. The Department of Defense provided defense committees with a list of military construction projects selected for deferral under 10 U.S.C. 2808. The final list included one planning and design project not previously notified, totaling $13.6 million."
