    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Article 1.5 of the Education Code requires public libraries with 3D printers to display a notice about potential misuse liability. The Department of Justice will provide the notice, detailing laws on copyright infringement and penalties for misuse. The Department of Justice provides a notice for users of 3D printers regarding their responsibility to comply with relevant laws. The notice must be in 14-point type and not exceed two 8 inch by 11.5 inch pages. A 3D printer is defined as a device that creates solid objects by depositing layers of material based on digital instructions. If state costs are mandated, reimbursement will be made to local agencies and school districts. Section 6254.31 of the Government Code states that images, footage, or data obtained through the use of an unmanned aircraft system are public records subject to disclosure, regardless of any other provisions in the chapter. Title 14 of the Penal Code prohibits public agencies from using unmanned aircraft systems unless specified. Disclosure of images, footage, or data obtained through the system may be restricted if it endangers safety or investigation completion. A law enforcement agency can use an unmanned aircraft system with a warrant based on probable cause or without a warrant in emergency situations like imminent threats to life, traffic accidents assessment, and inspecting state parks for illegal activities. Public agencies other than law enforcement can use unmanned aircraft systems in response to environmental emergencies or disasters, such as oil spills or chemical spills. They can also use these systems for their core missions as long as it is unrelated to criminal intelligence gathering. Peace officers or agencies involved in criminal investigations can use unmanned aircraft systems without a warrant for their core missions, as long as the purpose is not related to criminal intelligence gathering and the data collected is not used for any other purpose. Public agencies using unmanned aircraft systems must provide reasonable notice to the public before deployment. Images, footage, or data obtained by these agencies cannot be shared with law enforcement without a warrant, except as permitted by the law. Public agencies can disseminate images, footage, or data collected through unmanned aircraft systems within the agency or to another public agency related to their core mission. Dissemination outside the collecting agency is restricted unless specific circumstances apply. Images, footage, or data obtained by a public agency through the use of an unmanned aircraft system can be shared outside the agency if they are evidence in a claim or litigation. They can also be shared with a private entity if the agency is not law enforcement and the data is related to the agency's core function. Additionally, the agency can make this information available to the public under certain conditions. The disclosure of images, footage, or data obtained through the use of an unmanned aircraft system is only allowed if it is necessary to fulfill the public agency's legal obligations. The information collected must be destroyed within one year, unless specific circumstances allow for its retention by the agency. Images, footage, or data obtained through the use of an unmanned aircraft system can be retained for training, academic research, monitoring assets, or environmental planning by a public agency. The agency may keep this information beyond one year in certain circumstances. Unless authorized by federal law, a person or entity, including a public agency or a contractor, cannot equip an unmanned aircraft system with a weapon or device intended to cause harm or damage. All unmanned aircraft systems must minimize collecting unauthorized images or data. Local authorities can impose stricter rules. Definitions include \"criminal intelligence\" for monitoring criminal activity. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to unmanned aircraft systems and specifies that surveillance restrictions on electronic devices also apply to the use of these systems by public agencies. The Legislature imposes limitations on public access to meetings and writings of public officials to protect the safety and integrity of investigations."
