    "content": "In December 2019, a new disease, COVID-19, emerged in China and spread globally, impacting health, foreign relations, economy, and security. International institutions and governments are responding to the pandemic. The 116th Congress introduced legislation to address COVID-19 and global pandemic preparedness. This report focuses on global implications and responses to COVID-19, covering disease prevalence, country responses, economic implications, and issues for Congress to consider. For domestic cases and responses, refer to CRS Insight IN11253. Prior to COVID-19, two novel coronaviruses, SARS and MERS, caused serious illness and death. The origin of COVID-19 is unknown, but genetic analysis suggests an animal source. The World Health Organization first learned of pneumonia cases from unknown causes in Wuhan, China on December 31. The World Health Organization (WHO) first learned of pneumonia cases from unknown causes in Wuhan, China on December 31, 2019. Chinese scientists isolated a new coronavirus in the patients in early January 2020 and shared its genetic sequence with the international community on January 11. The virus, now present in most countries, is known as COVID-19. It is thought to spread mainly through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Health officials and researchers are still learning about the virus. The CDC has confirmed that asymptomatic cases can transmit the virus, but their role in transmission is not yet known. A study on the Diamond Princess cruise ship found that 19.2% of passengers tested positive for COVID-19, with almost half being asymptomatic. The COVID-19 case fatality rate is difficult to determine due to various factors. Wide disparities exist in case detection worldwide, and the case fatality rate may vary depending on factors like demographics, population density, and healthcare quality. Studies estimate case fatality rates for COVID-19 in different regions, with higher rates among the elderly and those with preexisting medical conditions. As of May 13, 2020, national governments reported over 4 million cases of COVID-19 and almost 300,000 related deaths worldwide. The pandemic epicenter has shifted from China and Asia to the United States and Europe, with Russia and Brazil joining the countries with the highest number of deaths. Almost 90% of reported COVID-19 cases were in the WHO Americas and Europe regions, with the United States, Brazil, and Canada leading in the Americas, and Russia, Spain, UK, Italy, Germany, Turkey, and France in Europe. Countries are following WHO guidance to control the pandemic, with the UNOCHA requesting $6.7 billion for humanitarian aid. The UNOCHA is requesting $6.7 billion to support COVID-19 efforts by various U.N. entities. WHO is responsible for setting global health norms and rules, including pandemic response, and has developed tools and protocols. The International Health Regulations (IHR) were adopted by the World Health Assembly in 1969 to control disease spread through quarantine measures. The IHR (2005) expanded control measures for infectious disease outbreaks beyond quarantine, including a code of conduct for notification and response to potential pandemics. The International Health Regulations (IHR) mandate that countries build and maintain public health capacities for disease surveillance and response, notify WHO of potential Public Health Emergencies of International Concern (PHEIC), and follow WHO recommendations for responding to such emergencies. China and other countries are monitoring and reporting COVID-19 cases to WHO, with debates on China's compliance with IHR reporting rules. The International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005) do not have an enforcement mechanism, relying on peer pressure and public knowledge for compliance. Non-compliant countries may face consequences such as tarnished international image, increased morbidity, travel restrictions, and economic disruption. China's handling of the COVID-19 outbreak raises questions about the need for enforcement. Some argue for enforcement due to delays in reporting and lack of transparency, while others question giving WHO enforcement authority. IHR (2005) came into force in 2007. In 2012, only 20% of countries reported developing IHR (2005) core capacities, prompting calls for a funding mechanism. The WHO launched the Global Health Security Agenda in 2014 to accelerate IHR (2005) implementation, improving global pandemic preparedness. Regional disparities in pandemic readiness persisted, with the WHO Africa region lagging behind the Western Pacific region. In 2020, WHO released a $675 million Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan to address the pandemic. Private donors and countries have contributed $536.5 million towards the plan, with the US donating $30.3 million. WHO has used the funds to purchase and ship PPE to 133 countries. In 2020, WHO provided personal protective equipment (PPE) to 133 countries, including surgical masks, gloves, gowns, goggles, and face shields. They also supplied diagnostic kits to 126 countries, developed online COVID-19 training courses in multiple languages, and enrolled over 100 countries in trials for vaccines and treatments. Additionally, WHO issued guidance for countries transitioning from widespread transmission to low-level or no transmission, without requesting additional funds. The President of the European Commission, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and other global leaders pledged commitment to the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT Accelerator) for equitable global access to countermeasures. A pledging conference hosted by the EU raised $7.4 billion, with the U.S. not participating or providing funding. Debates on whether health commodities are a public good continue. Debates on whether health commodities are a public good have intensified in recent years, with concerns about affordability for poor countries and recapturing research costs for wealthier countries. The WHO has faced challenges in developing agreements that satisfy both sides, with negotiations for prepurchasing agreements during major outbreaks. French officials have advocated for COVID-19 commodities to be considered a \"public good.\" The WHO has designated COVID-19 commodities as a \"public good\" and criticized a French pharmaceutical company for prioritizing the U.S. for vaccine access. The Solidarity Trial coordinates global research efforts, promoting open sharing of information and resources. A resolution at the World Health Assembly emphasizes the importance of universal access to quality COVID-19 diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. International financial institutions like the IMF and World Bank are providing significant financial resources to support countries dealing with the health and economic impacts of COVID-19. The IMF is ready to offer loans to over 100 countries, while the World Bank and other multilateral development banks have pledged billions of dollars to support various activities, including strengthening healthcare services and disease monitoring. The G-20 countries, with the urging of the IMF and World Bank, have agreed to suspend debt payments for low-income countries until the end of 2020. Policymakers are considering various actions to enhance the IFI response to COVID-19, such as adjusting policies for financial assistance, increasing foreign reserves, and providing debt relief to low-income nations. Congressional legislation may be required for some proposals, and the stimulus legislation (P.L. 116-136) has accelerated authorizations for the IMF in the FY2021 budget. The Administration requested accelerated authorizations in the FY2021 budget for the IMF, World Bank, and African Development Bank lending facilities. The International Organization for Migration and UN High Commissioner for Refugees suspended global resettlement travel for refugees due to COVID-19 travel bans, potentially increasing population density in refugee camps. Experts note that global humanitarian crises were already unprecedented before the pandemic. The U.N. estimated that in 2020, 168 million people in 53 countries would need humanitarian assistance due to armed conflict and human rights violations. The global humanitarian annual appeal reached over $28.8 billion, focusing on displaced populations, including refugees and internally displaced persons. Humanitarian experts warn that vulnerable populations are at high risk for COVID-19 due to overcrowded living conditions. The U.N. launched a $2.01 billion global appeal for the COVID-19 pandemic response to help the most vulnerable populations in low or middle-income countries. Limited access to clean water and sanitation makes disease control recommendations impractical in overcrowded living spaces. Despite the lack of testing, relatively few COVID-19 cases have been reported among refugees and those affected by conflict or natural disasters. The United Nations tripled its COVID-19 appeal to $6.7 million, expanding coverage to 63 countries to address the needs of vulnerable populations. Reports show incomes dropping, food supplies dwindling, and children missing vaccinations. UNOCHA will coordinate emergency health and humanitarian responses. The United Nations tripled its COVID-19 appeal to $6.7 million, expanding coverage to 63 countries to address the needs of vulnerable populations. UNOCHA will coordinate emergency health and humanitarian responses, with activities carried out by various organizations. President Trump announced the formation of the President's Coronavirus Task Force on January 29, 2020. On February 27, Vice President Pence was appointed as the leader of the Administration's COVID-19 task force, with Ambassador Birx as the White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator. The President signed a law providing $8.3 billion for domestic and international COVID-19 response, including funding for CDC's global health security programs and USAID and Department of State aid. The USAID and Department of State-administered aid for COVID-19 response includes $435 million for global health programs, $300 million for international disaster assistance, and $250 million for economic support. Additionally, $1 million is allocated for oversight of aid programming. President Trump signed a law providing $258 million for international disaster assistance to prevent, prepare for, and respond to COVID-19. The State Department allocated $258 million for international disaster assistance to prevent, prepare for, and respond to COVID-19. This funding is part of the USAID and Department of State-administered aid for global health programs, international disaster assistance, and economic support in response to the pandemic. In 2020, the State Department issued a Level 4 Global Health Advisory urging U.S. citizens to avoid international travel due to COVID-19. This advisory does not ban travel but warns of life-threatening risks and limited government assistance. U.S. embassies may have reduced capacity to help citizens abroad. The Critical Information Program (CIP) provides updates to registered citizens through the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP), overseen by the Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs. The Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs oversees the Critical Information Program (CIP), which provides updates to U.S. citizens through the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP). State Department regulations require the publication of a web page describing health threats to U.S. citizens. The Bureau of Consular Affairs has a web page for the COVID-19 pandemic, and the State Department has a website with COVID-19 information for every country. A daily COVID-19 newsletter was started on March 24, 2020, to provide accurate information to Members of Congress and staff. The Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986 authorizes the Secretary of State to manage overseas crisis response efforts. The Antiterrorism Act of 1986 authorizes the Secretary of State to conduct overseas evacuations for US citizens when their lives are in danger. Expenditures for evacuations can be made for government personnel, dependents, and private citizens, with the latter generally responsible for the costs, although emergency financial assistance may be available for those in need. The Basic Authorities Act limits repayment for evacuations to a reasonable commercial air fare. The State Department advises U.S. citizens to use existing commercial transportation options when possible. In rare cases, the department arranges non-commercial transportation for evacuations to safe locations. This has been done for thousands of U.S. citizens during the COVID-19 outbreak. During the COVID-19 outbreak, the State Department arranged evacuations for thousands of U.S. citizens worldwide, including those in Wuhan, China and passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Yokohama, Japan. They utilized commercial rescue flights and worked with airlines to secure clearances for evacuation flights in high-demand countries. Around 40% of evacuated U.S. citizens returned to the United States by late April. U.S. citizens evacuated due to COVID-19 returned to the United States on commercial rescue flights funded by Congress through the EDCS account. Congress allocated $7.9 million for FY2020 for this purpose, allowing the State Department to retain and transfer funds for emergency evacuations. The State Department received additional funding from Congress for emergency evacuations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including $588 million allocated through various appropriations legislation. This funding allowed for the evacuation of over 800 American citizens from Wuhan, China, starting on January 28, 2020. Additionally, the amount authorized for transfer from the Diplomatic Programs account to the EDCS account for emergency evacuations was increased from $10 million to $100 million for FY2020. The State Department coordinated the repatriation of over 85,000 Americans on 886 flights amid the global pandemic. A repatriation task force was established on March 19, 2020, to support these efforts. The State Department's Level 4 Global Health Advisory warns of limited funds for future evacuations. Some Members of Congress have praised the State Department's efforts to assist U.S. citizens abroad during the COVID-19 pandemic. USAID is aiding over 100 developing countries facing COVID-19 based on various criteria. USAID is providing funding to multilateral organizations for COVID-19 assistance, committing $99 million from the Emergency Reserve Fund. They are also assisting target countries in preparing laboratories for testing and implementing public-health emergency plans. USAID has pledged $653 million for international COVID-19 response as of May 1, 2020. The funding includes $215 million that has already been obligated, with contributions from various accounts such as the ERF, GHP, IDA, and ESF. Congress appropriates funds for USAID global health security and pandemic preparedness activities through annual State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs appropriations. The bulk of USAID's pandemic preparedness activities have been implemented through the Emerging Pandemic Threats program from FY2009 to FY2019. Key activities under the Emerging Pandemic Threats (EPT) program include strengthening surveillance systems, upgrading laboratories, combating antimicrobial resistance, training health volunteers, conducting simulation exercises, and establishing emergency supply-chain programs. The PREDICT project was a significant component of the EPT program. The PREDICT project under the EPT program helped detect over 1,100 unique viruses, including Ebola and coronaviruses, sampled 163,000 animals and people, and responded to 42 outbreaks. USAID will use lessons from PREDICT for the new STOP Spillover project to prevent zoonotic diseases. In 2020, CDC received $300 million for global disease detection and response, with plans to spend $150 million by the end of the fiscal year. CDC is collaborating with WHO, USAID, and the Department of State to assist countries in implementing COVID-19 control measures, including surveillance, diagnostics, and infection prevention. CDC is working closely with USAID and the Department of State to coordinate a U.S. government approach to the COVID-19 pandemic. They prioritize countries based on the current status and future trajectory of COVID-19, as well as their ability to implement activities effectively. CDC staff are conducting investigations in partner countries to inform response efforts and enhance global health security through the Global Health Protection line item of annual Labor-HHS appropriations. CDC works to enhance global health security and pandemic preparedness in 19 countries by focusing on core public health systems. Programs include the Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP) and National Public Health Institutes (NPHI) to strengthen disease detection and response capabilities. The Global Rapid Response Team (GRRT) supports partner countries in public health functions and resource accountability. The team focuses on data collection, program development, and emergency response. Over 500 CDC staff have provided 30,000 person-days of support, including over 100 deployments for COVID-19 response. Core and surge members assist in various domestic and international operations. The Public Health Emergency Management program by CDC trains public health professionals from international ministries of health on emergency management. The program has graduated 142 fellows from 37 countries. DOD is conducting global medical surveillance for COVID-19, monitoring reported cases and supporting CDC with additional laboratory capabilities. The Defense Department has provided detection and characterization capabilities to support global COVID-19 activities. The Secretary of Defense has directed combatant commanders to execute pandemic plans. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act and the CARES Act allocated funding for the Defense Health Program to address COVID-19. The Senate Appropriations Committee released a summary detailing the allocation of funds from H.R. 748 for various purposes related to COVID-19, including patient care, procurement of medical equipment, and development of vaccines. The bill also provided funding for the defense industrial base, operations and maintenance for military services, and military personnel deployments. The Defense Department has not specified how much of the emergency funding will be used for international activities related to COVID-19. The Department of Defense (DOD) is collaborating with the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of State to provide support for COVID-19. Air National Guard C-17 cargo aircraft have transported coronavirus testing swabs from Italy to the United States for distribution to medical facilities. The impact of COVID-19 on U.S. security operations worldwide is still uncertain, with reports of military personnel contracting the virus. The Department of Defense (DOD) directed military service commanders not to disclose the number of personnel affected by COVID-19 for security reasons. The Department of Homeland Security had nearly 9,000 employees exposed to COVID-19, impacting their workforce. U.S.-China relations were already tense before the pandemic, with disputes over trade, global influence, and issues like the South China Sea and human rights. Deployed U.S. Naval vessels, like the USS Theodore Roosevelt, faced operational challenges due to the virus. The pandemic has intensified tensions between the United States and China, with disputes over issues such as activities in the South China Sea, human rights, and the Belt and Road Initiative. China criticized the US for its response to the COVID-19 outbreak, accusing them of creating fear. In response, the US announced assistance of up to $100 million and delivered personal protection equipment to China. The Department facilitated the delivery of 17.8 tons of medical supplies to China. The Trump Administration criticized China's response to COVID-19. Secretary Pompeo accused China of covering up the outbreak. There were accusations traded between the State Department and China's Foreign Ministry on Twitter. President Trump referred to COVID-19 as \"the Chinese virus.\" President Trump accused the World Health Organization of promoting China's misinformation about the virus and suggested the Wuhan Institute of Virology as the origin of the virus. The intelligence community is still investigating the virus's origin, whether from infected animals or a laboratory accident in Wuhan. China has pushed back against these claims. China has pushed back against U.S. allegations regarding the virus's origin, calling them \"lies\" and criticizing the U.S. response to COVID-19. Chinese spokespeople have also spread a conspiracy theory that the virus could have originated in the United States. They have challenged the U.S. to open up Fort Detrick and other bio-labs for international review and invite WHO and international experts to investigate the source of COVID-19. Some U.S.-based analysts are concerned about the deteriorating U.S.-China relations and the lack of global coordination in response to COVID-19. They suggest that the strategic competition between the two countries is hindering transnational responses to the pandemic. Calls for cooperation in vaccine development, distribution, and addressing the economic crisis caused by the virus have been made. China's Ambassador to the U.S. has expressed openness to cooperation despite tensions. President Trump suggested on May 5 that China would still be open to cooperation despite tensions. He warned against blaming China for the pandemic, stating that it could harm efforts to fight the disease and reignite the global economy. In a Fox News interview on May 14, 2020, Trump mentioned the possibility of cutting off the entire relationship with China to punish them. He highlighted the trade deficit with China as a reason, suggesting that cutting ties could save money. Some Members of Congress have introduced legislation criticizing China's response to COVID-19. The COVID-19 outbreak in the region has led to disruptions in trade and labor movement, impacting economies and supply chains. Malaysia initially banned overseas travel, affecting 300,000 Malaysians working in Singapore, but later allowed their return with testing and quarantine. Singapore has seen widespread outbreaks among migrant laborers, contributing to the region's highest number of infections. The COVID-19 outbreak in the region has led to disruptions in trade and labor movement, impacting economies and supply chains. The region's largest number of COVID-19 infections is seen in crowded dormitories. Indonesia and the Philippines are experiencing widening outbreaks, Malaysia and Thailand have new governments facing legitimacy questions, and some nations have raised concerns about human rights and freedoms. President Duterte's strict lockdown measures in the Philippines have resulted in over 120,000 arrests. Human rights groups criticize Cambodia's draft emergency order for media control. Poor urban residents disproportionately affected by over 120,000 arrests. Southeast Asian diplomatic calendar disrupted, with virtual meetings replacing canceled events. Economic impacts of pandemic in Central Asia may alter Russia's role. The economic impacts of the pandemic in Central Asia may affect the roles of Russia and China in the region. Declines in trade and cross-border movement could reverse progress on regional connectivity, with China cutting natural gas imports and reducing investment. Turkmenistan, heavily reliant on gas exports to China, faces vulnerability due to the economic disruptions. Remittances from Russia to Kyrgyz, Tajik, and Uzbek citizens may also be interrupted. The flow of remittances from Russia to Kyrgyz, Tajik, and Uzbek citizens, who work as labor migrants, is significant for their countries' GDPs. Central Asian governments are using COVID-19 measures to suppress political and media freedoms, with restrictions on information and detentions of critics and journalists. Human Rights Watch criticizes these governments for failing to uphold human rights obligations during the pandemic. The government of Tajikistan is suppressing information on the pandemic and blocking a website that tracks COVID-19 fatalities. South Asian countries have limited healthcare resources and are at serious risk due to dense populations and lack of hygiene. The United States has provided financial assistance to India and Pakistan to combat COVID-19. The crisis has impacted U.S.-India and regional security cooperation activities. The postponement of Secretary of Defense Mark Esper's visit to New Delhi has raised concerns about bilateral defense relations. With India and Pakistan's ongoing militarized rivalry, any crisis in South Asia, especially in Kashmir, could escalate into conflict between the nuclear-armed countries. U.S. and Indian firms are collaborating on a coronavirus vaccine, with India being a major vaccine manufacturer and the leading producer of hydrocholoquine. President Trump has suggested possible retaliation if India bans the export of goods. The COVID-19 crisis has led to increased scrutiny of India's political leadership, with accusations of oppression and persecution of Indian Muslims. Reports suggest that the government is using the pandemic to limit press freedoms. India's Jammu and Kashmir territory faces severe hardships due to a \"double lockdown\" amid the pandemic. In Pakistan, Prime Minister Imran Khan faced disaffection over his government's performance. The military sidelined civilian leadership due to criticism of the pandemic response. Bangladesh struggles with social distancing in densely populated areas and overcrowded Rohingya camps. In the Kutupalong camp, approximately 630,000 Rohingya face challenges with social distancing and quarantine due to high population density. Bangladesh quarantined some Rohingya on Bhansan Char island to prevent COVID-19 spread. Australia and New Zealand's relations with China strained over support for an international investigation into the pandemic's origins. China's Ambassador warned against pursuing the inquiry. In an Australian newspaper interview, Jingye warned of a potential Chinese consumer boycott if an inquiry into the pandemic's origins is pursued. Labor's Penny Wong signaled support for the government on the issue. China's actions are seen as \"intimidation\" and \"economic coercion\" by commentators, revealing the CCP's political war on Australia. New Zealand faced backlash from China for supporting Taiwan's participation at the WHO. The Afghan peace process is further complicated by COVID-19 and a political crisis in Kabul. The U.S.-Taliban agreement signed on February 29, 2020, is in effect. The U.S.-Taliban agreement signed on February 29, 2020 commits the United States to withdraw troops from Afghanistan by mid-June 2020. There are conflicting reports on the impact of COVID-19 on the withdrawal timeline, with the U.S. pausing personnel movement due to the pandemic. President Trump has called for accelerating the troop withdrawal. Negotiations between the Taliban and Afghan government representatives have not yet taken place as scheduled. Negotiations between the Taliban and Afghan government representatives have not yet taken place as scheduled. Limited engagements were held over Skype due to the pandemic, but talks are mainly stalled by a disputed prisoner exchange. The spread of COVID-19 in Afghanistan could offer opportunities for compromise and cooperation. The Taliban have expressed willingness to cooperate with international health organizations in combating the virus, despite past targeting of health workers. Some observers view this as a propaganda move to undermine the Afghan government's legitimacy. The Taliban's escalation of violence is hindering Afghanistan's response to the pandemic. The country is at high risk of a COVID-19 outbreak due to weak public health infrastructure and its border with Iran. Asian governments like Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand have been praised for their COVID-19 control approaches. Singapore also received initial praise but faced a second wave of infections. These jurisdictions have learned from their experiences in dealing with the virus. Taiwan, along with other Asian governments, has effectively managed public health emergencies like SARS, swine flu, and MERS. Their experiences have led to the development of protocols for screening, testing, and isolating infected individuals. Taiwan's proximity to China has influenced its proactive approach in handling COVID-19, including implementing infection control measures and movement restrictions. Lessons from Taiwan's successful response may benefit other countries, including the United States. Taiwan, located near mainland China, took swift actions in response to the COVID-19 crisis. Measures included passenger screenings, travel alerts, and self-quarantine directives. The Central Epidemic Command Center was activated on January 20 to lead the government's response. Taiwan also suspended cross-Strait flights and barred entry to residents of mainland China. Taiwan's government response to COVID-19 was swift and effective, with a command headquarters established in 2004 after the SARS outbreak. Public health expertise among top leaders contributed to the attentive response, with strict guidance and widespread testing. Self-quarantine directives were enforced using cellphone location data, and violators faced steep fines. Taiwan's government responded swiftly to COVID-19, enforcing strict measures and punishing violators with fines. Public awareness was raised through daily press conferences and informational apps. Economic relief measures were also implemented. In contrast, Hong Kong initially resisted aggressive actions but later changed course due to public criticism. The Hong Kong government responded to the COVID-19 outbreak by closing borders, implementing quarantine measures, and providing public information. The public quickly adopted social distancing measures despite initial hesitation from the government. After initial hesitation from the HKSAR government, Hong Kong's public quickly adopted social distancing and anti-contamination behaviors during the COVID-19 outbreak. Medical professionals also implemented anti-viral protocols. The government began to relax restrictions on May 5, 2020, reopening offices and businesses while maintaining mask-wearing and gathering limits. Free reusable face masks were provided to residents, with the possibility of reinstating restrictions if local cases increase. Singapore, a city-state with 5.7 million people, has been praised for its rapid early actions in handling the COVID-19 pandemic. Health officials conducted extensive monitoring, testing over 2,000 individuals a day, and requiring quarantine for those in contact with infected individuals. Testing and quarantine measures are mandatory for those in close proximity to infected individuals. Singapore has strict measures in place for COVID-19, including mandatory testing, quarantine, and penalties for misleading health officials. Despite early success, a second wave of cases led to school and business closures. The country now has the largest number of infections in Southeast Asia. In contrast, South Korea implemented aggressive testing and communication strategies early on in the pandemic. South Korea's COVID-19 strategy focused on tracking, testing, and treatment, with high testing rates and quick results. The country's low case fatality ratio is attributed to early detection and treatment, along with universal healthcare. South Korea managed to stabilize the outbreak without lockdowns or travel bans by being transparent and disseminating information effectively. President Moon Jae-in allowed national health officials to lead the response. South Korea reformed its health policy after the MERS outbreak in 2015, granting the government greater powers for monitoring and testing. Australia's successful containment of the pandemic is attributed to mitigation efforts, widespread testing, and tracing of contacts. Australia has one of the highest per capita testing rates in the world. Australia has one of the highest per capita testing rates in the world and launched the \"Covidsafe\" app to trace contacts of COVID-19 cases. New Zealand effectively dealt with the virus by isolating travelers and implementing widespread testing. Since March 19, New Zealand closed its borders to almost all travelers except citizens, residents, and their immediate families. Arrivals are placed in managed isolation facilities, with high-risk individuals in quarantine. The country has moved from lockdown to easing restrictions, transitioning from level 4 to level 2 alert levels in a short period. New Zealand moved from level 3 to level 2 alert on May 13, allowing most businesses to open, tertiary education to resume, and gatherings of up to 10 people. Border controls and physical distancing measures will remain in place. A travel bubble between New Zealand and Australia is being planned. Europe has been characterized as the new global epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic, with over 1.2 million infections and nearly 155,000 deaths reported in the EU and UK as of May 15. Since mid-April, European countries have cautiously expressed optimism that they have passed the peak of the COVID-19 crisis. Many nations like France, Germany, Italy, and Spain have started implementing phased reopening plans, easing lockdown measures. However, officials warn that reopening is conditional and could be reversed if infection rates rise. The pandemic is seen as Europe's biggest challenge since World War II, with significant economic repercussions. European governments and the EU are enacting policy responses to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, including initial lockdowns transitioning to cautious reopening. Countries like Italy, France, Germany, and the UK imposed nationwide quarantines and closed non-essential businesses. Schools and some businesses were closed, and public gatherings were restricted. Military forces were mobilized to assist in the response efforts. European governments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have mobilized military forces, implemented curfews, and announced plans for gradual reopening. The pace of reopening varies across Europe, with a focus on regional differences in infection rates and testing capacity. Analysts predict a potential financial crisis in Europe due to the pandemic. European governments and the EU are taking measures to prevent a financial crisis in Europe caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. These measures include loan programs, credit guarantees, income subsidies, tax deferrals, and debt repayment deferments. Italy announced a \u20ac55 billion stimulus plan, France pledged unlimited budgetary support costing up to \u20ac45 billion, and Germany announced direct fiscal support of \u20ac236 billion and a \u20ac500 billion loan program. Other countries have also implemented similar relief measures. The European Central Bank announced a Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program to manage the euro currency. The EU announced a Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program of \u20ac750 billion to calm markets and address debt crisis in the Eurozone. Eurozone leaders agreed to a financial assistance package of at least \u20ac540 billion, including credit lines through the European Stability Mechanism, a European Investment Bank fund for business loans, and an unemployment benefit support plan. The package did not include establishing common EU debt instruments. EU leaders are discussing potential economic measures, including the controversial proposal of \"corona bonds.\" Border closures and national border controls within the EU's Schengen Area have complicated the free movement of goods, services, and people. A temporary ban on \"non-essential travel\" into the EU and the Schengen Area has been implemented. The EU has implemented a temporary ban on \"non-essential travel\" into the EU and the Schengen Area for most foreign nationals from outside countries, including the United States, to preserve freedom of movement. This ban is expected to remain in place until at least June 15, causing tensions in U.S.-European relations. EU leaders criticized the U.S. travel ban imposed without consultation, leading to tensions in U.S.-European relations. The ban was extended to the UK and Ireland, with concerns raised about scapegoating the EU. European policymakers also objected to President Trump's decision to halt funding to the WHO. EU officials criticized President Trump's decision to halt U.S. funding to the WHO pending a review of its pandemic response. Concerns were raised about U.S. economic sanctions blocking humanitarian supplies for countries like Iran and Venezuela. Some European officials complained about U.S. efforts to outbid them for medical equipment. Critics also lamented the lack of coordinated U.S.-European leadership in the global pandemic response. Africa, except Lesotho, had confirmed COVID-19 cases, with South Africa accounting for 25% of the continent's total cases. Africa's COVID-19 cases have been lower compared to developed countries, but local transmission chains are confirmed in most African countries. Prevention strategies vary, with some governments improving testing capacity and contact tracing. However, many African health systems have limited capacities and resources. Healthcare infrastructure in Africa is limited, with low health spending, few hospital beds, and shortages of healthcare supplies. Socioeconomic challenges hinder prevention measures like hygiene and social distancing. Many Africans lack access to clean water and sanitation facilities, live in high-density areas, and have co-morbidities that increase the risk from COVID-19. Public outreach campaigns focus on personal hygiene, mask-wearing, and social distancing, while some countries have implemented lockdowns and restrictions on gatherings and businesses. University closures have been common in response to the pandemic, with some countries implementing limited restrictions in specific areas. Governments in multiple countries have enforced restrictive measures under national states of disaster, leading to concerns about human rights violations and abuse of emergency powers. Lockdowns have caused economic hardship in Africa, prompting governments to ease restrictions to allow normal commercial activity to resume. Experts are concerned about the devastating economic impacts of the pandemic in Africa, where tourism and commodity exports have declined sharply. Food insecurity may increase in food import-dependent countries, and remittances from abroad have dropped. Africa's heavy reliance on imports from China may also suffer, affecting business sectors tied to these imports. The COVID-19 pandemic is causing devastating economic impacts in Africa, with declines in tourism and commodity exports. African countries heavily reliant on oil exports are facing a double threat from the global oil price collapse and decreased demand. African airlines are also experiencing significant losses.
