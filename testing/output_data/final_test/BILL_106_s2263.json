    "content": "Temporary reduction in fuel taxes on gasoline, diesel fuel, kerosene, and aviation fuel. During the applicable period, there will be a temporary reduction in taxes on gasoline, diesel fuel, and kerosene by a certain amount per gallon. This reduction applies to specific rates of tax for these fuels sold for use in diesel-powered highway vehicles. The Secretary, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, determines the applicable cents per gallon for each rate of tax on gasoline, diesel fuel, and kerosene in diesel-powered highway vehicles. The reduction in revenues to the Treasury should not exceed the Federal on-line budget surplus during the applicable period. During the applicable period, a temporary reduction in the tax on aviation fuel will be implemented, with the rate of tax being reduced by a certain amount per gallon. This reduction aims to maintain trust fund deposits while ensuring that the reduction in revenues to the Treasury does not exceed the Federal online budget surplus. During the applicable period, a temporary reduction in the tax on aviation fuel will be implemented to maintain trust fund deposits. The reduction in revenues to the Treasury will be treated as taxes received in the Treasury. The amendments made by this section will take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act. SEC. 2. FLOOR STOCK REFUNDS. Before the tax reduction date, if tax has been imposed on any liquid under specific sections of the Internal Revenue Code, and on that date the liquid is held by a dealer for sale without being used, a credit or refund will be given to the taxpayer for the excess tax paid. Claims for credit or refund must be filed within 6 months after the tax reduction date. On the tax reduction date, a dealer can request a refund or credit from the taxpayer for any liquid held, as long as the taxpayer repays or agrees to repay the amount claimed. No credit or refund is allowed for liquid held in retail stocks. Definitions for \"dealer\" and \"held by a dealer\" are provided in this section. The terms \"dealer\" and \"held by a dealer\" are defined in this section, with the term \"dealer\" including a producer. The tax reduction date is specified as April 16, 2000, and certain rules from the tax code apply for this section. SEC. 3. FLOOR STOCKS TAX. Imposition of Tax: A floor stocks tax is imposed on any liquid held on the floor stocks tax date, equivalent to the tax that would have been imposed under specific sections of the Internal Revenue Code. Liability and payment methods are outlined, with the tax due within 6 months after the floor stocks tax date. The floor stocks tax is due within 6 months after the floor stocks tax date. Definitions for terms like \"held by a person\", \"gasoline\", \"diesel fuel\", and \"aviation fuel\" are provided. The floor stocks tax date is defined as January 1, 2001, and the applicable period is from after April 15, 2000, to before January 1, 2001. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Treasury or their delegate. The tax imposed on gasoline, diesel fuel, kerosene, or aviation fuel does not apply if a credit or refund is allowable. No tax is imposed on fuel held in the tank of a vehicle, motorboat, or aircraft. Additionally, no tax is imposed on gasoline held on the floor stocks tax date if the amount does not exceed 4,000 gallons. The tax on aviation gasoline, diesel fuel, kerosene, or aviation fuel does not apply if the amount held does not exceed 2,000 gallons. To qualify for this exemption, the person must submit required information to the Secretary. Fuel exempt from tax under certain subsections is not considered. Controlled groups, specifically corporations, are subject to specific rules under this subsection. Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, principles similar to those for controlled groups of corporations apply to a group of nonincorporated persons under common control. The provisions of law applicable to taxes imposed by section 4081 or 4091 of the Code also apply to floor stock taxes imposed under subsection (a) to the same extent as if imposed by those sections. The tax reduction benefits should be passed on to consumers. Consumers should immediately benefit from tax reductions, and transportation fuel producers should lower prices accordingly. A study will be conducted to ensure the tax reduction is passed on to consumers. The Comptroller General of the United States will report the results of a study on tax reduction to the Senate and House committees by September 30, 2000."
