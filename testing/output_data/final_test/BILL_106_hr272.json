    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Airline Competition and Lower Fares Act\". Withdrawal of slots is addressed in the Act. The \"Airline Competition and Lower Fares Act\" requires the Secretary to determine if high-density airports can meet demand for slots. If demand cannot be met, slots will be withdrawn from dominant carriers for redistribution. The Secretary must issue a written determination every 2 years on whether redistributing additional slots would increase competition. If so, slots will be withdrawn to ensure competition, following applicable laws. The Secretary may only withdraw a limited percentage of slots held by dominant air carriers at high-density airports for auction under this Act. The calculation excludes slots used for direct flights between high-density airports and low-competition airports. The Secretary cannot withdraw a dominant air carrier's slot at a high-density airport for redistribution under this Act if the slot has been used for direct flights to a low-competition airport for at least 24 of the last 30 months, or if the slot is used for international flights. SEC. 3. AUCTIONS. After withdrawing slots at high-density airports, the Secretary auctions them to new entrant and limited incumbent air carriers. The slots are awarded to the highest bidder. A percentage of redistributed slots must be used for flights between the airport and low-competition airports. Eligible bidders can bid for or hold a slot. Eligible bidders for slots at high-density airports must be new entrant or limited incumbent air carriers, US citizens or entities, have safety and economic certifications, not declined slots before 1986, and be qualified to use purchased slots. Eligible bidders for slots at high-density airports must meet specific requirements set by the Secretary, including not being substantially owned or controlled by a person who fails to meet the established criteria. Slots obtained through auction can only be transferred to carriers meeting the requirements of the section, and any change in ownership will result in the slot reverting to the Secretary. The Secretary may allow a new entrant air carrier to retain a slot if it promotes competition. This section does not alter slot allocation criteria, diminish the Secretary's authority to regulate slots, or convey any rights different from other slots at the same airport. The Secretary may use auction funds to reimburse dominant air carriers for withdrawn slots and airport investments. Remaining funds go to the Treasury's general fund. SEC. 4. SLOTS NOT ASSETS. A slot obtained under this Act or any other provision of law shall not be considered an asset for any purpose, including for collateral, forfeiture, or in bankruptcy. This does not apply to agreements in effect before the enactment of this Act. SEC. 5. UNFAIR COMPETITION. The Secretary must address complaints of predatory practices by air carriers filed before or after December 31, 1998, within specified timeframes after the enactment of the Act. The Secretary must address complaints of predatory practices by air carriers within specific timeframes after the enactment of the Act. An initial finding must be made within 30 days of a complaint being filed, and a restraining order may be issued within 15 days after the initial finding. The Secretary is required to report to Congress every 6 months on complaints received and actions taken. Guidelines must be established within 6 months of the Act's enactment. Within 6 months of the Act's enactment, the Secretary, in consultation with the Attorney General, must issue guidelines defining predatory and unfair competition practices under this section and title 49, United States Code. SEC. 6. ACCESS TO FACILITIES: The Secretary must ensure new entrant air carriers have access to airport facilities at comparable fees to incumbent carriers. SEC. 7. EVALUATION OF RULE: The Secretary will assess the impact of the 80-percent rule on airline competition. SEC. 8. LIMITS ON COMPETITION: The Secretary will report to Congress annually on barriers to entry and limits on competition in the aviation industry. SEC. 9. CLARIFICATION OF LEGAL STANDING. SEC. 9. CLARIFICATION OF LEGAL STANDING. Amends Section 41713(b) of title 49, United States Code to protect causes of action against air carriers by private parties enforcing rights under state common law or statutes, excluding those regulating fares or routes. SEC. 10. DEFINITIONS. For the purposes of this Act, definitions include \"air carrier,\" \"dominant air carrier,\" \"high-density airport,\" and \"limited incumbent air carrier.\" A dominant air carrier holds 10% or more of slots at high-density airports like LaGuardia, O'Hare, JFK, and Reagan National. Limited incumbent air carriers operate fewer than 12 slots at high-density airports. A low-competition airport is defined as one that is not a large hub and has significantly less service or higher airfares. A new entrant air carrier is a person without a slot at a high-density airport and has not given up a slot since December 16, 1985. The term \"person\" includes a commuter operator or air carrier. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Transportation. A \"slot\" is the operational authority for one landing or takeoff each day at a high-density airport."
