The Regional Infrastructure Accelerator Act of 2015 establishes a program to provide grants for regional infrastructure accelerators. A regional infrastructure accelerator seeking a grant must submit an application to the Secretary, including a plan to promote investment in covered infrastructure projects by providing guidance, evaluating financing methods, connecting financing sources, and establishing standards to measure life-cycle costs. The Regional Infrastructure Accelerator Act of 2015 aims to support the design, development, and maintenance of infrastructure assets. It also focuses on building the capacity of State and local governments to evaluate projects involving private capital investment and providing technical assistance on best practices for such projects, including selecting qualified advisors, incorporating resiliency risk analyses, reviewing proposals from private sector partners, and applying standardized analyses and processes. The Regional Infrastructure Accelerator Act of 2015 supports infrastructure asset development by assisting State and local governments in evaluating projects involving private capital investment. It includes technical assistance on best practices, selecting qualified advisors, incorporating resiliency risk analyses, reviewing proposals, and applying standardized analyses. The Secretary will select 5 regional infrastructure accelerators from diverse regions to receive grants, each with a board of directors including representatives from States and localities. The board of directors of the regional infrastructure accelerator, nominated by governing bodies, has duties to develop a plan, select subgrantees for funds, and submit reports. The Board of Directors of the regional infrastructure accelerator must approve a plan and submit a report to the Secretary. They should consider input from public project sponsors, entities able to finance projects, and construction or real estate stakeholders. The regional infrastructure accelerator's Board of Directors must include a construction or real estate development entity, a labor association representative, a legal expert in public-private partnerships, and a representative from relevant Federal agencies. The funds of the accelerator are to be used according to their approved plan and report submitted to the Secretary. The regional infrastructure accelerator awarded a grant will use funds to assess regional approaches, develop strategies for transparency and reducing costs, create a catalog of projects for investment, and analyze procurement methods for infrastructure projects. The regional infrastructure accelerator awarded a grant will assess taxpayer benefits of contractual agreements, measure project completion speed and quality, evaluate contracting strategies for design, construction, financing, and maintenance solutions, and submit a report to the Secretary within 12 months. The report will include an update on the implementation of the plan and a description of the region's infrastructure needs. The regional infrastructure accelerator awarded a grant will assess taxpayer benefits, project completion speed, and quality, evaluate contracting strategies, and submit a report to the Secretary. The report will include infrastructure needs, covered projects, and procurement strategies for subsequent grants. The Secretary will select at least 4 accelerators for a subsequent grant. The regional infrastructure accelerator awarded a grant will assess taxpayer benefits, project completion speed, and quality, evaluate contracting strategies, and submit a report to the Secretary. The Secretary will select at least 4 accelerators for a subsequent grant. The Secretary awards grants to regional infrastructure accelerators for predevelopment costs, with restrictions on subgrants not exceeding $300,000 or 75% of project costs. Funds cannot be used for completed work. The regional infrastructure accelerator grants can be used for predevelopment costs, including project planning, design, financial planning, permitting, and regulatory processes. Public entities can apply for subgrants with specific requirements set by the accelerator. The regional infrastructure accelerator grants cover predevelopment costs such as project planning, design, financial planning, permitting, environmental review, and regulatory processes.
