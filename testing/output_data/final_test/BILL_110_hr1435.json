    "content": "The Act titled \"Department of Veterans Affairs Claims Backlog Reduction Act of 2007\" is cited as the short title. Congress finds that there are over 500,000 veterans with pending claims at the Department of Veterans Affairs, including 100,000 claims over a year old. 37 States have established a system of County Veterans Service Officers to assist veterans with filing claims and provide information on State benefits. Cooperation between the Department of Veterans Affairs, State Veterans Agencies, and County Veterans Service Officers is necessary. County Veterans Service Officers, accredited by the Department of Veterans Affairs or State Department of Veterans Affairs, are a dedicated workforce ready to assist veterans. Cooperation between these officers and governmental agencies is crucial for better assistance to the Nation's veterans. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions include terms like \"claimant\" for individuals applying for benefits, \"County Veterans Service Officer\" for those assisting veterans with benefits, \"injury or illness claim\" for service-connected claims, \"presumptive claim\" for specific duty-related claims, and \"statutory claims\" for certain types of claims. The term \"statutory claims\" refers to benefits defined in section 5101 of title 38, United States Code. \"Specific claims\" encompass statutory, presumptive, and injury or illness claims. \"Ready to be rated\" indicates there is enough information to evaluate and assign a disability rating. The term \"State\" is defined in section 101(20) of title 38, United States Code. SEC. 4. PILOT PROGRAM TO REDUCE BACKLOG OF VETERANS' CLAIMS. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will conduct a pilot program to reduce the backlog of claims for benefits with County Veterans Services Officers in specific states, with the potential for expansion to other states upon request. The pilot program, conducted by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, aims to reduce the backlog of veterans' claims by referring them to County Veterans Services Officers. The program will last for three years and categorize claims for further development. The pilot program, conducted by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, aims to reduce the backlog of veterans' claims by referring them to County Veterans Services Officers based on geographical proximity to the claimant. Claims requiring further development will be referred to County Veterans Service Officers for development. Under the pilot program, claims for benefits under laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs can be submitted to County Veterans Service Officers. When a County Veterans Service Officer receives a claim, they will develop it as needed. County Veterans Service Officers are responsible for developing claims under subsections (c)(1) and (c)(2) by making personal contact with the claimant and acting as their advocate. They have the authority to fully develop the claim and represent the claimant in case of conflicts with the Department of Veterans Affairs. County Veterans Service Officers have the authority to fully develop and transmit claims to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs when ready to be rated. A claim is considered fully developed when all necessary items have been obtained by the officer in accordance with specified requirements. Under the pilot program, County Veterans Service Officers cooperate with veterans service organizations to develop claims, and have access to veterans' information in the Benefits Delivery Network of the Department of Veterans Affairs. County Veterans Service Officers will have online access to client information from the Department of Veterans Affairs database. Electronic files will be made available to officers for developing claims, and the information can only be used for that purpose. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress within 180 days after the pilot program ends. The Secretary must report to Congress on the program, including the original and final backlog numbers per State, total reduction of the backlog, claims referred to County Veterans Service Officers, returned claims ready for rating, and new claims filed and transmitted as fully developed. SEC. 5. FUNDING. Authorized appropriations for each State in the pilot program under section 4."
