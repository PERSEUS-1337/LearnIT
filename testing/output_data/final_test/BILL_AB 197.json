    "title": "AB 197",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 authorizes the State Air Resources Board to adopt regulations for greenhouse gas emission reductions to 1990 levels by 2020 and maintain reductions thereafter. Continuing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is crucial for protecting all areas of the state, especially the most disadvantaged communities. These communities are disproportionately affected by climate change impacts like extreme weather events and public health issues. The State Air Resources Board must ensure transparency and accountability in its actions to reduce emissions by making information more accessible to the public and the Legislature. Transparency and accountability are crucial for equitable state actions, especially for disadvantaged communities. A Joint Legislative Committee on Climate Change Policies will provide ongoing oversight over the state's climate policies, connecting various legislative committees. This new committee will oversee the integration of climate change policies across state agencies, including the State Air Resources Board. The Joint Legislative Committee on Climate Change Policies is established to provide oversight and make recommendations to the Legislature on the state's climate programs and policies. It will consist of members from the Senate and Assembly, reflecting multiple perspectives from various standing committees. The chair of the State Air Resources Board will present the annual report on emissions to the joint committee. A panel of experts may be established to analyze the state's climate policies for the committee's recommendations. Section 38506 defines \"social costs\" as economic damages related to greenhouse gas emissions. Section 38531 requires the state board to publish emissions data for facilities reporting under Section 38530 on its website annually. The state board must include toxic air contaminant emissions in the emissions data available on its website by January 1, 2018. Data for stationary sources will be based on information provided by air pollution control districts. The state board is required to present an annual report on greenhouse gas, criteria pollutant, and toxic air contaminant emissions to the Joint Legislative Committee on Climate Change Policies. The report will assess emission trends and discuss regulatory requirements, initiatives, and programs that may impact these trends. Additionally, it may include recommendations for legislative action. The state board must follow specific requirements when adopting rules to reduce emissions beyond the statewide limit and protect disadvantaged communities. This includes prioritizing emission reduction rules for large stationary and mobile sources, as well as other sources. Section 38562.7 of the Health and Safety Code requires each scoping plan update to identify projected emissions and air pollution reductions, cost-effectiveness, and incentives for emissions reduction measures. Additionally, Section 39510 amends the State Air Resources Board's composition to consist of 14 voting members within the California Environmental Protection Agency. The Governor appoints twelve members to the State Air Resources Board based on their expertise in air pollution control and understanding of public needs. Six members must have specific qualifications in automotive engineering, chemistry, meteorology, health effects of air pollution, or be public members. The Governor appoints twelve members to the State Air Resources Board based on expertise in air pollution control. Six members must have specific qualifications in automotive engineering, chemistry, meteorology, health effects of air pollution, or be public members. Six board members from different districts are appointed, each representing specific geographical areas within the state. The Senate Committee on Rules and the Speaker of the Assembly appoint one member each to the State Air Resources Board who works directly with communities most affected by pollution. Vacancies must be filled within 30 days, with the Senate Committee on Rules able to make appointments if the Governor fails to do so. (g) Members of the state board must act independently in furthering the division's goals. They can vote on matters even if they have previously voted on them as district board members, except for actions related to their own district. (h) Voting members serve six-year terms, with the possibility of reappointment. The state board members must act independently and can vote on matters, except those related to their own district. Members serve six-year terms and can be reappointed. A person ceases to be a member if they no longer hold the qualifying membership. Two Members of the Legislature serve as nonvoting members. The state board is responsible for establishing a program to collect air quality data in each air basin. The state board is tasked with inventorying sources of air pollution in the state's air basins, including natural, mobile, and area sources of emissions. They must utilize data from local, state, and federal agencies to fulfill this purpose. The state board must make emissions data available on its website, including greenhouse gases, criteria pollutants, and toxic air contaminants at a local level for stationary sources and county level for mobile sources. They are also responsible for monitoring air pollutants, adopting test procedures for compliance with emission standards. The state board is responsible for establishing and reviewing criteria for designating air basin attainment or nonattainment for state ambient air quality standards. This includes considering poor or limited air quality data and irregular violations, with public comment and a public hearing before adopting the criteria. The state board evaluates air quality indicators to measure progress towards state standards. By July 1, 1993, they will identify indicators for districts to assess progress. These indicators may replace annual emission reductions if modeling capability is sufficient, but must be at least as protective of overall health. The state board will establish a uniform methodology by July 1, 1996, for assessing population exposure to air pollutants above state standards. This methodology must align with the federal Clean Air Act and state regulations. This act will only take effect if Senate Bill 32 is enacted by January 1, 2017."
