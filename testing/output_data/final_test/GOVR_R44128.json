    "content": "The Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) program, administered by HUD's FHA, allows older homeowners to borrow against their home equity. Borrowers receive payments and the loan is paid off when the home is sold. FHA insures lenders against potential losses. Borrowers pay fees upfront and annually. The program was created in 1988 to help older homeowners access home equity for aging in place. The HECM program, created in 1988, aimed to provide home equity for aging in place, especially for low-income homeowners. It allowed for reverse mortgages to cover long-term care expenses and offered government insurance to attract private lenders. Despite insuring nearly 1 million mortgages, the program faced financial challenges post-2008 economic downturn due to changes in borrower behavior, leading to defaults on property taxes and insurance payments. The HECM program faced financial challenges post-2008 economic downturn due to changes in borrower behavior, leading to defaults on property taxes and insurance payments. HUD made changes including credit requirements for borrowers and faced legal challenges regarding non-borrowing spouses' treatment after the borrower's death. HUD ensured non-borrowing spouses are protected from foreclosure. The report discusses HECM basics, facts about HECMs and borrowers, current issues, and legislative history. Reverse mortgages, like HELOCs, allow borrowers to access home equity without monthly payments. Borrowers repay the loan, interest, and fees when they sell the home or move out. Reverse mortgages allow older homeowners to access home equity without monthly payments. The loan, interest, and fees are repaid when they sell the home or move out, with the amount determined by the home's value, borrower's age, and interest rate. This option provides extra income for those with lower monthly incomes and little savings, helping with expenses, home improvements, or debt repayment. Reverse mortgages allow older homeowners to access home equity without monthly payments. Borrowers can use reverse mortgages to pay down debt and reduce monthly expenses. The HECM program offers FHA insurance for lenders, protecting them against losses on their loans. Reverse mortgages are made by private lenders, with nearly all insured through the HECM program since the 2008 economic downturn. Borrowers must be approved by FHA, and the program regulations determine the loan amounts. The HECM program, governed by statute and HUD regulations, allows borrowers aged 62 or older to access home equity without monthly payments. Borrowers pay insurance premiums to HUD, and if the loan amount exceeds the sale price, HUD reimburses the lender. Eligibility standards include age and type of home. The HECM program allows borrowers aged 62 or older to access home equity without monthly payments. Borrowers must occupy a one-to-four family residence as their primary residence. Financial assessments are now required for new HECM borrowers to ensure payment of property charges. The HECM program requires financial assessments for new borrowers to ensure payment of property charges like taxes and insurance. The amount that can be borrowed is based on the Maximum Claim Amount (MCA) and Principal Limit Factor (PLF) set by HUD. The MCA is tied to the home's appraised value or the HECM loan limit, with the current limit at $636,150 for a single-unit residence. The PLFs are percentages applied to the MCA to determine the principal. The Principal Limit Factor (PLF) is determined by the borrower's age and interest rate, with higher PLFs for older borrowers and lower interest rates. PLFs do not change for ages above 90 years. The PLF is used to calculate the amount that can be borrowed, known as the Principal Limit (PL), by multiplying it with the Maximum Claim Amount (MCA). HUD publishes separate PLFs for non-borrowing spouses under age 62 to account for their time in the home. For example, a 75-year-old borrower with a $200,000 home and a 5% interest rate would have a PLF of 0.614. The initial interest rate on the loan is 5%, resulting in a principal limit of $122,800. Borrowers can choose to receive loan payouts in various ways, such as a lump sum or monthly payments. There are limits on upfront payments based on the principal limit. The FHA Commissioner can adjust the initial disbursement limit for HECMs, with total disbursements not exceeding the principal limit. Borrowers must pay upfront and annual mortgage insurance premiums based on the amount available in the first 12 months of the loan. The annual MIP is 1.25% of the outstanding loan amount. The HECM program allows lenders to add annual premiums to the borrower's loan balance, which are repaid as part of the loan. HUD offers a lower up-front MIP option called HECM Saver from 2010 to 2014. Unlike forward mortgages, HECM borrowers do not make monthly payments but must fulfill other obligations. Counseling is mandatory for potential borrowers, with spouses required to participate even if not on the mortgage. Counseling is a requirement for potential HECM borrowers, with counselors discussing options, financial implications, taxes, and property maintenance. Borrowers must reside in the home as their principal residence, keep it in good repair, and pay property taxes and homeowners insurance. In a forward mortgage, property taxes and homeowner's insurance are typically added to the monthly payment in an escrow account. However, with HECMs, this was not always the case. Borrowers had the option to have these payments added to the loan balance, but it was not required. Failure to make these payments could result in the lender adding them to the loan balance, potentially exceeding the borrowing limit. HUD issued new financial guidelines in 2015 due to some borrowers not staying current on tax and insurance payments. In 2015, HUD issued new financial guidelines for borrowers regarding property tax and insurance payments. Lenders may require borrowers to deposit these payments into a Life Expectancy Set-Aside Account based on financial assessments. HECMs ensure homeowners are not displaced and become due when a borrower dies or no longer resides in the home as a principal residence. Obligations include paying property taxes, homeowner's insurance, and maintaining the home. When the HECM becomes due, borrowers have three options: pay the mortgage balance, sell the home, or provide a deed in lieu of foreclosure. New regulations effective from September 19, 2017, allow the FHA Commissioner to set lower sales price requirements. The FHA Commissioner can establish a cash incentive for borrowers who provide a deed in lieu of foreclosure and vacate within six months. Lenders must proceed to foreclosure if no action is taken within the specified time frame. FHA insurance protects lenders from loan balance exceeding home value. Lenders can assign HECMs to HUD when the loan balance reaches 98% of the maximum claim amount. When the loan balance reaches 98% of the maximum claim amount, lenders can assign HECMs to HUD to make a claim for the outstanding balance. This can happen due to rising interest rates, taxes, or insurance payments added to the loan balance. After HECMs become due and payable, lenders can claim the difference from HUD if the home is not sold for enough to cover the loan balance. Advocacy groups and Congress have worked to ensure borrower understanding and protections for reverse mortgages. HECMs require counseling, disclosures, and additional consumer protection provisions. Congress mandated more disclosures on charges, consumer education, and restrictions on excessive costs for HECMs. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act (HERA, P.L. 110-289) imposed regulations on HECM counselors and lenders to prevent conflicts of interest and limit fees. It also eliminated a provision allowing waivers for mortgage insurance premiums when purchasing long-term care insurance. HECM program loans represent a small portion of the mortgage market, with about 115,000 new loans insured in FY2009 out of 1.8 million FHA single family loans. The number of HECMs in calendar year 2009 was nearly 9.4 million, but by FY2015, it was about 58,000. The program has insured nearly 1 million loans since its inception. The average maximum claim amount increased from less than $100,000 in the early years to over $275,000 in FY2015. Borrowers have gotten younger, disbursement methods have changed, and more borrowers are using HECMs to pay off existing debts. The average age of HECM borrowers has decreased over the years, from 77 in 1990 to 73 in FY2016. Females initially made up over 50% of borrowers, but the percentage declined as male borrowers and couples increased. By FY2016, couples accounted for 41% of borrowers, females 37%, and males nearly 22%. The trend of couples borrowing may be due to borrowers getting younger. The age of HECM borrowers has decreased, with an increase in male and couple borrowing. Younger spouses were previously removed from deeds to borrow more, but now HUD includes non-borrowing spouse age in loan calculations. Borrowers' credit situations may be less secure now, with a rise in consumer debt for older homeowners. During the 2000s, the percentage of older homeowners aged 65 and above with mortgage debt increased from 22% in 2001 to 30% in 2011. The median mortgage amount also rose from $43,400 to $79,000 during the same period. A 2011 survey showed that 67% of potential HECM borrowers pursued a reverse mortgage to pay off debt, compared to 51% in 2006. 79% of counseled borrowers had existing debt, with 40% being mortgage debt. HUD noted the increase in borrowers with property debt, leading to changes in HECM disbursement patterns. Prior to 2014, borrowers often withdrew large percentages of their HECM loans upfront, with over 70% taking between 80% and 100% of their principal limit in the first month from FY2010-FY2013. In the early years of HECM loans, borrowers typically chose to receive distributions as a line of credit or combined term and tenure payments with lines of credit. The shift to lump sum payments began with the introduction of fixed interest rate HECMs in 2008. Lenders started offering fixed-rate closed-end loans, requiring borrowers to take the full loan amount upfront to avoid interest rate risks. By the end of 2009, nearly 70% of HECM borrowers opted for lump sum payments, a significant increase from previous years. Today, the majority of HECM borrowers choose either lump sum payments or other fixed disbursement options. The HECM portfolio has shown volatility for the last eight years, with the estimated economic value fluctuating between positive and negative since 2009. Borrowers now mostly opt for closed-end lump-sum payments or a line of credit to withdraw most of the balance upfront. HUD made changes to the HECM program to improve financial stability after facing significant financial challenges. Despite these changes, the FY2016 HECM actuarial review revealed a negative economic value of $7.7 billion. Various factors have contributed to this instability, leading to negative estimates for the HECM portfolio. Congress and HUD have taken actions to address these issues and strengthen the HECM portfolio. The negative estimate for the HECM program exceeded $1 billion due to factors such as declines in home values, longer loan life, an increase in homes conveyed to FHA, and borrowers withdrawing maximum lump sum payments. Approximately 10% of HECM borrowers had failed to pay property taxes or insurance, with lenders paying the debts and adding them to borrower loan balances. The FY2016 actuarial review showed a negative estimate of economic value of $7.7 billion, mainly due to changes in assumptions about the HECM portfolio. HECM home sales prices were lower than estimated in previous reports, attributed to discounts in prices of HECM properties compared to market prices. New FHA data also revealed higher costs for lenders and FHA to maintain and sell properties. In August 2013, Congress enacted the Reverse Mortgage Stabilization Act of 2013 (P.L. 113-29) to allow HUD to make timely changes to protect the HECM insurance fund. HUD initiated program changes, including limiting lump sum payments to borrowers, with final regulations effective September 19, 2017. In 2013, HUD introduced the HECM Saver with lower upfront mortgage insurance premiums. However, in 2014, HUD eliminated the HECM Saver and imposed new limits on lump sum payments for all HECMs. HUD also restricted future draws on fixed interest rate HECMs to protect the insurance fund. Starting in 2015, HUD began considering borrowers' credit histories and ability to pay taxes and insurance when approving HECMs. In 2015, HUD began considering borrowers' credit histories and ability to pay taxes and insurance when approving HECMs. FHA issued guidelines for lenders to determine eligibility, including the possibility of setting up a \"life-expectancy set-aside account\" to ensure payments are made. HUD regulations effective September 19, 2017, allow for HECM insurance reimbursement for lenders' property charge advances. The HECM insurance reimbursement for lenders' property charge advances will be limited to two-thirds of total payments made for HECMs with case numbers assigned on or after September 19, 2017. There was uncertainty regarding treatment of non-borrowing spouses of HECM borrowers after the borrowing spouse's death due to HUD's interpretation of the term \"homeowner\" in the code. Non-borrowing spouses of HECM borrowers faced foreclosure or loan repayment upon the borrower's death. HUD changed its treatment of non-borrowing surviving spouses to allow them to remain in the home. Protections were outlined in mortgagee letters and regulations from January 19, 2017. Lenders have the option to assign HECMs to HUD with deferred payment if the non-borrowing spouse meets certain conditions. Non-borrowing spouses of HECM borrowers can remain in the property after the borrower's death if certain conditions are met, such as obtaining marketable title within 90 days. If the HECM is not assignable or the lender chooses not to assign it to HUD, foreclosure should occur within six months. HUD released final regulations in 2017 to protect non-borrowing spouses and ensure their rights going forward. The final regulations released by HUD in 2017 aim to protect non-borrowing spouses of HECM borrowers by ensuring their rights going forward. Non-borrowing spouses can remain in the home if certain qualifying attributes are met, and additional criteria must be fulfilled during the deferral period. If these conditions are not satisfied, the loan becomes due and payable. The federal government's involvement in reverse mortgages began with a grant from the Administration on Aging in the 1970s. Researchers in Wisconsin conducted a feasibility study, leading to pilot projects across the country. The Home Equity Conversion Project coincided with the 1980 White House Conference on Aging. The 1980 White House Conference on Aging led to the Equity Conversion Project, which recommended using home equity to supplement income for seniors. The Senate Special Committee on Aging later discussed home equity conversion, leading to the enactment of the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage Insurance Demonstration in 1988. The Home Equity Conversion Mortgage Insurance Demonstration (P.L. 100-242) was created in 1988 based on provisions from Senate bill S. 825 and House bill H.R. 4. The program aimed to assist seniors with lower incomes by allowing them to use their home equity to pay for expenses and remain in their homes. Government insurance was seen as necessary to encourage private lenders to offer reverse mortgages. The HECM demonstration program was created in 1988 to encourage private lenders to offer reverse mortgages to seniors with lower incomes. The program included protections for borrowers such as required counseling and the prohibition on involuntary displacement. HUD could insure up to 2,500 HECMs from the enactment of the program through September 30, 1991, with only single-unit homeowners qualifying. The HECM program, created in 1988, aimed to promote reverse mortgages for low-income seniors. Borrowers could prepay without penalty, choose fixed or variable rates, and receive counseling on financial options. The law protected homeowners from mortgage balance liability after sale and required repayment only upon death or home sale. The program ran for 10 years, with three extensions, ending on September 30. During its 10-year run, the HECM program saw three extensions, increasing the maximum insured mortgages to 50,000. The program was expanded to cover 1-4 family residences in 1996. In 1999, the program was no longer a demonstration and could insure up to 150,000 mortgages. The HECM program saw extensions over 10 years, increasing insured mortgages to 150,000. The law directed HUD to consult with various groups to improve consumer information for potential borrowers. It authorized funds for counseling and education, expanded disclosure requirements, and gave the HUD Secretary authority to restrict excessive costs for obtaining the mortgage. The American Homeownership and Economic Opportunity Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-569) allowed borrowers to refinance existing HECMs, receive credit for upfront premiums, waive counseling, and set limits on origination fees. It made owners of housing cooperatives eligible for HECMs and allowed the waiver of upfront mortgage insurance premiums for long-term care insurance purchases. The FY2007 Department of Defense Appropriations Act (P.L. 109-289) expanded the aggregate number of insured mortgages to 275,000. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-289) strengthened counseling requirements for HECM borrowers. Third-party housing counselors cannot be associated with loan originators or entities selling financial products. Mortgage originators were prohibited from selling insurance or financial products to borrowers. Lenders were also prevented from requiring borrowers to purchase insurance or financial products as part of the reverse mortgage. The Reverse Mortgage Stabilization Act of 2013 (P.L. 113-29) removed the provision allowing the waiver of up-front mortgage insurance premium for purchasing long-term care insurance. It also limited origination fees and allowed HECMs to be used for purchasing one to four-family homes. HUD was given authority to establish requirements for the HECM program's fiscal safety and soundness."
