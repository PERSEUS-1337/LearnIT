    "content": "Federal efforts to assist members of the Armed Forces with voting date back to 1864 when President Abraham Lincoln allowed soldiers to return home to vote if they couldn't do so absentee. Some states in the North established remote voting at military encampments, while others allowed absentee voters to designate a proxy. Despite an expansion of state absentee voting laws, little progress was made in the following decades to facilitate absentee voting for military members. During World War I, state laws and federal legislation aimed at assisting military voters were ineffective for overseas soldiers due to mail delivery barriers. The War Department did not supervise the service vote, stating it couldn't be conducted on foreign soil without interfering with military efficiency. The issue resurfaced in World War II, highlighting the challenge of facilitating military voting, especially for those stationed overseas. The Soldier Voting Act of 1942 guaranteed members of the Armed Forces the right to vote in federal elections while absent from their places of residence during wartime. It allowed them to vote for presidential electors and candidates for federal office, regardless of registration status or poll tax requirements. The law provided for postage-free absentee ballot requests and the preparation of \"official war ballots\" by secretaries of state. However, it had minimal impact on assisting Armed Forces voters. The Soldier Voting Act of 1942, enacted shortly before the 1942 November general election, had minimal impact on assisting Armed Forces voters. Only 28,000 of 5 million soldiers voted that year. The law mandated voting procedures for states during wartime, but its authority expired once the war ended. President Truman requested a study on military voting in 1951, leading to legislative recommendations endorsed by Congress in 1952. The Federal Voting Assistance Act of 1955 recommended absentee registration and voting for military members, federal employees abroad, and civilians affiliated with the Armed Forces. It was amended in 1968 to include U.S. citizens residing outside the country. The Overseas Citizens Voting Rights Act of 1975 guaranteed absentee voting rights for citizens abroad. The current law, the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act of 1986, consolidated these provisions. The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-410) consolidated provisions for military voters, their dependents, and overseas citizens. It was amended multiple times by subsequent acts. States are required to permit absentee registration for uniformed services voters, their spouses and dependents, and overseas voters without a residence in the U.S. The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act of 1986 allows military and overseas voters to register and vote absentee in federal elections. Amendments have extended the period covered by a single absentee ballot application. The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act of 1986 allows military and overseas voters to register and vote absentee in federal elections. The law requires states to accept and process valid voter registration applications from absent uniformed services voters or overseas voters at least 30 days before the election. The Help America Vote Act amended the law to require states to provide reasons for rejecting registration applications or absentee ballot requests. States are recommended to accept federal write-in absentee ballots for general elections for federal office under certain conditions. Voting materials must be carried according to the law. The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act of 1986 requires states to accept and process voter registration applications from military and overseas voters at least 30 days before the election. It also recommends accepting the Federal Post Card Application for absentee registration and ballot requests. States are advised to waive registration requirements for military and overseas voters, expedite voting materials processing, and permit oaths to be administered by commissioned officers. The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act of 1986 requires states to accept and process voter registration applications from military and overseas voters at least 30 days before the election. It also recommends accepting the Federal Post Card Application for absentee registration and ballot requests. States are advised to waive registration requirements for military and overseas voters, expedite voting materials processing, and permit oaths to be administered by commissioned officers. The Help America Vote Act of 2002 made amendments to UOCAVA, including establishing procedures for voting assistance duties, ensuring postmark or proof of mailing date on absentee ballots, and notifying members of the last day for ballots to reach officials in a timely manner. The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act of 1986 requires states to accept and process voter registration applications from military and overseas voters at least 30 days before the election. The Help America Vote Act of 2002 made amendments to UOCAVA, including establishing procedures for voting assistance duties, ensuring postmark or proof of mailing date on absentee ballots, and notifying members of the last day for ballots to reach officials in a timely manner. Additionally, it required each person who enlists in the military to receive the national voter registration form and designated a single office in each state to provide information to absent uniformed services voters and overseas voters. The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act of 1986 and the Help America Vote Act of 2002 made amendments to UOCAVA, including procedures for voting assistance duties, postmark requirements for absentee ballots, and notification of ballot deadlines. The Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2005 further amended UOCAVA to allow absent military voters in the US to use federal write-in ballots and repealed the electronic voting demonstration project requirement for the November 2004 election. The John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 extended the Interim Voting Assistance System (IVAS) ballot request program and required assessment of DOD programs for UOCAVA voting. The Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment Act (MOVE Act) was signed into law in 2009 to improve voting for military and overseas citizens. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2010 (P.L. 111-84) was approved in October 2009. It required states to establish procedures for absent uniformed services voters and overseas voters to request voter registration and absentee ballots electronically for federal elections. States also had to transmit blank absentee ballots to these voters and send requested absentee ballots at least 45 days before an election. The presidential designee (Secretary of Defense) must establish procedures for collecting marked absentee ballots from overseas uniformed services voters for delivery to election officials. The federal write-in absentee ballot can now be used for special, primary, and runoff elections. States cannot reject valid voter registration or absentee ballot applications from absent uniformed services or overseas voters based on notarization or paper restrictions. Online portals must be developed to inform absent uniformed services voters about voting. The act aims to improve the Federal Voting Assistance Program by developing online portals to inform absent uniformed services voters about voter registration and absentee ballot procedures. It also requires the presidential designee to establish standards for reporting on absentee ballots and repeals certain subsections of the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act. The MOVE Act aims to enhance the Federal Voting Assistance Program by creating online portals for absent uniformed services voters. It mandates the presidential designee to report to Congress on ballot collection and delivery for overseas voters and assess the Voting Assistance Officer program. The Attorney General must submit an annual report on civil actions related to UOCAVA. The act allows payments under the Help America Vote Act to meet new requirements and permits pilot programs for testing election technology. Most provisions were effective as of the November 2, 2010, general election. In 2010, 24 states enacted legislation to comply with the MOVE Act for absentee ballots in the general election. States with late primaries faced challenges in meeting the 45-day mailing requirement. Delays in tabulating results and certifying winners can impact the printing of absentee ballots for the general election. In 2010, 24 states enacted legislation to comply with the MOVE Act for absentee ballots in the general election. States with late primaries faced challenges in meeting the 45-day mailing requirement. Winning candidates can be included on general election ballots, but election contests can cause further delays. Some states changed their primary dates to comply with the ballot availability requirement, while others applied for waivers based on various reasons. The Department of Defense approved waiver requests for five states (Delaware, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, and Washington) and not approved for six jurisdictions (Alaska, Colorado, Hawaii, the Virgin Islands, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia). Maryland withdrew its waiver application. U.S. District Judge Roger Titus ordered Maryland to extend the deadline for receiving marked ballots. A member of the Maryland National Guard sued the state board of elections for denying overseas voters sufficient time to vote for state candidates. The Department of Justice filed lawsuits against several states to ensure overseas voters could participate in the election under the MOVE Act. Some criticized the department for not enforcing compliance quickly enough. Lawsuits were filed against Wisconsin, Guam, Illinois, New York, and New Mexico. Wisconsin reached an agreement to accept absentee ballots until November 19. The Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against Guam to extend the deadline for accepting absentee ballots until November 15. In Illinois, county election officials failed to send ballots on time, leading to an agreement to extend the deadline for receiving voted ballots until November 16. The Department of Justice reached agreements with New Mexico and New York to extend deadlines for accepting absentee ballots. Lawsuits were filed against states for failing to send ballots on time, resulting in extended deadlines for ballot receipt. The Department of Justice reached agreements with several states to extend deadlines for receiving absentee ballots, including Alaska, Colorado, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Kansas, Mississippi, Nevada, North Dakota, and the Virgin Islands. A consent decree in Wisconsin required certification of primary results by September 27 and transmission of absentee ballots by October 1. Several states, including Alaska, Colorado, and the District of Columbia, agreed to extend deadlines for receiving absentee ballots. Alaska expedited certification of results and sent ballots by September 18. Colorado ensured all counties transmitted ballots by September 18 and deployed staff for assistance. The District of Columbia certified primary results by September 24 and extended the deadline for accepting ballots to November 19. Several states extended deadlines for receiving absentee ballots. Hawaii agreed to send ballots by September 24 and use express delivery. In Kansas, seven counties failed to send ballots by September 18, leading to an extension of the deadline for accepting ballots. Mississippi also extended ballot acceptance deadlines due to counties failing to send ballots on time. One county in Nevada failed to send ballots to 34 voters who had requested them by September 18, leading to an extension of the deadline for accepting ballots until November 8. The Virgin Islands had specific deadlines for sending out ballots for federal and local elections. There was also an issue with states not providing electronic means for UOCAVA voters to request registration and absentee ballot applications. The Department of Justice enforces UOCAVA and the MOVE Act, which includes a provision for the Attorney General to submit an annual report to Congress on civil actions pursued for enforcement. In its 2010 report, the department outlined its efforts regarding the MOVE Act, reminding covered jurisdictions of the law's requirements and requesting compliance information. The Federal Voting Assistance Act of 1955 designated the Secretary of Defense to coordinate the Federal Voting Assistance Program. The program administers voting assistance for citizens covered by the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, publishing a Voting Assistance Guide with state requirements and practices. The program also provides assistance through a toll-free phone number for voters, military, and federal government personnel responsible for implementing the law. The Federal Voting Assistance Program, under the Secretary of Defense, assists citizens covered by the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act. They provide voting assistance through a toll-free phone number and a website, including an electronic system for registering, requesting, and tracking ballots. In the 2000 presidential election, a pilot project called Voting Over the Internet allowed some military and overseas voters to vote online. The Federal Voting Assistance Program conducted a pilot project in the 2000 presidential election to assist UOCAVA voters in registering and voting online. The program allowed voters to request and submit ballots electronically, with the completed ballots being decrypted by local election officials for counting. A total of 91 people registered to vote and 84 cast ballots from 21 states, 11 countries. Further development was recommended for Internet remote registration and voting. The 2000 pilot project for online voting concluded that further development is needed before Internet remote registration and voting can be effectively provided on a large scale. A provision in the Defense Authorization Act for FY2002 planned to expand the project for the 2002 elections, allowing absent uniformed services voters to cast ballots electronically through the Secure Electronic Registration and Voting Experiment (SERVE). The Secretary of Defense could delay the program until the 2004 general election if necessary. The Secretary of Defense requested approval to implement the SERVE program for the 2004 election, expanding it to seven states. Voters and officials had to register with SERVE to access servers hosted by the FVAP for registration and voting. The Voting Over the Internet project in 2000 was expanded to seven states with a target of 100,000 participants. A Security Peer Review Group (SPRG) in 2003 found fundamental security problems in the SERVE program, recommending its immediate shutdown due to vulnerability to cyber attacks. The Secretary of Defense suspended the Internet voting program in 2004 due to security concerns. The FY2015 NDAA law repealed the authorization for the VOI demonstration project. DOD launched a new program in 2004 allowing UOCAVA voters to request absentee ballots online. The Voting Assistance System (IVAS) allowed registered voters to request absentee ballots online, which were then downloaded, completed, and returned by mail. Under P.L. 109-234, the IVAS program was continued for uniformed services voters and their dependents. In 2006, the system was reconfigured and renamed the Integrated Voting Alternative Site. The Integrated Voting Alternative Site allowed registered voters to request absentee ballots online using a unique identifier. Voters could choose to request and receive ballots by email or through a secure server, following specific procedures outlined in the FVAP's Voting Assistance Guide. The Integrated Voting Alternative Site enabled registered voters to request absentee ballots online using a unique identifier. Voters could request and receive ballots through email, facsimile, or postal mail, with the option to complete and return the ballot electronically or by printing it out. The system did not provide a way for voters to return completed ballots, requiring them to use available means in their voting jurisdiction. The Federal Voting Assistance Program announced a grants program in May 2011 to develop electronic voting options for UOCAVA voters. The program aims to reduce the time needed for voters to register, request, receive, and return ballots. States, counties, cities, and townships can apply for grants, with $25.4 million disbursed to recipients by June 2012. This is the first time the Department of Defense has provided grant assistance to election efforts. The Department of Defense has offered grant assistance to election officials for the first time. Two bills in the 114th Congress propose amendments to UOCAVA, including changes to absentee ballot rules and residency guarantees for family members of absent military personnel. The FY2017 NDAA bill also includes UOCAVA amendments, such as revising ballot transmission rules and allowing a single absentee ballot application for multiple elections. The FY2017 NDAA bill includes amendments to UOCAVA, such as revising ballot transmission rules and allowing a single absentee ballot application for multiple elections. Additionally, six bills were introduced concerning uniformed services and overseas voters, including provisions for voting residency guarantees for family members of absent military personnel and changes to absentee ballot availability and transmission reports. H.R. 1655, H.R. 2168, H.R. 3576, and S. 1728 proposed various changes to voting procedures for uniformed services and overseas voters, including ballot transmission rules, address notification for deployed servicemembers, and deadlines for ballot availability. The proposed changes to voting procedures for uniformed services and overseas voters included requirements for pre-election reports, repeal of waiver deadlines, express delivery for missed deadlines, single absentee ballot applications for multiple elections, prohibition of early submission of voter registration and absentee ballot applications, application of UOCAVA to the Northern Mariana Islands, and biennial reports on the Federal Voting Assistance Program. The Senate Committee on Rules and Administration proposed changes to voting procedures for uniformed services and overseas voters from 2014 to 2020. This included online assistance for voter registration, absentee ballot requests, and repealing a voting demonstration project. The bill also aimed to guarantee residency for family members of absent military personnel. The Senate Committee proposed changes to voting procedures for uniformed services and overseas voters, including allowing electronic absentee ballots after the deadline and ensuring voters have a reasonable opportunity to vote if the state misses the ballot transmission deadline due to a natural disaster. Five bills in the 112th Congress would have impacted UOCAVA voters, with H.R. 702 aiming to amend UOCAVA to prohibit a state from certain actions. H.R. 702 aimed to amend UOCAVA by delaying the certification of general election results until absentee ballots from uniformed services voters were counted. It also included provisions for residency guarantees for military personnel, electronic delivery of absentee ballots, and applying UOCAVA to the Northern Mariana Islands. H.R. 5828 addressed the consequences of the MOVE Act repeal on UOCAVA, allowing absentee ballot applications to cover multiple elections. This led to ballots being sent to outdated addresses, increasing costs for local governments. The bill aimed to streamline the process by treating one application as valid for subsequent elections. The National Defense Authorization Act for 2012 included a provision to extend protections for overseas voters under the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act. Congress passed a version that did not include this provision. S. 3322 aimed to guarantee residency for voting to absent military personnel and require states to issue pre-election reports on absentee ballot availability. The MOVE Act repealed provisions on absentee ballot transmission, established a private right of action, and was effective in the 2010 election. The Military and Overseas Citizens Voter Empowerment Act was added as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010. President Obama signed the bill into law on October 28, 2010. The Military and Overseas Citizens Voter Empowerment Act, signed into law on October 28, established procedures for email and fax use in registration and absentee ballot applications, as well as for collecting marked absentee ballots from overseas uniformed services voters. Additionally, the House Administration Committee reported the Military Voting Protection Act, which required the Secretary of Defense to establish similar procedures. In the 111th Congress, hearings were held on UOCAVA voting by the Senate and House Committees. Representative Maloney introduced bills H.R. 1659 and H.R. 1739, with the latter proposing significant amendments to UOCAVA including adjustments to balloting materials and establishing a voter outreach grant program. Another bill, H.R. 2082, aimed to require states to accept overseas ballots submitted through express providers. The UOCAVA bill would require states to accept overseas ballots submitted by express mail service, reimbursing voters for the cost. It would also mandate the collection and delivery of marked ballots from overseas uniformed services voters before polls close, with a tracking system for delivery confirmation. A companion bill was introduced in the Senate. The 110th Congress introduced several election reform bills, including S. 3073 and H.R. 6625. S. 3073 aimed to collect overseas military ballots using express mail, while H.R. 6625 allowed state election officials to designate VA facilities as voter registration agencies. Other bills like H.R. 2835, H.R. 4173, H.R. 4237, H.R. 5673, and S. 1487 were not acted on. H.R. 2835, H.R. 4173, H.R. 4237, H.R. 5673, and S. 1487 were not acted on. H.R. 2835 aimed to extend UOCAVA law's provisions to cover elections in American Samoa. H.R. 4173 would have prohibited states from requiring notarization of absentee ballots and established a grant program to inform overseas citizens about absentee voting. H.R. 4237 would have clarified postage markings on balloting materials and amended laws concerning absentee ballots. H.R. 5673 and S. 1487 aimed to improve absentee voting for overseas uniformed services voters. H.R. 5673 required the Secretary of Defense to collect and deliver marked absentee ballots, while S. 1487 prohibited states from rejecting registration or ballot applications based on nonessential requirements. The Overseas Vote Foundation's survey included responses from active duty military personnel. The survey of 37 active duty military personnel found that 60.1% used the Federal Post Card Application for absentee ballots. Most who didn't submit cited missing the deadline or technical difficulties. 74.4% received an official ballot, while 23.2% did not. The Election Assistance Commission's 2015 report focused on UOCAVA voting. The EAC survey, Election Administration and Voting Survey, included 17 additional questions on UOCAVA voting from the FVAP survey. In the 2014 election, states sent 420,094 ballots to UOCAVA voters, with 51.4% to overseas civilian voters and 46.0% to uniformed services voters. The ballots were sent from various states and territories, with a majority from California, Florida, New York, and Washington. 145,509 ballots were submitted for counting by UOCAVA voters, including Federal Write-in Ballots (FWAB). The rate of return for ballots sent to uniformed services members was 34.8%. The overall rate of return for UOCAVA voters in the 2012 general election was 34.6%, similar to the 2010 mid-term election. Election officials counted 94.6% of the returned ballots, with reasons for rejection including ballots not received in time (48.9%), voter signature issues (14.2%), and ballots lacking postmarks (3.3%). The Election Assistance Commission's biennial report in July 2012 highlighted that states transmitted 876,362 ballots to UOCAVA voters, of which 606,425 were returned. In the 2012 general election, 606,425 out of 876,362 ballots sent to UOCAVA voters were returned for counting. States counted 95.8% of returned ballots, an improvement from the 2008 election. Most rejected ballots were late, had signature issues, or lacked postmarks. The majority of ballots were sent from seven states. The report provided detailed information on UOCAVA ballots, noting improvements in data quality and state efforts. The Overseas Vote Foundation also issued a biennial election report in January 2013 based on post-election surveys. The 2012 report on UOCAVA voters found that 34.9% used electronic methods for registration and ballot requests, an increase from previous years. Most voters returned their marked ballots by regular mail, while 14.9% used electronic means. The leading reasons for rejecting a registration and ballot request were late arrival, lack of signature or date, and incompleteness. Most states transmitted blank ballots as PDF attachments via email. However, issues arose with electronic transmission, such as voters not receiving the ballot or being unable to open PDF files. The Inspector General of the Department of Defense assessed the implementation of the MOVE Act by the Federal Voting Assistance Program in a report issued on August 31, 2012. The report assessed the 2010 FVAP report to Congress and the establishment of voting assistance offices on military installations. It found that not all required offices were set up due to lack of funding, estimated at $15-20 million annually. The report recommended drafting a legislative proposal to request relief from the MOVE Act requirement, allowing Military Departments to designate IVAOs at their discretion to optimize voting assistance. The Military Voter Protection Project highlighted incomplete MOVE Act implementation, leading to a decrease in absentee ballot requests from military voters in 2012 compared to 2008. The Election Assistance Commission and the Federal Voting Assistance Program provide reports on absentee ballot requests from military voters, comparing data to 2008. The EAC report noted that states counted 93% of UOCAVA ballots submitted, similar to 2008 figures. In 2010, 93% of UOCAVA ballots were submitted, with 49% from uniformed services voters and 41% from overseas civilians. States transmitted 611,058 ballots, of which 211,749 were submitted for counting and 197,390 were counted. The fate of the remaining 400,000 ballots is unclear, with 47,000 returned as undeliverable or spoiled. The most common reason for rejecting a ballot was late arrival, accounting for 32% of rejections. The number of ballots transmitted to UOCAVA voters dropped from 989,208 in 2008 to 611,058 in 2010. The number of ballots transmitted to UOCAVA voters dropped from 989,208 in 2008 to 611,058 in 2010. The FVAP report adjusted survey results for active duty military members, noting that 85% were registered and 45.5% voted, compared to 65% registration and 46% turnout for the civilian voting age population. The report highlighted voter turnout rates for active duty military (ADM) compared to the civilian voting age population (CVAP) in the 2010 election. Overseas citizen data was challenging to obtain, but local election officials reported a 45% voter turnout among registered overseas citizens. The report also noted a stable ADM voter registration between 2008 and 2010, with a significant increase in voter participation rates from 2006 to 2010, possibly due to improvements in ballot transmission for military voters under the MOVE Act. The Overseas Vote Foundation's report on the 2010 election revealed that 18% of UOCAVA voters did not receive a requested ballot and 16.5% received it late. The survey also found that 80% used electronic means to send applications, and 23% received blank ballots electronically. The report, based on survey responses from UOCAVA voters and election officials, shows progress in voting under UOCAVA but highlights areas for reform. One in four voters did not receive their absentee ballot, leading to some using the federal write-in ballot or not participating in the election. Over half of those who tried to vote but failed received a late or no ballot. The Pew Center on the States issued a report in January 2009 with recommendations for improving the voting process for UOCAVA voters. The report highlighted the need for improvements in absentee balloting rules for UOCAVA voters, recommending changes such as eliminating notarization requirements, expanding electronic transmission of election materials, and providing at least 45 days to receive and return a ballot. The Overseas Vote Foundation launched a website in 2007 to assist UOCAVA voters in registering and requesting a ballot. The GAO and EAC reports in 2007 highlighted challenges faced by military and overseas voters in the 2006 election. The EAC found that 33% of ballots requested by these voters were cast or counted, with 70% of uncounted ballots returned as undeliverable. GAO recommended electronic solutions to improve absentee voting for the 6 million UOCAVA voters. The challenges faced by military and overseas voters in elections have led to frequent revisions in voting laws, with Congress amending the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act multiple times since 2001. Further improvements to the law may be considered in the 114th Congress based on voting participation in the 2012 election. In the 2014 midterm election, 34.6% of transmitted UOCAVA ballots were not returned to election officials, highlighting disparities in absentee ballot return rates. Congress has shown a willingness to make further improvements for UOCAVA voters."
