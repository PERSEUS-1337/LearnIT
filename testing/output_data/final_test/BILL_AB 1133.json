    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The State of California has a history of recognizing the mental health needs of children and supporting evidence-based mental health services in publicly funded preschools and elementary schools. This is evident from programs like the Primary Intervention Program and the Early Mental Health Initiative. The State Department of Mental Health provided funds for prevention and early intervention programs like the Primary Intervention Program for students with school adjustment difficulties. The EMHI received $15 million in state funds in the 2011\u201312 fiscal year, with success measured by improvements in learning behaviors, attendance, school adjustment, and school-related competencies for at least 75% of program completers. The EMHI met legislative requirements successfully, with 79% of students showing improved social competence and school adjustment behaviors after completing services. The program's effectiveness was exceptional compared to others, considering its short-term and cost-effective nature. The 2010/2011 Early Mental Health Initiative Statewide Evaluation Report highlighted an unmet demand for EMHI-funded services at schools due to capacity and funding constraints. The Governor's realignment in 2011\u201312 limited the State Department of Mental Health's mission, and the Budget Act of 2012 disbursed Proposition 98 funds directly to local education agencies for enhanced financial management at schools. The State of California supports local decisions to fund evidence-based mental health services for children in publicly funded preschools and elementary schools. Multitiered systems have been shown to be cost-effective in pilot programs in San Bernardino and Alameda counties. Amendments are made to the Welfare and Institutions Code for defining purposes. For the purposes of this part, definitions include \"Cooperating entity\" as a provider of school-based early mental health services, \"Eligible pupil\" as a student in preschool or grades K-3, \"Local educational agency\" as a school district or charter school, \"Department\" as State Department of Public Health, \"Director\" as State Director of Mental Health, and \"Supportive service\" as a service enhancing children's mental health and social development. The State Public Health Officer will establish a pilot program to provide funding for school-based early mental health intervention and prevention services. The program includes outreach to local education agencies and county mental health agencies, as well as free regional training on eligible support services. The pilot program provides funding for school-based mental health services, including individual and group interventions, parent involvement, staff training, referrals to outside resources, and use of paraprofessional staff. These services aim to improve the mental health of eligible pupils and align with state priorities and local goals. The eligible support services defined in this section include using local funds for educational and mental health purposes, accessing external resources like workshops and training, and utilizing state resources for student mental health and positive learning environments. These resources cover aspects such as toxic stress, childhood trauma, behavioral supports, restorative practices, and bullying prevention. The department offers technical assistance to local education agencies for eligible services, including program design, staff training, local evaluations, and budget development. Schoolsites are selected and supported for outreach, training, and technical assistance. During the first 18 months, the department will support 30 schoolsites that previously received funding for mental health services and develop methods for new schoolsites. In the following 18 months, 30 new schoolsites will be selected to receive eligible support services. The department will prioritize geographic diversity, program effectiveness, efficiency, and long-term sustainability in selecting schoolsites for support. An interim report will be submitted to the Legislature after the second year of the pilot program, detailing the department's work and assessing the impact of funding for the School-Based Early Mental Health Intervention and Prevention Services Matching Grant Program. The report will be made public and posted on the department's website. The department will develop an evaluation plan to assess the impact of the pilot program and submit a report to the Legislature at the end of the four-year period. The chapter will be in effect until January 1, 2021, unless extended or deleted by a later statute enacted before that date."
