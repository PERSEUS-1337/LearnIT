SEC. 3. NATIONAL COUNTER-CYCLICAL INCOME SUPPORT PROGRAM FOR DAIRY PRODUCERS. During 2003-2011, the Secretary will implement a program to support eligible milk producers' income in participating States. States are automatically part of the program unless they choose to withdraw by notifying the Secretary in writing. The program supports milk producers' income in participating States.

Regional Supply Management Districts will be established by the Secretary. The bill establishes regional supply management districts in various states, including Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Utah, Wyoming. The Pacific District, consisting of California, Oregon, and Washington, is administered by a Regional Supply Management Board composed of members appointed by the Secretary from nominations submitted by the Governor of each participating State. Each State must nominate at least five residents to serve on the Board, including an eligible producer and a consumer representative. The National Dairy Producers Trust Fund is established in the Treasury of the United States, funded by payments received and made by the Secretary. The Trust Fund is available for the Secretary to use for expenditures related to this section, as provided for in an appropriations Act. The Secretary will use Trust Fund amounts for administrative costs and increased milk expenses in food assistance programs. Processors in participating States will pay into the Trust Fund when milk prices are below target prices. The payment rate for Class I milk purchased from eligible producers is determined by the quantity purchased and the difference between the target price and minimum price in the marketing area. The target prices for different marketing areas range from $16.05 to $18.25 per hundredweight. The target prices for various marketing areas range from $16.05 to $18.25 per hundredweight. The Secretary determines prices for specific regions, such as $16.25 for the Mideast, $16.15 for the Pacific Northwest, $17.25 for the Southwest, $16.60 for the Arizona-Las Vegas area, and $16.15 for the Western region. For areas not covered by an order, the Secretary sets a price per hundredweight based on adjacent marketing areas. Additionally, the Secretary can allocate funds from the Commodity Credit Corporation for counter-cyclical payments to the Trust Fund as specified in appropriations Acts. The Commodity Credit Corporation is authorized to make monthly payments to the Trust Fund based on the quantity of eligible milk production sold in different districts. The payment rate is determined as 25% of the difference between $13.00 per hundredweight and the average price received by producers for Class III milk. The Trust Fund can then make payments to Boards. The Trust Fund uses remaining amounts to make monthly payments to Boards based on eligible production sold in each District. Boards can then use these payments to compensate eligible producers for commercially sold milk in participating States. The Trust Fund makes monthly payments to Boards based on eligible production sold in each District. Boards can use these payments to compensate eligible producers for commercially sold milk in participating States. Boards may also use a portion of the payments to provide bonuses or incentives to manage milk supply and request the Secretary to review proposed actions. If the Secretary determines additional costs incurred by the Commodity Credit Corporation, reimbursement may be required. The Corporation incurred extra costs for the milk price support program due to overproduction in a District. The Board may impose an assessment on milk sales to reimburse the Corporation. Counter-cyclical payments are provided for eligible producers selling milk to processors in nonparticipating states. Counter-cyclical payments are made to eligible producers in nonparticipating states based on the difference between $13.00 per hundredweight and the average price received for Class III milk in the District. The payment quantity for eligible producers in a District is determined by the Secretary based on the quantity of eligible production of Class II, Class III, and Class IV milk, minus any milk sold to a processor in a participating State during the month. SEC. 5. PAYMENT LIMITATION: No individual or entity may be paid for production exceeding 230,000 pounds of milk per month under this Act."
