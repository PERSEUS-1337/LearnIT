    "content": "China supported the United States in combating terrorism after the September 11, 2001 attacks. President Jiang Zemin condemned the attacks, offered condolences, and promised cooperation with the US. China also voted for Resolution 1368 at the UN Security Council to combat terrorism and offered \"unconditional support\" in fighting terrorism. Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan promised cooperation with the US Secretary of State Colin Powell. China's support for the US in combating terrorism after 9/11 included promises of cooperation and attendance at a productive meeting in Washington, DC. China voted for Resolution 1373 at the UNSC but expressed concerns about US military action. Initial PRC media commentary faulted US intelligence and policies for the attacks. China favored using its veto power at the UNSC and initially expressed reservations about US military actions. Prime Minister Tony Blair and China's Jiang emphasized the need for conclusive evidence and specific targets in the war against terrorism, while also stressing compliance with the U.N. Charter and involvement of the Security Council. President George W. Bush's top security concerns included terrorism, weapons proliferation, and China. The EP-3/F-8 aircraft collision crisis and U.S. arms sales to Taiwan strained U.S.-China relations in April 2001. Despite limited cooperation in counterterrorism post-9/11, efforts helped stabilize the bilateral relationship pursued by President Bush. In late 2001, President Bush pursued a relationship with Beijing focusing on counterterrorism cooperation. China's support in the war against terrorism was praised by Secretary of State Colin Powell in February 2002. China's ties with nuclear-armed Pakistan were also considered significant, especially with concerns about the stability of President Pervez Musharraf's government. Musharraf had agreed to fight terrorism before meeting with a PRC envoy on September 18, 2001. In September 2001, President Musharraf agreed to fight terrorism and received support from China, which has provided Pakistan with nuclear and missile technology. There were hopes that counterterrorism cooperation would improve US-China relations, but concerns remained about potential compromises to other US interests. President Bush expressed optimism for collaboration in his State of the Union speech in January 2002. In 2002, President Bush emphasized cooperation with Russia, China, and India for peace and prosperity. Despite concerns about domestic attacks and foreign links, China supported the US after 9/11. China also feared US military actions near its borders, US-led alliances, Japan's role in the war on terrorism, and increased US influence in Asia. China's stance was influenced by its image as a responsible world power and long-standing fears of \"encirclement.\" China's Defense White Papers criticized the United States for military buildup, alliances in Asia, and arms sales to Taiwan. U.S. concerns about China's cooperation in counterterrorism have increased since 2005. Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick called for more collaboration in the global fight against terrorism. Since 2005, U.S. concerns about China's cooperation in counterterrorism have grown. U.S. officials have expressed worry about China-origin arms in conflicts involving U.S. forces in Afghanistan. Policy options for Congress include visits to Xinjiang and legislation for a Special Envoy for Uighur affairs. The U.S. has concerns about China's cooperation in counterterrorism, including China-origin arms in conflicts involving U.S. forces in Afghanistan. Policy options for Congress include visits to Xinjiang and legislation for a Special Envoy for Uighur affairs. The counterterrorism campaign stabilized U.S.-PRC relations after tensions in the Bush Administration. President Bush chaired a NSC meeting on September 11, 2001, following the attacks. President Bush saw the 9/11 attacks as an opportunity to engage with Russia and China. He met with PRC President Jiang Zemin in Shanghai and Beijing, emphasizing the importance of China in the global fight against terrorism. Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick recognized the potential for increased cooperation between China and the United States in combating terrorism. President Bush emphasized China's role in the global fight against terrorism. President Obama elevated the dialogue with China to the \"Strategic and Economic Dialogue\" in 2009. Secretary Clinton urged cooperation to increase stability in Afghanistan and Pakistan during the first S&ED. Talks in Beijing reciprocated a meeting in Washington, DC on counter-terrorism. In Beijing, the PRC agreed to U.S. requests for FBI cooperation on counterterrorism, including setting up a Legal Attach\u00e9 office at the U.S. Embassy, holding semi-annual consultations, and establishing a Financial Counter-Terrorism Working Group. Cooperation involved U.N. coordination, intelligence-sharing, law enforcement liaison, and monitoring financial networks. The FBI office was approved in February 2002, with the first meeting on terrorist financing held in May. The FBI attach\u00e9 arrived in Beijing in September 2002. In November 2005, U.S. Attorney General met with PRC Minister of Public Security in Beijing, and in June 2007, FBI Assistant Director visited Beijing. In June 2007, FBI sought more information on terrorism from the PRC. In December 2002, Assistant Secretary of State confirmed intelligence-sharing with the PRC. President Obama called for continued intelligence-sharing at the S&ED in July 2009. Major General Yang Hui of the PLA complained about leaks during a visit to Washington in September 2009. General Ronald Burgess expressed concerns about leaks related to a 2006 incident involving a PLAN submarine following the USS Kitty Hawk. He also raised questions about the alleged terrorist ties of Muslim Uighurs in China's Xinjiang region. Congress is worried about the human rights of Uighurs, with China accusing the US of double standards. Uighurs claim to face executions, torture, detentions, and religious persecution. Since 2002, China has used the international counterterrorism campaign to justify its repression of Uighurs, including military exercises in Xinjiang. Critics accuse China of extraditing Uighurs for punishment, violating international laws. Cambodia also returned Uighurs in 2009. Cambodia and Burma deported Uighurs to China in 2009 and 2010, despite opposition from the US State Department. Uighurs are ethnically Turkish people who practice Islam and call their homeland \"East Turkistan.\" The Uighurs refer to their Central Asian homeland as \"East Turkistan,\" which was incorporated into the People's Republic of China in 1949. The area was later designated as the \"Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region\" in 1955. The region is heavily controlled by PLA forces, the People's Armed Police, and the paramilitary Production and Construction Corps. Uighurs face forced assimilation and routine executions for political and religious dissent. The Uighurs in Xinjiang resent Communist controls on religion, military presence, and forced assimilation. The population demographics show Uighurs at 8.4 million and Hans at 40% in 2003. The PRC regime responds to dissent with public sentencing rallies and executions, intimidating Uighurs. In December 2001, there were individuals from western China involved in terrorist activities in Afghanistan, but not all people from western China are terrorists. The U.S. captured some individuals from western China linked to Al Qaeda. However, in August 2002, the East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM) was designated as a terrorist group by the U.S. after bilateral discussions with China. In January 2002, China accused ETIM and other East Turkistan groups of terrorism, linking them to Al Qaeda. The U.S. Embassy in Beijing warned of a potential attack on the U.S. Embassy in Kyrgyzstan by ETIM, but no attack occurred. The U.S. called on China to respect Uighur rights while acknowledging China's support at the UN Security Council. ETIM was designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. to freeze its assets. E.O. 13224 defines \"terrorism\" as involving violent or dangerous acts intended to intimidate or coerce. The U.S., PRC, Afghanistan, and Kyrgyzstan requested the UN to designate ETIM under Resolutions 1267 and 1390 to freeze assets. In 2004, ETIM was included in the \"Terrorist Exclusion List\" by the Secretary of State. In April 2009, Abdul Haq, a Uighur leader of the East Turkistan Islamic Party (ETIP), was designated under E.O. 13224 for directing attacks in China. Haq was also a member of Al Qaeda's Shura Council in 2005. The UN Security Council identified him as the overall leader of ETIM in Pakistan. Abdul Haq, a Uighur leader associated with Al Qaeda and the East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM), was reportedly killed in a drone attack in North Waziristan in February 2010. The case against ETIM has been complicated by questions regarding the credibility of linking \"terrorism\" to repressed groups like Uighurs. The authenticity of Internet messages and websites supposedly linked to the Turkistan Islamic Party (TIP), also known as ETIM, is being questioned. There are possibilities that the messages were created by the terrorist group, fabricated by the PRC, or made by a third party for deception. ETIM first appeared in 2000 and was reportedly linked to Osama bin Laden in 1999. Before the PRC government's public report in January 2002 on \"East Turkestan terrorists,\" most were not aware of ETIM. PRC officials did not mention ETIM until after the September 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States. The leader of ETIM, Hasan Mahsum, claimed in 2002 that the organization had no links to Al Qaeda or Taliban and did not receive financial aid from Osama bin Laden. In November 2003, the Turkistan Islamic Party denied the U.S. and PRC designations of ETIM as a \"terrorist organization.\" In December 2003, China issued a list of wanted \"terrorists,\" including ETIM and other Uighur groups. Hasan Mahsum was listed as a terrorist, but he was already dead. Pakistan's military killed Mahsum at the Afghan-Pakistani border. In October 2003, Pakistan's military killed Hasan Mahsum, a leader of the Turkistan Islamic Party, in South Waziristan. The TIP eulogized Mahsum online, mentioning his organization's development with Taliban support in Afghanistan. Abdul Haq took over as the new leader, but his name was not on China's list of wanted terrorists. Hozaifa Parhat, a Uighur detainee at Guantanamo, confirmed seeing Mahsum at a Uighur camp in Afghanistan. In 2004-2005, Review Tribunal confirmed seeing Mahsum, leader of Uighur camp in Afghanistan. ETIM sent militants to China, met with Osama bin Laden in 1999. Al Qaeda in Afghanistan mentioned Uighur \"martyrs\" in 2008. ETLO leader denied responsibility for violent incidents in 2003. Hazret, leader of ETLO, denied responsibility for violent incidents and any links to Al Qaeda. He acknowledged the intention to establish a military wing targeting the PRC government for oppressing the Uighur people. The PRC's 2002 report on \"East Turkistan terrorists\" claimed bombings in Xinjiang from 1991 to 1998, with no incidents reported after that year. The report did not label violent incidents outside Xinjiang as \"terrorism\" and alleged bombings in 1998 that were not reported by media sources. Abdurixit stated in Beijing in early 1998 and 1999 that there were no major violent incidents in 1998. In April 1998, a PRC official journal reported bombings in 1997 but none in 1998, claiming China had no terrorist organizations. Xinjiang's Vice Chairman mentioned an explosion near Kashgar in early 1998 with no casualties. The last bombing incident in Xinjiang before August 2008 occurred in 1997, with speculation that it was timed around Deng Xiaoping's death. The preceding major turmoil in Xinjiang in February 1997, known as the \"Gulja Massacre,\" led to Uighur protests, crackdowns, and bombings in various cities. The incidents followed the PRC's national anti-crime campaign targeting separatists in Xinjiang and Tibet. Uighur and human rights groups expressed concerns over the U.S. designation of ETIM as a terrorist organization. Groups have raised concerns that the U.S. designation of ETIM as a terrorist organization in 2002 justified China's persecution in Xinjiang. They argue that Uighurs do not harbor anti-U.S. sentiments and see the U.S. as a defender of their human rights. Assistant Secretary of State James Kelly defended the designation based on evidence of ETIM's links to Al Qaeda and violence against civilians, not as a concession to China. Assistant Secretary of State Lorne Craner visited Xinjiang University as part of the U.S.-PRC Human Rights Dialogue, emphasizing U.S. support for human rights. The U.S. does not support governments using counterterrorism to suppress peaceful political or religious views. The U.S. condemned the ETIM group linked to Al Qaeda but reaffirmed friendship with the peaceful people of Xinjiang. Questions remain about the extent of ETIM's ties to Al Qaeda, with limited evidence presented in court cases. The U.S. condemned the ETIM group linked to Al Qaeda but questions remain about the extent of their ties. Specific U.S. allegations mention Al Qaeda's financial aid for ETIM and the inclusion of ETIM's leader in Al Qaeda's Shura Council in 2005. There is uncertainty about any ties evolving after 2005. Al-Fajr Media Center issued a video in 2006 supporting \"jihad in East Turkistan\" against China, but did not mention the TIP organization. In 2009, TIP's media center allowed Al-Fajr to distribute their messages. Al Qaeda's deputy leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, occasionally mentioned the East Turkistan cause in videos from 2006 to early 2009. China has linked charges of terrorism to Uighur groups and Rebiya Kadeer. The Congress has expressed concerns about PRC repression of Uighurs and Tibetans, including the imprisonment of Rebiya Kadeer's relatives. Rebiya Kadeer was detained in China from 1999-2005, nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006, and elected as President of the Uyghur American Association and World Uyghur Congress in 2006. In 2004, the East Turkestan National Congress and World Uyghur Youth Congress merged to form the World Uyghur Congress (WUC). The House passed H.Res. 497 in the 110th Congress, expressing concerns about the PRC's treatment of Uighurs and urging the release of Rebiya Kadeer's children and Huseyin Celil. On May 22, 2008, Senator Sherrod Brown introduced a bill, S.Res. 574, and on July 11, Representatives Jim McGovern and Frank Wolf condemned China's crackdown on Uighurs. The House passed H.Res. 1370 on July 30, 2008, calling on China to stop repression of Tibetan and Uighur peoples. In May 2009, the WUC held its Third General Assembly where Members of Congress spoke, and Senator Sherrod Brown introduced S.Res. 155 urging China to stop suppressing Uighur rights. In June 2007, President Bush met with Uighur activist Rebiya Kadeer and criticized China's imprisonment of her sons. In July 2008, before the Beijing Olympics, Bush addressed religious freedom and met with advocates for freedom in China, including Kadeer. The PRC blamed Kadeer for Uighur-Han clashes in 2009, raising her international profile. In March 2008, violent clashes occurred in Lhasa, blamed on the Dalai Lama by the PRC. In July 2009, Uighurs in Urumqi protested a deadly fight between Han and Uighur workers, resulting in 192 dead and 1,721 injured. The PAP allowed Han mobs to attack Uighurs, with casualties emphasized on Hans as victims. Foreign reporters had more access in Urumqi but communication was blocked by the regime until March 2010. In July 2009, the Xinjiang local government blamed Rebiya Kadeer for the clashes in Urumqi, while she denied the accusations and called for international investigations. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Ted Kaufman urged China for peaceful protests and press freedom, while Representative Bill Delahunt introduced measures in Congress. In July 2009, Representative Bill Delahunt introduced H.Res. 624 to condemn the violent repression of Uighurs in China. Later, Representative James McGovern introduced H.Res. 953 to address human rights violations targeting Uighurs in the aftermath of unrest in July, including executions and arbitrary detentions. Uighur women spoke to foreign reporters about their detained family members. Following the unrest in Xinjiang, over 4,000 Uighurs were reportedly arrested by the PRC, with some held in PLA warehouses. Nearly 10,000 Uighurs were said to have disappeared in Urumqi, and at least 300 fled from China. Ethnic tension remained high, with some Hans directing anger towards Uighurs, Wang Lequan, and the PLA. Court decisions in Xinjiang resulted in 26 death sentences and other jail terms for those charged with \"violent attacking.\" Following the unrest in Xinjiang, 26 death sentences and other jail terms were handed out by the courts for charges of \"violent attacking.\" China expanded security forces presence, including police, paramilitary, and military forces, to address the violence. Despite China's attempts to deflect criticism, foreign groups did not claim responsibility for the unrest. China faced foreign criticism, especially from Muslim countries like Turkey and organizations like the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC). The Muslim Brotherhood called for unity among fellow Muslims in response to the Uighur situation. The Hizb ut-Tahrir and Al Qaeda issued statements criticizing China's treatment of Muslims in Xinjiang. The OIC's Secretary-General visited Xinjiang in 2010, and Al Qaeda in Algeria threatened China's interests in Africa. Before the July 5 incident in Urumqi, TIP's leader Abdul Haq criticized the PRC for events in Guangdong and Urumqi, calling for Uighurs to engage in jihad. Al Qaeda issued a message focused on \"East Turkistan,\" calling for education about a \"massacre\" against Muslims and use of weapons against \"invaders.\" TIP claimed credit for actions in revenge against China's \"bloody massacre\" on July 5, 2009, and called on Muslims in Xinjiang to carry out jihad. In March 2010, TIP denied links to Uighur organizations accused of violence in Xinjiang and distanced itself from democratic groups. The PRC influenced Cambodia to deport Uighurs to China in 2009. In June 2010, the PRC announced uncovering a terrorist cell planning attacks in 2008 and 2009. In July 2010, Norway arrested three men suspected of planning a terrorist plot orchestrated by Al Qaeda's network in the United States and United Kingdom. One of the suspects was a 39-year-old Norwegian citizen of Uighur origin named Mikael Davud, along with citizens of Uzbekistan and Iraq. The plot was organized by Salah al-Somali, a member of Al Qaeda who was killed by a U.S. drone in 2009. Al-Somali, a Qaeda leader in Pakistan, allegedly organized three separate groups in Norway, the United States, and the United Kingdom to plot attacks in 2009. The groups were compartmentalized and unaware of each other's plans to bomb subways in New York and a shopping mall in Manchester. One suspect in the plots had Uighur origin and had contacts with Al Qaeda in Waziristan. The multinational network and direction from Pakistan showed the influence of Al Qaeda over TIP. Uighur and Uzbekistan radicals have had contacts through TIP and IMU for years. In July 2010, two Uighurs were sentenced to 10 years in jail in Dubai for planning to explode a bomb in a shopping center. After the U.S. military launched a war against Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, at least 18 Uighurs were captured in Pakistan and handed over to Guantanamo Bay military prison. The U.S. military detained Uighurs at Guantanamo Bay in 2002. The PRC claimed them as citizens and interrogated them as \"suspected terrorists.\" Amnesty International alleged that the Uighurs were subjected to stress treatments and that the U.S. handed over personal files to PRC officials. Amnesty urged the U.S. not to turn the detainees over in July 2004. In 2004, Amnesty International urged the United States not to turn the 22 detained Uighurs over to China, where they would face torture and execution in China's campaign to repress the Uighur people in the name of \"counterterrorism.\" Options included sending them to a third country or resettling them in the United States. The Departments of Defense and State sought a third country to accept them, rather than send them to China. By late 2003, the Defense Department determined that 15 Uighurs at Guantanamo could be released. In 2004, U.S. officials struggled to find a country to accept Uighurs detained at Guantanamo Bay, ruling out China and the U.S. as options. Over 100 countries were approached, with the possibility of sending them back to China considered. Defense Department released a list of detainees in 2006. The Pentagon transferred five Uighurs from Guantanamo Bay to Albania in 2006, despite China's demand for their extradition. The Uighurs faced uncertainty about resettlement, but one was granted asylum in Sweden in 2009. The executive branch grappled with the issue of releasing detainees by mid-2008. The executive branch was dealing with the release of Uighur detainees at Guantanamo Bay, with defense lawyers complaining about their isolation and mistreatment. U.S. military interrogators collaborated with Chinese government agents to interrogate the Uighurs, using tactics like the \"frequent flyer program\" to deprive them of sleep. The Uighur detainees at Guantanamo were awarded access for interrogation by PRC officials in 2002. Representatives Delahunt and Rohrabacher requested their prompt transfer and parole into the US, noting it wouldn't automatically grant asylum. Under Secretary Edelman responded, stating some Uighurs received terrorist training but efforts were made to have other countries accept them. The Uighur detainees at Guantanamo were captured during hostilities and some received terrorist training from ETIM, a group linked to Al Qaeda. The U.S. has no plans to release them into the country but is seeking other nations to accept them. Only Albania has agreed so far. Only Albania has agreed to accept Uighur detainees from Guantanamo, while Senator Lindsey Graham argued against their release in the United States, stating it would set a dangerous precedent. Representative Delahunt urged for Uighurs to resettle in the US and expressed concern over PRC intelligence agents interrogating them at Guantanamo. Defense Secretary Robert Gates signed a memorandum on the Defense Department's compliance with President Obama's Executive Order. The Defense Department's review on compliance with President Obama's Executive Order regarding Guantanamo detainees, led by Adm. Patrick Walsh, highlighted the tension and anxiety among Uighur detainees. Efforts to transfer 17 Chinese Uighur detainees to a third country have been ongoing due to U.S. obligations and recent court rulings. Recent court rulings have increased pressure to move detainees out of Guantanamo, especially the Chinese Uighurs and two additional detainees. They are currently housed in Camp Iguana, where they express frustration with their continued detention. The Review Team requests immediate assistance in transferring these detainees to a suitable third country. Defense Secretary Robert Gates confirmed to Congress that the Administration has considered taking in some of the 17 Uighur detainees due to concerns about persecution in China. Senator Mitch McConnell raised questions about the safety of releasing terrorist-trained detainees in the United States. Representative Frank Wolf expressed concern about releasing Uighur detainees to the US, citing potential security threats. He requested declassification of intelligence before any decision. Representative John Boehner introduced a bill to oppose transfers of Guantanamo detainees to the US. The approval process for transferring detainees outside the United States involves various steps, including approval from the recipient state's governor and legislature, presidential certification to Congress, and restrictions on transferring detainees to the US. The Senate Appropriations Committee allocated $50 million for relocation of detainees, with a ban on transferring them to the US. The PRC Foreign Ministry labeled Uighur detainees at Guantanamo as \"East\" without custody or legal proceedings. In June 2009, Guantanamo labeled Uighurs as \"terrorist suspects,\" with Palau and Bermuda accepting some detainees. Palau later interviewed Uighurs worried about China and accepted six in November. Switzerland accepted two Uighurs on humanitarian grounds in February 2010. In June 2009, five Uighurs remained in detention at Guantanamo after fleeing bombings in Afghanistan. Concerns were raised in Congress about security risks if Uighurs were transferred to Palau and potentially traveled to Guam. Representatives urged Attorney General Holder to oppose China's demand to take the Uighur detainees. Hearings were held on the Uighurs at Guantanamo in June and July 2009. On June 26, 2009, the House Intelligence Committee reported H.R. 2701 (Reyes), the Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2010, with Section 351 requiring an unclassified summary of intelligence on threats posed by Uighurs detained at Guantanamo. The House passed H.R. 2701 on February 26, 2010. Representative Alcee Hastings introduced H.Res. 774 on September 24 to thank Bermuda for accepting four Uighurs. In legal developments, the Supreme Court granted habeas corpus rights to Guantanamo detainees on June 12, 2008, and the U.S. Court of Appeals invalidated the \"enemy combatant\" status of Huzaifa Parhat on June 20, 2008. The U.S. Court of Appeals ordered the release of Parhat, an ethnic Uighur who is not affiliated with al Qaida or the Taliban. The Tribunal's determination that he is an enemy combatant was based on his affiliation with a Uighur independence group associated with al Qaida and the Taliban, relying on classified documents. The Justice Department conceded that all remaining Uighur detainees were no longer enemy combatants, with their status to be put in the same category as the original petitioners. Uighurs' counsels submitted a memorandum stating that this concession resolved any questions about their non-combatant status. The Justice Department conceded that all remaining Uighur detainees were no longer enemy combatants, with their status to be put in the same category as the original petitioners. Judge Ricardo Urbina ordered the release of the Uighurs into the United States, stating that their continued detention without cause was unlawful. The Uighur detainees were ordered to be released into the United States, with assistance from various communities. The release order was temporarily blocked by the U.S. Court of Appeals due to concerns about their military training, undermining State Department efforts to find a country to accept them. The Uighur detainees, ordered for release into the United States, faced a setback as the Court of Appeals granted a stay on the release order. Judge Judith Rogers highlighted that firearms training alone does not indicate danger. The Uighurs expressed support for the U.S. but also frustration over their prolonged detention. They were moved to Camp Iguana after a change in their status. The Justice Department reported their housing conditions as \"relatively unrestrictive.\" The Uighur detainees, initially ordered for release into the United States, faced a setback as the Court of Appeals granted a stay on the release order. The Justice Department reported that they were housed in relatively unrestrictive conditions at Camp Iguana, with access to amenities like TV, showers, and reading materials. The U.S. Court of Appeals later reversed the release order, citing insufficient evidence presented by the government. In the Parhat case, the court ruled that the Uighurs could not be held as enemy combatants due to lack of evidence linking them to terrorist groups. The government decided not to detain any of the petitioners as enemy combatants, but releasing them to China poses a risk of mistreatment. Efforts are ongoing to find a third country for resettlement. Efforts to find a third country for resettlement of the Uighurs continue. Petitioners are currently held at Guantanamo under minimal restrictions. Judges ruled against releasing them into the US, stating the courts cannot review the executive branch's decision. The Uighurs appealed to the Supreme Court in 2009. The Uighurs appealed to the Supreme Court in 2009 regarding their resettlement. The Supreme Court dismissed the case in 2010 due to offers of resettlement in another country. Concerns were raised about China's security measures during the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the implications for future international events in China. The PRC government intensified intelligence gathering on foreigners suspected of protesting its policies, including targeting NGOs. The State Department issued a travel alert for U.S. citizens attending the 2008 Olympic Games in China due to terrorist threats. There were concerns about PRC compromising electronic equipment brought by Americans to the Games. Senator Sam Brownback introduced S.Res. 633 on China's pre-Olympic clampdown, expressing concerns about the deterioration of privacy and human rights. Some questioned the U.S. stance on China's security crackdown before major events, including President Bush's attendance at the Olympic Games. U.S. policymakers were aware of China's history of rounding up dissidents and protestors during international events. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice acknowledged reports of crackdowns by China's security forces on religious figures before President Bush's visit. The U.S. planned to raise concerns about human rights and religious freedom with the Chinese government. As preparations for the Beijing Olympics intensified, there were debates on cooperating with China's military given concerns about internal repression. The US considered providing security assistance for the Beijing Olympics in 2008 due to concerns about \"ethnic separatism, religious extremism, and violent terrorism.\" However, China ultimately did not accept assistance from the Defense Department for Olympic security, and there was uncertainty surrounding the PRC's claims of terrorist threats. The US planned to raise concerns about human rights and religious freedom with the Chinese government before President Bush's visit. The PRC regime in China selectively targets violent incidents involving Uighurs and Tibetans as \"terrorism\" but not attacks by Hans. After a Tibetan riot in 2008, the Tibetan Youth Congress was labeled \"terrorist.\" In 2007, the PRC claimed to have destroyed a \"terrorist training camp\" in Xinjiang. The question remains whether China truly faces a serious terrorism threat in Xinjiang. The FBI was assessing the terrorist threat in Xinjiang in 2007. The State Department reported no international terrorism acts in China from 2002 to 2007. The National Counterterrorism Center did not report any attacks in China in 2007. In 2008, the PRC claimed to have raided a house in Xinjiang, labeling Uighur separatists as terrorists despite finding only common items like axes and books. In Xinjiang, the police found axes, books, and knives, common in Uighur culture. The Uyghur American Association called for an independent investigation and defended Uighur people's peaceful efforts. In March 2008, the PRC claimed a Uighur woman tried to blow up a plane. Riots in Tibet led to protests in Xinjiang, with police returning the body of a Uighur man who died in custody. In April 2008, Urumqi and flights to Beijing were calm with increased security measures. The Olympic torch relay in Xinjiang had no major incidents, but there were crackdowns leading to an attack on a police station. Security checks were tightened in Xinjiang to protect the Olympics, leading to complaints of racial profiling and passport confiscations among Uighurs. Before the Olympic Games, protests and police car burnings occurred in Han areas of China. In June and July 2008, there were violent incidents in China, including protests in Guizhou province and an attack on a police station in Shanghai. The attacker sought revenge for police interrogation in 2007. In Xinjiang, the police killed criminals in a \"holy war\" training group, while Uighurs were forced to watch mass sentencing and executions. In July 2008, Urumqi and Kashgar officials in Xinjiang cracked down on \"terrorist groups\" and detained suspects. The PRC regime downplayed terrorist threats targeting the Olympic Games, including a video posted on YouTube by the Turkistan Islamic Party. Only a PRC official media report mentioned an \"East Turkistan\" threat online. The Vice Minister of Public Security mentioned an \"East Turkistan\" threat online. Uighur leader Rebiya Kadeer supported peaceful Olympic Games in Beijing. A TIP leader posted videos on YouTube claiming credit for incidents in China. The PRC government denied the TIP leader's claims and warned Muslims against attending the Olympic Games in Beijing. The incidents outside Xinjiang were not labeled as \"terrorist\" acts by the PRC. The PRC did not label incidents outside Xinjiang as \"terrorist\" acts. There were explosions in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Wenzhou, Hunan, Kunming, and Kashgar before the Olympics in Beijing. The PRC Public Security Ministry called the Kunming incident \"sabotage,\" not terrorism. Two men in Kashgar drove a truck into PAP Border Security Guards, killing 16. The incident was reported as \"suspected terrorism\" with alleged ties to \"East Turkistan\" terrorists. Two Uighur men were arrested with homemade bombs, a handgun, and knives, claiming to be waging a \"holy war.\" The director of Xinjiang's Public Security Department stated there was no proof of ETIM involvement. The incident involved PAP guards detaining and beating individuals in a hotel, leading to Japan's diplomatic protest. Foreign witnesses reported that the attackers wore PAP uniforms. In 2008, China experienced a high-fatality attack in Kashgar, Xinjiang, with no group claiming responsibility, although ETIM was widely suspected. On August 10, 2008, in Kuqa, Xinjiang, 15 assailants threw homemade bombs targeting government offices. On August 10, 2008, in Xinjiang, attackers threw homemade bombs at government offices, killing one security guard and one Uighur bystander. The police detained Japanese reporters to prevent foreign news coverage. Two days later, three guards were stabbed to death at a security checkpoint near Kashgar. The authorities blamed \"East Turkistan\" forces for the attacks. In the 1990s, alleged attacks involved bombs being thrown on August 10. PRC officials labeled two attackers who died as \"terrorists\" and \"suicide bombers.\" The attacks in Xinjiang in August 2008 killed 21 people, primarily security forces. A bombing incident on a bus in Guangzhou during the 2008 Olympic Games was reported late by PRC media. A man from Guangxi was sentenced to six years for planting a bomb on a bus. In 2008, a man from Guangxi allegedly planted a bomb on a bus, which exploded a hole with no injuries. The incident did not involve a Uighur and was not labeled as \"terrorism\" by the PRC. The Taliban's resurgence in Pakistan and Afghanistan since mid-2006 may have radicalized some disaffected Uighurs in the border area. Pakistani militants crossing into China have raised concerns in Beijing since 1997. During the 2008 Olympic Games, the PRC arrested 35 Pakistanis accused of planning an attack. During the Olympic Games, the PRC arrested 35 Pakistanis accused of planning an attack. In the spring of 2009, the PRC government asserted to Pakistan's President that ETIM was planning to attack China on the 60th anniversary celebration of the communist revolution. Pakistan reportedly extradited nine alleged militants from Xinjiang to China. PRC officials may have precipitated unrest in Xinjiang ahead of the 2008 Olympics for a pre-Olympic crackdown. The PRC tightened security before the 2008 Olympics to prevent any disruptions, including potential preemptive strikes in Xinjiang. Despite concerns about maintaining control, the Games in Beijing proceeded without violence. The PRC deployed extensive security forces, showing a tendency to overreact to any disturbances, even peaceful protests. The PRC deployed 110,000 security forces, including the military, to tighten control during the 2008 Olympics. They initially showed restraint but later violently beat up and detained foreign reporters and journalists covering protests. The Ministry of Public Security issued a list of alleged terrorists seeking to capture Uighurs wanted for plotting. In December 2003, the Ministry of Public Security sought to capture Uighurs wanted for plotting \"terrorist attacks\" against the Olympic Games. A video from TIP defended the Uighurs' \"jihad\" against Chinese Communist invaders. In February 2009, PRC authorities demolished the Uighurs' old town in Kashgar and relocated families to new buildings. Two Uighur men were executed for an alleged attack in August 2008. In September 2009, PRC authorities intensified assimilation policies by closing schools in townships and villages to merge students into larger county-level schools. Uighur students were forced to learn Mandarin at a younger age instead of their Uighur language. Critics argued that this imposed superiority and exacerbates resentment among Uighurs. Outside Xinjiang, violent incidents in China were not labeled as \"terrorism\" or \"suicide bombings\" by PRC authorities. From January 2006 to July 2009, PRC authorities conducted a nationwide campaign against organized crime, resulting in thousands of convictions and detentions. Incidents such as fires and explosions in buses were reported, with one incident in Chengdu resulting in 28 deaths. The media reported an unemployed man as the perpetrator, not a terrorist or suicide bomber. In another city, Chongqing, a bus caught fire or exploded, injuring seven riders. Congressional oversight included sanctions on arms sales. The President has the options of maintaining, waiving, or selectively waiving sanctions on arms sales and crime control equipment to China. President Bush issued waivers for specific exports in 2002 and considered more waivers for the Olympic Games in Beijing in 2008. In 2005, China showcased counterterrorism equipment from over 200 foreign companies. Concerns were raised about exporting high-tech surveillance equipment to China for potential misuse in monitoring political activists and minority groups. The Bush Administration approved exports of sensitive equipment to Chinese security and military forces, including tools for detecting explosives and radiation. The Bush Administration approved exports of sensitive equipment to Chinese security and military forces, including tools for detecting explosives and radiation. President Bush waived sanctions temporarily to allow firearms and high-tech camera systems for the Olympic Games. Another law could impact U.S. policy on military transfers to China. There are concerns about suspected PRC-directed intimidation or harassment in the United States, including incidents involving Uighur leader Rebiya Kadeer. PRC diplomats reportedly use informants in Uighur communities in various countries. In 2010, the PRC withdrew films in retaliation for a film festival in Palm Springs refusing to cancel a movie about Tibet. Defense Secretary Robert Gates objected to any efforts to intimidate U.S. corporations engaged in legitimate economic activities. President Bush voiced U.S. objection to intimidation of U.S. corporations in the South China Sea. He emphasized terrorism and weapons proliferation threats in his 2002 State of the Union speech. The Administration imposed sanctions on PRC entities for weapons proliferation but highlighted China's cooperation in talks on North Korea's nuclear weapons and sanctions against Iran. China has not joined the Proliferation Security Initiative announced by President Bush in 2003. The 9/11 Commission urged the United States to encourage China to join the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI). The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 called for China's participation in PSI. The bill became law in August 2007, and the Bush Administration also sought China's cooperation in the Container Security Initiative (CSI). China agreed to join the Container Security Initiative (CSI) at PRC ports (Shanghai and Shenzhen) for U.S. screening of manifests and inspections of containers. The CSI program in Shanghai became operational in April 2005 and underwent its first review by late summer. In November 2005, the U.S. and China signed an agreement to install equipment at China's ports to detect nuclear and radioactive material. The Pentagon has cautiously resumed a military-to-military relationship with China, including Defense Consultative Talks and high-level visits. Relevant legislation for congressional oversight includes the Foreign. There is a debate about the extent of U.S. military cooperation with China, with some cautioning against it due to concerns about China's practices in counterterrorism and technology sharing with rogue regimes. Senator Bob Smith and Representative Dana Rohrabacher expressed concerns about renewed military contacts with China in 2001. China has increased its influence in international counterterrorism cooperation through a Central Asian group, sponsoring meetings with Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan to sign agreements on military confidence building measures and banning activities that undermine sovereignty. By 2000, PLA General Chi Haotian and PRC ruler Jiang Zemin attended defense ministers' meetings and summits in Tajikistan. China's influence in international counterterrorism cooperation increased through the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), targeting religious extremism, national separatism, and international terrorism. The PLA provided military assistance to Central Asian countries and conducted joint military exercises to combat terrorism. The SCO's expansion and U.S. concerns were raised during summits in 2005 and 2006. The SCO summits in 2005 and 2006 raised U.S. concerns about the organization's counterterrorism efforts. The summit in 2005 included India, Pakistan, and Iran as observers. The declaration from the summit called for a deadline for the temporary use of military facilities in SCO countries. The U.S. had military presence in Uzbekistan until 2005 and maintained an airbase in Kyrgyzstan, which raised suspicions from China about U.S. military deployments in Central Asia. Hu Jintao of China argued that Central Asian countries could handle their own affairs, while General Richard Myers accused China and Russia of trying to bully Central Asian countries. The House passed an amendment expressing concern about the SCO's military deployments in Central Asia, calling for dialogue with SCO countries. China and Russia were accused of bullying Central Asian countries, while the PRC hosted a summit with Iran as an observer in a counterterrorism group. The State Department criticized Iran's inclusion as an observer in a counterterrorism group, calling it counterproductive. Ahead of the SCO summit in Bishkek in 2007, China urged the U.S. military to withdraw from the base in Kyrgyzstan. PLA and Russian forces conducted a joint counterterrorism exercise in 2007. Iran applied for SCO membership in 2008, raising concerns for the U.S. military and NATO about alternative supply routes. The U.S. military and NATO were exploring alternative logistical supply routes for the war in Afghanistan due to instability in Pakistan. China was approached for cooperation after Kyrgyzstan threatened to close Manas Air Base in 2009. However, no progress was made, and the option became less urgent when Kyrgyzstan backed off. In July 2009, Obama and Medvedev agreed to allow lethal supplies to transit through Russia. In July 2009, violent ethnic clashes occurred between Uighur and Han people in Xinjiang, China, near Afghanistan's Wakhan Corridor. Tensions remained high for months due to China's repression of Uighurs. China's armed forces in Xinjiang include the PLA, PAP, and PCC. In July 2009, violent ethnic clashes occurred in Xinjiang, China involving Uighur and Han people. China's armed forces in Xinjiang include the PLA, PAP, and PCC. The PCC alone reportedly totaled 2.5 million personnel in May 2010. During the \"Peace Mission 2009\" military exercise, PLA Chief Chen Bingde mentioned deploying troops under U.N. authority to fight \"East Turkistan elements\" outside of China. An exercise in the PLA's Shenyang Military Region involved forces from China and Russia deploying to a third nation for an \"anti-terrorism\" operation. Russia, under U.N. authority, deploying to a third nation in an \"anti-terrorism\" operation to fight \"separatist\" forces. China's official newspaper called for control of Afghanistan's Wakhan Corridor. PLA forces may combat \"East Turkistan\" organizations. The Obama Administration proposed China's contribution to stabilize Afghanistan. China pledged $1 million in aid at a conference in Tokyo. China has provided reconstruction aid to Afghanistan, including $150 million promised by Jiang Zemin to Hamid Karzai. This aid included cancelling debts, grants totaling $132 million, and converting loans into grants. China also initiated projects like building a hospital and training Afghan officials. Additionally, Chinese workers were sent to assist in building roads and schools in Afghanistan. China's investment in Afghanistan's Aynak copper mine, worth $3-4 billion, led to allegations of corruption with a reported $808 million signing bonus and $30 million bribe. This raised concerns about Chinese contributions and corruption in Kabul, contradicting US goals for better governance. The US also pressed for increased Chinese coordination in promoting stability and development in Afghanistan and Pakistan. PRC coordination with the US to promote stability and development in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Blake sought greater transparency from China on aid and coordination efforts to defeat Al Qaeda. US welcomed Chinese investments in Afghanistan if they were transparent and met international standards. No discussion on military assistance from China, but assurances that US forces would not withdraw hastily. General Tommy Franks and Admiral Dennis Blair confirmed in 2002 that there was no military cooperation with the People's Liberation Army. China did not provide military cooperation in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, and did not pledge troops when the US deployed additional troops in 2009. However, the PLA started providing military training to the Afghan National Army in 2009. The US has discussed parallel pressure on Pakistan with China. China has close military and intelligence ties with Pakistan. Pressure on Pakistan to counter terrorists increased after the 2008 Mumbai attack. The CIA facilitated intelligence-sharing between India and Pakistan. Pakistan's President briefed China on improving relations with India. The US looked to China for help in Pakistan, including humanitarian aid and governance. In May 2010, the PRC Defense Minister visited Pakistan and signed agreements for military exercises, trainer aircraft, and aid. The two militaries conducted joint exercises focused on fighting terrorists. Pakistan sought more economic investments from China, but concerns arose over job opportunities for locals and security for Chinese citizens. The PLA could potentially deploy forces to Pakistan in the future. By 2010, there were increased concerns about cyber threats from China stealing sensitive information on U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan. India also worried about China's growing influence in Central and South Asia, which could impact reconciliation between India and Pakistan. Pakistan redeployed troops to fight the Taliban near the Afghan border, but strategic concerns about India remained paramount. US also raised concerns about China-origin weapons found in the region. Since 2006, U.S. concern has increased about China-origin weapons found in conflicts in the Middle East and Afghanistan involving U.S. and allied forces, as part of the broader threat posed by Iran and its arms transfers to terrorist forces. Hezbollah used C-802 anti-ship cruise missiles to attack an Israeli naval ship, killing four crewmembers. Iran allegedly armed Hezbollah with C-802 missiles acquired from China in the 1990s. PRC-made weapons found in Afghanistan include small arms, ammunition, and man-portable anti-aircraft missiles. The Taliban in Afghanistan have used various Chinese-origin weapons, including man-portable anti-aircraft missiles, armor-piercing ammunition, rocket propelled grenades, and sniper rifles. In some cases, the origin of the arms is difficult to trace due to intentional removal of serial numbers. Iran has also manufactured a similar anti-aircraft missile to those made by China. The China Precision Machinery Import and Export Corporation (CPMIEC) exported HN-5 anti-aircraft missiles to Afghanistan, Iran, and other countries. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld mentioned in 2002 that Afghanistan was filled with weapons from various countries, including China, but many were old and unstable. In September 2007, Afghan officials discovered arms from China, Iran, and Russia in Herat. The Bush Administration focused on Iran's role in transferring weapons to the Taliban in Afghanistan. The Bush Administration focused on Iran's role in transferring arms to the Taliban in Afghanistan. Richard Lawless, former Deputy Under Secretary of Defense, emphasized the need to identify how the weapons are being transported through Iran. The US also expressed concerns to China about their arms sales to Iran. The United States and the United Kingdom expressed concerns to China about its arms sales to Iran, urging Beijing to stop transfers of weapons and technologies. China's response was deemed \"irresponsible,\" with the US requesting China to refrain from signing new arms sales contracts with Iran. Despite these concerns, China did not deny its arms sales to Iran and continued with a sense of \"business as usual.\" The PRC Foreign Ministry defended China's arms sales in Afghanistan and Iraq as \"normal\" military trade, stating that they adhere to principles of legitimate self-defense, non-interference in internal affairs, and compliance with international laws and UNSC resolutions. China also requires permission for re-transfer to a third party. China's objection to UNSC sanctions on Iran's arms imports led to diplomatic negotiations. Despite objections from China and Russia, Resolution 1747 was passed, banning Iran's arms exports. Questions arose about China's government involvement in allowing arms flow to Iran, with state-owned defense-industrial plants implicated rather than the PLA. The PRC government's knowledge of arms sales to Iran and weapons found in Afghanistan and Iraq was questioned by the U.S., leading to demarches with Beijing. Concerns were raised about China's destabilizing arms sales in the Middle East and missile sales to Iran posing a threat to U.S. forces. Despite U.S. demands to stop transfers violating sanctions, nonproliferation norms, and PRC law, China's cooperation was deemed uneven, particularly regarding sales of conventional weapons to Iran, a country supporting terrorism. In March 2009, the Secretary of Defense reported to Congress about China's weapons supplied to Iran being transferred to terrorist groups in Iraq and Afghanistan. In July 2009, the UAE seized a cargo ship bound for Iran with weapons from North Korea suspected for Hezbollah, Hamas, or Quds Force. The weapons were hidden in containers and included parts for rockets used by Hamas and Hezbollah. In October 2009, a U.S. destroyer followed an Iranian ship from Dalian to Iran's port of Bandar Abbas."
