    "content": "The Act titled \"Specialty Crop Mechanization Prize Challenge of 2018\" addresses challenges related to specialty crop mechanization. The \"Specialty Crop Mechanization Challenges\" program, established by the Secretary of Agriculture, involves prize competitions for mechanizing specialty crop production. Prize committees are formed to define competition scopes and requirements, with representation from the specialty crop industry. The prize committee for each specialty crop mechanization competition determines the incentive, which may include a cash prize or access to Government facilities. Other entities like State and local governments and higher education institutions may also be involved as determined appropriate by the Secretary. The prize committee for each specialty crop mechanization competition establishes judging criteria that consider the potential for solutions to become commercial products, their likelihood to lead to further research or manufacturing in the US, their impact on agricultural workforce efficiency, and their ability to alleviate stresses on the workforce. The committee will consider solutions to alleviate burdens on agricultural producers and reduce losses of fresh produce. Prize competitions will focus on automating or alleviating stresses in planting. The committee will focus on solutions to automate or alleviate stresses in planting, crop management, harvesting, and packaging of specialty crops to reduce burdens on agricultural producers and minimize losses of fresh produce. The Secretary can accept funds from various sources to award prizes for distribution. Eligibility for awards requires at least one group member to be a US citizen or permanent resident. The completion of prize competitions is also outlined. The completion of prize competitions under this section must be done within 5 years of the program's establishment. The Comptroller General must submit a report to Congress on the program's impact and effectiveness. The term \"specialty crop\" is defined in accordance with the Specialty Crops Competitiveness Act of 2004. $10,000,000 is authorized for carrying out this Act."
