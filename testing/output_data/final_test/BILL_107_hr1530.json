    "content": "The \"Prescription Drug Competition Act of 2001\" aims to address the increasing costs of prescription drugs by promoting competition between generic and brand-name manufacturers. Congress recognizes the concerns of senior citizens and American families regarding rising drug costs and the potential anti-competitive practices in the pharmaceutical industry. The Prescription Drug Competition Act of 2001 aims to provide timely notice to the FDA and FTC regarding agreements between patent-holding companies and generic drug manufacturers to ensure availability of safe generic drugs, enhance antitrust law enforcement, and deter anticompetitive actions. The Act defines key terms such as \"agreement,\" \"antitrust laws,\" \"ANDA,\" and \"brand name drug company\" in relation to the Prescription Drug Competition Act of 2001. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act defines terms such as Commission (referring to the Federal Trade Commission), FDA (referring to the United States Food and Drug Administration), generic drug, generic drug applicant, and Secretary (referring to the Secretary of Health and Human Services). SEC. 5. NOTIFICATION OF AGREEMENTS AFFECTING GENERIC DRUG SALES. A brand name drug company and a generic drug applicant must file the details of any agreement that could limit the production or sale of a generic drug equivalent to a brand name drug. This includes the purpose, scope, and potential impact on the availability of the generic drug. Any notice, agreement, or material required to be filed under section 5 must be submitted to the Commission and the Secretary within 10 business days of execution. Enforcement procedures are outlined in section 7. SEC. 7 of the Act outlines enforcement measures, including a civil fine of up to $20,000 per day for non-compliance. The United States district court can order compliance and grant equitable relief for failure to comply with notification requirements under section 5. SEC. 8 addresses rulemaking procedures. SEC. 8 of the Act empowers the Commission to make rules in consultation with relevant authorities to ensure compliance with antitrust laws and define terms. It may also exempt certain agreements from the Act's requirements and establish additional rules as needed. SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATES. This Act will take effect 90 days after enactment."
