    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Brownfields Redevelopment Enhancement Act\" and its purpose is outlined in Section 2 as findings and purposes. The \"Brownfields Redevelopment Enhancement Act\" finds that returning brownfield sites to use can create jobs, generate tax revenues, protect natural resources, and address funding obstacles. The Department of Housing and Urban Development plays a key role in supporting community development and land use in urban areas through grants. The Department of Housing and Urban Development initiative provides funding for brownfields redevelopment activities, requiring communities to pledge community development block grant funds as collateral for a loan guarantee. Delinking grants from loan guarantees removes a barrier for many local communities. The Act aims to provide cities and towns with more flexibility and accessibility to funds for brownfields redevelopment by offering incentives and separating grants from community development block grant funds.
