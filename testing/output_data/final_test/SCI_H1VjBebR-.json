    "content": "The feasibility of learning a mapping between two domains with unmatched samples is discussed. The lack of paired samples and undefined semantic information make the problem seem ill-posed. Despite the ambiguity of multiple possible mappings, recent empirical success has been achieved in solving this problem. A theoretical framework is developed to align two domains in a semantic way with minimal complexity. The complexity of compositions of functions is measured to show the uniqueness of minimal complexity mapping. The depth of neural networks is directly related to the measured complexity, suggesting that a semantically aligned mapping can be achieved by learning with architectures not much bigger than the minimal architecture. Various predictions are made based on the hypothesis that semantic alignment can be captured by the minimal mapping. A new mapping algorithm is proposed and shown to lead to better results. Recent reports demonstrate the ability to map between two domains with unlabeled examples using methods like CycleGAN. Constraints are employed to ensure the output is indistinguishable from the samples of the new domain. The mapping of horse images to the zebra domain aims to create images that are indistinguishable from zebras, and vice versa. Constraints ensure that each sample can be transformed back and forth between domains without losing similarity to the original input. In another example, a function is learned to map a handbag to a similar style shoe. If every pattern in one domain is mapped to a different pattern in the other, distribution and circularity constraints may be satisfied. The distribution and circularity constraints may hold when mapping patterns between domains, creating striped and checkerboard objects. The alignment is based on fitting the shapes of the distributions, with the target mapping approximated by the lowest-complexity mapping with low discrepancy. The text discusses the process of mapping patterns between domains, aiming for a low complexity mapping with minimal discrepancy. It explores the ambiguity of cross-domain mapping, presents hypotheses and predictions, and introduces an unsupervised mapping algorithm. The number of minimal complexity mappings is expected to be small, and various predictions are verified. The learning algorithm uses two unlabeled datasets to tie the distributions together. The text discusses mapping patterns between domains using a generative view aligned with GAN-based image generation. It introduces invertible functions yA and yB to tie distributions DZ, DA, and DB together. The assumption of invertibility is supported by recent pre-image computation methods. In unsupervised learning, a stochastic component can be added to map between domains A and B when the target function is not invertible. This stochastic variable helps in selecting the analogous item from one domain to another. The goal is to fit a function that is closest to the mapping function yAB. The learner aims to fit a function h \u2208 H closest to yAB, where R D [f1, f2] = Ex\u223cD(f1(x), f2(x)), for a loss function and distribution D. Fitting may be possible with a mapping that transforms input samples in XA to the next in order to yAB(x). The alignment problem arises when trying to learn h that satisfies h = yAB \u2022 \u03a0, where \u03a0 permutes samples in XA. Recent contributions employ circularity to recover yAB. Circularity is employed to recover both yAB and yBA = yA \u2022 y simultaneously by learning functions h and h jointly. This is done by minimizing the risk using a GAN to ensure that samples generated from mapping domain A to domain B follow the distribution of samples in domain B. The circularity constraints ensure that mapping a sample from one domain to the second and back results in the original sample. Circularity constraints ensure that mapping a sample from one domain to the second and back results in the original sample. There are infinitely many mappings that preserve the uniform distribution on the two segments, but only two are considered \"semantic\" and can be captured by a neural network with two hidden neurons and Leaky ReLU activations. This is illustrated through a simple toy example in FIG2. In a simple toy example, a neural network with one hidden layer of size 2 and Leaky ReLU activations is used to learn a mapping from domain A to B. The hypothesis space of the network is restricted to eliminate alternative solutions, resulting in only two admissible options for the mapping. The hypothesis space of a neural network is restricted to simplify the mapping process, resulting in only two admissible options for the mapping. The network focuses on functions involving linear transformations and a non-linear activation function like Leaky ReLU. The complexity of a function is defined as the minimal number of layers in a neural network that implements it. This measure is intuitive and provides a clear stratification of functions, with capacity controlled by norm regularization. The architecture is bounded to a certain number of layers, using layers as a proxy for the Kolmogorov complexity of functions. Norm capacity is not effective for comparing functions of different architectures. L1 and L2 norms of desired mapping fall within range of norms obtained with bigger or smaller architectures. VC-dimension and Rademacher complexity are not suitable for measuring individual function complexity. Simplicity hypothesis leads to predictions verified in Sec. 5, stating semantically aligned mapping can be learned without matching samples or circularity with a small enough network in an unsupervised way. Prediction 2: When learning a mapping between domains in an unsupervised way, the complexity of the network is crucial. The success of recent methods lies in selecting the appropriate architecture, such as DiscoGAN BID13 using eight or ten layers depending on the dataset. A network with too low complexity cannot replicate the target distribution, while a network with too high complexity may be distracted by other alignment solutions. In unsupervised learning, adjusting network complexity is crucial for mapping between domains. Deeper architectures can lead to better outcomes by capturing small discrepancies. A function h with non-minimal complexity is proposed to minimize discrepancies between domain A and domain B. In unsupervised learning, adjusting network complexity is crucial for mapping between domains. A function h with non-minimal complexity is proposed to minimize discrepancies between domain A and domain B by finding a function g with small complexity and discrepancy first, then finding h with larger complexity close to g. This two-step algorithm is implemented to minimize the objective function. In unsupervised learning, adjusting network complexity is crucial for mapping between domains. A function h with non-minimal complexity is proposed to minimize discrepancies between domain A and domain B by finding a function g with small complexity and discrepancy first. The goal is to provide alignment, not the lowest possible discrepancy. Density preserving mapping is defined as a function \u03a0 that switches between domain members with similar probabilities. In unsupervised learning, adjusting network complexity is crucial for mapping between domains. A similarity relation between functions is defined to bound the number of different minimal complexity mappings. Functions of the same complexity have this relation if their activations are similar at each processing step. The number of functions is counted by partitioning the space into subsets where any two functions have the closeness property. This quantity is denoted by N(U, \u223c U) where U is the set and \u223c U is the closeness relation. The number of minimal low-discrepancy mappings is upper bounded by the number of DPMs of a certain size over D A and D B. DPMs are rare in real-world domains due to near-perfect symmetries being uncommon. Replacing specific samples in domain B with other samples of the same probability results in very complex, discontinuous mappings that are necessary for reducing modeling error for discontinuous functions. The number of minimal low-discrepancy mappings is related to the complexity of networks needed to map distributions between domains A and B. The covering number of these mappings is similar to the covering number of DPMs, suggesting that DPMs of low complexity are rare. The number of minimal low-discrepancy mappings is small if prediction 3 holds. Theorem 1 states that for a Leaky ReLU with parameter a = 1 and identifiability, uniqueness up to invariants in neural networks is an open question. Previous works have shown identifiability for specific network architectures and activation functions. The experiments test predictions and compare algorithm success with DiscoGAN. CycleGAN and U-net architectures are also discussed. The experiments with DiscoGAN test predictions and compare algorithm success, focusing on GAN-based solutions for image mapping. The architecture deviates from previous models like DualGAN and CycleGAN, emphasizing the use of U-nets and patches. The DiscoGAN architecture uses GAN loss to transform image domains A and B with convolutional layers and Leaky ReLU activation units. Experiments on the CelebA face dataset show successful transformations between male and female, blond and black hair, and eyeglasses and no eyeglasses. The DiscoGAN architecture successfully transforms image domains A and B using GAN loss and convolutional layers. Experiments on the CelebA face dataset show transformations between male and female, blond and black hair, and eyeglasses. Results show that the output image is closely related to the input images. However, mapping handbags to shoes did not yield a meaningful solution, while edges to shoes and vice versa were successful. The selection of the right number of layers is crucial in unsupervised learning, with fewer layers hindering target alignment and superfluous layers leading to obscured transformations. Experimentation with varying numbers of layers and Wasserstein GAN loss is conducted to analyze the impact on results. The experiments on the CelebA gender conversion task show that the number of layers in the DiscoGAN architecture significantly influences the results. Results indicate that 6 or 8 layers yield the best outcomes, with 6 providing better alignment and 8 offering improved discrepancy. Deviating from these optimal values quickly degrades results, with fewer layers failing to produce desired images and additional layers leading to loss of semantic alignment. The selection of the right number of layers is crucial for achieving desired transformations in unsupervised learning. The experiments on the CelebA gender conversion task show that the number of layers in the DiscoGAN architecture significantly influences the results. Results indicate that 6 or 8 layers yield the best outcomes, with 6 providing better alignment and 8 offering improved discrepancy. The selected architecture of size k = 8 presents acceptable images at the price of lower alignment compared to an architecture of size k \u2212 2. The smaller architecture of size k \u2212 2 does not produce images of extremely low discrepancy, and there is no architecture that benefits both low discrepancy and high alignment. The quality of results in DiscoGAN architecture is related to complexity, with norms of weights not indicating a clear architecture. Optimal depth is not consistent in measurements. Few DPMs exist, verified by training a DiscoGAN with added loss. No DPM found in experiments with network complexities from 2 to 12. The network in Alg. 1 aims to find a well-aligned solution with higher complexity than the minimal solution. It goes through two stages, first identifying the minimal complexity k1 that leads to a low discrepancy. Then, it optimizes a second network of complexity k2. The goal is to achieve robustness and unambiguous alignment in the training process. The second network (h) in the algorithm aims to optimize a one-directional mapping with complexity k2, leading to more sophisticated mappings compared to the DiscoGAN method. The new method better captures complex transformations such as texture or style transfer, as seen in the male to female mappings where facial features are more accurately transformed. The second network (h) in the algorithm optimizes a one-directional mapping with complexity k2, producing more sophisticated mappings compared to DiscoGAN. It captures complex transformations like texture or style transfer, seen in mappings from male to female where facial features are accurately transformed. In female to male mappings, g produces a blurred image while h is more coherent for k2 > k1. In blond to black hair mapping, g creates unrealistic black hair, while h separates objects from hair for realistic results. Mapping h with k2 > k1 sharpens general structure in edges to shoes and handbags mappings. Face descriptors are used to check if identity is preserved post-mapping. The VGG face descriptors are compared to check if identity is preserved post-mapping. A linear classifier is trained on VGG face descriptors to distinguish between Male/Female, Eyeglasses/No-eyeglasses, and Blond/Black. The classifier is tested on images before and after mapping to measure accuracy, with higher accuracy indicating better separation. Results are presented for different network complexities, showing the effectiveness of the mapping algorithm. In experiments mapping black to blond hair and blond to black hair, network h with complexity k2=8 shows the best descriptor similarity, separation accuracy, and discrepancy. Higher k2 values improve separation accuracy and discrepancy but slightly reduce descriptor similarity. Similar results are observed for male to female, female to male, and eyeglasses to non-eyeglasses mappings. The distance between networks g and h is minimal for k2=8. Our stratified complexity model, related to structural risk minimization (SRM), utilizes a hierarchy of nested subsets of hypothesis classes based on the number of layers. The algorithm selects the hypothesis from nested classes depending on the training data amount. Higher values of k2 are beneficial with more training samples, but the exact relation is for future work. Alg. 1 can be viewed as a form of distillation, with the first step finding the optimal descriptor similarity. The algorithm in Alg. 1 is a form of distillation, finding minimal complexity for mapping between domains and training generators. It is related to methods proposed by BID11 and analyzed by BID10. This work optimizes network architecture and is somewhat related to learning network structure during training.

Various mappings h obtained by the method are displayed. The complexity measurement assigns a value based on the number of simple functions that make up a complex function in the stratified complexity model. SCM[C] is a hypothesis class of functions specified by a set of functions C, where every function in C is invertible. A SCM partitions functions into complexity classes based on the number of hidden layers in neural networks. The complexity of a function is determined by the minimal number of primitive functions needed to represent it. This work focuses on SCMs representing fully connected neural networks with fixed layers. A NN-SCM is a SCM N = SCM[C] representing fully connected neural networks with fixed layers. It uses a non-linear activation function \u03c3, with a focus on the Leaky ReLU. The complexity of the inverse function in NN-SCM with Leaky ReLU is the same as the original function. The complexity of the inverse function in a NN-SCM with Leaky ReLU remains the same as the original function. For any u \u2208 N, the complexity is preserved. The complexity of the inverse function in a NN-SCM with Leaky ReLU remains the same as the original function for any u \u2208 N. A minimal complexity mapping between domains A and B is defined with minimal complexity among functions h. In the example of a line segment in R M, linear mappings using ReLU based neural networks are considered minimal. Minimal complexity mappings between domains A and B are defined with minimal complexity among functions h. The discrepancy distance is used to measure the distance between h \u2022 D A and D B. Classes of discriminators D of the form D m := {u|C(u) \u2264 m} are focused on in this work. The (m, 0)-minimal complexity between A and B is defined, with the set of (m, 0)-minimal complexity mappings between them. The sequence {C} is monotonically increasing as m tends to infinity. The sequence {C} is monotonically increasing as m tends to infinity. Neural network implementations can have alternative implementations through simple operations like permuting units in hidden layers. Identifying inconsequential transformations is crucial. The invariant set in a NN-SCM is the set of all functions that satisfy specific conditions. The set of invariant functions in a neural network with Leaky ReLU activation is characterized by invertible linear mappings that satisfy specific conditions. This includes permutations of vectors and multiplication by standard basis vectors. The set of invariant functions in a neural network with Leaky ReLU activation is characterized by invertible linear mappings that satisfy specific conditions, including permutations of vectors and multiplication by standard basis vectors. The analysis simplifies by ensuring every function has one invariant representation. The analysis of neural networks with Leaky ReLU activation involves identifying invariant representations for functions, simplifying the process. Identifiability is a key aspect, with previous works proving uniqueness for networks with one hidden layer and classical activation functions. This lemma demonstrates identifiability for Leaky ReLU networks with one hidden layer. The lemma proves identifiability for Leaky ReLU networks with one hidden layer, showing that unique representations exist for these networks. This result extends the line of work on identifiability for activation functions like Leaky ReLU. The Leaky ReLU activation functions show identifiability for networks with a fixed number of neurons per layer. In unsupervised alignment, algorithms aim to learn a well-aligned function between two unmatched datasets. In unsupervised alignment, algorithms aim to learn a well-aligned function between two unmatched datasets by developing machinery to show that low-discrepancy mappings are rare. Density preserving mappings are defined using discrepancy distance, and the number of low-discrepancy and low-complexity mappings is bounded by the number of DPMs. There are infinitely many DPMs, and perturbing weights of a minimal representation results in a new DPM. In unsupervised alignment, algorithms aim to learn a well-aligned function between two unmatched datasets by developing machinery to show that low-discrepancy mappings are rare. A similarity relation between functions is defined to bound the number of different minimal-complexity mappings by the number of DPMs. The relation is reflexive and symmetric but not transitive, leading to various ways to partition the space of functions into subsets based on similarity. The idea of covering numbers is introduced to count the number of functions up to similarity, requiring the minimal number of subsets to cover the entire space. The curr_chunk discusses the concept of covering numbers in relation to low discrepancy mappings and complexity in unsupervised alignment algorithms. It introduces various symbols and functions used in the work, such as equivalence relations, risk functions, discrepancy between distributions, and complexity of functions. The chunk also mentions the invariant set of minimal complexity mappings between datasets A and B. The section discusses lemmas used in the proof of Thm. 1, assumptions in various lemmas, useful inequalities related to discrepancy distance, complexity measures, invariant functions, and properties of inverse functions. Assumptions 1 and 2 are heavily used, while Assumptions 3 and 4 are mild assumptions for convenience. Assumption 1 states identifiability of functions in a specific setting. The section discusses lemmas used in the proof of Thm. 1, assumptions in various lemmas, useful inequalities related to discrepancy distance, complexity measures, invariant functions, and properties of inverse functions. Lemmas 4 and 5 provide insights into classes of functions and distributions. Lemma 6 discusses the lower and upper bounds for functions u and v in the context of SCM[C]. It also addresses minimal decompositions and representations of functions. Lemma 8 proves that Invariant(N) is closed under inverse and composition for linear mappings. It also discusses the properties of Leaky ReLU with a > 0 and identifiability assumptions. Lemma 10 states that for a neural network N with Leaky ReLU activation function, every invertible linear mapping W is a member of C 0. Lemma 11 further shows that C 0 is closed under inverse and composition. Lemma 13 discusses the minimal decomposition of a function and proves it by induction. It also introduces the concept of set embedding. Lemma 13 discusses the minimal decomposition of a function and proves it by induction, introducing the concept of set embedding. In the following text chunk, it is shown that (U, \u2261 U ) is a covering of (U, \u223c U ) and the covering number of (U, \u223c U ) is at most the covering number of (V, \u223c V ). Lemma 16 discusses the equivalence relation (U, \u2261 U ) being a covering of (U, \u223c U ). It proves this by showing that \u2261 1 \u00d7 \u2261 2 is an equivalence relation and covers (U 2 , \u223c 2 U ). Lemma 17 states that for a tuple of a set and a reflexive and symmetric relation, an embedding can be defined. Lemma 18 discusses two tuples of sets and relations, showing that a smaller covering can be found for one tuple if a covering is found for the other. Thm. 1 relies on assumption 3, and Lem. 19 proves this assumption for the case of a continuous risk with bounded weights for discriminators. Lemma 17 introduces an embedding for a set and relation tuple, while Lemma 18 discusses finding smaller coverings for tuples of sets and relations. Thm. 1 relies on assumption 3, proven by Lem. 19 for continuous risk with bounded discriminator weights. If discriminators have bounded weights, then for all m, n, and E, a function disc m,E is defined. This leads to a contradiction, concluding with a minimal decomposition for g. Lemma 17 introduces an embedding for a set and relation tuple, while Lemma 18 discusses finding smaller coverings for tuples of sets and relations. By Lem. 9, with Leaky ReLU parameter a = 1, a contradiction is reached. Let A = (X A , D A ) and B = (X B , D B ) be two domains. The function G(h) = h \u22121 is proven to be an embedding. Lemma 17 introduces an embedding for a set and relation tuple, while Lemma 18 discusses finding smaller coverings for tuples of sets and relations. By Lem. 9, with Leaky ReLU parameter a = 1, a contradiction is reached. Let A = (X A , D A ) and B = (X B , D B ) be two domains. The function G(h) = h \u22121 is proven to be an embedding. Similarly, we conclude that h 1 with \u03c3 as a Leaky ReLU with parameter 0 < a = 1. Assume Assumptions 1, 2, and 3. Let 0 , 1, and 2 be positive constants with specific conditions. We aim to find an embedding mapping in two parts. Part 1 constructs G, while Part 2 shows a specific relationship. Part 2 shows that C(f \u2022\u1e21 \u22121 ) = 2n = 2C 0 A,B and for f \u2208 H 0 (A, B; m), we have \u2264 2 0 + 2. Part 3 demonstrates that G is an embedding by assuming G(f, g) and showing that there is an index i \u2208 [n + 1] such that the option i = n + 1 is not possible. Alternatively, for minimal decompositions such that Eq. 133 holds, there exists i \u2208 [n]. Lemmas 4 and 5 show that for specific cases, contradictions to F (f, g) arise. By Lem. 18, the function q = N DPM 2 0+ B; k, 2C is examined for validity in different discrepancy forms like the Wasserstein GAN. This analysis is done for Prediction 2, focusing on the selection of variables. In the WGAN experiment, the number of layers in the architecture is varied to observe its impact on results. Results on the CelebA dataset show that 6 layers yield the best overall results, with fewer layers leading to failure in producing desired images and adding layers causing loss of semantic alignment. In an experiment on the CycleGAN architecture of BID12, 8 layers produced aligned solutions for Aerial images to Maps dataset, while 10 layers resulted in unaligned map images with low detail. Fewer than 8 layers led to high discrepancy and less detailed images."
