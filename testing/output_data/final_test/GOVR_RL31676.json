    "content": "During the Iraq conflict, concerns about oil supply disruption arose, but the impact was smaller than in previous crises. Oil prices briefly spiked but quickly returned to normal levels. Iraq's oil exports have been limited due to disagreements with the United Nations. Iraq's exports averaged less than 1.5 mbd in the past year, half of its potential. The disruption of Iraq's exports in March 2003 had less impact than previous crises. Other exporting nations increased crude supply to offset the loss. OPEC had spare production capacity three times Iraq's average exports in 2002, maintaining stability in the market despite conflicts and strikes in other oil-producing countries. Iraq's exports were lower than potential due to disruptions, but other OPEC exporters provided enough supply to compensate. A conflict involving other producing nations or export routes could have had a larger impact on the oil market. The Strait of Hormuz is a crucial oil choke point, with 13 million barrels per day passing through. Iraq has the potential to significantly increase oil production with further development. Iraq has the potential to rival Saudi Arabia and Russia as the world's largest oil producer, which could impact global oil pricing. It may take up to two years to rehabilitate Iraq's output to historic levels. The United States has policy options, including the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, to respond to oil supply disruptions. The President can release funds from LIHEAP for shortages of home heating oil in New England. OPEC consists of 11 members controlling a large portion of the world's oil production and reserves, acting as a cartel to balance supply and demand for certain price levels. OPEC administers crude oil production quotas to maintain prices within a range of $22 to $28 per barrel. The June 2003 quota was 25.4 mbd, while members produced 26.4 mbd in April. Saudi Arabia has the most surplus capacity at 10.0 mbd, potentially increasing to 10.5 mbd with 90 days' lead time. OPEC regularly adjusts quotas to match global crude demand. The new OPEC-10 output ceilings are 25.4 mbd, below maximum production levels. Spare capacity measures the world's reserve production capability. In the US, crude inventories hit a record low of 270 million barrels in March 2003, less than 14 days of demand at 20.1 mbd. Iraq's participation in OPEC pricing decisions was affected by its oil-for-food program under U.N. Resolution 986, leading to fluctuating crude exports before the war. Iraq's U.N.-sanctioned exports ceased during the conflict, but the loss was offset by other sources. Before the Iraq war, OPEC expressed willingness to replace lost supplies in case of armed conflict. OPEC-10 producers had enough spare capacity to prevent a market shortage if Iraqi exports were cut off. OPEC President Rilwanu Luckman assured that they could meet demand if only Iraq was affected, but disruptions from other key Middle East producers would create a different scenario. OPEC assured they could offset any supply shortfall from Iraq due to military conflict. UN evacuated staff from Iraq and suspended oil-for-food program. OPEC increased production to compensate for lost Iraqi crude. Venezuela's PVDSA experienced a strike, halting production for 6 weeks. The strike at Venezuela's PDVSA in November 2002 halted oil production and exports for 6 weeks, affecting the nation's oil fields and refinery capacity. This strike was led by opponents of President Hugo Chavez and resulted in a stoppage of all exports, including shipments to the United States. Exports from Venezuela were halted in November 2002 due to a strike at PDVSA, led by opponents of President Hugo Chavez. Reports on current export levels vary, with estimates ranging from 400,000 to 2.5 million barrels per day by April 2003. Despite overproduction relative to OPEC quotas, oil prices remained within the desired band. OPEC calculates the average price of seven internationally traded crudes, known as the \"OPEC basket,\" to determine if prices are within the desired band. U.S. crude prices have fluctuated between $20 and $30 per barrel, with some variation attributed to supply and demand fundamentals and a possible \"war premium\" due to uncertainty surrounding Iraq. The war premium on oil prices, estimated to be between $2-4/bbl to $6-9/bbl, is based on attempts to quantify the psychology of crude oil markets. The 1991 Desert Storm campaign led to a significant drop in oil prices, and the current uncertainty surrounding a US-led military strike on Iraq has caused prices to fluctuate between $20 and $30 per barrel. The war premium on oil prices is widely debated, but current demand and supply, as measured by U.S. commercial crude inventories, is a key factor. Refiners' crude stocks have been declining since winter 2001-02, reaching a low of 269 million barrels in early March 2003. Analysts predicted a brief military action against Saddam Hussein would cause a mild spike in oil prices. In August 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait, leading to a halt in oil exports from both countries. Production data from 1989 showed a significant loss of 3.7 million barrels per day in international commerce. Prices for U.S. crude imports rose immediately, ending a period of stability during the Gulf Crisis. The 1990-91 Gulf Crisis saw a brief period of price increase due to halted oil flows from Iraq and Kuwait. The world oil market recovered lost production through increased output from countries like Saudi Arabia, Iran, and the U.A.E. The recent Iraq war involved much less oil loss compared to the Gulf Crisis. The recent Iraq war had less oil loss compared to the 1990-91 Gulf Crisis, as it did not affect other Persian Gulf producers. World markets were not overly reliant on Iraqi supplies, and other OPEC members had unused capacity to compensate. However, if the conflict had spread to nearby producers, it could have led to a different, more severe scenario involving political instability in Saudi Arabia or shipping disruptions in the Persian Gulf. The potential impact of political instability in Saudi Arabia or shipping disruptions in the Persian Gulf could lead to unprecedented crude supply losses, with estimates suggesting oil prices could reach $80 per barrel in a worst-case war scenario. This scenario could have widespread spillover effects throughout the Middle East. The dire outcome of the Iraq conflict, with widespread spillover in the Middle East, could lead to a crisis-related oil price escalation. Analysts described worst-case scenarios of oil production ceasing in Iraq, attacks on oil facilities in other Gulf nations, and political unrest. The most likely scenario included the cessation of Iraqi oil exports. The most likely scenario during the Iraq conflict involved the cessation of Iraqi oil exports, leading to a short-lived price spike in the oil market. This scenario had a 40% to 60% probability of occurring, according to Cordesman. During the Gulf Crisis in 1990-91, spot-market prices briefly peaked at roughly $40 per barrel when Iraqi and Kuwaiti exports were halted, reflecting market psychology and supply shortfalls. In 2002, predicted price spikes due to potential hostilities in Iraq were short-lived as responses mitigated disruptions. Different price scenarios were projected, with a baseline trend showing a decline to $20 per barrel by mid-2003 without war. Potential disruptions ranged from brief spikes of $11 to as high as $53 per barrel. The public response to oil price shocks is often influenced by gas pump price developments. Gasoline prices typically mirror crude oil prices on a penny-for-penny basis. Dividing discussed crude oil price increases by 42 results in potential gasoline price increases ranging from 26 cents to $1.26 per gallon. Actual average U.S. pump prices rose from $1.41 to $1.72 in March 2002, the highest nominal price observed. The International Petroleum Encyclopedia 2001 reports that Iraq has proven crude oil reserves of 112.5 billion barrels, second only to Saudi Arabia's 259 billion barrels. Iraq's production comes from 1,685 wells in 20 fields, with a sustainable production capacity estimated at 2.8 million barrels per day. Iraq has the potential to increase its oil production to 3.3 million barrels per day with repairs and modernization. This could significantly impact the world oil market by driving prices down and challenging OPEC's control over supply. Iraq's massive oil reserves could potentially rival Saudi Arabia's, with proven and probable reserves exceeding 300 billion barrels. This could position Iraq as a major player in the global oil market, challenging Saudi Arabia's dominance within OPEC and impacting world oil prices. If Iraq's oil potential is fully realized, it could diversify global oil supply and become a significant determinant of oil prices. Iraq's oil potential could rival Saudi Arabia's, impacting global supply patterns and oil prices. Saudi Arabia has shown interest in developing natural gas reserves with foreign companies, including ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell. Russian companies may also play a role in these developments. Russian companies, particularly in the oil and gas sector, could be involved in investment opportunities in the Persian Gulf region. Russia's interest in the region extends beyond oilfield service contracts in Saudi Arabia and Iraq, as its economy heavily relies on energy exports. With Russia being the world's second-largest oil producer, its economic well-being is closely linked to high oil prices. Russian officials are concerned about the impact of high oil prices on their economy, especially in the event of military activity in Iraq. They fear that Western investment in the Iraqi oil sector could lead to a significant drop in oil prices, affecting Russian economic growth. The Bush administration is aware of these concerns but denies any specific agreement with Russia. A $6 fall in oil prices could halve Russian economic growth and impact Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil producer. 40% of Saudi GDP and 70%-80% of government revenues come from oil exports. A drop in oil prices would reduce government revenues and slow economic growth, affecting a population with limited job opportunities. Political stability in Saudi Arabia relies on a steady flow of oil revenues. The Iraq conflict caused a minor disruption in the world oil market, with prices rising and then returning to normal levels. During the 1990-91 Gulf Crisis, oil prices initially increased to $40 per barrel before readjusting to the low-to-mid $20 range. Policy tools could be used to replace lost supplies and mitigate price increases. OPEC producers were willing to make up for supply shortfalls during conflicts, but the Strategic Petroleum Reserve would be crucial in the event of prolonged supply disruptions. The short-term policy options to address oil supply shortages include utilizing the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) and Northeast Heating Oil Reserve (NHOR), as well as programs like the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). Other options include enacting a moratorium on motor fuel excise taxes and reimposing a ban on oil exports. These options would make use of existing programs or involve legislative action debated in Congress. Long-term policy options to address oil supply instability focus on boosting U.S. oil production, diversifying sources of supply, and reducing consumption. Recent interest in these options includes tightening CAFE standards and promoting the diversification of U.S. sources for imported petroleum. Diplomacy with OPEC producers has also been a key consideration. The Clinton Administration's diplomatic efforts in response to reduced crude supply and rising prices in 1999-2000 included diplomatic missions by Secretary of Energy Richardson to OPEC and non-OPEC nations to address the supply imbalance caused by production cuts. Secretary Richardson's diplomatic mission aimed to address the supply imbalance caused by production cuts in OPEC and non-OPEC nations with surplus production capacity. Upon his return, Richardson testified that the trip was successful, leading to OPEC's announcement of a production boost. However, Iran initially opposed the agreement, citing American intrusion into OPEC's deliberations, but eventually agreed to increase production to maintain market share. Senator Murkowski challenged OPEC's decision-making timeline, suggesting they could meet whenever they wanted. Representative Gilman introduced the Oil Price Reduction Act of 2000 to reduce assistance to countries engaged in oil price fixing. The Oil Price Reduction Act of 2000 aimed to address price fixing by oil exporting nations, with provisions for sanctions that were later removed due to concerns about the impact on U.S. industries. The bill passed the House but faced challenges in the Senate. The Powers Act (P.L. 95-223) was passed by the House and a resolution supporting U.S. diplomatic efforts (S.Res. 263) was approved by the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. Diplomacy is seen as a preferred policy to avoid market intervention and economic dislocation, but opinions on its success vary. Representative DeLay criticized the Administration's energy policy during an OPEC meeting in 2000. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was authorized in 1975 to create a reserve of crude oil for supply interruptions. As of November 2002, the SPR held a record 593.5 million barrels, expected to reach 700 million barrels. Maximum drawdown is 4.3 million barrels per day. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) allows for a maximum drawdown of 4.3 million barrels per day in case of a severe energy supply interruption. Additional drawdown authority was enacted in 1990 after the Exxon Valdez oil spill to address spot shortages and price increases. The President can use the SPR for a limited drawdown without declaring a severe energy supply interruption. Up to 30 million barrels can be sold over 60 days if there is a significant energy shortage. This authority is periodically extended by Congress. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) holds 500 million barrels and its authorities are periodically extended by Congress. In times of supply emergency, fill activities may be suspended. In the past, there were debates on drawdowns during oil price volatility, with the Clinton Administration opposing it. Legislation in the 107th Congress aimed to permanently authorize the SPR. President Clinton announced a swap of 30 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in response to escalating crude oil prices and low stocks of home heating oil. Interested parties bid to borrow oil with contracts awarded based on how much they offered to return to the SPR. President Clinton announced a swap of 30 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in response to escalating crude oil prices and low stocks of home heating oil. Bidders based their offers on acquiring replacement crude and additional supply for the winter. DOE awarded 24 million barrels of sweet crude and 6 million barrels of sour, with a total of 31.5 million barrels to be returned to the SPR in 2001. Crude prices softened from $37 to less than $31/bbl after the awards, potentially influenced by the swap and U.S. willingness to use the SPR. President Clinton announced a swap of 30 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to address high crude oil prices and low home heating oil stocks. Some believed it was a political move, while others saw it as necessary to stabilize supply. Senator Murkowski highlighted the irony that U.S. SPR oil might help European markets more than domestic ones. European nations were urged to coordinate a stock drawdown by the European Union in response to a U.S. action, but opinions were divided. The advantage of a European drawdown was the faster access to product markets due to stocks being held in refined products. The risk in swap transactions was mainly on oil companies or refiners. The volume promised to return and the price at acquisition determined the refiner's return. The swap resulted in a net acquisition of reserves that would not have otherwise occurred due to the lack of congressional appropriations for the SPR in recent years. On March 29, 2001, a renegotiated repayment schedule allowed five companies to return nearly 24 million barrels of swapped oil by January 2003. Despite owing roughly 6.5 million barrels, delivery was rescheduled due to a drop in crude exports from Venezuela. The total projected return under the swap will be over 33.5 million barrels. Additionally, the FY2001 Interior Appropriations Act provided $8 million for the establishment and fill of a Northeast Heating Oil Reserve. The Northeast Heating Oil Reserve (NHOR) was established with $8 million in funding under P.L. 106-469 on November 9, 2000. It holds 2 million barrels of home heating oil in New York and New Jersey to serve New England during shortages. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA, P.L. 94-163) authorized the Secretary of Energy to establish regional reserves, including the NHOR. Controversy arose over the NHOR's use and its potential impact on private sector inventories. Advocates of the regional reserve argued that the 1999-2000 winter demonstrated how problems in the Northeast can lead to price increases in other petroleum fuels. P.L. 106-469 allows drawdown in case of a regional supply shortage or a significant price differential between crude oil and home heating oil. Critics warned that using a government reserve to lower prices could dampen supply response. The price differential between crude oil and home heating oil increased by over 60% from its five-year rolling average. Despite breaching the 60% threshold in December 2000, it was due to a decline in crude prices rather than an increase in home heating oil prices. By February 2001, heating oil stocks had recovered sufficiently to ease concerns about supply adequacy for the remainder of the winter. DOE updates a weekly table on its website showing the status of heating oil stocks. The NHOR, designed to provide relief from weather-related shortages for approximately 10 days, may not be needed during the winter of 2002-2003. It cannot be a long-term replacement for a supply shortfall but could be effective if coordinated with drawdown of crude from the SPR to tide the Northeast over until new refined product could reach the region. Legislation proposed during the 106th Congress by Senator Kennedy aimed to ensure \"minimally adequate\" heating oil stocks to meet winter demand and protect consumers from price increases. The Stable Oil Supply (SOS) Home Heating Act (S. 2094) would have required importers, wholesalers, and refiners to develop plans to mitigate price risks, with potential Department of Energy intervention if necessary. The Department of Energy proposed a plan to require specific inventory levels for oil marketers, which was opposed due to cost burdens and market interference. Proponents argued that private sector responsibility is more cost-effective and compared advance purchases to an insurance premium. The International Energy Agency was established in 1974 to coordinate energy policies in response to the Arab oil embargo. The International Energy Agency (IEA) was established in 1974 in response to the Arab oil embargo to coordinate energy policies and mitigate supply disruptions. IEA members must maintain 90 days of net imports in stocks, which can be held by industry, governments, or other agencies. Members also have demand restraint programs and participate in oil allocation during emergencies. The IEA Governing Board convenes during emergencies, with the last activation in January 1991 during the air war on Iraq. In 1991, following the air war on Iraq, demand restraint was 300,000 barrels per day with a stock drawdown of over 2 mbd. IEA estimates its members hold nearly 4 billion barrels, about 114 days of net imports. Two-thirds of IEA stocks are held by the petroleum industry, and one-third by governments and agencies. The maximum drawdown of IEA stocks is 12.9 mbd for one month, including 9.6 mbd of crude and 3.3 mbd of \"products.\" The IEA initially did not have stockpiling programs but later developed an oil-sharing plan to allocate shortages among members. Demand restraint and stock drawdown are now preferred by IEA signatories. The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) provides financial aid to low-income households affected by high energy costs. The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) provides annual grants to needy households in states, territories, and tribal organizations. Funding for FY2003 was $1.8 billion with an additional $200 million for contingency. LIHEAP could be used for consumer relief in case of sustained price spikes, but budget issues would arise with significant expansion. (For more information, see CRS Report 94-211) In 2000, policymakers considered a moratorium on motor fuel excise taxes to address rising petroleum prices, but it was rejected due to potential revenue loss for the Highway Trust Fund. The complex tax structure for transportation fuels includes varying rates and exemptions. The tax structure for transportation fuels includes varying rates and exemptions. Gasoline used in highway transportation is taxed at a rate of 18.4\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd per gallon, with most revenue going towards highway construction and maintenance. Diesel fuel for highway use is taxed at 24.4\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd per gallon. The tax on kerosene and diesel used on highways is 24.4\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd per gallon, higher than gasoline. This tax was added in 1997 to reduce tax evasion. Diesel is mainly used by businesses for transporting goods, with projected revenues of $7.2 billion in FY2003. Truckers can deduct this tax from their income taxes, reducing the net revenue yield to the government by about 25%. The government projects net revenues of about $5.4 billion in FY2003 from the tax on diesel used by truckers, with 2.86% allocated for mass transit and the remaining 24.3% going into the highway account. Senators proposed suspending the 4.3 cents/gallon increment of the federal excise tax on gasoline in 2000, originally designated for deficit reduction but redirected to a transportation trust fund. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 redirected gasoline excise taxes to a transportation trust fund. Senate proposal aimed to lift excise taxes on gasoline, diesel, and aviation fuel if gas prices exceeded $2/gallon. A Senate cloture motion on S. 2232 failed, while H.R. 3749 in the House suggested reducing fuel taxes by 10 cents/gallon. Another bill, S. 2161, would transfer funds from the General Fund to cover any revenue loss for the Highway Trust Fund. The House and Senate considered tax relief proposals for truckers affected by diesel fuel price increases. One proposal suggested a one-year moratorium on the diesel tax and a permanent reduction to 4.3 cents. However, concerns were raised about potential market distortions between home heating oil and diesel fuel prices. The potential effects of a tax moratorium on diesel prices and home heating oil prices are uncertain. States may offset lost revenues from the Highway Trust Fund by increasing state fuel taxes, but the impact on federal legislation objectives and equity issues remain unclear. The reimposition of the ban on Alaskan oil exports was proposed during a period of tight supplies and volatile prices. Legislation aimed to prohibit exports of petroleum from Alaska, which accounted for about 7% of Alaskan production. This was in response to concerns about inefficiency and inequity in relief measures for gasoline consumers. In 1995, P.L. 104-58 allowed North Slope crude exports, but the President could still suspend exports in a national emergency. Legislation was proposed in 1999 to suspend Alaskan exports, but currently, no Alaska North Slope crude oil is being exported. BP Amoco and Arco merged in 2000, with Arco's stake in ANS operations sold to Phillips. Phillips does not export Alaskan oil and has no plans to do so. Overall, U.S. oil exports have averaged less than a million barrels per day during January-September 2002, primarily consisting of less desirable fuels. Any generalized ban on petroleum exports from the United States is unlikely to impact U.S. supply significantly. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 established corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards for new vehicles, with the current standard set at 27.5 mpg for passenger cars and 20.7 mpg for light trucks, including SUVs. The proportion of new vehicles that are light trucks has increased from 20% in 1980 to over 50% in 2001, impacting gasoline demand and U.S. vulnerability to price increases. Congress prohibited adjustments to fuel economy standards for light trucks from FY1996-FY2001, but in the 107th Congress, a study by the National Academy of Sciences suggested a 40% improvement in light truck and SUV fuel economy was possible. The 107th Congress debated comprehensive energy legislation that aimed to improve light truck and SUV fuel economy by more than 40% over a 10-15 year period. The House and Senate versions of the bill included provisions to reduce fuel consumption and develop new CAFE standards, but final action was not taken before the Congress ended. The 107th Congress debated comprehensive energy legislation to improve light truck and SUV fuel economy, but final action was not taken before the Congress ended. The 108th Congress's inclusion of fuel economy in energy legislation is uncertain. NHTSA issued a rule to raise CAFE standards for SUVs and light-duty trucks during MY2005-MY2007. Environmentalists criticized the rule as insufficient, while the automotive industry suggested meeting the standards would be challenging. Policymakers discuss boosting domestic energy production to reduce U.S. dependence on imported oil amidst uncertain oil prices and difficulty in long-term investments in higher-cost technologies. The United States faces challenges in reducing its dependence on imported petroleum, with proposals for boosting domestic production sparking debate among policymakers. The National Energy Plan released by the Bush Administration in 2001 was criticized for favoring production over reducing oil consumption, including controversial proposals such as oil and gas leasing in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Other debated policies to encourage domestic production have included tax incentives and filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The 106th Congress enacted a guaranteed loan program (P.L. 106-51) to assist domestic oil producers. The 107th Congress debated comprehensive energy legislation with tax provisions to boost production from marginal wells and extend tax benefits for unconventional sources. The House bill included opening ANWR for leasing, while the Senate did not. The 107th Congress adjourned without finalizing the bill, but similar legislation is being considered in the 108th Congress. The National Energy Plan emphasized the importance of increasing production worldwide, especially outside of OPEC. The Administration directed efforts to integrate energy with Canada and Mexico and support American energy firms in foreign markets. Congress may have a limited role in these initiatives."
