    "content": "The Clean Water Act prohibits pollutant discharge into US waters without a permit. Vessels are considered point sources. In 2006, a court revoked a regulation excluding ballast water from permitting requirements, citing Congress's intention for vessel discharges to be regulated under the CWA. The Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals upheld a district court ruling on the regulatory exclusion as of September 30, 2008, and remanded the decision to the EPA for further proceedings. In response to a court order in 2006, the EPA proposed two Clean Water Act general permits on June 17, 2008, one for commercial vessels and one for small recreational vessels. These permits are issued for a specific period, not exceeding five years, and can cover multiple facilities with similar operations and waste discharges. The use of general permits was deemed more administratively efficient by the EPA due to the large number of potential vessel sources. In August 2008, the federal district court agreed to delay vacating the regulatory exemption for three months to ensure permits could be issued before the exemption was eliminated. EPA finalized a Vessel General Permit on December 18, 2008, which became effective on December 19, 2008. Congress enacted two bills in July 2008 to exempt certain vessels from CWA permitting, limiting EPA regulation. The Clean Boating Act of 2008 exempted recreational vessels from CWA permitting requirements. A moratorium was placed on CWA permitting for certain discharges from commercial fishing vessels and non-recreational vessels under 79 feet in length, which has been extended multiple times by Congress. EPA is developing regulations for recreational vessels as required by the legislation. The moratorium on CWA permitting for certain discharges from commercial fishing vessels and non-recreational vessels under 79 feet in length was extended until December 18, 2017. Vessels less than 79 feet are not affected by the moratorium and are required to be authorized by permits. The Vessel General Permit finalized by EPA in December 2008 provided permit coverage to an estimated 72,000 vessels larger than 79 feet used in transportation. The Vessel General Permit in 2008 covered pollutant discharges from non-recreational vessels over 79 feet, including ballast water, into US waters up to 3 miles from the shoreline. It included 26 types of waste streams such as invasive species, nutrients, pathogens, oil, metals, and toxins. The 2008 VGP regulated various pollutant discharges from non-recreational vessels over 79 feet, including invasive species, nutrients, pathogens, oil, metals, and toxins. Effluent limitations were required to meet technology-based controls, with specific best management practices (BMPs) in place for most discharges. Certain vessel categories, like cruise ships, had detailed requirements for discharges such as graywater and pool/spa water, along with monitoring and reporting obligations. The 2008 VGP regulated pollutant discharges from non-recreational vessels over 79 feet. Larger vessels had to submit a Notice of Intent for permit coverage, while smaller vessels were automatically covered. EPA proposed two Vessel General Permits to replace the 2008 VGP, one for large vessels and one for smaller vessels. Compliance costs were estimated between $8.9 million to $23.0 million annually. The draft permits proposed to regulate discharges from various waste streams, including a new category for fish hold effluent. They retained the approach of using specific behaviors or BMP techniques to control most discharges, as developing numeric effluent limits was deemed infeasible. Changes in the draft permits included numeric ballast water discharge limits for larger vessels, more stringent limits for oil-to-sea interfaces and exhaust gas scrubber washwater, and specifications for managing fish hold effluent. Streamlined recordkeeping and reporting requirements were also included. The EPA issued a final permit in 2013 to replace the 2008 VGP, with similar requirements to the draft VGP. Smaller vessels were covered by a congressional moratorium until December 18, 2014, which was extended until December 18, 2017. The report discusses the revised VGP for large vessels, focusing on ballast water management and federal and state requirements. The 2013 final VGP applies to seven categories of vessels operating in a capacity of transportation with discharges incidental to their normal operations into waters subject to the permit: commercial fishing, freight barge, freight ship, passenger vessel, tank barge, tank ship, and utility vessel. Freight barges, tank barges, and utility vessels account for the majority of domestic vessels eligible for coverage under the VGP. Foreign vessels eligible for coverage are mainly freight ships and tank ships. The 2013 final VGP covers seven categories of vessels, with freight ships and tank ships accounting for the majority of eligible vessels. The permit does not require smaller vessels to submit NOIs, automatically covering over 10,000 vessels. All covered vessels must comply with the permit's requirements and maintain a Permit Authorization and Record of Inspection form on board. The final VGP requires vessels to maintain a Permit Authorization and Record of Inspection form on board at all times. The permit has a five-year term and covers various vessel categories, with a focus on ballast water discharge as a pathway for the introduction of Aquatic Nuisance Species (ANS). EPA's economic and benefits analysis of the permit modifications are also discussed. Ballast water discharge is a crucial practice for ships' stability during transport, but it can introduce harmful non-native Aquatic Nuisance Species (ANS) into ecosystems. Environmental groups challenged EPA regulations in 1973 due to concerns about the impacts of ballast water discharge. The 2008 VGP requires minimal ballast water requirements, including mid-ocean ballast water exchange for ships outside the 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone. Vessels engaged in Pacific nearshore voyages must conduct ballast water exchange at least 50 nautical miles from shore. Vessels declaring \"no ballast on board\" must seal tanks or carry out saltwater flushing, and operators must maintain log books and records of ballast water. The 2008 VGP requires vessel operators to maintain log books and records of ballast water management. EPA is not imposing numeric limits on living organisms in ballast water discharge, opting for management practices instead due to the lack of proven treatment technologies. EPA deems numeric effluent limits for living organisms discharge as impracticable at this time. The EPA is considering establishing treatment requirements in future permits to regulate the discharge of living organisms in ballast water. The 2013 VGP includes numeric discharge limits for ballast water to reduce the number of organisms released into water bodies. The limits are expressed as maximum acceptable concentration of living organisms per cubic meter discharged. The EPA has established numeric discharge limits for ballast water to reduce the number of organisms released into water bodies. Treatment technologies are available to meet these limits, which are economically practicable and achievable. The limits align with international standards and include biocide effluent limitations to prevent violations of water quality standards. The VGP includes biocide effluent limitations to protect aquatic life with specific limits for chlorine dioxide, peracetic acid, ozone, and hydrogen peroxide. Vessels can comply with numeric treatment limits by treating ballast water, transferring it for on-shore treatment, using municipal water, or not discharging. EPA estimates around 2,880 domestic and 5,270 foreign vessels are subject to these standards, with 40% expected to install treatment systems. Under the VGP, new vessels constructed after December 1, 2013, must comply with the permit's numeric limits upon delivery. Existing vessels with ballast water capacity of less than 1,500 cubic meters must comply by their first scheduled drydocking after January 1, 2016, while vessels with capacity between 1,500 and 5,000 cubic meters must comply after January 1, 2014. EPA has determined that various treatment technologies are available for shipboard installation to meet the permit's requirements. Existing vessels with ballast water capacity greater than 5,000 cubic meters must comply by their first scheduled drydocking after January 1, 2016. Certain vessel classes, such as those engaged in short-distance voyages or operating solely within the Great Lakes, are not subject to the ballast water numeric limits in the VGP. EPA states that various treatment technologies are available for shipboard installation to meet the permit's requirements. The EPA requires existing Lakers to use Best Management Practices (BMPs) for managing ballast water, as there are currently no treatment systems available. The 2013 VGP includes more stringent effluent limits and BMPs for vessel discharges, such as using environmentally acceptable lubricants on equipment at the sea interface. EPA will consider revising permit requirements if new technologies become available. The permit requires vessel operators to use lubricants and maintenance BMPs to prevent oil discharges. It also includes BMPs to reduce fish hold effluent discharges, which contain pollutants from seafood catch and cleaning processes. The VGP permit sets numeric limits for controlling harmful exhaust emissions from vessel engines and includes monitoring requirements for pH, turbidity, PAHs, and nitrates plus nitrites. It also includes administrative modifications for self-inspection and recordkeeping, clarifying the use of electronic systems. The 2013 VGP permit requires vessels to report electronically, consolidates reporting requirements, and includes additional requirements for cruise ships due to their higher graywater discharges and use of toxic chemicals. The 2013 VGP permit tightens operational limits on cruise ship graywater discharges, prohibiting discharge within 3 nautical miles of shore unless treated to specified standards. Requirements are similar for large and medium cruise ships, with some flexibility for the latter due to differences in graywater holding capacity and operation. The 2013 VGP permit includes additional requirements for various types of vessels to minimize spills and protect against harmful discharges. EPA estimates annual costs of implementing the VGP for domestic vessels to range from $7.2 million to $23.0 million. The 2013 VGP permit imposes additional costs for compliance, mainly related to environmentally acceptable lubricants and ballast water. Compliance costs do not include capital costs for ballast water treatment systems, estimated at $168 million per year by the Coast Guard. Average per vessel compliance costs range from $51 to $7,004, with tank ships facing the highest costs. The EPA concludes that complying with the 2013 VGP permit for oil tankers in coastwise trade is economically feasible. The permit aims to reduce the risk of introducing aquatic nuisance species and improve environmental quality by reducing pollutants. The ballast water management practices outlined in the permit are expected to prevent future damages to various aspects of the ecosystem, although the specific benefits cannot be quantified. The EPA cannot quantify the benefits of complying with the 2013 VGP permit for oil tankers due to the complexity of analyzing the probability of ANS introduction and spread. The permit's controls are expected to generate both monetized and nonmonetized benefits, but the magnitude of these benefits is not calculable. EPA acknowledges significant uncertainty regarding estimated costs of the VGP. The EPA is uncertain about the costs of implementing discharge control practices and new treatment systems for vessels. There are questions about including specific numeric ballast water discharge limits in the permit and the role of states in regulating vessel discharges. EPA's estimates should be seen as a range of incremental costs, not precise figures for vessel owners. The EPA and Coast Guard sought advice from the National Research Council to evaluate the science supporting numeric limits for ballast water discharge standards. This was in anticipation of the expiration of the 2008 VGP and potential changes to the permit's requirements. The National Research Council evaluated the effectiveness of setting limits on live organisms in ballast water discharge to prevent the establishment of aquatic invasive species. The NRC report highlighted the complexity of invasion outcomes and the need for further research on the relationship between organism release and invasion risk. Additionally, the EPA requested advice from its Science Advisory Board on technologies to minimize the impacts of invasive species in vessel ballast water discharge. The Science Advisory Board recommends a risk-based approach to minimize invasive species in vessel ballast water discharge. Existing technologies can meet current standards, but testing for more stringent standards is challenging. Reaching higher standards would require improved technology. The Science Advisory Board suggests a risk-based approach to reduce invasive species in ballast water discharge. Meeting more stringent standards would necessitate new treatment systems that have not been tested for practicality and cost. EPA's 2011 draft VGP aimed to align with IMO D-2 standards/Coast Guard rule while maintaining the use of BMPs. EPA determined that achieving a faster implementation schedule or stricter discharge limits is not currently feasible based on available data. EPA requested public comment on the appropriateness of proposed ballast water controls in the draft VGP and whether to adopt alternative treatment limits. In the 2013 final VGP, EPA retained the position taken in the 2011 draft VGP. The 2013 final VGP retains the position that more stringent ballast water discharge standards cannot be supported. It acknowledges the unique vulnerabilities of the Great Lakes system and requires vessels operating outside the EEZ to conduct saltwater flushing of ballast tanks before entering Great Lakes waters. The Clean Water Act allows EPA to authorize states to administer permitting programs, with EPA currently authorizing 46 states. In cases where EPA issues a general permit, it applies in non-authorized states where EPA retains permitting authority. Authorized states must issue permits at least as stringent as the EPA general permit. States authorized by the EPA can issue permits for vessels under the Clean Water Act, with the flexibility to impose more stringent requirements than federal rules. This allows states to tailor water quality programs to local conditions, although the complexity of regulating mobile vessels differs from stationary sources. The 2008 VGP and final 2013 VGP apply to vessel discharges into U.S. waters in all states and territories, preempting states from issuing CWA permits for vessel discharges. Some states require vessels to meet their own discharge requirements through 401 certification. States have the power to impose conditions on federal permits for discharges into U.S. waters through Section 401 certification, ensuring compliance with the Clean Water Act. Prior to the 2013 VGP, 25 states added conditions to the permit, with 14 including restrictions on ballast water discharges. The federal court upheld state certifications attached to the 2008 federal permit for ballast water discharges, rejecting a challenge from commercial shipping operators. The court ruled that EPA cannot amend or reject state certifications under the Clean Water Act. The court upheld state certifications attached to the federal permit for ballast water discharges, stating that EPA cannot amend or reject state certifications. Petitioners have recourse through state or federal court challenges, or seeking modification of the Clean Water Act. States have the authority to issue permits independent of the federal permit. Challenges from commercial shipping industry and environmental groups have been generally upheld by courts. For example, a Minnesota court upheld a state permit despite challenges from an environmental group regarding water quality impact review and numeric limitations for aquatic nuisance species. Michigan's actions were also mentioned. Michigan's permitting program and New York's 401 certification of the 2008 federal permit were upheld after challenges by shipping industry groups. EPA plans to provide a clearinghouse of information to track each state's 401 conditions. Environmental advocacy groups criticized the 2013 final permit for not adequately addressing invasive species spread. Legal challenges to the permit were filed by various groups and consolidated in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York. The Canadian Shipowners Association (CSA) challenged the 2013 permit's deadline for implementing ballast water management systems in court. The Coast Guard has been granting compliance extensions due to technology unavailability, which the EPA has acknowledged. The court granted CSA's request to stay the deadline for vessels operated by CSA members. EPA officials stated that enforcement action against non-compliant vessels would have a low priority. In October 2015, the court ruled that EPA acted arbitrarily in choosing the IMO standard for ballast water discharges without adequately considering higher standards achievable with available technology. The court highlighted the Science Advisory Board's report identifying technologies capable of meeting higher standards than IMO, suggesting EPA should have adjusted its standard accordingly. The court ruled that EPA should have adjusted its standard in light of available technologies discussed in the SAB report. The court also found EPA's decision to exempt Lakers built before 2009 from numeric effluent limits of the VGP to be arbitrary and capricious. EPA's belief that there is a lack of supply of updated shipboard systems for Lakers was not a legitimate reason to exempt pre-2009 Lakers from the 2013 VGP. The court remanded the permit to EPA for proceedings consistent with the opinion, but allowed the 2013 permit to remain in place until EPA issues a new VGP. The Canadian Shipowners Association's challenge to the 2013 VGP is in abeyance until EPA issues its response to the October 2015 remand order. Several bills enacted in 2008 exempted certain vessels from a CWA permit requirement. A permit moratorium for small non-recreational and commercial fishing vessels was extended until December 18, 2014. The sVGP would apply to these vessels if the moratorium expired without congressional action. Bills were introduced in the 113th Congress to make the moratorium permanent, including H.R. 3464, S. 2094, and S. 2963. Supporters argued that these vessels contribute little pollution. Some support a permanent permit exemption for small non-recreational vessels due to their minimal pollution contribution. Others argue for a permit moratorium citing environmental concerns over vessel discharges. Legislation was introduced for a one-year extension of the moratorium, which was later extended for three years until December 18, 2017. The small vessel moratorium has been extended until December 18, 2017. Ballast water discharges from vessels less than 79 feet are not affected by the moratorium and require permits. Owners can seek coverage under general permits for large or small vessels, with different compliance standards. Bills have been introduced in Congress to make the temporary permit moratorium for small vessels permanent. Legislation addressing ballast water standards and permit moratorium has been introduced in Congress multiple times since 2000. The Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee approved S. 373 in February 2015, which later became part of other bills related to maritime administration and Coast Guard authorization. Various legislative proposals have aimed to address the issue of aquatic invasive species introduced through ballast water discharges into U.S. waters. Several legislative proposals have sought to harmonize ballast water management requirements in a single authority to be implemented by the Coast Guard, including provisions of H.R. 2838 passed in 2011. This legislation would establish a federal ballast water management standard, superseding existing state standards or permits for commercial vessel discharge. The Coast Guard would have the primary role in enforcing the ballast water performance standard. In December 2012, Congress enacted H.R. 2838 (P.L. 112-213) with modifications, extending the moratorium on CWA permit requirements for small vessels. Legislation for nationally uniform ballast water discharge standards (S. 2094) was approved by the Senate Commerce Committee in July 2014. In the 114th Congress, bills S. 373 and H.R. 980 were introduced to address ballast water standards and make the temporary permit moratorium permanent for small non-recreational vessels and commercial fishing vessels. The Senate Commerce Subcommittee held a hearing on vessel discharge regulation issues. The committee approved the Vessel Incidental Discharge Act, allowing states to enforce stricter ballast water standards if feasible. The Senate Commerce Subcommittee approved the Vessel Incidental Discharge Act, allowing states to enforce stricter ballast water standards. The bill was included in the Maritime Administration Authorization and Enhancement Act for Fiscal Year 2017 and the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2015. The House passed the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2017, which included similar provisions objected to by the Administration. On September 10, 2014, EPA issued the final permit for small vessels known as the sVGP, set to be effective on December 19, 2014. The permit applied to non-military, non-recreational vessels under 79 feet in length, with an estimated 115,000 to 138,000 domestic and 156 foreign vessels affected. Various commercial fishing vessels, tugs, water taxis, and ferries were included. Approximately 68,000 commercial fishing vessels are the largest category affected by the sVGP, followed by unspecified vessels and passenger vessels. The sVGP would regulate various discharges and prescribe Best Management Practices for maintenance. The sVGP regulates discharges and prescribes Best Management Practices for maintenance, including preventive measures for fuel and oil leaks, minimizing graywater discharges, and implementing ballast water management for vessels under 79 feet. The sVGP requires vessels to follow Best Management Practices for ballast water management, including minimizing uptake in high-risk areas and discharging minimal amounts in U.S. waters. EPA decided not to require an NOI for all vessels due to administrative burden and limited discharge types, but operators must comply with permit requirements and maintain necessary documentation onboard. The 2014 sVGP introduced new requirements for vessel maintenance, including the removal of accumulated bilgewater before transporting a vessel over land. EPA estimated annual costs for domestic vessels to range from $7.1 million to $16.9 million, with expenses mainly attributed to hull maintenance, recordkeeping, and engine/oil control practices. The average cost per vessel varied depending on discharge categories. The EPA estimated annual costs for domestic vessels under the sVGP to range from $7.1 million to $16.9 million, with expenses mainly attributed to hull maintenance, recordkeeping, and engine/oil control practices. The agency expected benefits from reducing discharges incidental to small non-recreational vessels, including enhanced environmental quality and reduced risk of spreading invasive species. EPA acknowledged uncertainties about impacts of the sVGP due to data limitations on financial and operational characteristics of affected firms. The EPA estimated annual costs for domestic vessels under the sVGP to range from $7.1 million to $16.9 million, mainly for hull maintenance, recordkeeping, and engine/oil control practices. The agency recognized uncertainties in the impacts of the sVGP on small firms in the commercial fishing industry, with some vessels already implementing discharge control practices and unlikely to incur significant additional costs. The permit was expected to affect small operators, but the exact profitability impacts are difficult to quantify due to data limitations. Discharges from military vessels are not covered by EPA's VGP or the 2012 Coast Guard rule on ballast water. Instead, they are regulated under CWA Section 312(n), added in 1996, requiring EPA and DOD to establish uniform national discharge standards for Armed Forces vessels. Compliance is mandatory unless the Secretary of Defense deems it a national security risk. Once finalized, these standards will apply to discharges in U.S. waters. EPA and DOD are in the process of developing these standards. The EPA and DOD have been working on developing discharge standards for military vessels under CWA Section 312(n) for over 20 years. Phase I identified 25 discharges requiring control with a marine pollution control device (MPCD) and 14 not needing control. Phase II involves proposing discharge performance standards for these categories, with two sets published in 2014 and 2016. Phase III of the UNDS rulemaking will be a DOD-only rule, requiring regulations for MPCDs to meet performance standards. It will be promulgated in three batches, with DOD required to finalize the standards within one year of Phase II. Approximately 6,230 Armed Forces vessels will be affected by these regulations. Approximately 18% of the 6,230 Armed Forces vessels affected by the UNDS rulemaking are larger than 79 feet in length, including aircraft carriers, auxiliary ships, patrol ships, and submarines. The remaining 5,140 ships are less than 79 feet in length. The EPA and DOD are using the 2013 VGP and the 2014 sVGP as baselines for developing Phase II discharge performance standards for these vessels."
