    "content": "The Act titled \"What Works to Move Welfare Recipients into Jobs Act\" amends Section 413 of the Social Security Act to strengthen welfare research and evaluation, as well as develop a What Works Clearinghouse for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and related programs. The Secretary is required to conduct research on the impacts of State programs funded under this part and grants to improve child well-being by promoting healthy marriage and responsible fatherhood. The research will focus on employment, self-sufficiency, child well-being, marriage, poverty, economic mobility, and other relevant factors. Additionally, the Secretary will develop methods to disseminate information on the research findings. The State can receive funding to evaluate programs funded under this part if the proposed evaluation is rigorous and likely to yield credible information. The State must contribute to the evaluation cost from non-Federal sources unless waived by the Secretary. The State must contribute at least 25 percent of the cost of the proposed evaluation from non-Federal sources. The Census Bureau will conduct household surveys to assess the impact of welfare reform on low-income families with children. The Bureau of the Census, the Secretary, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics will gather necessary information to examine issues such as unmarried childbearing, marriage, welfare dependency, work compliance, assistance spells, earnings, and child well-being. They will work on improving surveys to address underreporting of benefits and understand poverty spells better. Research and evaluation conducted under this section aims to understand intergenerational poverty, improve geographical understanding of poverty, analyze the effects of means-tested and tax benefits on low-income families' earnings, and enhance the measurement of poverty and economic well-being. The research will use experimental designs with random assignment or other evidence-based methods to determine the effects of programs or policies. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor, will develop a database called the 'What Works Clearinghouse of Proven and Promising Projects to Move Welfare Recipients into Work'. It will list projects using proven or promising approaches based on rigorous evaluations, including those with developmental approaches and those with no or negative effects. The Secretary will add projects with proven or promising approaches to the What Works Clearinghouse. Criteria for evidence of effectiveness will be established in consultation with the Secretary of Labor and organizations experienced in evaluating research on moving welfare recipients into work. The Secretary will establish criteria for evidence of effectiveness and ensure transparency, consistency, public comment, and consideration of efforts across agencies. The term 'approach' refers to a process, product, strategy, or practice. A proven approach is one that meets the requirements of a promising approach and has shown significant positive outcomes at multiple sites in terms of improving work and earnings, reducing poverty and dependence, or strengthening families. A promising approach is one that meets specific requirements, has been evaluated rigorously, shows positive outcomes at one site, and has benefits that exceed the costs. The developmental approach is research-based, evaluated rigorously, and aims to increase work and earnings of participants in a cost-effective way. The amendment made by this Act will be effective on October 1, 2016."
