    "content": "Many federal regulations aim to reduce risks of death, illness, or injury from various hazards by assigning a monetary value to expected health benefits based on the number of \"statistical lives\" saved. This concept reflects risk reduction in a population, not individual lives. For example, the Federal Railroad Administration published a rule in 2010 requiring \"positive train control\" systems on certain rail lines for safety improvement. The Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 mandated safety measures on rail lines to reduce accidents. The Federal Railroad Administration estimated that the rule would decrease deaths and injuries by over 50%, with projected benefits valued at $175-269 million for deaths and $133-204 million for injuries over 20 years. These health benefits accounted for more than 70% of the rule's total benefits. The report summarizes government-wide requirements for benefit-cost analysis and the monetization of health benefits in rulemaking processes. It also describes agency-specific policies and provides examples of final rules from selected agencies. The process of placing monetary values on expected health benefits is not widely understood, despite various statutes and executive orders mandating economic analysis during rulemaking. Executive Order 12866, issued by President Clinton in 1993, requires federal agencies to assess costs and benefits of regulatory actions. Agencies must conduct benefit-cost analyses for actions with significant economic impact, and only adopt regulations if benefits justify costs. Around 600 federal rules are deemed significant annually, with about 100 considered economically significant. The order also mandates agencies to provide regulatory benefits information to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. The Executive Order 12866 requires federal agencies to assess costs and benefits of regulatory actions, including promoting the efficient functioning of the economy, enhancing health and safety, protecting the environment, and reducing discrimination. Agencies must provide benefit-cost analyses to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs within the Office of Management and Budget. The order also mandates agencies to justify regulatory actions over potential alternatives, with detailed regulatory analysis requirements outlined in OMB Circular A-4. Circular A-4 guides analysts in regulatory agencies by defining good regulatory analysis and standardizing the measurement and reporting of benefits and costs of Federal regulatory actions. It emphasizes expressing both benefits and costs in monetary units for evaluating different regulatory options. Risk assessments are used to estimate regulatory health benefits, determining the extent of damage or injury from hazards. Risk assessment is crucial for agencies to identify potential concerns and select regulatory options. The concept of \"statistical lives\" saved reflects the expected risk reduction in a population, not individual lives. For example, if a regulation reduces the annual risk of death by 1 in 100,000 for a population of 100,000, it is considered as saving one statistical life per year. The number of lives saved depends on the population size and the level of risk reduction. Circular A-4 emphasizes the importance of opportunity cost in valuing benefits and costs, using the concept of willingness-to-pay to measure what individuals are willing to sacrifice for a particular benefit. Surveys are often used to determine the public's willingness-to-pay, such as in stated preference studies where respondents indicate how much they would pay to avoid specific risks. For instance, if 100,000 people are willing to pay $50 each to reduce a 1 in 100,000 risk of death, the value of a statistical life (VSL) for the population can be calculated. The \"value of a statistical life\" (VSL) for a population relative to a particular risk is $5 million ($50 times 100,000). Circular A-4 discusses the use of \"willingness-to-accept\" as an alternative measure of opportunity cost, using data from market transactions to estimate risks. Revealed preference studies, like wage-risk studies, compare earnings in different occupations to assess on-the-job risks. Economists generally prefer willingness-to-pay as the best measure of opportunity costs for fatality risk reductions. Circular A-4 states that the willingness-to-pay approach is the best methodology for monetizing health benefits, as it captures pain and suffering effects. It distinguishes between monetizing risk reductions and placing a value on human life, using the concept of the \"value of statistical life\" (VSL). This approach allows for direct comparison of results with other benefits and costs in the analysis. The \"value of statistical life\" (VSL) is used to measure willingness to pay for small risk reductions in premature death, not to assign a monetary value to individual lives. OMB has used a specific VSL in the past for regulatory health benefits, but Circular A-4 does not recommend a specific VSL for all economic analyses. The circular acknowledges a range of estimates for VSL from $1 million to $10 million per statistical life. The valuation of fatality risk reduction is an evolving area with VSL estimates ranging from $1 million to $10 million per statistical life. Circular A-4 allows flexibility in determining how reductions in mortality are valued but requires transparency in decision-making. It is important to use appropriate valuation methods for the regulatory circumstances and explain the selection of estimates and any adjustments made. Alternative approaches should be considered, and if monetizing mortality risk reduction, it should be done consistently. When monetizing mortality risk reduction, it is important to do so consistently and transparently, using appropriate valuation methods. Circular A-4 allows flexibility in determining the value of fatality risk reduction, with VSL estimates varying. Contextual factors such as the nature of the death being prevented, voluntary risk, and age of the affected population should be considered when determining VSL estimates. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) used an \"age adjustment factor\" in May 2003 to value the \"statistical lives\" of older people 37% less than younger people in calculating the benefits of the Clear Skies initiative. This led to a significant decrease in the estimated benefits of the initiative, sparking criticism from interest groups and Members of Congress. The EPA administrator announced the discontinuation of the age adjustment factor in valuing statistical lives, following criticisms from interest groups and Members of Congress. A memorandum advised federal agencies to stop using age adjustment factors in VSL analysis, and a provision in the FY2004 appropriations bill prohibited funding for economic analyses using age-adjustment factors. Circular A-4 emphasized not using age-adjustment factors in VSL estimates due to ongoing questions about their impact. Circular A-4 recommends federal agencies to consider providing estimates of both Value of Statistical Life (VSL) and Value of Statistical Life Years (VSLY) extended. The VSLY approach is favored when there are significant differences in life expectancy effects between populations, as it reflects these differences. When estimating Value of Statistical Life Years (VSLY), agencies should consider larger estimates for senior citizens due to their higher health risks and accumulated savings. Circular A-4 cautions against assuming more life-years extended always equate to better regulations. Critics argue VSLY can be discriminatory towards older individuals with shorter life expectancies. Some argue for using Value of Statistical Life Years (VSLY) in regulatory analyses, suggesting it can have a significant impact on the valuation of mortality risks for different age groups. Critics caution against potential discrimination towards older individuals with shorter life expectancies. The focus on life-years over lives in regulatory analyses is deemed appropriate, with the argument that life-extension is the primary goal. Saving more life-years is considered more beneficial, especially for younger individuals. Sunstein suggests prioritizing Value of Statistical Life Years (VSLY) over VSL in benefit-cost analysis. When conducting a benefit-cost analysis, the focus should be on Value of Statistical Life Years (VSLY) rather than VSL. Circular A-4 recommends using a discount factor to adjust for timing differences in benefits and costs of regulations. This is because current consumption is more expensive than future consumption due to the positive return on investment from resources invested. When conducting a benefit-cost analysis, it is important to consider discounted present values to compare costs and benefits. Circular A-4 recommends using a 3% and 7% discount rate to estimate net benefits in regulatory analyses. The 7% rate reflects the average before-tax rate of return to private capital in the U.S. economy. The Circular A-4 recommends using a 7% discount rate based on the before-tax rate of return to private capital in the U.S. economy. Critics argue that discounting in health, safety, and environmental regulation undervalues future lives saved. Intergenerational discounting ethics are also questioned. Circular A-4 recommends agencies to use benefit-cost analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis for major rulemakings focusing on public health and safety outcomes. Valid monetary values should be assigned to primary health and safety outcomes for benefit-cost analysis. Final outcomes like lives saved are considered better measures of effectiveness. Circular A-4 recommends using benefit-cost analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis for major rulemakings focusing on public health and safety outcomes. Measures of effectiveness such as lives saved or quality-adjusted life years saved are preferred over intermediate measures like tons of pollution reduced or crashes avoided. Agencies are encouraged to report results using multiple measures of effectiveness and to explain their choices. Circular A-4 recommends using benefit-cost analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis for major rulemakings focusing on public health and safety outcomes. Agencies should conduct a break-even analysis to evaluate the significance of regulations, using different values for the Value of Statistical Life (VSL) to determine the point at which net benefits are provided. Some federal departments and agencies have their own policies in addition to government-wide guidelines in OMB Circular A-4. Some federal departments and agencies have established policies on valuing reductions in deaths, illnesses, and injuries in economic analyses. DOT has written policies on valuing reductions in fatalities and injuries, recommending a $1.5 million value for a statistical life in economic analyses. The Department of Transportation (DOT) initially valued a statistical life at $2.5 million, which was later adjusted to $2.7 million in 1995 and $3.0 million in 2002. In 2008, the value was updated to $5.8 million due to new research and comparisons with other federal agencies. This new value was to be used immediately for DOT analyses. In 2007, DOT required sensitivity analyses at $3.2 million and $8.4 million to assist decision-makers in recognizing the necessary imprecision of any assumption of the value of a statistical life. In March 2009, the VSL was increased from $5.8 million to $6.0 million based on the Employment Cost Index and the Consumer Price Index. Analysts were not required to modify analyses already prepared if it would not significantly impact the comparison of benefits. The memorandum did not mention changing the values for supplementary analyses set in 2008 at $3.2 million and $8.4 million. DOT's VSL guidance established the relative value of injuries based on the MAIS scale. The percentages used in the guidance have not been updated and are reflected in Table 1. The Department of Homeland Security does not have a written policy on valuing health or safety benefits in rules, relying on DOT's $6.0 million VSL. Some DHS agencies still reference DOT's VSL policy from 2008 and 2009. A report for U.S. Customs and Border Protection recommended using wage-risk studies for VSL estimates in homeland security. The report recommended a VSL of $6.1 million in 2007 dollars, adjusted to $6.3 million in 2008 dollars. DHS may conduct a sensitivity analysis with a mean value of $12.6 million. The Coast Guard used the $6.3 million VSL to estimate benefits from marine casualty cases. The Coast Guard used a $6.3 million VSL in a break-even analysis to assess casualty risk reduction benefits. The EPA's guidance on mortality and morbidity valuation suggested a range of VSLs from $0.4 million to $7.0 million, cautioning that valuing illnesses based on direct costs underestimates benefits. The EPA's guidance on mortality and morbidity valuation suggests a range of VSLs from $0.4 million to $7.0 million, cautioning that valuing illnesses based on direct costs underestimates benefits. EPA recommends a central estimate of $4.8 million for statistical life estimates, updated to $6.1 million in 1999 dollars. EPA has not changed its guidance since 2000. The EPA guidelines recommend a central VSL estimate of nearly $7.9 million in 2009 for valuing mortality risks, considering differences in population characteristics and risk factors. Despite limitations in economic literature, analysts should use this estimate as a default approach but acknowledge its limitations. Analysts should carefully present the limitations of the central VSL estimate for valuing mortality risks recommended by EPA guidelines. Economic analyses should fully characterize the risk and affected populations, considering a diverse set of issues for valuing preventing illnesses and injuries. Quantitative sensitivity analyses should be considered on a case-by-case basis, with a discussion on estimating morbidity values. The EPA guidance highlights shortcomings in estimating morbidity values and emphasizes the importance of addressing these explicitly, conducting sensitivity analysis, and stating assumptions clearly to enhance benefits analysis credibility. Unlike the valuation of mortality, the guidance does not recommend a central monetary estimate for non-fatal health effects. The EPA Science Advisory Board recommended identifying important characteristics before combining VSL estimates from different studies. The EPA Science Advisory Board recommended establishing criteria for acceptable empirical studies to estimate the Value of Statistical Life (VSL) and determining appropriate studies based on policy context and population affected. They advised against relying exclusively on either stated preference or revealed preference studies and cautioned against using a VSL that varies with age due to insufficient robustness in the literature. The EPA Science Advisory Board recommended criteria for empirical studies to estimate the Value of Statistical Life (VSL) and advised against using a VSL that varies with age. They urged EPA to fund more research on empirical estimates of the VSL, as reductions in the risk of death constitute most benefits from regulations. In a review, it was found that the EPA had reduced the VSL used in air office regulations from nearly $8 million to $7 million in 2008 dollars starting in 2004. The EPA reduced the Value of Statistical Life (VSL) used in air office regulations from nearly $8 million to $7 million in 2008 dollars starting in 2004. Critics suspected the reduction was to lower expected benefits, but EPA claimed it was based on updated information on individuals' willingness to pay for risk reduction. The air office used results from three meta-analyses of the labor market literature on VSL, with one study's co-author questioning the decision-making process. The EPA Air Office selected a VSL based on two studies, creating an illusion of precision without scientific basis. There were substantial differences in methodology and resulting estimates in the studies, raising questions about the agency's choice of VSL. EPA did not change its official guidance on VSL or subject the interim estimate to scientific peer review. The Agency is updating its guidance with the most recent literature. The EPA is updating its guidance by incorporating the latest literature and recommendations from SAB-EEAC. It has decided to use a single, peer-reviewed estimate until updated guidance is available. Senator Barbara Boxer introduced a bill to address concerns about the lowered VSL at EPA, but it was not voted on by the Senate. The bill introduced by Senator Barbara Boxer aimed to prevent the EPA administrator from reducing the agency's Value of Statistical Life (VSL) below previous levels and required annual increases based on various factors. It also prohibited adjustments based on personal attributes and mandated transparency in the process of establishing VSL. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) lacks a department-wide policy on valuing mortality or morbidity risks in rulemaking. FDA within HHS follows EPA policies on VSL, with no formal internal guidance. FDA typically uses a VSL of $5 million for premature mortality. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) did not have specific policies on valuing mortality or morbidity risks in rulemaking. In a 2008 rule, CMS used VSL and life-year estimates from a 2006 FDA rule, which calculated a quality-adjusted life-year value between $213,000 and $373,000. According to an official in the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the agency lacks a written policy on valuing mortality or morbidity risks. In a February 2006 rule on occupational exposure to hexavalent chromium, OSHA established exposure limits to prevent lung cancer in workers. OSHA estimated the monetary value of the health benefits of the rule for informational purposes only. OSHA estimated the health benefits of the rule on occupational exposure to hexavalent chromium by adopting EPA's approach of valuing premature fatality at $6.8 million and using cost of illness and willingness to pay values for nonfatal cases of lung cancer. Other health effects were also assigned monetary values using a cost of illness approach. The agencies' policies on valuing health benefits in rulemaking varied, with only DOT and EPA having written policies. Their base values of statistical life (VSL) differed by almost $2 million. Other agencies tended to follow DOT or EPA's VSLs. Specific regulations were examined to see how these policies were implemented, with agencies using a cost of illness approach to value health benefits such as premature fatality and other health effects. In rulemaking, agencies used various methods to determine the value of anticipated health benefits, including VSL and VSLY. They used this information to assess if the rules would result in positive net benefits or to rule out certain regulatory options. Sensitivity analyses with different VSL estimates were also conducted in some cases. Regulatory agencies within DOT frequently monetized health benefits using VSLs, with consistent values of $5.8 million in 2008 and $6.0 million in 2009. Differences in VSL information usage were observed in economic analyses. A 2009 rule by the Federal Railroad Administration mandated action plans for states with the most highway-rail grade crossing collisions. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) mandated action plans for states with the most highway-rail grade crossing collisions. FRA estimated the total value of statistical lives lost at $3.28 billion and injury costs at nearly $20 million. The agency concluded that preventing one average accident would exceed the total expected costs of the rule. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) issued a final rule in July 2009 to improve the stopping distance performance of truck tractors, requiring a 30% reduction in stopping distance. NHTSA estimated that the rule would prevent an average of 227 fatalities and 300 serious injuries each year, with net benefits ranging from $1.27 billion to $1.75 billion. The NHTSA published a final rule in May 2009 to upgrade roof crush resistance standards, mandated by SAFETEA-LU. The rule aimed to reduce the risk of rollover crashes and improve safety by doubling the force the roof structure must withstand. The estimated benefits of the rule exceeded the costs, with the highest net cost per equivalent life saved estimated at $108,000. The NHTSA estimated that upgrading roof crush protection regulations would prevent 135 fatalities and 1,065 nonfatal injuries annually, with a total impact ranging from $6 million in net benefits to a net loss of $458 million. The NHTSA conducted an uncertainty analysis on the impact of a rule, with potential net losses ranging from $151 million to $824 million based on different values assigned to statistical lives. The FMCSA issued a final rule requiring intermodal equipment providers to register, establish maintenance programs, and comply with safety regulations. The FMCSA issued a final rule requiring intermodal equipment providers to comply with safety regulations, estimating the cost of a truck crash at $170,229 and the net present value of a single crash avoided per year at about $1.25 million. Compliance costs were estimated between $52.4 million and $285.4 million over 10 years. FMCSA issued a final rule to raise compliance standards for new entrant safety audits and identified 16 regulations for basic safety management controls. The rule aimed to prevent 40,000 crashes and 487 fatalities over 10 years, with estimated costs between $52.4 million and $285.4 million. The agency used various values for the VSL in their analysis, concluding that even the lowest value resulted in positive net benefits. Using different values for the Value of Statistical Life (VSL) showed positive net benefits. For instance, with a $3.2 million VSL and 7% discount rate, benefits exceeded costs by five times. Increasing the VSL to $8.4 million resulted in nearly 11 times more benefits than costs. FMCSA conducted a sensitivity analysis, raising the VSL to over $10 million, which increased safety benefits related to costs. FMCSA did not find the elimination of the 11th driving hour cost beneficial. DHS rules often do not monetize regulatory benefits, focusing on qualitative descriptions instead. For example, the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards rule estimated costs but described benefits qualitatively. No benefit-cost analysis was discussed in the rulemaking. The rulemaking docket lacked references to studies. DHS agencies used VSLs for health benefits in break-even analysis. DHS components aim to enhance security benefits presentation. Terrorism's nature hinders assigning traditional probabilities. Break-even analysis balances methodologies without disclosing sensitive intelligence. TSA's final rule was implemented on September 16, 2009. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) implemented a final rule on September 16, 2009, to screen 100% of cargo on passenger aircraft by August 2010, as required by the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007. The rule assessed the benefits through a break-even analysis of the cost reduction in risk in various attack scenarios. TSA used a $5.8 million Value of Statistical Life (VSL) in its analysis. The TSA implemented a final rule in 2009 to screen all cargo on passenger aircraft by 2010, as required by the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007. The rule assessed benefits through a cost-benefit analysis using a $5.8 million Value of Statistical Life (VSL). The TSA estimated that implementing the \"secure flight\" rule would cost $3.2 billion over 10 years but highlighted benefits such as more accurate screening and improved national security. The break-even analysis considered three attack scenarios involving airplane destruction and fatalities. The TSA estimated that implementing the \"secure flight\" rule would cost $3.2 billion over 10 years but highlighted benefits such as more accurate screening and improved national security. The break-even analysis considered three attack scenarios involving airplane destruction and fatalities, with potential consequences ranging from $21 billion in property damage to over $1 trillion in direct losses and hundreds of thousands of lives. The rule would need to reduce the risk of attack by more than 40% to break even for the lowest level attack, but only by 0.03% for benefits to equal costs in the most catastrophic scenario. TSA did not indicate whether the rule would prevent any of the three types of attack. On November 18, 2008, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) published a final rule requiring private aircraft pilots to transmit passenger manifest information electronically. The agency conducted a break-even analysis using different VSL estimates and attack scenarios to determine the necessary risk reduction for benefits to exceed costs. The final rule published by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) on November 18, 2008, required private aircraft pilots to transmit passenger manifest information electronically. A break-even analysis was conducted using various Value of Statistical Life (VSL) estimates and attack scenarios to determine the needed risk reduction for benefits to surpass costs. The results showed varying levels of risk reduction required based on different VSLs and casualty levels. CBP conducted a break-even analysis to determine the necessary risk reduction for benefits to exceed costs in the final rule requiring private aircraft pilots to transmit passenger manifest information. Results showed varying risk reduction levels based on different Value of Statistical Life estimates and casualty scenarios. The CBP estimated costs and benefits of a rule, with costs at $126.8 million and benefits at $15 million plus \"enhanced security\" benefits. The EPA established emission standards for nonroad spark ignition engines, estimating annual benefits in 2030 at $1.6 billion to $4.4 billion, with costs at about $190 million. EPA projected reductions in emissions would prevent premature deaths and hospitalizations. The EPA used various values of statistical life (VSL) to monetize the benefits of reducing premature mortality or morbidity in a rule issued on June 30, 2008. For example, they valued the prevention of 230 premature deaths related to particulate matter in 2030 at $1.6 billion, using a VSL of nearly $7 million. They also valued averted deaths related to ozone at about $7.5 million each, chronic bronchitis prevention at $500,000 per case, and non-fatal heart attack prevention at about $98,000 per case. EPA issued a rule on \"Control of Emissions of Air Pollution from Locomotive Engines and Marine Compression-Ignition Engines Less Than 30 Liters per Cylinder\" in 2008. By 2030, the rule was estimated to prevent up to 1,100 premature deaths per year, with health benefits valued between $9.2 billion and $11 billion. The projected costs of the rule in 2030 were estimated at $740 million. EPA did not specify the VSL used to monetize benefits, but provided estimates for various health effects. The EPA valued health benefits associated with a rule on emissions from engines in 2030. They estimated 1,100 premature deaths averted valued at $8.1 billion, 2,500 prevented heart attacks at $260 million, and 680 cases of chronic bronchitis at $340 million. In a different rule, EPA used a \"benefits transfer approach\" to monetize human health benefits. The EPA used a \"benefits transfer approach\" in a rule to estimate ozone emission reductions and monetized benefits. The expected benefits were $220 million by 2015 with annualized costs of $22 million. The agency did not specify the number of deaths expected to be avoided or assign a monetary value to them. The EPA established requirements for training renovators and firms, work practices, and recordkeeping for activities disturbing lead-based paint. Benefits included avoiding IQ loss in 1.4 million children under six, with estimated annual benefits ranging from $700 million to $1.8 billion. The EPA estimated the economic value of avoiding lost IQ points in children due to lead exposure. The value per IQ point lost was estimated at $8,346. FDA issued a rule to ensure quality of dietary supplements, estimating a reduction of 1,180 acute illnesses per year with an average value of $33,800 per illness prevented. The FDA estimated that the annual benefits from preventing acute illnesses totaled nearly $40 million, representing more than 90% of the rule's central estimate of $44 million in benefits. The baseline annual costs of the rule were estimated at about $164 million, with various assumptions made for the value of statistical life and quality-adjusted life year. Sensitivity analysis was conducted using different values, resulting in a range of estimates for health benefits. Alternative assumptions of regulatory costs were also considered. The FDA published a final rule on August 24, 2007, requiring establishments collecting blood to establish systems for identifying donations from individuals testing reactive for hepatitis C. This action aimed to ensure blood supply safety and recipient awareness of infection risks. The rule also extended record retention requirements for 10 years to facilitate treatment for recipients of infected blood. The FDA estimated that the rule would provide one-time benefits of 2,640 quality-adjusted life years with a value between $264 million to $1,228 million. They conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis, showing a cost per quality-adjusted life year of $33,200. The FDA published a final rule on April 29, 2009, requiring new warnings for certain over-the-counter drugs like acetaminophen and NSAIDs to inform consumers about the risks of liver injury and stomach bleeding. The agency estimated about 100 deaths per year from unintentional acetaminophen overdose and predicted the rule would prevent one to three of those deaths annually. The expected benefits were monetized using a VSL of $5 million, with a total estimated value of prevented illnesses and deaths ranging from $5.6 million to $16.8 million per year. The FDA estimated the benefits of a new rule on over-the-counter drugs, such as acetaminophen and NSAIDs, to range from $5.6 million to $16.8 million per year. The one-time industry cost was $32 million. Even with conservative estimates, the benefits were projected to exceed costs over a 10-year period. If the rule prevented less than one death per year, the benefits would equal costs. The FDA revised the benefits-cost comparison for a new rule on over-the-counter drugs, increasing the estimated 10-year costs to nearly $80 million. Using different value of statistical life (VSL) estimates, the agency found that annualized costs exceeded benefits with a $5 million VSL, but benefits exceeded costs with a $7 million VSL. To break even, the rule would need to prevent about two deaths each year over 10 years. The FDA published a final rule in 2009 requiring shell egg producers to prevent Salmonella Enteritidis contamination, citing it as a leading cause of foodborne illnesses. The rule aimed to prevent about two deaths and 928 to 1,058 hospitalizations annually over 10 years. The agency used various value of statistical life estimates to monetize the expected reduction in health consequences. The FDA estimated that the rule to prevent Salmonella Enteritidis contamination would cost about $1,000 per case, with annual net benefits of more than $1.4 billion. The rule aimed to prevent 79,170 SE cases per year, costing between $9,300 and $16,100 per life-year saved. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) mandated that long term care facilities install automatic sprinkler systems within five years to save lives. CMS estimated that the rule would save 33 life years annually, with potential benefits of $25 million per year and up to $500 million over 20 years. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) estimated that the rule mandating automatic sprinkler systems in long term care facilities would provide total 20-year benefits of $722.4 million to $991.4 million, with total costs estimated at between $715.0 and $806.4 million. On November 15, 2007, OSHA published a final rule stating that employers must provide personal protective equipment at no cost to employees. On February 14, 2007, OSHA issued a final rule revising the general industry electrical installation standard. The rule aimed to prevent more than 6,700 injuries and 1.7 fatalities each year, with estimated annual benefits totaling $349 million using the \"willingness to pay\" approach. The total annual cost of compliance to employers was estimated at $85.7 million. The final rule revised the general industry electrical installation standard for the first time since 1981, focusing on safety in workplace electrical equipment design and installation. OSHA estimated the rule would save between one and two lives per year, valued at $6.1 million each. The monetized benefit of avoiding these deaths was estimated to be between $6.1 million and $12.2 million. OSHA did not provide an estimate for avoided injuries, but estimated the cost of the rule for all employers at $9.6 million. The value of \"statistical lives\" saved by rules varies across federal departments and agencies. VSL estimates are used differently, such as to show net benefits, effectiveness of a rule, or to eliminate regulatory options. OMB Circular A-4 gives agencies discretion in monetizing health benefits, suggesting VSL values between $1 million and $10 million. Agencies are encouraged to provide estimates of both VSL and VSLY. The circular suggests agencies consider providing estimates of VSL and VSLY, but it is not required. Cost-effectiveness analysis should be done wherever possible, and a break-even analysis is needed when non-quantified benefits are deemed important. Government-wide requirements could ensure consistency but may limit tailoring to specific risks and populations. Circular A-4 mandates discounting future costs or benefits to present values using 3% and 7% rates. The 7% rate is considered the average before-tax rate of return. The Circular A-4 mandates discounting future costs or benefits using 3% and 7% rates, with the 7% rate representing the average before-tax rate of return to private capital in the U.S. economy. However, recent years have seen a sharp decline in rates of return, with the most recent OMB update in December 2009 placing the 30-year real interest rate at 2.7%. Agencies are advised to use a larger VSLY estimate for senior citizens, but the specific increase is not specified. The use of a larger VSLY estimate for senior citizens is recommended, but the specific increase is not specified. This lack of clarity can lead to variations in regulatory approaches between agencies. DOT and EPA have established policies for monetizing health benefits in regulatory analyses for nearly 30 years, while other departments like HHS do not have department-wide policies and sometimes refer to values used by other agencies. Some agencies do not have department-wide policies for establishing values, instead, they tend to follow policies set by other agencies. For example, FDA follows EPA policies, CMS uses VSL and life-year estimates from FDA, OSHA uses EPA's VSL for occupational illnesses, and DHS agencies reference DOT's policy for VSLs in break-even analyses. Agencies may also use a particular VSL because it was previously used by them or another agency. The agency used a $5 million VSL from a previous rule over eight years ago. Adopting earlier VSLs without adjusting for inflation can result in lower values. Using VSLs from other agencies can provide consistency in economic analyses, but applying VSLs from one policy area to another may not accurately reflect public willingness to pay. EPA's Science Advisory Board recommended determining appropriate studies before combining VSLs. In a specific policy context, VSLs ranging from $5.0 million to $8.0 million were commonly used in regulatory impact analyses, with sensitivity analyses conducted using values as low as $3 million and as high as $10 million. Differences were noted in how fatalities and injuries were valued, such as NHTSA using a VSL of $5.8 million in a rule on roof crush resistance. The Department of Transportation (DOT) used a Value of Statistical Life (VSL) of $5.8 million in a rule on roof crush resistance, with additional economic savings of $300,000. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) converted non-fatal injuries into \"fatality equivalents\" valued at $6.1 million each. There were discrepancies in how VSLs were used between agencies, with varying ages and development processes. EPA guidance had not been updated in nearly 10 years, while DOT's VSL had been revised multiple times recently. The EPA guidance recommends updating the agency's Value of Statistical Life (VSL) to reflect inflation, based on studies from 1974 to 1991. Circular A-4 warns against using inappropriate VSL estimates and occupational risk premiums to value reductions in environmental hazards. Different agencies varied in how they used VSL information, with most using it to monetize health benefits in benefit-cost analyses. The DHS and DOT agencies did not consistently use Value of Statistical Life (VSL) estimates to monetize health benefits in their rules. DHS agencies conducted break-even analyses due to lack of key data, while FMCSA did not monetize health benefits in a rule on intermodal equipment. The agencies used Value of Statistical Life (VSL) information in cost-effectiveness analyses for various rules, such as NHTSA's truck tractor air brake systems rule and roof crush resistance rule. In the FMCSA rule on hours of service for drivers, VSL information was used to eliminate a regulatory option. Another DOT agency also used VSL information in a 2009 advance notice of proposed rulemaking. NHTSA considered regulatory options for rearview mirrors to improve driver visibility and reduce accidents, but found none were cost-effective compared to a statistical life value of $6.1 million. VSL information was used in various rules, showing that changing the VSL value can impact the expected net benefits of a rule. Raising the VSL from $6.1 million to $8.7 million could change the upper-level estimate of net benefits from $6 million to $388 million. Lowering the VSL to $3.5 million could result in a net loss of about $376 million. The FDA found that benefits exceeded costs initially but later concluded that costs exceeded benefits using conservative assumptions. The size of the VSL did not always affect the outcome of rules, as seen in the FMCSA rule on new entrant safety audits. Safety audits showed positive net benefits even with the smallest Value of Statistical Life (VSL). Different agencies used varying VSL values in their rules, with some exceeding estimated costs. Agencies primarily used life-year measures to assess non-fatal injuries and illnesses in rulemaking. For example, FDA used a base estimate of $300,000 for a quality-adjusted life year in a rule on manufacturing practices for dietary supplements. The FDA used a base estimate of $300,000 for a quality-adjusted life year to estimate the average value of preventing a typical illness. Agencies also placed a monetary value on injuries by viewing them as a percentage of a death or assigning a specific average value to an injury in various rules. For example, the FRA assumed all injuries in grade crossing collisions were minor and valued each injury at $12,000, while OSHA valued injuries expected to be prevented by a rule at more than $337 million. In some rules, agencies did not estimate the number or value of injuries that could be avoided. Benefits of a rule are monetized and compared to costs to determine if it should be issued. In cases where costs exceeded benefits, agencies often cited statutory requirements for issuing the rule. In the \"positive train control systems\" rule, FRA estimated costs to be 20 times greater than benefits due to statutory constraints. Another example is the CBP rule on electronic transmission of manifests, with costs of $126 million and benefits of $15 million over 10 years. The Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 requires DHS to establish procedures for pre-departure vetting of passengers and crew on aircraft and vessels bound for the US. Some agencies issued rules with quantified net losses even when not required by the underlying statutes. For example, the FDA rule on dietary supplements had a 10-year central estimate of net loss of $120 million. The FDA justified the costs by stating that the benefits of the rule outweighed them. The agencies varied in their approach to monetizing health benefits, with some using cost-effectiveness studies and VSLs while others did not. Despite potential costs exceeding benefits, agencies cannot consider costs in determining regulation, but including such information in the rule preamble can enhance transparency. Some agencies showed variations in their use of VSLs, with differences in discounting levels and disclosure of analytic procedures. The NHTSA rule on air brake systems did not mention the VSL used for monetizing reductions in fatalities and injuries in the preamble but included it in the regulatory impact analysis. Agencies may have conducted sensitivity analyses using different VSLs but did not discuss them. The agency's final economic analyses can be found on http://www.regulations.gov."
