    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Waterfront Community Revitalization and Resiliency Act of 2015\". Congress recognizes the importance of waterfront communities for economic development, sustainable water management, and revitalization efforts. Challenges such as outdated infrastructure, industrial contamination, and lack of public access hinder waterfront development despite growing interest in revitalization. The importance of waterfront communities for economic development and revitalization efforts is recognized by Congress. Public investment in waterfront development should consider changing ecosystem conditions and extreme weather projections for resilient investments. Individual communities have unique priorities and opportunities for waterfront restoration. The Secretary of Commerce has expertise in Great Lakes and ocean coastal resiliency and economic development. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"resilient waterfront community\" is defined as a unit of local government or Indian tribe that is bound by the Great Lakes, ocean, riverfront, or inland lake, self-nominated, and designated by the Secretary based on development of an eligible resilient waterfront. The term \"resilient waterfront community\" is defined as a local government or Indian tribe bound by a body of water, designated by the Secretary based on eligibility criteria. The Secretary of Commerce determines eligibility for a resilient waterfront community plan. SEC. 4. RESILIENT WATERFRONT COMMUNITIES DESIGNATION. The Secretary designates resilient waterfront communities based on criteria in subsection (b) and collaborates with other agencies for inland lake and riverfront communities. A resilient waterfront community plan is a community-driven vision developed voluntarily to respond to local needs or new water-oriented opportunities. A resilient waterfront community plan is developed voluntarily to respond to new water-oriented opportunities, with the leadership of relevant entities and active community participation. It must consider State and Federal coastal zone management requirements, address economic strengths, and align with regional economic plans. The resilient waterfront community plan should consider the waterfront area and adjacent land, describe a vision for development, and integrate economic opportunities and community relationships with the water. The resilient waterfront community plan should address quality of life, public health, community heritage, and public access in areas undergoing ecosystem restoration. It should also consider ecosystem challenges, infrastructure needs for docks and protection against storm surges, waves, and flooding. The resilient waterfront community plan should address infrastructure needs for docks, storm surges, waves, flooding, stormwater systems, and other community facilities. It should also consider metrics for resiliency and environmental changes determined by the Secretary. The resilient waterfront community plan must be approved by the Secretary and updated by the community within a 10-year period for the Secretary's approval. The Secretary will establish a resilient waterfront communities network to share best practices. Designated communities will receive public recognition to boost tourism and investment. Additionally, the Waterfront Community Revitalization Activities will be implemented. The Secretary may use existing authority to support the development and implementation of resilient waterfront community plans. Local governments or Indian tribes bound by the Great Lakes, ocean, or riverfront may be considered as lead non-Federal partners. Planning activities for resilient waterfront communities include technical assistance for developing a plan, conducting community outreach, identifying challenges and opportunities, developing strategies, and preparing plan materials. Non-federal partners can contract with eligible partners for implementation activities. Implementation assistance may be provided to initiate the implementation of a resilient waterfront community plan and facilitate high-quality development, including leveraging local and private resources. Assistance may be provided for implementation activities such as site preparation, environmental review, engineering and design, acquiring easements or land for green infrastructure, public amenities, or development sites, updates to zoning codes, and construction of public waterfront or boating amenities and public spaces. To assist in implementation activities, a lead non-Federal partner can collaborate with various entities including nonprofit organizations, public utilities, private entities, institutions of higher education, and State governments. The lead non-Federal partner must ensure that resources received are used for waterfront community revitalization and resiliency. A resilient waterfront community must contribute non-Federal funds towards planning or implementation activities. Non-Federal funds from various sources can be provided for planning or implementation activities, including local or tribal governments, state governments, nonprofit organizations, private entities, foundations, public utilities, or regional organizations. SEC. 7. The Secretary will provide a list of resilient waterfront communities to relevant States and Federal agencies. SEC. 8. No new regulatory authority established by this Act. The Senate passed S. 1935 on July 14, 2016, requiring the Secretary of Commerce to support waterfront community revitalization and resiliency."
