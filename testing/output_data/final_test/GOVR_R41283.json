    "content": "Since the 64th Congress, 4,201 individuals have entered the House of Representatives for their first terms, along with 28 Delegates or Resident Commissioners. Additionally, 844 individuals began their first terms in the Senate. Membership is divided into two categories: Members chosen before a Congress convenes and those chosen after. The 64th Congress marked the first time Senators were elected by direct popular vote. Members in both chambers are chosen before or after a Congress convenes. Seats can be filled by special elections or electoral challenges. First-term Senators can also join through appointment or special election. Members with non-consecutive service are counted as first-term Members in their initial term between the 64th and 114th Congresses. The data combines pre-convening and post-convening first-term Members to count all Members who served a first term in the House or Senate between the 64th and 114th Congresses. Data on pre-convening first-term Members offer insight into membership turnover since 1915, while post-convening first-term Member data show no clear patterns within individual Congresses or over time. The data on first-term Members in the House and Senate does not reveal clear patterns within individual Congresses or over time due to various reasons for vacancies and circumstances of filling seats. Tables in the \"Data Tables\" section provide information on first-term membership, turnover, and partisan breakdown in both chambers. Since the 64th Congress, the average turnover in the House with each election has been 72 seats, or 16.57%. The election with the greatest change occurred in 1932, resulting in a turnover of 158 seats, or 36.32% of the Representatives. The smallest pre-convening turnover among Representatives in the House occurred in the 101st Congress, with a change in 30 seats, or 6.90%. Figure 1 provides a graphic representation of the percentage. The data shows a decline in the number of new, first-term Representatives in the House over time. There is no consistent pattern of change from Congress to Congress, but overall, the turnover rate has decreased. The tables provide data on the Congresses with the greatest and least change in pre-convening Representatives between the 64th and 114th Congresses. The smallest pre-convening turnover among Representatives in the House occurred in the 101st Congress (1989-1990), with a change in 30 seats, or 6.90%. The distribution of greater changes occurring earlier in the period between the 64th-114th Congresses, and smaller changes happening in the later period may also support contentions regarding the duration of Representatives' careers. Data describing the number and partisan distribution of first-term Representatives are provided in Table 7. The 79th Congress had the highest turnover in Senate membership, with 33 new Senators taking seats. Data shows a decline in the number of pre-convening, first-term Senators since the 64th Congress. Changes in Member career patterns may explain this trend. The 102nd Congress had the smallest turnover of pre-convening Senators. In the 102nd Congress, there was a small turnover of three seats among pre-convening Senators. Data from seven Congresses between the 64th and 114th show that smaller changes were more evenly distributed in the latter half. This could be due to electoral patterns, as only one-third of Senate seats are up for election every two years."
