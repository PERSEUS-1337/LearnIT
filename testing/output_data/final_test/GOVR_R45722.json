    "content": "This report provides information on the overtime provisions in the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) for executive, administrative, and professional employees. It includes an overview of the FLSA, defining the EAP exemptions, applicability of the exemptions, and details on the 2019 proposed rule and the 2016 final rule. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), enacted in 1938, establishes minimum wage and overtime pay requirements for most private and public sector employees. Section 7(a) of the FLSA specifies that nonexempt employees must receive pay at one-and-a-half times their regular rate for hours worked over 40 in a workweek. The FLSA provides exemptions for executive, administrative, and professional employees, with the Secretary of Labor authorized to define these terms through regulations. The Secretary of Labor is authorized to define and delimit the exemptions for executive, administrative, and professional employees under the FLSA. The rationale for including the exemptions was the difficulty in standardizing the work of these employees and their additional compensation benefits. The DOL has finalized nine rules on EAP exemptions since 1938. Employees must meet certain criteria to qualify for an exemption from overtime pay under Section 13(a)(1) of the FLSA. To qualify for the EAP exemption from overtime pay under Section 13(a)(1) of the FLSA, an employee must meet three criteria: 1. The \"salary basis\" test: must be paid a fixed salary. 2. The \"duties\" test: must perform executive, administrative, or professional duties. 3. The \"salary level\" test: must be paid above a set threshold on a weekly basis. Job titles alone do not determine exemption status, as duties specified by the Secretary of Labor are crucial. The EAP exemption from overtime pay under the FLSA requires employees to meet specific duties tests. For executive employees, duties include managing the enterprise, directing two or more employees, and having authority over hiring or firing. For administrative employees, duties involve office or non-manual work related to business operations. To qualify for the exemption for professional employees, the job duties must involve work requiring advanced knowledge in a field of science or learning, or work involving invention, imagination, originality, or talent in a recognized artistic or creative field. Additionally, the employee must earn above a certain salary to qualify for the EAP exemption. The standard salary level thresholds have been raised nine times since the FLSA was enacted in 1938. In 1938, the standard salary level thresholds have been raised nine times. Prior to 2004, the salary level for exemption varied by the type of employee and duty test. In 2004, DOL created a \"highly compensated employee\" (HCE) exemption for employees earning above the standard EAP salary threshold annually. Independent contractors are not covered by FLSA provisions. Nonprofits do not have a general exemption in FLSA or EAP overtime regulations. Coverage for nonprofit workers is determined by enterprise and individual coverage tests. Charitable activities associated with nonprofits do not count as ordinary commercial activities. Nonprofits' commercial activities count towards enterprise coverage under the FLSA. Individual employees in exempt nonprofits may still be covered if they engage in interstate commerce. Both FLSA and EAP overtime regulations apply to institutions of higher education. Many personnel at IHEs may not be eligible for overtime based on duties alone. Some workers at institutions of higher education may be affected by changes in the EAP salary level for exemption from overtime pay. Public IHEs have the option to use compensatory time instead of cash payment for overtime compensation. State employees are not blanket exempt from FLSA and overtime rule coverage. State and local government employees are generally covered by FLSA overtime provisions, including updates to the salary threshold for EAP exemptions. Public sector workers may have the option to use compensatory time instead of cash payment for overtime. Certain state and local employees, like elected officials, may not be covered by FLSA regulations. Certain state and local government employees, such as elected officials and their staff not subject to civil service laws, are not covered by the FLSA. Fire protection and law enforcement employees may have exemptions from overtime requirements based on agency size. Overtime for these employees can be calculated on a \"work period\" basis. The FLSA overtime provisions also apply to employees in U.S. territories. The FLSA overtime provisions apply to employees in U.S. territories, including American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The exemption for American Samoa is traditionally set at 84% of the standard salary level, while the other territories follow the standard level. The application of FLSA provisions in territories is determined by the Congressional Accountability Act (CAA), which extends some FLSA provisions, including overtime, to congressional employees. The CAA created the Office of Compliance to enforce these laws. Rulemaking on EAP exemptions would apply to congressional staff if approved by the Board and Congress. The Board's regulations must be approved by Congress to have legal effect. The 2004 overtime regulations have not been approved, so the 1996 regulations still apply to congressional staff. Congress can pass legislation to repeal or compel new rules. The status quo will remain until new rules are approved. The proposed regulations aimed to prevent the Secretary of Labor from enforcing a final rule and required additional analysis before issuing a similar rule in the future. Employers would have options such as paying overtime to newly covered employees, increasing pay for workers near the salary threshold, reducing work hours, hiring additional workers, or reducing base pay to comply with the regulations. The 2019 proposed rule on EAP exemptions aimed to address the reduction in hours for nonexempt employees by hiring more workers or adjusting base pay to maintain previous employer costs. The 2016 final rule on EAP exemptions was blocked by a preliminary injunction in 2016 and invalidated in 2017 for setting the salary threshold too high. The 2016 final rule on EAP exemptions, with a salary level of $913 per week, was invalidated. The DOJ appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which put the appeal on hold until DOL issued new rulemaking. Currently, DOL enforces the EAP regulations from November 30, 2016, with a standard salary level of $455 per week. A request for information was issued in 2017, and a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking was published in 2019 to revise the EAP exemptions and rescind the 2016 final rule. The 2019 rule would revert EAP regulations to the 2004 final rule if invalidated. DOL enforces the 2004 rule due to the invalidation of the 2016 rule. Changes in the 2019 proposed rule include salary level increases and adjustments for different regions. The proposed 2019 rule includes salary level increases for employees in various regions, with the base rate weekly salary level for employees in the motion picture industry increasing from $695 to $1,036 per week. The salary level threshold has been increased eight times since the enactment of the FLSA in 1938, with adjustments made through intermittent rulemaking by the Secretary of Labor. The 2020 final rule sets the standard salary level threshold for EAP exemptions at the 20th percentile of weekly earnings of full-time non-hourly workers in the South region or retail sector, estimated at $35,308 annually. The HCE salary level is set at the 90th percentile of weekly earnings of full-time non-hourly workers nationally, estimated at $147,414 per year. The 2020 final rule establishes salary thresholds for EAP exemptions, with full-time non-hourly workers in certain territories earning $455 per week, except for American Samoa at $380 per week. The motion picture industry employee salary level for the EAP exemption is set at $1,036 per week, continuing a special salary test created in 1953. The 2019 proposed rule aims to update the EAP salary level thresholds every four years based on data from the CPS. If finalized, the first update would be in 2023, with subsequent updates every four years. The standard salary level would be set at the 20th percentile of weekly earnings in the lowest-wage Census region, while the HCE salary level threshold would be at the 90th percentile of annual earnings for full-time non-hourly workers. The 2019 proposed rule would adjust the salary level for EAP employees to the 90th percentile of annual earnings for full-time non-hourly workers nationally. This change would likely make EAP employees earning between $455 and $679 per week nonexempt, entitling them to overtime pay for hours worked over 40 per week. The impact on the number of exempt employees is uncertain due to potential employer responses such as increasing salaries to maintain exemption. The 2019 proposed rule aims to increase the salary threshold for EAP employees, potentially affecting around 4.9 million workers. Approximately 1.3 million EAP employees could become eligible for overtime pay in the first year under the new provisions. This includes employees who meet the duties test for exemption but earn between the current and proposed salary thresholds, as well as those who meet the HCE duties test but not the standard test. The 2019 proposed rule aims to increase the salary threshold for EAP employees from $100,000 to $147,414 per year. This change would impact around 4.9 million workers, with 3.6 million gaining strengthened overtime protections. This includes 2.0 million white collar workers and 1.6 million salaried workers in blue-collar occupations who would benefit from clearer overtime coverage. The 2019 proposed rule aims to increase the salary threshold for EAP employees to $147,414 per year, impacting around 4.9 million workers. This includes 3.6 million gaining strengthened overtime protections, with 2.0 million white-collar workers and 1.6 million salaried workers in blue-collar occupations benefiting from clearer overtime coverage. The 2016 final rule would have affected approximately 13.1 million workers, with 4.2 million EAP employees newly entitled to overtime pay and 8.9 million receiving strengthened overtime protections."
