    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Comprehensive Methamphetamine Response Act\". It addresses high intensity methamphetamine abuse and trafficking areas. The Director may designate a State or portion as a high intensity methamphetamine abuse and trafficking area (HIMATA) and provide funding. The designation process involves receiving a petition from a Governor and making a determination based on the methamphetamine epidemic severity index. Priority is given to HIDTAs. The Director may designate a State or portion as a high intensity methamphetamine abuse and trafficking area (HIMATA) based on a methamphetamine epidemic severity index. The index considers per capita rates of arrests for methamphetamine possession, production, and lab seizures in an area. The Director may provide funding to a State for a HIMATA based on a comprehensive methamphetamine response plan meeting specified requirements. Funding level is determined by population and methamphetamine epidemic severity index, with a 10% increase for States. The Director may provide funding to a State for a High Intensity Methamphetamine Trafficking Area (HIMATA) based on effective precursor control laws. Specific funding requirements include 5% for prevention efforts, 25% for treating addiction, and the rest for law enforcement priorities. Funding is provided annually for five years, with a review for extension after that period. The Director requires States with designated High Intensity Methamphetamine Trafficking Areas (HIMATAs) to develop a Comprehensive Methamphetamine Response Plan (CMRP) within six months. The plan must address inadequacies in enforcement, treatment, prevention, and precursor controls using funding provided under the Act. In the Act, HIMATA and HIDTA programs must cooperate and coordinate efforts, resources, and merge resources. Definitions include Director, HIMATA, HIDTA, and CMRP. Authorization is granted to appropriate $1,000,000,000 annually for the methamphetamine response plan developed under this Act."
