They should play a role in disseminating and implementing clean technologies in developing countries and be supported through the fund mentioned. SEC. 1308. USE OF GREENHOUSE GAS ACCOUNTING BY THE MULTILATERAL DEVELOPMENT BANKS.

This includes calculating carbon flows, using uniform techniques, disclosing calculations, setting a carbon charge rate, and conducting GHG accounting. The Secretary of the Treasury mandates multilateral development banks to implement GHG accounting for project funding, which involves calculating carbon flows and applying a carbon charge rate."
