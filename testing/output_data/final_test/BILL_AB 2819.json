    "content": "The people of California enact the following. The Legislature of California declares the policy of promoting open access to public records, especially court records, with limited restrictions only under compelling circumstances. Currently, civil case records in unlawful detainer proceedings are restricted from public access for 60 days after filing, and permanently unavailable if the defendant prevails within that period. The state of California is facing a housing crisis due to a shortage of affordable housing for low-income tenants. Median monthly rents are 50% higher than the national average, leading to low-income households spending 67% of their income on housing. The recent economic and foreclosure crises have worsened the challenges in securing affordable housing. The existing law governing access to civil case records in unlawful detainer proceedings exacerbates the difficulty of securing affordable housing in competitive rental markets. Tenant screening companies and credit reporting agencies can publish personal information of tenants sued for unlawful detainer, which remains publicly available for up to seven years. This information cannot be challenged under consumer credit reporting laws. Many innocent tenants face negative credit reporting due to delays in resolving their unlawful detainer cases, leading to difficulties in securing rental housing. Landlords often rely on unlawful detainer registries and credit reports, resulting in tenants being unfairly denied housing opportunities for up to seven years. Due to a housing shortage, tenants may be denied rental opportunities for up to seven years. This act aims to balance open access to public records with protecting innocent tenants' credit and reputation. It also ensures landlords have timely and accurate information on prospective tenants. The legislation addresses the affordable housing crisis by making civil case records in unlawful detainer proceedings unavailable to the public if the plaintiff does not prevail within 60 days of filing. Section 1161.2 of the Code of Civil Procedure is amended to restrict access to limited civil case records, allowing access only to parties, residents of the premises, and by court order showing good cause or after judgment is entered for the plaintiff. Access to court records in a limited civil case is restricted to parties, residents of the premises, and by court order showing good cause or after judgment is entered for the plaintiff. In cases involving residential property, access may be granted to any other person 60 days after the complaint has been filed if the plaintiff prevails within that time frame. The court may issue an order restricting access to court records in a limited civil case if parties agree. \"Good cause\" includes gathering newsworthy facts or evidence for an unlawful detainer action. The Legislature intends to establish a simple procedure for requesting an ex parte order. Upon filing a restricted case, the court clerk must notify each defendant named in the action by mail. The notice will state that an unlawful detainer complaint has been filed against them and that access to the court file will be delayed for 60 days, except for parties, attorneys, or individuals who provide specific information. Access to court records will be restricted during this period. The court clerk must notify defendants by mail that access to court records will be restricted for 60 days after filing a restricted case, except for parties, attorneys, or individuals with specific authorization. The court clerk must provide contact information for the county bar association, certified lawyer referral services, and a required statement in the notice to parties involved in a restricted case. To find a certified lawyer referral service in California, visit the State Bar's website at www.calbar.ca.gov or call 1-866-442-2529. The court requires the inclusion of contact information for legal services for low-income individuals in the county where the action is filed. A fee of $15 is charged for filing a first appearance by the plaintiff in addition to the standard filing fee. Section 4 adds a new provision to the Code of Civil Procedure, stating that if proof of service of the summons is not filed within 60 days of the complaint, the court may dismiss the action without prejudice."
