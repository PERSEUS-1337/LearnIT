    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act\". It includes findings related to telemarketing and consumer fraud. The Congress finds that telemarketing fraud is a significant issue, with consumers losing an estimated $40 billion annually. Legislation is needed to protect consumers from deception and abuse in telemarketing. The Commission is required to create rules to prohibit deceptive and abusive telemarketing practices, including defining deceptive acts and practices and restricting unsolicited calls considered coercive or abusive. The Commission is mandated to establish rules to regulate telemarketing practices, including restrictions on unsolicited calls, disclosure requirements for sales calls, and consideration of recordkeeping. Enforcement of these rules is also specified. The Securities and Exchange Commission must enforce rules similar to those established by the Federal Trade Commission to prohibit deceptive telemarketing practices within 6 months. The Securities and Exchange Commission is not required to create a rule for deceptive telemarketing if existing federal securities laws or SEC rules already provide similar protection, or if a new rule is deemed unnecessary for public interest, investor protection, or market fairness. The Securities and Exchange Commission may publish its determination with reasons if exceptions apply to orderly markets. Rules apply to various entities and individuals associated with them. The Securities and Exchange Commission may publish its determination with reasons if exceptions apply to orderly markets. Rules apply to entities like securities dealers, investment advisers, and investment companies, with specific definitions provided for terms like \"broker\" and \"investment adviser.\" The Commodity Futures Trading Commission rules do not apply to certain persons under the Commodity Exchange Act. Amendments to the Act include a new subsection regarding the effective date of rules promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission shall promulgate rules to prohibit deceptive telemarketing practices by persons registered under the Act, unless existing rules provide similar protection. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission will establish rules to prevent deceptive telemarketing practices by registered individuals, unless existing rules offer comparable protection. If the Commission decides that an exception applies, it must publish its determination in the Federal Register with the rationale. SEC. 4. ACTIONS BY STATES. Whenever an attorney general of a State believes residents are affected by telemarketing violations, the State can bring a civil action in federal court to stop the violations, enforce compliance with rules, seek damages, restitution, or other relief. The State must notify the Commission before taking legal action. The State must provide the Commission with a copy of its complaint before taking legal action, or serve immediate notice if not feasible. The Commission has the right to intervene, be heard on all matters, and file petitions for appeal in civil actions. Attorneys general can conduct investigations and compel evidence for civil actions. The Commission can also bring civil actions for rule violations. During a civil action instituted by the Commission for rule violations, no State can initiate a separate civil action against the defendant named in the complaint. The venue for civil actions in a district court can be where the defendant is located, resides, conducts business, or where proper under the law. Authorized State officials are not prohibited from pursuing legal action in State court. Authorized State officials, in addition to the attorney general, can bring actions in State court on behalf of residents, despite the Commission's civil action against a defendant. SEC. 5. ACTIONS BY PRIVATE PERSONS. Any person affected by telemarketing violations can bring a civil action within 3 years of discovery. The action can seek damages, compliance enforcement, or injunction relief. Prior notice to the Commission is required. The Commission must be notified before taking action, with exceptions for cases where immediate action is necessary. The Commission has the right to intervene, be heard on all matters, and file petitions for appeal. During a Commission-initiated civil action, no other civil action can be brought against the defendant named in the complaint. The court may award costs of suit in any final order issued under this section. The prevailing party in a civil action under subsection (a) may be awarded costs of suit, attorney fees, and expert witness fees. The section does not limit any rights under other laws. Venue and service of process for such actions in a U.S. district court are determined by the defendant's location or business activities. SEC. 6. ADMINISTRATION AND APPLICABILITY OF ACT. The Act will be enforced by the Commission under the Federal Trade Commission Act. The Commission will prevent violations of its rules in the same manner as the Federal Trade Commission Act. Penalties and privileges for violations will be the same as under the Federal Trade Commission Act. The Act will be enforced by the Commission with the same means, jurisdiction, power, and duties as the Federal Trade Commission Act. This Act does not limit the Commission's authority under any other law. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms such as \"attorney general,\" \"Commission,\" \"State,\" and \"telemarketing,\" specifying that telemarketing involves using telephones to induce purchases and excludes sales through mailed catalogs. The Act defines telemarketing as using telephones to induce purchases, excluding sales through mailed catalogs. Catalogs must include written material or illustrations, be issued at least once a year, and orders must be taken without further solicitation during customer-initiated calls. SEC. 8 amends the Federal Trade Commission Act to include \"services\" in false advertising regulations. SEC. 9 addresses enforcement of orders. The Federal Trade Commission has the authority to bring criminal contempt actions for violations of its orders under section 13(b) of the FTC Act. These actions can only be initiated after the Attorney General appoints a special assistant US Attorney. The appointment can be requested by the FTC, the court, or initiated by the Attorney General. The Attorney General must respond to requests within 45 days. The FTC's authority to bring criminal contempt actions expires 2 years after the first rules are established, but ongoing actions are unaffected. SEC. 10. REVIEW. After 5 years from the initial rules, the Commission will review the Act's impact on deceptive telemarketing practices and report to Congress."
