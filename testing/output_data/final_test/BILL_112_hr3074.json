    "content": "The \"Cormorant Management and Natural Resources Protection Act\" aims to address the negative impacts of excessive cormorant populations on ecosystems, public health, safety, and fish populations. The Act recognizes that the current permitting system is inadequate in controlling cormorant populations and highlights the displacement of native species and damage to vegetation caused by cormorant colonies. The \"Cormorant Management and Natural Resources Protection Act\" delegates authority to states under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act specifically for cormorants. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act is amended to delegate authority to states for cormorants, with approval of a management plan by the governor. The Secretary must approve a management plan submitted by the governor within 60 days if it complies with US obligations. If the plan is disapproved, the Secretary must provide reasons for the decision and allow for revisions to be resubmitted. If no decision is made, the plan is deemed approved. The Secretary must approve a management plan within 60 days if it complies with US obligations. If disapproved, reasons must be provided for revisions to be resubmitted. Failure to act results in deemed approval. Management plans violating US obligations or laws cannot be approved. Plans are reviewed every 5 years, with the Secretary having the authority to revoke approval based on the review. The Secretary must approve a management plan within 60 days if it complies with US obligations. Plans violating US obligations or laws cannot be approved. A management plan approved for a State shall apply in that State with respect to cormorant management, in lieu of regulations issued under this Act. The governor of a State must comply with this Act and all treaties implemented by this Act when exercising delegated authority. Nothing in this section affects other authorities. The Secretary can assist a State with cormorant control upon request by the governor. The term 'cormorant' refers to the double-crested cormorant. The Secretary of the Interior will work with relevant agencies to educate aquaculture facility owners on preventing cormorant proliferation. Facilities are urged to prevent cormorants from consuming aquatic species in aquaculture facilities to control their proliferation. Other wildlife agencies can also cooperate with aquaculture owners for cormorant management. The term \"cormorant\" specifically refers to the double-crested cormorant."
