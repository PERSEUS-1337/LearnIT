    "content": "This report explores the implications of the ongoing debate on global climate change for agriculture. Governmental activities include the EPA's initiative to address greenhouse gas emissions, USDA conservation programs, and laws promoting biofuels. Private sector concerns, such as investing in drought-tolerant seed technology, also impact agriculture. Agriculture plays a multifaceted role in the climate change debate, acting as both a source of greenhouse gases and a carbon sink. It accounts for approximately 7% of U.S. emissions, with implications of land use changes on emissions not well understood. Emissions/sequestration in agriculture are dynamic and can be manipulated to some degree. Comprehensive climate change legislation was passed during the 111th Congress. During the 111th Congress, comprehensive climate change legislation was passed in the House and reported by a Senate committee, but not enacted. The Administration took steps to address climate change through research, EPA's clean air initiative, and USDA's promotion of conservation practices. Agriculture was largely excluded from regulatory requirements in climate change bills, and Congress excluded agriculture from certain EPA regulatory requirements in a funding bill. This report contextualizes federal agricultural policymaking in the climate change debate, focusing on agricultural activities that contribute to emissions from cropland and livestock production. Agricultural activities contribute to emissions and sequestration of GHGs through cropland and livestock production. Animal agriculture directly emits GHGs through processes like digestion and manure management. Non-livestock sources in agriculture also emit GHGs, including rice cultivation and field burning of residues. Land can act as both a source and sink for GHGs, storing carbon dioxide through photosynthesis. Agricultural activities contribute to emissions and sequestration of GHGs through various practices like soil conservation, manure management, and land retirement. In 2008, agriculture was responsible for 6.9% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, with methane and nitrous oxides being the dominant gases. Agriculture also acted as a sink, sequestering 5.4% of total GHG emissions in the United States. Millions of tons of carbon dioxide are emitted annually from anthropogenic sources and natural processes. In 2008, agriculture contributed 6.9% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, with CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and soil activities. Agriculture soils sequester more carbon than they emit, with soil carbon sequestration largely due to cropland conversion. Soil carbon sequestration in agriculture is mainly due to cropland conversion, conservation tillage practices, and organic fertilizer use. EPA reports show carbon sequestration in cropland and grassland, but emissions from land converted to cropland. Farm lands contribute over 5% of total sequestration and less than 1% of total GHG emissions in the US. There is ongoing debate about the permanence of carbon sequestration practices, which depends on factors like location, climate, and land condition. Reforestation and forestry activities can lead to long-term emission reduction, while cropping practices may or may not be long term depending on various factors. Agricultural sources emit CH4 and N2O, with livestock production being a major contributor. In the US, one-third of CH4 emissions come from livestock. Nitrous oxides are formed through crop fertilization practices. In 2008, total agricultural sector GHG emissions of CH4 and N2O were 427.5 MMTCO2e. Livestock sources, particularly cattle, contribute significantly to CH4 emissions in the US. Over 90% of N2O emissions in the agricultural sector come from soil management practices. In 2008, agricultural emissions of CH4 and N2O totaled 427.5 MMTCO2e, accounting for 48% of total US emissions of both gases. Livestock, particularly beef and dairy cattle, contribute to methane emissions in the US. Factors such as animal size, feed quality, and manure management affect methane production. Methane is produced from liquid-based livestock manure decomposition in storage facilities like lagoons, ponds, tanks, or pits. Temperature, moisture, and storage time influence bacteria growth responsible for methane formation. Higher energy content in animal feed increases methane potential. Solid manure handling on lands produces minimal methane emissions. The shift towards liquid manure management systems in the dairy industry has led to increased methane emissions. Between 1990 and 2008, methane emissions from manure management increased annually. Swine and dairy cow manure saw significant increases in emissions. Rice cultivation and field burning of agricultural residues also contribute to methane emissions, but to a lesser extent. Field burning of agricultural residues contributes to CH4 emissions, accounting for 1.5% of all CH4 emissions in the U.S. Crop residue burning also produces small amounts of CH4 and N2O. This practice is used for disposing of about 3% of crop residues in the United States. Nitrous oxide emissions mainly come from agricultural soil management practices, accounting for nearly 68% of U.S. N2O emissions. In the United States, agricultural activities contribute to the majority of N2O emissions, accounting for nearly 68% in 2008. Factors such as weather patterns, fertilizer use, and crop type influence the fluctuations in emissions. Practices like fertilization, manure application, and growing nitrogen-fixing crops increase soil mineral nitrogen, leading to higher N2O emissions. Croplands in the Corn Belt states and grasslands in central and western states have high direct N2O emissions due to intensive farming and cattle grazing. A high proportion of land in the United States is used for cattle grazing, leading to emissions from grazing animals and crop residues. Indirect emissions from agricultural soil management activities, such as nitrogen volatilization and runoff into streams and lakes, account for about 25% of emissions. These indirect emissions occur in the same regions as direct emissions, like the central and western United States. Livestock manure management activities also contribute to N2O and CH4 emissions. Indirect emissions from agricultural soil management activities, such as nitrogen volatilization and runoff, contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. While direct and indirect emissions of N2O have remained steady since 1990, there are uncertainties in emission estimates, especially for smaller contributors like the agriculture sector. EPA's Greenhouse Gas Inventory shows the uncertainty in data on agriculture's emissions. The EPA's Greenhouse Gas Inventory shows uncertainties in emission estimates for agricultural sources. For CH4 emissions from enteric fermentation, the uncertainties range from -11% to +18%. However, for N2O emissions from soil management, the uncertainties are greater, with direct emissions having a range of -24% to +63% and indirect emissions having a range of -48% to +142% due to lack of data and uncertainties in crop and fertilizer application. The report highlights uncertainties in emission estimates for agricultural sources, with a wide range of -48% to +142%. The role of agriculture in policy debates on GHG emissions and climate change is not crucial, as it is a smaller source compared to electricity generation and transportation. Three policy tracks could define agriculture's role: regulation to mitigate emissions, promoting practices to diminish emissions, or a combination of both. Efforts have been made to address GHGs and climate change through policies and legislation, with agriculture being a major part of discussions but largely excluded from regulatory proposals. The EPA's actions on GHG emissions have drawn stakeholders' attention, including an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in 2008. The Supreme Court ruling in Massachusetts v. EPA authorized the EPA to regulate emissions from new motor vehicles based on their climate change impacts. The EPA Administrator must determine if GHG emissions from vehicles endanger public health or welfare. The EPA's Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking discussed various CAA authorities to address climate change but did not propose specific actions or mention agricultural sources. In December 2009, EPA Administrator Jackson signed two endangerment findings about GHGs, stating that current and projected concentrations of six GHGs threaten public health and welfare. GHG emissions from motor vehicles were also found to contribute to atmospheric pollution. The Administrator's endangerment finding on GHG emissions from motor vehicles contributes to climate change threat. It is a prerequisite for finalizing proposed greenhouse gas emission standards for light-duty vehicles, triggering CAA requirements for stationary sources emitting the six GHGs covered. EPA's proposed rule for light-duty vehicles is expected to take effect in January 2011. EPA issued the GHG Tailoring Rule on May 13, 2010, setting thresholds for GHG emissions to determine when Title V and NSR permits are needed. The rule established a threshold of 100,000 tons per year of CO2 equivalent of GHG emissions to limit the number of facilities requiring permits. This rule covers 67% of the nation's largest stationary source GHG emitters while exempting small businesses and agriculture operations. Livestock and production agriculture operations are not expected to be subject to CAA permitting due to the high threshold in the rule. The Tailoring Rule, issued by the EPA in 2010, sets thresholds for GHG emissions to determine when permits are needed. It exempts agriculture operations due to the high threshold, but applies to emissions from internal combustion diesel engine generators. Another EPA action in 2009 proposed reporting requirements for facilities emitting GHGs and suppliers of fossil fuels in response to a congressional directive. The EPA proposed a rule to report emissions of CO2 and other GHGs from major U.S. sources, including manure management systems. Less than 50 beef cattle, dairy cattle, and swine operations would be affected, along with some poultry operations. Agriculture stakeholders criticized the proposal, arguing that manure management systems contribute less than 1% of total U.S. GHGs. The EPA proposed a rule to report emissions of CO2 and other GHGs from major U.S. sources, including manure management systems. The final rule, signed on September 22, 2009, did not include reporting by other agriculture categories due to the lack of accurate measurement methods and costly burden of compliance. The final reporting rule, signed on September 22, 2009, applies to manure management facilities with a reporting threshold of 25,000 metric tpy of CO2 equivalent of GHGs. EPA removed manure sampling requirements and will allow facilities to use default values for estimating emissions. Approximately 107 livestock facilities will be subject to the reporting rule, with population threshold levels set to exclude 99% of beef feedlots, dairy farms, and other operations with manure management systems. Reporting will begin annually in January 2011. In response to concerns raised by EPA's ANPR in July 2008, the 111th Congress introduced legislation to exempt agriculture from potential regulation of GHG emissions. The legislation aimed to prevent CAA permits for GHG emissions from agriculture, with bills S. 527 and H.R. 1426 amending the Clean Air Act to prohibit Title V permits for controlling carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide, water vapor, or methane emissions. In response to concerns raised by EPA's ANPR in July 2008, the 111th Congress introduced legislation to exempt agriculture from potential regulation of GHG emissions. Bills S. 527 and H.R. 1426 aimed to prevent CAA permits for controlling carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide, water vapor, or methane emissions resulting from biological processes associated with livestock production. Additionally, Congress included provisions in the FY2010 appropriations bill to block EPA from requiring CAA Title V permits for GHG emissions from livestock production and mandatory reporting of GHG emissions from manure management operations. The 111th Congress debated climate change bills, including the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 (H.R. 2454), which aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through a cap-and-trade system. Agriculture was a key focus, with negotiated changes to address concerns from agriculture interests. EPA's mandatory reporting rule excluded reporting by 99% of farms with manure management systems, while P.L. 111-88 addressed the remaining 1% of operations. The legislation H.R. 2454 aimed to reduce GHG emissions from covered entities, excluding small businesses emitting less than 25,000 tons of CO2 per year. Animal agriculture sources were not considered covered entities, exempting them from the bill's provisions. The \"Peterson Amendment\" allowed certain agricultural and forestry activities to participate in a carbon offset program. The legislation H.R. 2454 aimed to reduce GHG emissions from covered entities, excluding small businesses emitting less than 25,000 tons of CO2 per year. The \"Peterson Amendment\" allowed agricultural and forestry activities to participate in a carbon offset program under USDA, enabling them to earn income for measurable and verifiable emission reductions. Comprehensive climate change legislation was reported from the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee in February 2010. The Clean Energy Partnerships Act of 2009 (S. 2729) introduced by Senator Stabenow expanded agricultural and forestry carbon offset provisions in climate bills like S. 1733. It aimed to benefit U.S. farmers and landowners by allowing GHG emissions reduction through conservation and land management practices. Conservation practices on farms can help reduce agricultural greenhouse gas emissions. These practices vary in effectiveness, cost, and complexity depending on factors like farm type and size. Some practices, such as reduced tillage and prescribed grazing, can mitigate emissions. While conservation practices have traditionally focused on soil and water quality, recent studies show they can also reduce GHG emissions from agriculture. Selected practices that can help reduce emissions are listed in Table 2. Conservation practices on farms can help reduce agricultural greenhouse gas emissions, with a focus on croplands and livestock. Various practices like nutrient management, tillage operations, field management, precision agriculture, manure management, and dietary management can influence decreasing emissions. Different conservation practices may be needed based on the agricultural source of emissions, with strategies differing for cropland and livestock. Some practices may decrease one greenhouse gas while increasing others, requiring a combination of practices for significant emission reductions. Cropland GHG emissions are reduced through land management practices, while livestock emissions can come from dispersed or point sources. A mix of feed, nonstructural, and structural practices can help reduce livestock emissions. Conservation practices also offer carbon sequestration benefits, with wetland restoration being a prime example. Current federal policies are voluntary and offer incentives for reducing GHG emissions, but strategies to reduce CH4 and N2O emissions at the farm level are not mandated. Financial and monitoring challenges have hindered large-scale adoption of certain practices and technologies, such as anaerobic digestion systems for methane capture and nutrient management efforts for N2O emissions from corn fields. Efficient application of fertilizer and conservation tillage can reduce GHG emissions from corn fields, but costs of adopting technologies may be prohibitive. Quantifying, monitoring, and verifying emission reductions make it challenging to include agricultural activities in GHG reduction programs. Existing federal and state conservation programs encourage practices that reduce emissions and sequester carbon, but few specifically address GHG concerns in agriculture and forestry sectors. USDA and some states are focusing on reducing emissions and storing carbon in agriculture and forestry through existing conservation, forestry, energy, and research programs. These programs encourage farmers to adopt certain practices with financial incentives and technical support. Participation is voluntary, and the effectiveness depends on maintenance and duration of the practices. The programs aim to make site-specific improvements based on conservation plans. USDA programs offer financial and technical assistance for on-farm practices to reduce agriculture's GHG emissions. Conservation plans are essential for participation in these programs, which aim to improve land through land retirement/easement or working lands programs. Technical assistance is provided for implementation, along with cost-share contracts for producers. USDA programs provide financial and technical assistance to reduce agriculture's GHG emissions through conservation practices. These programs, outlined in the 2008 farm bill, encourage emission reductions and carbon sequestration. Working lands programs like EQIP and CSP promote practices such as anaerobic digestion and nutrient management to prioritize GHG reduction. USDA programs focus on reducing agriculture's GHG emissions through various cropland practices, such as installing shelter belts, conservation tillage, and biomass energy projects. These programs prioritize emission reductions and carbon sequestration, with some offering only technical assistance to producers. USDA has modified scoring criteria for the Conservation Reserve Program to emphasize vegetative covers that sequester carbon and has initiatives to plant bottomland hardwoods for carbon sequestration. The Conservation Technical Assistance (CTA) program prioritizes reducing GHG emissions and supports conservation practices through financial assistance and planning requirements. Compliance programs like conservation compliance, sodbuster, and swampbuster also include land management components that can benefit GHG reduction efforts. Technical assistance programs, similar to financial assistance programs, are voluntary and were initially established for other purposes. The USDA offers financial and technical assistance for conservation practices that reduce GHG emissions. Conservation programs implemented by USDA could potentially mitigate over 81 MMTCO2e of GHG by 2020. The 2008 farm bill included a provision to facilitate farmers' participation in carbon and emissions trading markets. The 2008 farm bill directed USDA to establish guidelines for carbon and emissions trading markets, aiming to address measurement issues and expand conservation programs for farmers and ranchers to reduce emissions and adopt energy efficiency measures. The USDA is working on developing guidelines and methods to assess environmental benefits for promoting markets for ecosystem services, including carbon trading to combat climate change. A public advisory committee has been set up to advise the board, and the USDA has established an Office of Ecosystem Services and Markets to provide assistance in creating and expanding markets for ecosystem services in farming and forestry sectors. Additionally, farm bill programs aim to encourage renewable energy projects and activities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The 2008 farm bill includes provisions to support renewable energy projects, such as the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) which provides funding for energy audits, renewable energy development, and anaerobic digesters in the livestock sector. Limited information is available on the number of digesters installed through REAP. The 2008 farm bill funded approximately $26 million for anaerobic digesters, leveraging $123 million in private investment. Over 90 digesters have been funded, with 19 operational, 6 near completion, and 66 under development. Renewable energy funding is also available through federal programs like the Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) for renewable energy feedstocks. BCAP incentivizes the conversion to dedicated energy crops to mitigate GHG emissions, but concerns remain about the impact on biodiversity and wildlife habitat. Title VII of the farm bill supports research on renewable fuels, feedstocks, and energy efficiency. The economic stakes in debates on human-induced climate change are high, with costs of controls and inaction estimated in trillions of dollars. Political dynamics in Congress have shifted after the 2010 elections, with comprehensive approaches to climate change not a priority. Agriculture's role in these discussions is of interest. Agricultural activities contributed significantly to methane and nitrous oxide emissions in the United States in 2008. Livestock-related categories accounted for a large portion of methane emissions, while various land management practices were a major contributor to nitrous oxide emissions. Emissions from agricultural activities increased between 1990 and 2008. Conservation practices and programs also play a role in affecting greenhouse gas emissions."
