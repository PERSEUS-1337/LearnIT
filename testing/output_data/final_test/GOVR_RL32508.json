    "content": "The budget category known as Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) encompasses various systems for collecting, processing, and disseminating intelligence. The majority of funding goes towards research and development (R&D) and procurement, with some systems used by military units and others by national defense agencies. Total spending on ISR programs managed by the CIA and Department of Defense is estimated to be in the tens of billions of dollars. ISR acquisition has faced criticism in recent years due to technical problems with new generation systems. The ISR acquisition has faced criticism for technical problems with new generation systems, cost overruns, and deployment issues. There is a concern that ISR spending could consume even larger portions of defense budgets, leading to the need for trade-offs. Some suggest that satellites and UAVs could potentially undertake similar missions, but the current acquisition process lacks cost comparisons and trade-offs. Appendix A provides a case study on trade-offs between satellites and UAVs. The acquisition of ISR systems, including UAVs, is complex due to different acquisition processes, oversight by various committees, and the need for efficient coordination. There are challenges in ensuring a seamless system of systems and acquiring an optimal mix of specific systems. Coordination of ISR program budgets has been criticized for lacking effectiveness, with concerns about comparing capabilities and costs across intelligence programs. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence expressed concerns about the imbalance in intelligence programs and recommended a joint review by the DCI and Deputy Secretary of Defense. The FY1997 Intelligence Authorization Act strengthened the DCI's management abilities for ISR programs. The FY1997 Intelligence Authorization Act (P.L. 104-293) enhanced the DCI's authority to manage the Intelligence Community's budgets and urged the DCI to be more assertive in using these powers. The Senate Intelligence Committee criticized the budget practices of the CIA and the Intelligence Community as inadequate. The Senate Intelligence Committee criticized the Intelligence Community for inadequate budget practices and lack of comprehensive strategic and performance plans. They directed the DCI to produce annual plans to improve program efficiency and aid in resource planning. The Senate Intelligence Committee requested annual program aggregation plans from the Intelligence Community to establish performance measures aligned with goals. Despite acknowledging progress in 2002, the Committee emphasized the need for validated intelligence needs and value from capabilities. However, in 2003, the Committee noted the absence of a performance plan. The Senate Intelligence Committee highlighted the absence of a 2003 performance plan submission and the lack of capability within DoD or the Intelligence Community to objectively evaluate alternative sensor and platform architectures. This hinders the ability to optimize collection capabilities and architectures despite substantial effort and time spent on program trades. The Senate Intelligence Committee noted the importance of optimizing collection capabilities and architectures, emphasizing the need for efficient resource allocation. The FY2004 Intelligence Authorization Act required a report assessing progress in developing a comprehensive analytical capability for intelligence collection. The FY2004 Defense Authorization Act urged the Department of Defense to improve coordination with the intelligence community for strategic and budgetary planning. Congress also highlighted the need for a well-defined forum for integrating intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities to prevent duplication of effort. P.L. 108-136 stated that the current intelligence programming structure may not be optimal for developing an effective intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance system. The FY2004 Defense Authorization Act directed the establishment of an \"ISR Integration Council\" to assess ISR capabilities and develop a roadmap for DOD ISR capabilities for 15 years. Some Members of Congress have focused on budget processes that undermine oversight of ISR efforts. Some Members of Congress have criticized budget processes for ISR programs, citing inadequate budget justification materials and over-reliance on supplemental appropriations. The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence has called for more complete budget submissions to ensure effective oversight. Proposals for ISR programs are to be submitted to intelligence, armed services, and appropriations committees, with justification materials including classified CBJBs. The classified budget justification books (CBJBs) are essential for Congress to review the National Intelligence Program (NIP). These books provide detailed explanations and resource displays for all program requests, including base levels of efforts and new initiatives. Once the intelligence committees complete their review, the legislation is referred to the armed services committee for further consideration. In 1997, HPSCI criticized justification books for lacking critical components necessary for proper funding alignment within appropriations categories. They directed the CMS and Defense Department to provide specific data in all future budget justification documents. In 2000, HPSCI expressed frustration with a lack of detail in justification books and criticized financial management practices. The HPSCI criticized financial management practices and lack of detail in justification books for NFIP agencies, highlighting the need for greater insight into financial obligations and capabilities. They also called attention to limitations in data included in CBJBs, emphasizing the importance of including major milestones and deliverables for contracted projects in acquisition program details. The Committee criticized the lack of detail in justification books for contracted projects, highlighting the need for more specific project milestones and descriptions. There has been a trend of providing intelligence funding in supplemental appropriations acts since 9/11, with a significant portion of funds directed to the Defense Department. The House Committee criticized the reliance on supplemental appropriations for intelligence funding, noting the risks of abuse and long-term funding gaps. The Defense Emergency Response Fund was highlighted as a funding initiative that has deviated from its original purpose. Supplemental legislation for intelligence funding has been criticized for diverting from its intended purpose and undermining budgeting and oversight procedures. Funding \"core\" programs through emergency supplements has raised concerns about sustainability and proper allocation of resources. The House and Senate Intelligence Committees have expressed concerns about the negative impact of relying on supplemental appropriations for intelligence funding. They believe that this practice hinders long-term strategic planning, limits congressional oversight, and affects the transparency and confidence in the activities of the Intelligence Community. The Senate Intelligence Committee is pushing for a bill to curb the practice of using supplemental appropriations for baseline expenditures in the Intelligence Community. Concerns have been raised about the reprogramming of funds, with the House Intelligence Committee noting inconsistencies in money movements within the CIA. The Senate Intelligence Committee and Congress expressed concerns about the CIA's use of funds, citing inconsistencies and reprogramming issues within the National Foreign Intelligence Program. Senator Roberts highlighted budgetary challenges and the need for better cost estimation to avoid reshuffling funds. The Senate Intelligence Committee and Congress criticized the CIA's reprogramming of funds within the National Foreign Intelligence Program, expressing concerns about inconsistencies and lack of clarity in meeting 'unforeseen' requirements. The FY2003 Intelligence Authorization Act aimed to clarify these requirements but was not included in the final bill. The FY2004 intelligence authorization bill sought to delete the 'unforeseen requirements' provision. The FY2004 intelligence authorization bill aimed to delete the \"unforeseen requirements\" criterion, but the provision was not adopted in conference. Concerns raised by Congress have led to calls for a major restructuring of the Intelligence Community to address challenges in ISR efforts. Recommendations from the 2002 Joint Inquiry and the 9/11 Commission include establishing a Director of National Intelligence with comprehensive authority over the entire U.S. Intelligence Community. The 9/11 Commission's report in July 2004 prompted congressional action, leading to recommendations for a new Director of National Intelligence (DNI) with authority over the Intelligence Community. The DNI would oversee national programs, while joint military or tactical intelligence programs would remain under the Department of Defense. Larry Kindsvater proposed reorganizing the Intelligence Community, giving the DCI authority to transfer funding across agencies with congressional approval. The 9/11 Commission's report in July 2004 led to recommendations for a new Director of National Intelligence (DNI) with authority over the Intelligence Community. Efforts in the 1990s addressed the DCI's lack of personnel and budget authority over intelligence agencies. Reforms in 1996 gave the DCI consultative authority and created new deputy positions. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence threatened to bring down the defense authorization bill to push for these changes. The 1990s saw a decrease in the DCI's authorities over national intelligence, with some capabilities transferred to the Department of Defense. Former Representative Hamilton testified about the issue of information sharing among agencies. The \"wall\" separating intelligence and law enforcement agencies was addressed by the USA Patriot Act of October 2001. The Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 established a Director of National Intelligence (DNI) with stronger oversight and management responsibilities for all intelligence agencies. The DNI has important statutory authorities in the intelligence budget process and enhanced reprogramming authorities to transfer funds within the National Intelligence Program for higher priority activities. The Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 created the DNI with increased oversight and budget management powers. Reprogramming funds within the National Intelligence Program is limited to $150 million or 5% without department head approval. There is a proposal to reorganize intelligence programs due to technological advancements and evolving threats. Intelligence programs are currently categorized into NIP, JMIP, and TIARA based on consumer needs. The National Intelligence Program (NIP) encompasses programs, projects, and activities of the intelligence community to support national decision-makers. It includes the Central Intelligence Agency Program (CIAP) and is overseen by the Director of Central Intelligence. The National Intelligence Program (NIP) includes major programs like CIAP, GDIP, CCP, NRP, and FCIP, covering over half of intelligence spending. It involves efforts from CIA, DIA, NRO, NGA, and NSA, with the DNI responsible for budget submissions based on presidential priorities and input from DOD agencies. The Joint Military Intelligence Program (JMIP) was established in 1995 to support multiple defense consumers through four principal components: Defense Cryptologic Program, Defense Imagery Program, Defense Mapping, Charting, and Geodesy Program, and Defense General Intelligence and Applications Program. The total budget for NIP is authorized annually in intelligence authorization acts, with specific amounts detailed in classified schedules accompanying appropriations legislation. The House Intelligence Committee described various JMIP programs in 2000, including modifications to reconnaissance aircraft and Global Hawk UAVs. TIARA programs are part of the military force structure, providing direct support to military operations. These programs include cryptologic training for the Army, ground stations for JSTARS aircraft, naval space surveillance funds, hyper spectral sensing systems for Air Force UAVs, and tactical video systems for Special Operations Forces. Annual lists of TIARA programs are not published, but some are mentioned in appropriations reports. Unlike JMIP programs, which are intelligence systems, TIARA programs are more diverse and include related components. TIARA programs, unlike JMIP programs, are more diverse and include related activities that are essentially parts of various weapons systems. The distinctions among NIP, JMIP, and TIARA programs are becoming indistinct as intelligence assets are capable of serving both national and tactical purposes. For example, the Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP) program facilitates the use of satellite imagery and other NIP products by military commanders. In August 2004 testimony, Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence Stephen Cambone highlighted the blurred distinction between strategic and tactical intelligence, emphasizing the importance of low-level tactical intelligence acquired through TIARA systems. This merging of national and military intelligence assets, such as Global Hawks and SIGINT satellites, reflects the evolving nature of intelligence capabilities. Some argue that the NIP, JMIP, and TIARA categories are outdated and should be considered as parts of a greater whole. Changing these categories would be challenging and could impact organizational relationships. Abolishing the system could lead to acquisition being managed by multiple program managers, which may have drawbacks. The growing interrelationships among these systems could complicate the Intelligence Reform Act's provisions. The Office of the DNI faces challenges in coordinating ISR programs within the NIP, JMIP, and TIARA categories. Congress will play a significant role in ISR acquisition, and the effectiveness of the DNI's enhanced authorities in coordinating programs is under scrutiny. Programming and budgeting of ISR systems are currently managed by the DOD and the Intelligence Community. The Intelligence Community, Office of Management and Budget, and Congressional committees all play roles in allocating budget and coordinating intelligence efforts. Different agencies use various procedures for ISR systems, complicating compatibility and effectiveness. The DCI was responsible for facilitating intelligence efforts before the Intelligence Reform Act. Prior to the Intelligence Reform Act, the DCI was responsible for developing annual budgets for intelligence activities. The 9/11 Commission highlighted the need for restructuring the Intelligence Community and strengthening the DCI or a DNI. The 108th Congress debated the DNI's role in budget development and oversight. The Intelligence Reform Act established the DNI's authority over the Intelligence Community's budget, ensuring the DNI directs resources to critical threats. The DNI sets priorities, guides departments, and develops the annual NIP budget, with funds apportioned by the OMB under the DNI's direction. The legislation empowers the DNI to manage funds for the National Intelligence Program efficiently, without repealing the Secretary of Defense's authorities. Guidelines must be issued by the President to ensure effective implementation while respecting other department heads' responsibilities. Media analysis often focuses on turf battles, but the priority is for intelligence systems to support different needs. Intelligence systems must support different consumers, with priorities in acquisition and coordination. The CIA budget mainly consists of personnel expenses and past procurement efforts. The CIA Program is managed by the Executive Director of the CIA. Other agencies play a minor role. The Director of the CIA and the Secretary of Defense play major roles in intelligence acquisition efforts. The Secretary of Defense is responsible for ensuring adequate budgets for intelligence needs within the Department of Defense. The National Foreign Intelligence Program is overseen by the Department of Defense to ensure compatibility with tactical intelligence activities. Executive Order 12333 mandates coordination between national foreign intelligence programs and Department of Defense intelligence programs. The Defense Department manages most NIP programs, including the General Defense Intelligence Program and the Consolidated Cryptologic Program. The Department of Defense oversees various intelligence programs, including the General Defense Intelligence Program (GDIP), the Consolidated Cryptologic Program (CCP), the DOD Foreign Counterintelligence Program (FCIP), the National Geospatial-Intelligence Program, and the National Reconnaissance Program (NRP). These programs are managed by different agencies within DOD, with responsibilities shared among them. The CCP is managed by NSA, the GDIP covers the work of DIA, geospatial intelligence is handled by NGA, the NRP is the responsibility of NRO, and counterintelligence is a shared responsibility. Satellites and sigint programs, managed by NRO, NGA, and NSA, constitute a significant portion of the estimated $40 billion annual intelligence spending. The Department of Defense oversees various intelligence programs, including the General Defense Intelligence Program (GDIP), the Consolidated Cryptologic Program (CCP), the DOD Foreign Counterintelligence Program (FCIP), the National Geospatial-Intelligence Program, and the National Reconnaissance Program (NRP). These programs are managed by different agencies within DOD. The responsibility for overall coordination of these programs was transferred to the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence in 2003. Stephen Cambone heads this newly created post and has the authority to lead departmental activities related to intelligence programs. Making decisions on ISR programs early in the process is crucial as it can have major implications for years ahead. The establishment of Cambone's office reflects a centralized approach to ISR acquisition under the Intelligence Reform Act. Implementation of acquisition and management authorities for DOD's national intelligence programs is uncertain. Managing programs involves budget planning and monitoring expenditures. Intelligence funds are included in DOD's budget. The CIA's intelligence funds are included in the DOD budget and transferred to the DCI for execution. Most ISR funding is in Program 3 of DOD's Future Years Defense Program, with other programs also having intelligence-related components. Funding is divided into program elements for various purposes. Slightly over half of annual intelligence spending is allocated to agencies within the National Intelligence Program (NIP), with the rest going to programs in the Joint Military Intelligence Program (JMIP) and Tactical Intelligence and Related Activities (TIARA). JMIP programs are included in defense bills and can be managed by a single defense agency or a service as an \"executive agent.\" Funding for intelligence programs is hidden in appropriations legislation, with some known RDT&E programs supporting intelligence efforts. TIARA programs are typically managed by a single service for its own forces. TIARA programs are designated aggregations of military intelligence assets and funding for tactical intelligence programs. They are challenging to review as they consist of various programs that may change yearly and can be difficult to distinguish from other surveillance and targeting efforts. TIARA programs are complex to review as they are part of budget requests from military departments and need to be considered alongside other services' programs. Assessing trade-offs among intelligence programs can be challenging, especially when a weapon system with a TIARA component is delayed or cancelled, impacting integrated intelligence efforts. Various steps have been taken to ensure an integrated approach to intelligence programs, including the Expanded Defense Resources Board. The Defense Resources Board, including senior DOD officials and the DCI, was established in the mid-1990s for broader executive branch review. The Intelligence Program Review Group analyzes priorities and funding alternatives before the Expanded Defense Resources Board considers them. Concerns have been raised about different procedures in the Defense Department and Intelligence Community regarding intelligence collection, analysis, and dissemination. The need for depicting intelligence capabilities, ensuring detailed program review, and supporting decision-making processes was recognized by 1993. During the mid-1990s, the Defense Resources Board, with senior DOD officials and the DCI, was established for executive branch review. The Intelligence Program Review Group assesses priorities and funding options before the Expanded Defense Resources Board reviews them. Concerns arose about differing procedures in the Defense Department and Intelligence Community regarding intelligence activities. In 1993, the importance of depicting intelligence capabilities, ensuring thorough program reviews, and supporting decision-making processes was acknowledged. Measures were taken by the then-DCI, R. James Woolsey, to align DOD and IC milestones, conduct joint TIARA/NFIP reviews, and establish a common budget framework for consistent resource characterization. The goal was to enable resource managers to oversee all programs, projects, and activities related to similar missions and identify unintended consequences of program changes. Implementation of the effort to eliminate the TIARA program and rely on more expensive satellite coverage began in FY1995. Changes involved the DOD, including the Expanded Defense Resources Board and the Intelligence Program Review Group. An interagency Mission Requirements Board was established to address national and tactical needs. Coordination was done by DOD and Intelligence Community officials, with major decisions made jointly by the DCI and the Secretary of Defense. The Department of Defense (DOD) plays a significant role in the acquisition of ISR resources, with observers believing it has greater influence due to its size and the military services' operational needs. Congressional oversight of intelligence activities is conducted by the two intelligence committees, with HPSCI overseeing the National Intelligence Program (NIP) and other intelligence-related activities. Senate rules focus on intelligence activities across all government departments and agencies. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) has jurisdiction over various intelligence agencies and activities, excluding tactical military intelligence. The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) oversees JMIP and TIARA programs, coordinating with the House Armed Services Committee. Both intelligence committees have sole jurisdiction over budgets for the CIA and other related programs. NIP programs are included in annual intelligence authorization legislation and national defense authorization bills. The Senate Armed Services Committees authorizes JMIP and TIARA expenditures, while SSCI reviews and analyzes the budget requests. The National Defense Authorization Act established NIMA despite HPSCI's concerns. Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence was established by the FY2003 National Defense Authorization Act. The FY2003 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 107-314, section 901) established the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, not through an intelligence authorization act. The FY2004 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 108-136, section 921) renamed NIMA to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. Congress has expressed concerns about the coordination of ISR due to challenges in managing technological developments and evolving defense planning post-cold war. Implementation of the Intelligence Reform Act provisions remains uncertain. The Intelligence Reform Act provisions are uncertain in their implementation. The DNI will assess ISR systems and government-wide requirements. Past coordination failures were attributed to the DCI's lower influence compared to the Secretary of Defense. Questions remain about the influence of intelligence and Armed Services committees. The Intelligence Reform Act did not specify procedures for congressional oversight of ISR programs. Some suggest that distinctions among national, joint military, and tactical systems may need to be reevaluated. Any major changes would require further congressional action due to existing statutes. There is a widespread sense that the optimal mix of ISR systems has not yet been determined. The challenges in determining the optimal mix of ISR systems and the complexities involved in acquiring expensive new systems, such as reconnaissance satellites and UAVs, present a significant hurdle for government decision-makers. Efforts to assess the advantages and disadvantages of different ISR options are necessary for executive and congressional review, especially considering potential budgetary constraints in the future. Satellite imagery has been a valuable tool for intelligence gathering since the mid-1950s, leading to the development of reconnaissance satellites to avoid dangerous overflights. Acquisition of intelligence platforms and systems, including reconnaissance satellites and UAVs, is crucial for national policymakers and military commanders. Efforts to achieve an optimal mix of collection capabilities while avoiding duplication are needed. Satellite imagery has been crucial for intelligence gathering since the mid-1950s, leading to the development of reconnaissance satellites. Satellite programs are expensive, with individual satellites costing a billion dollars each. The Future Imagery Architecture (FIA) program aims to replace aging satellite programs with smaller satellites for wider coverage. However, FIA has faced criticism for its increasing costs. The committee is concerned about the rising costs of National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) programs and the need for cost reduction through technological innovations and managerial reforms. They advocate for a shift to smaller satellites for better performance, reduced vulnerability, and to counter foreign denial and deception practices. The committee believes more oversight is needed to control costs and measure cost-effectiveness in the NRO programs. The committee advocates for more oversight of NRO programs to control costs and improve cost-effectiveness. Concerns have been raised about the delays and cost overruns of the Future Imagery Architecture spy satellites, prompting internal debates within the Pentagon. Additional funds have been recommended to accelerate the development of oversight capabilities. The Defense Science Board criticized the underfunded and flawed Future Imagery Architecture program, stating it was not executable. Criticism was also directed towards the inefficient requirements process and the reduced role of the DCI in satellite procurement. The Future Imagery Architecture program, controlled by DoD, faces delays and management issues, leading to a $4 billion shift from other ISR programs. Suggestions include using high-altitude unmanned aerial vehicles like Global Hawk instead of reconnaissance satellites. Global Hawks, costing $57 million each, are used for operational missions and can provide imagery comparable to satellites. Satellites are expensive and limited in number but are considered invulnerable, while Global Hawks can be launched as needed and targeted by local commanders. The Global Hawk UAVs are criticized for cost growth issues, with the average total unit cost projected to exceed $75 million per copy due to upgrades and sensor additions. The Global Hawk program is facing criticism for cost growth issues, with the total unit cost projected to exceed $75 million per copy. Efforts to rapidly upgrade the program without established requirements and lack of examination on its overall fit into intelligence collection architecture are noted. Concerns are raised about the ability to relay and process the large amounts of data generated by a fleet of 51 Global Hawks with highly capable sensors. The separate budget paths for satellites and Global Hawk UAVs have made potential trade-offs between space and UAV collection more challenging. Integration of intelligence acquisition efforts is seen as lacking effectiveness. The integration of intelligence acquisition efforts has not provided a comprehensive assessment of issues related to satellite and UAV programs. There is a debate on whether UAVs could replace satellites partially, leading to potential budget savings. However, not utilizing U.S. satellite technology superiority may limit intelligence capabilities and impact the U.S. industry in the long term."
