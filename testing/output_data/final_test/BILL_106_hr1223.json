    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Teachers for the 21st Century Act\". Congress acknowledges the need for well-trained teachers in the 21st century to meet the increasing demands of students. However, teacher development resources are lacking in many school districts, leaving educators ill-prepared to educate children in a global workforce. Over the next 10 years, the Nation will face a demand for 2,000,000 additional teachers due to increased student enrollments and teacher attrition. This will force many school districts to choose between quantity and quality, with 50,000 unqualified teachers hired annually to meet the growing demand. Teacher shortages will disproportionately affect high-need urban and rural communities struggling to attract and retain qualified teachers. Education Statistics reports that 39 percent of teachers in high-need urban and rural communities lack a college major or minor in their primary field of coursework. The purpose of the legislation is outlined in Section 3. The Act aims to establish 10 National Teachers Academies in each of the 10 regions to support high-need local education agencies. These Academies will improve teaching by mentoring student teachers and increasing the pool of qualified teachers through professional development opportunities. The National Teachers Academies aim to enhance teaching by providing demonstration sites for best practices, improving collaboration between faculty, and disseminating research findings to school districts nationwide. The National Teachers Academies focus on enhancing teaching by collaborating with various stakeholders, offering alternative teaching certification, providing professional development opportunities, supporting teachers in research, and ensuring students from disadvantaged communities receive quality education. The Secretary can provide grants to 10 high-need local educational agencies to establish National Teachers Academies in each region. These academies promote teacher training, professional development, recruitment, and curriculum development. To be eligible for a grant under this Act, a high-need local educational agency must submit an application to the Secretary, describe plans to recruit and hire \"master\" teachers for mentoring, and partner with education institutions to expand the pool of \"master\" teachers through professional development opportunities. The curr_chunk describes the goals of a demonstration site for best practices in education, including improving classroom management, teacher training, collaboration between faculty, sharing knowledge with school districts, and establishing a consortium for educational development. The curr_chunk outlines the requirements for a demonstration site in education, including offering alternative teaching certification, professional development opportunities, and engaging teachers in action research. It also mandates non-Federal matching funds of 25% for the first 2 years, 35% for the 3rd and 4th years, and 50% for the 5th year. The Secretary may award each grant for up to 5 years, renewable annually based on achieving goals, showing progress, meeting non-Federal costs, and having a plan for sustainability. SEC. 6. USE OF FUNDS. A high-need local educational agency or eligible consortium receiving a grant under this Act must use funds to establish or expand a National Teachers Academy, covering costs like startup, staff training, materials, personnel, recruitment, and facility construction or renovation. The Secretary may limit funds for remodeling and construction costs related to creating or expanding each National Teachers Academy. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS.
