    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 5388 is added to the Public Utilities Code in California. The commission in California shall establish a telephone communications service for the public to report concerns or complaints about charter-party carriers of passengers, including transportation network companies. The commission will designate a specific telephone number for this purpose and require carriers to include it in contracts. For transportation network companies using apps, customers must be notified of the telephone number during electronic transactions. Additional means of communication may also be maintained by the commission. The commission in California may maintain alternative means for the public to express concerns or complaints about charter-party carriers, including transportation network companies, during electronic transactions. The commission in California maintains records of concerns and complaints regarding charter-party carriers, including transportation network companies. They establish rules for determining serious concerns and complaints, resolving non-serious ones informally, and investigating and enforcing actions for serious concerns. The California commission keeps a record of concerns and complaints related to charter-party carriers and transportation network companies, conducting investigations and providing results. Section 1801.3 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to apply to formal proceedings involving various corporations regulated by the commission. The Public Utilities Code is amended to streamline the process for intervenor compensation in formal proceedings regulated by the commission. Intervenors will be compensated for their substantial contributions in a timely manner. The Public Utilities Code is amended to streamline intervenor compensation in formal proceedings regulated by the commission, avoiding unnecessary participation and defining compensation for advocates and expert witnesses. The Public Utilities Code is amended to define a \"customer\" as a representative authorized by a customer or a group representing residential or small commercial customers. It excludes government agencies, publicly owned utilities, and entities formed for commission proceedings. The Public Utilities Code defines \"expert witness fees\" as costs incurred by a customer for an expert witness, and \"other reasonable costs\" as out-of-pocket expenses directly related to the customer's contentions. \"Party\" refers to any interested party, respondent public utility, or commission staff in a proceeding, which includes applications, complaints, investigations, rulemaking, and other formal proceedings before the commission. (g)\u201cSignificant financial hardship\u201d refers to the inability to afford costs of effective participation, including advocate\u2019s fees and expert witness fees. For groups or organizations, it means the economic interest of members is small compared to participation costs. (h)\u201cSmall commercial customer\u201d is a nonresidential customer with a peak demand below 50 kilowatts. The commission can adjust this definition to encourage small business participation without including large commercial and industrial customers. The commission may award compensation for advocate's fees, expert fees, and other costs if a customer's presentation substantially assists in the decision-making process. Claims for contributions to closed proceedings will be denied unless specified otherwise."
