    "content": "Many Members of Congress receive complaints from constituents about the lack of local news and programming that addresses their community's needs and interests. This is often due to contractual agreements between broadcast networks and local stations, as well as discrepancies in broadcast signal contours and audience viewing patterns. The need for rules on broadcaster programming and signal carriage may not fully meet all viewer or community needs. Using metropolitan areas or state borders to determine programming obligations will inevitably disappoint some households. Despite government intervention, some viewers and communities may feel their needs are not being met. The report aims to explain how existing statutes and rules impact television programming for consumers and explore ways to improve programming for local communities. Broadcast television licenses are assigned to specific cities, but stations often reach beyond their city borders and even state borders. Cable systems must carry local broadcast stations based on Nielsen Designated Market Areas. Congress addressed these issues in the 1992 Cable Act. The 1992 Cable Act requires cable systems to carry local broadcast stations based on Nielsen Designated Market Areas (DMAs), which represent nationwide commercial mapping of television audience viewing patterns. DMAs are determined by commercial publications and each county in the United States is assigned to a television market based on residents' viewing habits. Some counties may be assigned to DMAs in different states due to viewing patterns being more aligned with economic markets than state boundaries. The Cable Act requires cable systems to carry local broadcast stations based on Nielsen DMAs, which represent TV audience viewing patterns. In some DMAs straddling two states, cable systems may not carry local broadcast stations from their own state. Before SHVERA in 2004, satellite systems could only offer local broadcast stations within the same DMA to subscribers. This meant subscribers in DMAs where all stations are in another state couldn't receive in-state broadcast signals. SHVERA expanded satellite operators' ability to offer in-state television signals to subscribers, including signals from outside the DMA if they are \"significantly viewed\" in the area. Certain states have specific requirements for in-state signal offerings. Table 1 in the report compiles data on U.S. television households in DMAs with primary cities in different states. It includes the number of households, counties assigned to these DMAs, and full power broadcast TV stations within the state but in DMAs outside the state. This data forms the basis of the report's discussion, emphasizing the importance of city of license information. The information in Table 1 is crucial as it shows whether television households in counties assigned to DMAs with primary cities outside the state have access to in-state, in-DMA television stations. For example, Arkansas households in the Springfield, Missouri DMA receive service from stations with a license in Arkansas, while those in the Memphis, Tennessee DMA have no access to stations with an Arkansas license. This data highlights the importance of city of license information for meeting the needs of viewers. Localism is a key objective of U.S. broadcast policy, with broadcasters serving as temporary trustees of the public's spectrum. The FCC awards licenses on the condition that licensees serve the public interest, convenience, and necessity. The FCC requires broadcasters to serve the public interest by airing programming responsive to their community's needs. Localism is a key aspect of U.S. broadcast policy, with the FCC prioritizing fair distribution of radio service among states and communities. The FCC emphasizes the importance of localism in broadcast policy, ensuring fair distribution of radio service among communities. Broadcast stations must have a main studio in or near their community of license, equipped with necessary facilities and a public inspection file. The FCC requires broadcast stations to have a main studio in or near their community of license, equipped with necessary facilities and a public inspection file. The station's public interest obligation is limited to serving the needs of viewers within its city of license, even though its signal contours extend beyond those borders. The FCC rules require broadcast stations to have a main studio in or near their community of license. The licensee is obligated to serve the needs of viewers within the city of license, even though the signal reaches beyond those borders. Many stations have viewing areas that extend across state borders due to urban development, and the FCC has assigned licenses to cities in each state to serve populations on both sides of the borders. The FCC assigns broadcast licenses to cities on both sides of state borders to serve populations in urban areas. Some areas have licenses concentrated in a single large city, while others have licenses spread across multiple cities in different states. The FCC assigns broadcast licenses to cities on both sides of state borders to serve urban populations. Despite efforts, many TV households in New Jersey are served by stations licensed outside the state. There are 3,149,060 television households in New Jersey. Only one TV station in New Jersey is affiliated with a major network, serving the southern part of the state. Most households in New Jersey receive signals from stations in New York City or Philadelphia. Four New Jersey stations transmit from New York City, covering the area fully. The FCC has tried to address the lack of New Jersey-specific programming by requiring stations in neighboring cities to offer such content. The FCC requires stations in New York City and Philadelphia to provide programming for New Jersey households. Delaware has one commercial station and three noncommercial stations, with most viewers served by Philadelphia stations. New Hampshire primarily receives broadcast service from Boston stations. Maryland has over 900,000 households in the Washington, DC DMA. In the Washington, DC DMA, most households are served by DC stations, with some also receiving programming from Baltimore stations. Virginia also has over 900,000 households in the Washington, DC DMA. In the Washington, DC DMA, over 900,000 television households are primarily served by DC stations. In the Kansas City, Missouri DMA, more than 300,000 households rely on broadcast stations from that city. In the New York City DMA, over 330,000 television households in Connecticut are primarily served by New York City stations. Additionally, more than 150,000 Kentucky television households are in the Cincinnati, Ohio DMA. In Kentucky, over 150,000 television households are in the Cincinnati, Ohio DMA with no commercial stations in Kentucky. In northwestern Indiana, almost 200,000 television households are in the Chicago, Illinois DMA, primarily served by Chicago stations. In western Illinois, more than 300,000 television households are in the St. Louis, Missouri DMA, primarily served by St. Louis stations. In Wyoming, 54.55% of television households are located in markets outside the state. In Wyoming, most television households are served by broadcast stations with city of license outside the state. Concerns about local broadcasters being harmed and a decrease in programming serving local needs led Congress to enact laws to promote localism in cable television. The 1972, 1984, and 1992 Cable Acts aimed to promote localism in the cable television industry. The 1992 Cable Act introduced the \"retransmission consent/must carry\" election, where local commercial broadcast stations must choose between negotiating agreements with cable systems for signal carriage or requiring carriage without compensation. This election allows broadcasters to control the distribution of their programming on cable systems. The evolution of must-carry rules shows the challenge of balancing local broadcaster protection and promoting local programming without burdening cable operators. Initially, cable operators were required to carry all broadcast signals reaching their service area, but this was too broad. Must-carry requirements were then adjusted to accommodate these challenges. The must-carry rules were modified to apply to all broadcast stations that were \"significantly viewed\" by households in the cable service area not served by cable or satellite providers. Specific threshold viewing levels were set for network-affiliate and independent stations. In 1992, the must-carry rules were modified by Congress to apply to all broadcast stations significantly viewed by households in cable service areas not served by cable or satellite providers. This change was made as more households subscribed to cable service, making it less reasonable to base decisions on over-the-air viewership behavior. Congress modified sections 614 and 615 of the 1934 Communications Act to require cable operators to carry local commercial and noncommercial educational stations based on viewing patterns. The number of broadcast signals carried varies by cable system size, with a minimum of three local commercial stations and one local noncommercial educational station. Cable systems with more than 12 channels must carry local commercial stations on up to one-third of their channels and up to three qualified noncommercial educational stations. The FCC requires cable systems to carry local television stations within the same television market, based on Nielsen DMAs. However, complex rules often result in some stations not being carried due to duplication or exclusivity agreements. The FCC requires cable systems to carry local television stations within the same television market based on Nielsen DMAs. Non-duplication rules are still based on the \"significantly viewed\" criteria. If a cable operator successfully negotiates a retransmission consent agreement with a nearby station outside the DMA, its signals may not be subject to non-duplication rules. The Montgomery County cable operator can carry both the Washington, DC and Baltimore network affiliates without blackouts. National networks often determine retransmission consent for stations outside a cable system's DMA, which may be limited by copyright law. Cable systems must pay royalties for carrying signals outside their DMA. The 1992 Cable Act allows cable systems to carry broadcast signals outside their designated market areas (DMAs) without blackouts, but they must pay royalties for these secondary transmissions. Cable systems have a royalty-free license for carrying signals within their DMAs, including out-of-DMA stations that meet certain criteria. If an in-state, out-of-DMA station does not meet the criteria, the cable system may have to pay copyright royalties. The FCC has the authority to implement must-carry rules flexibly to promote localism. The 1992 Cable Act allows cable systems to carry broadcast signals outside their designated market areas (DMAs) without blackouts, but they must pay royalties for these secondary transmissions. The FCC has the authority to implement must-carry rules flexibly to promote localism, allowing for exceptions in determining local commercial television stations. The FCC considers requests for multiple television markets, focusing on localism and factors like historical carriage, local service, news coverage, and viewing patterns. The FCC determines the areas served by cable systems in a community and only broadcasters or cable systems can request to modify signal carriage rights. The television industry is debating cable carriage of local broadcast signals during the transition from analog to digital transmission mandated by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. The FCC ruling in January 2001 stated that cable systems are not required to carry both analog and digital signals of local television stations simultaneously. However, digital-only television stations have the right to assert carriage on local cable systems. The FCC ruling in January 2001 stated that cable systems are not required to carry both analog and digital signals of local television stations simultaneously. Digital-only television stations have the right to assert carriage on a local cable system. In April 2007, the FCC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to address how to protect households subscribing to cable systems not fully deployed with digital technology by the February 17, 2009 deadline for broadcasters to discontinue analog transmission. The Commission proposed that cable operators must comply with the \"viewability\" provision to ensure cable subscribers with analog television sets can continue to view all must-carry stations after the end of analog broadcasting. The FCC adopted final rules on September 11, 2007, to ensure that cable customers can still receive local television stations after the digital television transition. Analog television sets can continue to view all must-carry stations by carrying the digital signal in analog format or in digital format if subscribers have the necessary equipment. Some commissioners raised questions about proposing specific rules prematurely and the potential market forces to resolve issues. The FCC requires cable operators to comply with a \"viewability requirement\" to carry local television stations in analog and digital formats or digital-only with set-top boxes. The viewability requirement is in place until February 2012, with small cable companies able to request waivers. Cable systems must carry \"primary video\" defined as a single programming stream and related content. Broadcasters can use digital technology to broadcast multiple channels of programming. In February 2005, the FCC ruled that cable operators are not required to carry more than a single digital programming stream from any particular broadcaster. Cable providers argued that their decision to carry additional broadcaster programming streams should be market-driven, not mandated. Local franchising authorities may require cable operators to set aside channels for public, educational, or governmental use under the 1984 Cable Act. The 1984 Cable Act allows franchising authorities to require cable operators to provide public, educational, and governmental (PEG) channels. Cable operators must offer access channels for community-oriented programming, with content control restrictions. They may impose non-content-based requirements and provide equipment user training. Local cable operators are mandated to carry full-power television stations' broadcast signals, except for systems with very small capacity. Operators must carry broadcast signals of full-power television stations in their DMA and certain low-power stations within 50 miles of the cable head-end. The cable operator must carry the program schedule of each station, with possible blackouts for duplicated programming. If a cable system is in a DMA with the primary city in another state, it must carry out-of-state broadcast signals. Local cable operator Q, located in state Y but within DMA F, may negotiate with broadcasters outside DMA F to carry their signals, subject to various restrictions and fees. This could limit the state-specific entertainment and local news programming offered. Cable operator Q is unlikely to have a program schedule with blacked out or unavailable programs. Cable operators may not offer a complete program schedule due to copyright fees and territorial exclusivity provisions imposed by broadcast networks. This can limit the availability of in-state programming on cable systems. The inclusion of out-of-state broadcasters in the same DMA as the cable operator's subscribers may lead to limited coverage of issues specific to the cable system's service area. This is because broadcasters are not obligated to serve viewers outside their city of license, and advertisers may prioritize close-in viewers. Subscribers' satisfaction will depend on their interest in news, information, and sports programming focused on the television market. The current rules assume cable subscribers have a preference for news, information, and sports programming focused on the television market in their area, rather than the political jurisdiction they reside in. This preference is based on existing viewing patterns and was influenced by the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act of 1999. The Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act of 1999 allowed satellite television providers to offer local broadcast television signals to subscribers in specific markets defined by Nielsen DMAs. This service, known as \"local-into-local,\" is not mandatory and can be charged for. Satellite companies have a royalty-free compulsory copyright license for the secondary transmission of broadcast signals to subscribers. The Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act of 1999 allowed satellite TV providers to offer local broadcast signals in specific markets. Local-into-local service is not mandatory but can be charged for. Satellite operators must provide all local broadcast signals in a DMA if they choose to offer local-into-local service. They are not required to carry more than one local station affiliated with the same network unless they are licensed in different states. Cable operators have more negotiation opportunities for programming carriage than satellite operators under SHVIA. The Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act of 1999 allowed satellite TV providers to offer local broadcast signals in specific markets. Cable operators have more negotiation opportunities for programming carriage than satellite operators under SHVIA. Satellite operators could provide local-into-local service to subscribers in-state, but outside their DMA, based on signal intensity qualifications. Subscriber Z in state Y and DMA F could only receive local signals from DMA F, not from state Y due to Grade B contour restrictions. The Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act of 1999 allowed satellite TV providers to offer local broadcast signals in specific markets, but restrictions on local-into-local service were not based on technological constraints. Once a satellite operator uplinks programming to a satellite, there are no technical constraints on making that signal available to all television households within the satellite's footprint. The Satellite Home Viewer Extension and Reauthorization Act of 2004 expanded the scope of in-state television signals that satellite operators can offer to subscribers, including signals from broadcast television stations within the subscriber's DMA. This was done to comply with the law and provide local-into-local service. The Satellite Home Viewer Extension and Reauthorization Act of 2004 allows satellite operators to offer in-state television signals to subscribers, including signals from broadcast television stations within the subscriber's DMA. Restrictions on retransmitting distant broadcast signals have been reduced, allowing satellite carriers to offer signals from outside the local market to subscribers under certain conditions. The Satellite Home Viewer Extension and Reauthorization Act of 2004 permits satellite carriers to offer in-state television signals to subscribers within their DMA. Carriers can also provide signals from outside the local market if the FCC determines the signal is \"significantly viewed\" in the community. This exempts satellite carriers from paying copyright royalties for retransmitting these signals. The FCC implemented SHVERA, allowing broadcasters to choose between retransmission consent or mandatory carriage for satellite carriers retransmitting distant signals. This change was necessary due to satellite providers retransmitting \"significantly viewed\" signals on a county-specific basis, impacting local broadcasters. The FCC implemented SHVERA, allowing broadcasters to choose retransmission consent or mandatory carriage for satellite carriers retransmitting distant signals on a county-specific basis. Satellite carriers can retransmit WMUR, an ABC affiliate in New Hampshire, and four commercial stations in Vermont to subscribers within the state, subject to FCC rules and royalty payments. Satellite carriers can retransmit network-affiliated broadcast television stations in Oregon to specific counties outside the state, subject to FCC rules and royalty payments. This includes retransmitting signals to subscribers in Umatilla, Grant, Malheur, and Wallowa counties. Satellite carriers can retransmit network-affiliated broadcast television stations in specific counties outside the state, subject to FCC rules and royalty payments. This includes retransmitting signals to subscribers in two counties in Mississippi and two counties in Louisiana. Satellite carriers must retransmit all analog and digital broadcast signals from Alaska and Hawaii to subscribers in local markets within specific timeframes after the passage of SHVERA. Additionally, signals from at least one local market in each state must be available to subscribers not located in a designated market area. The SHVERA requires satellite carriers to retransmit broadcast signals from Alaska and Hawaii to local markets within specific timeframes. Signals from one local market in each state must also be available to subscribers outside designated market areas, with costs not exceeding retransmission of local stations in other states. Additionally, if broadcast signals meet certain criteria or if the subscriber is in a state covered by state-specific provisions, additional programming may be offered. The SHVERA allows satellite carriers to retransmit broadcast signals from Alaska and Hawaii to local markets within specific timeframes. Additional programming may be offered if certain criteria are met, such as negotiating retransmission consent agreements. This expansion of in-state signals can benefit candidates by reducing campaign costs and promoting localism in U.S. media policy. The U.S. media policy is based on a small number of broadcast television stations serving multiple local jurisdictions. Broadcasters face challenges in meeting the needs of viewers across different governmental boundaries and states. They strive to cover general and regional interests to cater to a wide audience. Some statutory and regulatory requirements hinder television providers from meeting community needs and interests. Congress could pass legislation to instruct the FCC to review rules and eliminate disincentives to localism. Broadcast television stations prioritize serving their city of license but may face market incentives that diverge from this goal. Market incentives may diverge from serving the city of license if the signal covers a larger city, especially if they are in different states. This can impact how the station markets itself and is identified geographically. The Television & Cable Factbook provides data on television stations by state, showing instances where stations are licensed in one state but located in a different DMA. In the 2004 edition of the Television & Cable Factbook, seven TV stations were listed under a neighboring state despite being licensed in a different state. By 2006, all stations were listed under their actual city of license only. The editors of the Factbook made the decision to list stations by city and state of license, rather than using hyphenated market designations with the major city listed first. The FCC also opened a proceeding in 2004 regarding this issue. The FCC opened a proceeding in 2004 on broadcast localism, but has not proposed any rules yet. Congress may direct the FCC to clarify licensees' obligations to serve viewers in their city of license and enforce these obligations. Current FCC rules are unclear about licensees' obligations to serve viewers beyond their city of license. The FCC may be directed by Congress to clarify broadcasters' obligations to serve viewers outside their city of license. This includes viewers in areas beyond the city of license but not in larger nearby cities with their own broadcast television stations. This could provide economic incentives for broadcasters to cater to these viewers, but producing news and information programming for them can be costly. Congress might want the FCC to explicitly outline licensees' responsibilities in serving this specific viewer demographic. The FCC may be directed by Congress to clarify broadcasters' obligations to serve viewers outside their city of license, including those in areas beyond the city of license but not in larger nearby cities with their own broadcast television stations. In 1999, the FCC issued a notice of inquiry regarding the public interest obligations of broadcast television licensees during the transition to digital television. This led to the adoption of children's programming obligations for digital television broadcasters in September 2004. Technological advancements in digital transmission have the potential to help broadcasters better meet the local needs of their viewers. The FCC is considering rules to address digital broadcast television public interest obligations, including the possibility of requiring cable operators to carry each programming stream that offers distinct programming aimed at previously unserved geographic areas within a broadcaster's serving area. This could benefit viewers in areas where a broadcaster's serving area crosses state borders. The FCC is considering rules for digital broadcast television public interest obligations, including requiring cable operators to carry additional broadcast channels that cater to viewers in areas where a broadcaster's serving area crosses state borders. Congress may direct the FCC to study and make recommendations for rules on mandatory carriage of multiple broadcast signals. The FCC is considering rules for digital broadcast television public interest obligations, including addressing issues related to mandatory carriage of multiple broadcast signals and better serving viewers in different governmental jurisdictions. Existing rules and fees may restrict cable operators in DMAs with primary cities in other states from carrying local broadcasters' signals, reducing viewer access to state-wide programming. Many states have a significant number of television households in DMAs with primary cities outside the state, impacting access to local programming. The FCC is considering rules for digital broadcast television public interest obligations, including addressing issues related to mandatory carriage of multiple broadcast signals and better serving viewers in different governmental jurisdictions. There is flexibility in the must-carry rules, non-duplication rules, and copyright laws to foster localism. Congress may direct the FCC to review existing rules to promote localism. The Commission is studying whether to loosen non-duplication rules to promote cable carriage of state-wide programming without undermining goals. It may explore exceptions to current rules using DMAs to determine cable must-carry rights. The Commission is considering allowing parties other than broadcast licensees and cable operators to request exceptions based on localism impact. Additionally, it may investigate if the Commission should have the right to propose changes. The Commission is considering whether to give itself the authority to propose exceptions to current rules on cable carriage of state-wide programming. It believes that parties other than broadcast licensees and cable operators have valuable knowledge that state officials or the FCC may not possess. Changing must-carry stations could impact the programming available to cable subscribers. By passing SHVERA in November 2004, Congress expanded the scope of in-state television programming that satellite operators are permitted to offer subscribers. This includes allowing satellite providers to offer programming that is \"significantly viewed\" by over-the-air television viewers. The effectiveness of SHVERA will be determined over time to see if it reduces consumer complaints about access to programming that meets their needs and interests. The effectiveness of SHVERA in expanding satellite programming to meet viewer needs will be determined over time. If the \"significantly viewed\" provision does not address state-specific needs, bills may be introduced in the 110th Congress for state-specific solutions. Senator Allard has introduced S. 124 to allow satellite operators to offer programming in two counties. S. 124 would allow satellite operators to offer signals of broadcasters in Denver to subscribers in two counties in Colorado. Senator Salazar's S. 760 adds provisions to waive retransmission rules for carrying network station signals to subscribers outside their state's DMA. H.R. 602 and H.R. 2821 propose changes to retransmission rules for satellite carriers to provide network station signals to subscribers in specific states. The proposed changes in H.R. 602 and H.R. 2821 aim to allow satellite carriers and cable operators to retransmit local television broadcast signals to adjacent DMAs within the same state under a royalty-free statutory copyright license. Additionally, the FCC would revise regulations to permit retransmission in adjacent DMAs for subscribers receiving the signals."
