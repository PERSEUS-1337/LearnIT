    "content": "Several actions occurred throughout the past year related to foreign aid reform, including the release of the Obama Administration's Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on December 15, 2010. President Obama also signed a Presidential Policy Directive on Global Development on September 22, 2010, to improve agency coordination and identify foreign aid with foreign investment. These actions aim to elevate development as a key pillar of U.S. foreign policy. The House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman released a discussion draft in 2010 to revamp the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, emphasizing reducing global poverty and implementing rigorous monitoring systems. The President's National Security Strategy also highlighted foreign aid priorities within the Administration's agenda. The strategy aimed to integrate all tools in defense, diplomacy, and development, improve coordination of foreign assistance programs, advance democracy and human rights, enhance relationships with allies, expand multilateral development institutions, and invest in long-term development activities. Concerns were raised about inefficiencies in U.S. foreign aid management, including the lack of a national strategy, insufficient funding compared to diplomacy and defense, and lack of coordination among Cabinet-level departments and agencies. The curr_chunk discusses challenges in foreign aid coordination, lack of visibility for USAID at the Cabinet level, and debates on strengthening USAID's role. Criticisms include inflexibility and lack of progress in some aid programs. Criticism of foreign aid includes perceived lack of progress in some countries and concerns about the Department of Defense's increasing involvement in aid distribution. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is seen as outdated and not reflecting current international conditions, with multiple goals and priorities that do not align with present needs. Congress has also passed additional legislation further complicating aid responsibilities. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is criticized for its outdated nature and lack of coherence in U.S. foreign policy. Recommendations for rewriting the act include removing earmarks and aid restrictions, focusing on poverty reduction, and setting development goals based on current realities. Calls for reform have come from NGOs, development experts, and policymakers, with actions taken in 2009 and 2010 to address these issues. In 2009 and 2010, there were efforts to reform foreign aid legislation, conduct a quadrennial review, and issue a Presidential Study Directive on U.S. Global Development Policy. Interest in diplomacy and development as foreign policy tools has grown across the political spectrum, especially after the 9/11 attacks. Both the Bush and Obama Administrations, along with bipartisan support in Congress, have emphasized the importance of strengthening diplomacy and development alongside defense for national security goals. The Bush Administration emphasized the importance of elevating diplomacy and development alongside defense for national security goals, aiming to bring democracy, development, free markets, and free trade worldwide. However, there have been doubts about whether the rhetoric has been matched by actual policies. During the George W. Bush Administration, there was a push to elevate diplomacy and development alongside defense for national security goals. Questions arose about whether the rhetoric was backed by actual policies. In 2003, a Strategic Plan was released by Secretary of State Colin Powell and USAID Administrator Andrew Natsios to align diplomacy and development assistance with the President's National Security Strategy. Several changes were made to the foreign aid structure. The Bush Administration made significant changes to foreign aid, including increasing the budget and establishing new programs like the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and the Millennium Challenge Corporation. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice introduced transformational diplomacy and development to improve the effectiveness of foreign assistance. This led to the creation of the Foreign Assistance (F) Bureau and the Director of Foreign Assistance position in 2006. The Foreign Assistance (F) Bureau and Director of Foreign Assistance (DFA) were created by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to align USAID budget with State Department's foreign policy objectives. The F process aimed to develop a coherent foreign assistance strategy, provide country-specific assistance strategies, and consolidate policy planning and implementation mechanisms. The Strategic Framework for Foreign Assistance guided aid programs alignment with strategic objectives in FY2008 and FY2009 budgets under President Bush. During the Bush Administration, a significant portion of aid was delivered by DOD due to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. NGOs have raised concerns about military personnel distributing American aid, with Secretary of Defense Robert Gates stating that DOD lacks expertise in aid delivery. The Obama Administration aims to balance diplomacy, development, and defense for national security goals. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has also emphasized the importance of this balance. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton emphasizes the importance of diplomacy and development in achieving \"smart power\" goals. The Administration has taken steps to improve foreign aid by partnering with aid-recipient countries, integrating development activities among all agencies, and targeting investment in key sectors like agriculture, health, and education. Clinton stresses that the U.S. will not sacrifice long-term development goals for short-term objectives or hand over development work to diplomats and defense experts. In a speech, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton emphasized the importance of leveraging the expertise of diplomats and military for development goals. Some experts suggest a quadrennial review process for foreign affairs similar to the Quadrennial Defense Review to improve interagency cooperation and national security. The HELP Commission recommended a Quadrennial Development and Humanitarian Assistance Review to evaluate U.S. development efforts every four years. The review proposes changes to U.S. development objectives and government approaches, influencing the National Security Strategy and National International Affairs Strategy. A quadrennial review for civilian foreign affairs agencies was established by Secretary of State Clinton in 2009, modeled after the Quadrennial Defense Review. The Quadrennial Defense Review aimed to enhance the capabilities of civilian foreign affairs agencies for 21st-century demands, focusing on diplomacy and development tools' effectiveness. Secretary Clinton intended to elevate diplomacy and development as key pillars of national security strategy through the QDDR. The review also looked at future State and USAID capabilities and the need for institutionalizing a culture of review and responsiveness. The QDDR outlines the Obama Administration's plans to modernize foreign policy agencies, prioritize civilian power alongside military power, reform foreign aid, improve program coordination, and promote accountability. It includes recommendations to empower Chiefs of Missions and enhance coordination of civilian personnel at overseas posts. The Department of State will seek input from other agencies in reviewing the performance of Chiefs of Missions. Replacing the Civilian Reserve Corps with an Expert Corps to draw on expertise across government agencies and the private sector. Embracing technology for global networking and collaboration. Focusing on gender equality in overseas investments. Making public diplomacy a key aspect of U.S. diplomacy by building regional media hubs. The U.S. government aims to enhance flexibility by balancing direct-hire personnel and contractors, focusing on specific development areas like economic growth and food security. USAID will lead efforts in Food Security and Global Health, ensuring funding is tied to performance and aid is transparent. Improved monitoring and evaluation will guide resource requests, align budgets, and transition to multi-year budget formulation. The QDDR recommends structural changes in the Department of State to improve coordination of aid and promote foreign aid activities aligned with the Obama Administration's interests. This includes creating new positions like an Under Secretary for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment, establishing a Bureau for Energy Resources, and elevating economic diplomacy as a key component of foreign policy. The QDDR recommends structural changes in the Department of State to improve coordination of aid and promote foreign aid activities aligned with the Obama Administration's interests. This includes creating new positions like an Under Secretary for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment, establishing a Bureau for Energy Resources, and elevating economic diplomacy as a key component of foreign policy. Additionally, President Obama authorized a Presidential Study Directive on U.S. Global Development Policy to provide a U.S. government-wide review. The U.S. Global Development Policy (PSD-7) directive initiated a government-wide review of global development policy, involving various departments beyond State and USAID to address challenges like poverty, hunger, disease, and conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Chaired by National Security Advisor James Jones and National Economic Council Director Lawrence Summers, the interagency committee evaluated existing U.S. development activities to adopt a more coordinated and strategic approach. The U.S. Global Development Policy (PSD-7) committee, chaired by Gayle Smith, was reviewed by the National Security Council and National Economic Council. The PSD aimed to create a global development policy for the executive branch, distinct from the QDDR initiated by the Secretary of State. The processes were coordinated, with senior officials from the QDDR also involved in the PSD committee. A draft PSD report was made public in early May 2010. The draft PSD report, A New Way Forward on Global Development, outlined a deliberate development policy focusing on fostering emerging markets, democratic governance, research and development, sustainable systems, tailored strategies for each country, and improved coordination between the Department of State and USAID. President Obama signed the Presidential Policy Directive (PPD) on Global Development on September 22, 2010, emphasizing the need to elevate development as a pillar of national security strategy. The PPD signed by President Obama on September 22, 2010, aims to prioritize development as a key aspect of U.S. national security policy. It designates USAID as the lead agency on development and establishes a global development advisory committee. The policy focuses on sustainable development outcomes, leveraging leadership, and utilizing development capabilities to support common objectives. New approaches include prioritizing economic growth, utilizing new technologies in development, and promoting clean energy. The PPD signed by President Obama on September 22, 2010, prioritizes development as a key aspect of U.S. national security policy. It designates USAID as the lead agency on development and focuses on sustainable development outcomes, economic growth, new technologies, and clean energy. Initiatives include prioritizing vaccines for neglected diseases, weather-resistant seed varieties, and clean energy innovations, balancing military and civilian power, adopting metrics to measure progress, being selective on aid recipients, establishing country ownership and responsibility, coordinating with other aid donors, supporting multilateral development organizations, and monitoring and evaluating programs. The PPD signed by President Obama prioritizes development as a key aspect of U.S. national security policy. It includes initiatives such as Feed the Future, Global Health Initiative, and Global Climate Change Initiative. Foreign aid experts emphasize the need for a national strategy to guide aid reform. The HELP Commission recommended establishing a National International Affairs Strategy to enhance U.S. foreign assistance planning, aligning it with security and defense policies. This strategy would outline global and regional objectives, country-specific goals, and government-wide capabilities needed for implementation, covering efforts funded by the International Affairs budget function. The Government Accountability Office recommends developing a comprehensive government-wide foreign assistance strategy involving all U.S. government entities. President Obama's National Security Strategy emphasized a whole-of-government approach to integrating and coordinating agencies and tools. The 111th Congress believed in mandating clear objectives for foreign aid, assessing its effectiveness, and reporting findings for reform. Establishing criteria for a more effective foreign aid program would elevate development as a foreign policy tool. During the 111th Congress, foreign aid reform was a priority for legislators, with some praising initial measures as good first steps while others criticized the legislation for not going far enough in overhauling aid to align with U.S. foreign policy goals. Representative Berman believed in the need for reform, emphasizing the importance of repealing the Foreign Assistance Act. Representative Berman advocated for reforming foreign aid by repealing the outdated Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and replacing it with a new act that aligns with current challenges. The new act would focus on reducing poverty, promoting peace, supporting human rights, and enhancing strategic partnerships. It would also aim for greater flexibility in aid distribution, transparency in spending, and accountability to the American public. Representative Berman supported strengthening USAID for global development leadership. He released a Concept Paper on Foreign Aid Reform and a discussion draft for a foreign aid reform bill in 2010, emphasizing reducing global poverty and involving the private sector. The draft proposed enhancing USAID's role in foreign aid programs, promoting private sector involvement, and establishing Development Support Funds to build local capacity in developing countries. Senator Kerry emphasized the importance of development in national security and suggested ways to strengthen USAID's relevance, including increased participation in Cabinet meetings and budget discussions. The USAID mission director would be responsible for coordinating all U.S. development and humanitarian assistance activities in recipient countries. Senator Lugar and Senator Kerry supported enhancing USAID's capacity to be the leading development agency and participate in policy, planning, and budgeting. They also proposed creating an independent evaluation group to measure the impact of U.S. foreign aid programs. The 2010 House Foreign Affairs Committee concept paper emphasized the need for comprehensive foreign aid reform before increasing funding. The 2010 House Foreign Affairs Committee emphasized the need for comprehensive foreign aid reform, including ending \"top-down approaches\" and promoting trade and investment programs. Legislation before the 111th Congress included provisions for efficiency, accountability, and objective criteria for aid recipient countries. The House passed the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 2010 and 2011 (H.R. 2410) containing Sec. 302, Quadrennial Review of Diplomacy and Development. This measure required the President to develop a national strategy on diplomacy and development by December 1, 2010, conduct a quadrennial review every four years, and consult with Congress on the strategy. S. 1524, the Foreign Assistance Revitalization and Accountability Act of 2009, introduced by Senator Kerry and Senator Lugar, aimed to re-establish a Bureau for Policy and Strategic Planning within USAID to develop development policy in line with U.S. objectives. The bill aimed to establish a Bureau for Policy and Strategic Planning within USAID to coordinate development policy and programs, integrate monitoring and evaluation, and strengthen U.S. foreign aid coordination overseas. It also proposed the creation of an Office for Learning, Evaluation, and Analysis in Development, an independent Council on Research and Evaluation of Foreign Assistance, and a center in USAID to assess program impact and effectiveness. The bill aimed to improve USAID's human resources capacity and promote transparency in U.S. aid by requiring the President to publish information on foreign assistance expenditures. It also urged participation in multilateral efforts for international aid transparency. The bill introduced on April 28, 2009, aimed to develop a \"National Strategy for Global Development\" and establish a monitoring and evaluation system for foreign assistance. It also emphasized transparency in U.S. aid by requiring the President to publish information on foreign assistance expenditures. Additionally, it urged participation in international efforts for aid transparency. The Policy and Assistance Act of 2009, introduced by Representative Ros-Lehtinen, aimed to improve foreign aid effectiveness and reduce costs by integrating budget requests with national security objectives. The 111th Congress failed to pass the legislation, but the 112th Congress may consider foreign aid reform. The QDDR and PSD's Presidential Policy Directive on Global Development could impact FY2012 foreign affairs funding. The Policy Directive on Global Development may affect the FY2012 foreign affairs budget and could lead to new legislation in the 112th Congress. Congressional action on foreign aid reform, whether incremental or comprehensive, could enhance the cost-effectiveness of foreign aid and provide better results in the future. This could garner support from American taxpayers, national security experts, and development advocates."
