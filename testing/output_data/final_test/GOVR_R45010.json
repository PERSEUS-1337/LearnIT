    "content": "Growing demands on the transportation system and constraints on public resources have led to calls for more private-sector involvement in transportation infrastructure through public-private partnerships (P3s). These partnerships are contractual agreements between a public agency and a private-sector entity, allowing for greater private-sector participation in the delivery and financing of transportation projects. The federal government influences the prevalence and structure of P3s through transportation programs, funding, and regulatory oversight, but is usually not a party to P3 agreements. This report discusses the benefits and limitations of P3s involving long-term private financing. The report discusses issues and policy options for public-private partnerships (P3s) in transportation infrastructure, including project evaluation, asset recycling, infrastructure banks, tax credits, tolling, and federal loan program changes. P3s involve private-sector participation in development, operation, and maintenance of facilities, contrasting with traditional public sector methods. Public-private partnerships (P3s) in transportation infrastructure involve various forms of private sector participation, such as design-build, design-build-finance, design-build-operate-maintain, and long-term lease agreements. DBFOM and long-term lease agreements are of particular interest, as they involve ongoing private sector management of facilities. DBFOM P3s encompass construction, operation, maintenance, and financing, with the private sector being repaid through user fees or government payments. The public-private partnerships in transportation infrastructure involve various forms of private sector participation, such as design-build, design-build-finance, design-build-operate-maintain, and long-term lease agreements. DBFOM P3s encompass construction, operation, maintenance, and financing, with the private sector being repaid through user fees or government payments. In long-term lease agreements, the private partner pays a concession fee to operate and maintain the facility to prescribed standards. In transportation infrastructure public-private partnerships, private firms operate and maintain facilities to standards in exchange for collecting tolls or user fees. An example is the Indiana Toll Road lease concession awarded to the Indiana Toll Road Concession Company for $3.8 billion. The public sector must establish legal and policy frameworks for implementing infrastructure projects through P3s. Ownership of the lease was transferred to IFM Investors after the bankruptcy of ITRCC in 2014. The public sector establishes legal and policy frameworks for implementing infrastructure projects through P3s, with 35 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico having enabling legislation. P3 implementation involves complex legal, financial, and technical issues, requiring public oversight and evaluation of projects through studies and risk assessments. The United States has a small number of transportation P3s with limited private financing. From 1993 to September 2017, there were 32 transportation P3s with total project costs of $45 billion, including projects like the Chicago Skyway lease and the LaGuardia Airport renovation. P3 deals have increased over time but still represent a small portion of transportation investment. Despite an increase in P3 deals over time, they remain a small percentage of transportation investment in the United States. The value of privately financed road contracts through 2012 was less than 1% of government highway spending. P3s currently make up about 2% of public infrastructure outlays, with larger usage in countries like Portugal, Spain, Australia, and the United Kingdom. Limited use in the US is attributed to the availability of municipal bonds with preferential tax treatment, allowing lower borrowing costs for state and local governments compared to private investors. Public-private partnerships (P3s) are a financing source that requires a revenue stream to service debt and provide returns on private equity. While the federal government can encourage P3 development, decisions are made at the state and local level. Many states lack experience with P3s, and some do not have enabling statutes. P3s attract private capital for transportation infrastructure investment, especially when public budgets are limited. This early investment opportunity may appeal to pension funds and foreign investors. Public-private partnerships (P3s) attract private capital for transportation infrastructure investment, appealing to pension funds and foreign investors. P3s allow for more efficient construction, maintenance, and operation of facilities, transferring risks to the private sector. Risks include higher operating costs and lower than expected demand for toll-financed facilities. The private sector may not save money by assuming risks in toll-financed projects, but it can provide greater certainty for the public sector. Concerns with P3s include project types, retained risks, and transportation planning. Private investors are attracted to projects with high financial returns adjusted for risk. P3s relying on tolls may not address transportation issues in rural areas, but could be viable with government availability payments. Public sectors may still retain significant risks in P3s. In some P3s, the public sector retains revenue risk, potentially leading to renegotiations or project ownership. Transportation P3s involving federal loans expose taxpayers to losses. P3s can influence transportation system decisions and may not align with state priorities. Noncompete clauses in P3 contracts can limit public improvements near privately operated facilities. The clauses in P3 contracts may restrict public improvements near privately operated facilities or require compensation, hindering public agencies' capacity and congestion management. Long concession agreement terms, up to 99 years, limit planners and policymakers' flexibility. Most transportation P3s involve highways or marine terminals, with few involving public transportation, rail, or airports. User fees for public transportation cover less than one-third of funding, posing challenges for rail projects. Private entities are hesitant to invest in such projects, leading the public sector to finance only a few transit projects through availability. The federal government encourages P3s and private financing in surface transportation through the TIFIA program, providing long-term, low-interest loans up to 49% of project costs for highways, bridges, public transportation, and intermodal facilities. TIFIA financing offers attractive features for project sponsors, including low fixed interest rates and flexible repayment terms. It can be used as senior or subordinate debt, with a provision for federal government equal treatment in case of project bankruptcy. TIFIA financing reduces project risk, aiding P3 partners in securing private financing at lower rates. Eligibility criteria include creditworthiness, project cost thresholds, and repayment with a dedicated revenue stream. The TIFIA program relies on market discipline to limit the federal government's exposure to losses by requiring loans to be repaid with a dedicated revenue stream. A small amount of budget authority can be leveraged into a large amount of loan capacity. The subsidy cost of credit assistance is covered by administrative costs, and a typical rule of thumb is that the average subsidy cost of a TIFIA loan is 10%. The FAST Act reduced direct funding for TIFIA loans to $285 million per year from FY2016 through FY2020, down from $1 billion per year in FY2014 and FY2015. States can now use funds from federal highway grant programs to cover subsidy and administrative costs, potentially increasing TIFIA financing beyond the direct authorization. Private activity bonds (PABs) are municipal bonds secured by project revenue. Private activity bonds (PABs) are municipal bonds secured by project revenue, specifically for transportation projects. Congress has approved limited use of tax-exempt PABs for selected transportation projects, including airports, mass commuting facilities, and highways. The Secretary of Transportation must approve PABs for qualified highway projects, with a total allocation limit of $15 billion. Examples of P3s partially financed with PABs include the Capital Beltway High Occupancy Toll Lanes project and the Gold Line transit rail project. The federal tax law affects P3s, including depreciation rules for physical assets. Private partners in P3s can depreciate assets over 15 years using MACRS's ADS, impacting project returns. Different depreciation schedules apply to various transportation assets, potentially providing a government subsidy. The depreciation period reduces the tax rate on income from investments, increasing after-tax returns for investors. State infrastructure banks (SIBs) provide financing for P3 projects, with many states and Puerto Rico having federally authorized SIBs. Some states have independent SIBs, and local governments like Chicago and Dauphin County, PA, are also attracting private investment for public works projects. Dauphin County, PA, has established an infrastructure bank to loan funds for public works projects to municipalities and private project sponsors. The bank is funded by a state tax on liquid fuels and can receive federal transportation funds. State infrastructure banks (SIBs) are mainly determined at the state level, with most housed within a state department of transportation. State infrastructure banks (SIBs) function as revolving loan funds, providing credit assistance to project sponsors through loans, bonds, letters of credit, lines of credit, and loan guarantees. They have not been significant in financing transportation projects and mainly assist local governments rather than private participants in P3s. Between 1995 and 2012, federal and nonfederal SIBs entered into about 1,100 agreements totaling $9 billion, averaging $8 million per agreement. Between 1995 and 2012, state infrastructure banks (SIBs) entered into approximately 1,100 agreements totaling $9 billion, averaging about $8 million per agreement. SIBs mainly assisted local governments with highway projects, while other types of projects accounted for the remaining activity. SIB activity varied widely among states, with a few states dominating the loans and agreement value. Factors such as limited capitalization and the lack of small, revenue-generating projects have contributed to the low level of SIB activity. The ability to generate sufficient revenue to repay a loan is a challenge for infrastructure projects. Public-private partnerships (P3s) may not work for smaller projects due to high procurement costs. Federal regulations on environmental review and prevailing wages can make projects funded by state infrastructure banks (SIBs) more expensive and time-consuming. Concerns also exist about how SIBs may impact a state's debt limit and credit rating. The Department of Transportation (DOT) has been tasked with supporting P3s by providing best practices, model contracts, and technical assistance. The FAST Act authorized the creation of a new bureau within DOT to consolidate federal transportation financing programs and support for P3s. The Department of Transportation (DOT) established the Build America Bureau in July 2016 to consolidate federal transportation financing programs and support for Public-Private Partnerships (P3s). The Bureau administers various programs and provides assistance to project sponsors with innovative financing, transparency of P3 agreements, and navigating environmental reviews and permitting. The federal government can influence Public-Private Partnerships (P3s) through policies and regulations, including providing incentives or imposing restrictions on projects involving federal funding. P3s offer benefits but also come with trade-offs and potential issues, such as concerns about private sector involvement and public subsidies. Public-Private Partnerships (P3s) can involve little private money or be subsidized by the public sector, with risk transfer to the private sector sometimes being illusory. Proponents of cautious view favor regulations to protect public interest, including evaluation of projects and transparency in negotiations. Concerns about undervaluing public assets and windfall private profits are common, with examples like the 75-year lease of parking meters in Chicago being undervalued by 46%. Government Accountability Office proposes rigorous analysis of costs and benefits, such as value-for-money analysis. A value-for-money analysis can help compare traditional public-sector procurement with Public-Private Partnerships (P3s) in terms of risk-adjusted life-cycle costs. This analysis can inform decisions on procurement approaches, risk allocation, and private sector bids. However, it relies on estimates and assumptions, including project costs and future interest rates. The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee's Special Panel on P3s recommended using this analysis for P3 projects with federal funding. Disclosure of information to the public at the right time in the decision-making process is crucial. The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee's Special Panel emphasized the importance of transparency in Public-Private Partnerships (P3s) involving federal funds. Information disclosure in highway P3s should include details like proposed contracts, toll rates, use of toll revenue, and administrative costs. Federal agencies are recommended to provide detailed information on tax benefits and asset depreciation allowances related to federal investment in P3 projects. The federal government could offer financial incentives for state and local governments to enter into long-term lease concessions of public assets and to \"recycle\" the proceeds from these deals into other infrastructure investments. Assets with the potential for leasing are those with user-fee revenue streams, such as toll roads and airports. New investments in infrastructure could involve facilities with or without such revenue streams, such as rural roads and transit systems. In Australia, the national government paid an incentive grant of 15% of the value of the asset to state and territorial governments to enter into such agreements. For example, the State of Victoria leased the Port of Melbourne for 50 years. The Australian asset recycling program involved leasing the Port of Melbourne for $10 billion to fund infrastructure projects. Criticisms included loss of control over assets, potential poor decisions, and favoritism towards states with large assets. Federal grants were also proposed to encourage public-private partnerships for new projects. A national infrastructure bank, or \"I-bank,\" could provide low-cost, long-term loans for P3 projects, similar to the TIFIA program. It could have more independence and specialized staff to oversee P3s, funded through appropriations or bond issuance. Several I-bank proposals have been introduced in the 115th Congress, including the National Infrastructure Development Bank Act of 2017 (H.R. 547), the Partnership to Build America Act of 2017 (H.R. 1669), and the BRIDGE Act (S. 1168). A federal financing fund could be established to administer all federal credit programs, improving consistency and avoiding conflicts of interest. Enhancing existing state infrastructure banks is also considered as an alternative to creating a national infrastructure bank. A national infrastructure bank could enhance state infrastructure banks by providing credit assistance for projects involving private partners. Capitalization has been a challenge for federally authorized SIBs due to committed grant funds. Various proposals, such as dedicating federal funds and issuing tax credit bonds, have been suggested but not enacted. To promote P3 development, the federal government could offer tax credits for equity investment in infrastructure projects. The Move America Act of 2017 proposes a 5% tax credit for investment in qualified infrastructure projects for 10 years. Critics argue that equity investment tax credits may benefit investors without increasing infrastructure investment, while others believe it could enhance project financing. Private activity bonds provide P3 projects access to municipal funding. Private activity bonds (PABs) offer P3 projects access to municipal bond market rates. The current law limits tax-exempt PABs for transportation projects to $15 billion, with $11 billion already allocated. Proposals aim to raise the cap, such as the Obama Administration's suggestion to increase it to $19 billion. Another proposal suggests standardizing tax rules for projects and uncapping the volume. The Move America Act of 2017 introduces Move America Bonds to incentivize P3s. Congress could also consider increasing direct funding for the TIFIA program, which was reduced under the FAST Act. The FAST Act reduced direct funding to the TIFIA program, allowing states to exchange formula grant funding for larger loans. Currently, the TIFIA program has $1.5 billion in unobligated budget authority. If the program runs out of direct funding in the future, states may need to use grant funding for loan costs. Streamlining the application process could improve TIFIA financing for P3 projects. User fees like tolls can generate revenue to repay project bonds and provide returns on investment. The need for reconstructing Interstates is likely to accelerate in the years ahead, with many projects running into the hundreds of millions of dollars. Congress could allow states to impose tolls on Interstates after reconstruction to facilitate P3 financing for these expensive \"mega-projects.\""
