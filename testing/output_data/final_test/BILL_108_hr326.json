The \"Fairness for American Investors Act of 2003\" introduces a shareholder credit system to eliminate double taxation on dividends for individuals. The credit allows taxpayers to offset tax liability by the amount of shareholder credits determined from domestic corporation dividends received during the taxable year, with limitations based on regular tax liability and minimum tax requirements. Nonresident aliens are not eligible for this credit unless the dividend is taxable under specific conditions. The \"Fairness for American Investors Act of 2003\" introduces a shareholder credit system to eliminate double taxation on dividends for individuals. SEC. 54A determines the shareholder credit. The shareholder credit system introduced by the \"Fairness for American Investors Act of 2003\" aims to prevent double taxation on dividends for individuals. The credit is calculated based on the ratio of a domestic corporation's post-2002 Federal income taxes to its post-2002 undistributed earnings. The term 'Federal income taxes' refers to any tax paid by the corporation under this chapter, with shareholder credits treated as taxes paid. Post-2002 undistributed earnings are the earnings and profits accumulated by the distributing corporation after December 31, 2002. Post-2002 undistributed earnings are determined as of the close of the taxable year in which the dividend is distributed, without diminution by dividends distributed during that year.
