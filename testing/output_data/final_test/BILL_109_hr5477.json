    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Innovations for our Nation's Vital Educational Needs for Technology Act\". The Congress acknowledges the importance of invention for economic wellbeing and quality of life. Disparities in societies' abilities to invent and adopt innovations must be maintained for the future wellbeing of the United States. While federal support for basic research has led to scientific discovery, it has been less effective in turning those discoveries into inventions. Education and societal support can enhance the process of invention and traits of the inventive mind. In formal education, every student deserves the opportunity to learn about the nature of invention and acquire basic skills and generative attitudes with appropriate societal support. The curriculum materials for inventiveness are outlined in Section 3. The National Science Foundation will establish a grant program to develop curriculum tools promoting inventiveness at various educational levels. The materials will focus on fostering inventive thinking by emphasizing adventure, excitement, and crossing boundaries of convention and disciplines. The National Science Foundation will establish a grant program to develop curriculum tools promoting inventiveness at various educational levels. This includes strengthening aspects of the education process that enhance creativity and technological inventiveness, such as open-ended problem-solving assignments, studying the social and political implications of inventions, seeking research projects and collaborations, and providing appropriate supporting infrastructure for teachers to utilize new technologies. Initiatives to involve young people in the invention process include supporting teams in high schools and colleges to invent products, design-oriented activities in engineering courses, and fostering hands-on activities for all students. The National Science Foundation aims to promote inventive creativity through engineering courses, community centers for invention, teacher workshops, and networks of innovators and entrepreneurs. The National Science Foundation will disseminate curriculum tools developed under this section through workshops and other measures. SEC. 4. INVENTIVENESS PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN. The National Science Foundation will implement a public awareness campaign promoting invention and inventiveness through events, awards, and prizes. SEC. 5. ENGINEERING AND SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH PROGRAM ON INVENTION. The National Science Foundation will establish engineering and social science research programs focusing on the process of invention and teaching of inventiveness. The programs will delve into understanding the creative mind, measuring inventiveness, studying flexible learning environments, and assessing the impact of past educational support on inventive creativity. The National Science Foundation will establish research programs focusing on the process of invention and teaching of inventiveness. The programs will study the major societal sectors influencing inventions, intersector interactions, patent laws, and the impact of inventions on sustainable development in poorer regions."
