    "content": "Between 2009 and the end of 2016, the U.S.-South Korea alliance was strong, especially in cooperation on North Korea policy. Despite changes in leadership with Trump and Moon Jae-in, the alliance is expected to endure, with a commitment to defend South Korea reiterated by top U.S. officials. During a summit meeting in June 2017, the U.S. and South Korea emphasized their shared approach to North Korea amidst escalating provocations. This led to closer security cooperation, including joint military exercises and the deployment of a U.S. missile defense battery. The U.S. and South Korea discussed amending missile guidelines, with potential policy differences on North Korea. President Moon proposed dialogue initiatives while Trump's administration increased pressure on Pyongyang. Despite agreeing not to attack North Korea, preemptive measures were mentioned. The Trump Administration has openly discussed the possibility of a preemptive military strike on North Korea and is pressuring South Korea to address the U.S. trade deficit and increase defense spending. President Trump has emphasized the need for all U.S. allies, including those in the Pacific, to \"pay their fair share of the cost.\" The Trump Administration is pressuring South Korea to address the U.S. trade deficit and increase defense spending. President Trump has emphasized the need for allies to \"pay their fair share of the cost.\" Bilateral policy coordination between the two countries may have become more difficult under the Trump and Moon administrations, raising questions about prior consultation on issues such as North Korea, security policy, and trade. South Korea elected Moon as president in May 2017, with a high voter turnout. The election occurred earlier than scheduled due to the impeachment of former President Park. Moon's focus is on economic growth, social welfare, and political reform. Moon, a human rights lawyer and former chief of staff to President Roh Moo-hyun, was elected as South Korea's president in May 2017. He advocates for South Korea to take a leading role in North Korea policy and increase military spending for an independent defense posture. Moon also emphasizes the importance of the ROK-U.S. alliance and placing conditions on engagement initiatives with North Korea. His public approval ratings have been high, ranging from 75% to 85%. On June 29-30, 2017, Presidents Trump and Moon met in Washington, DC, reaffirming their commitment to the U.S.-South Korea alliance. They shared the same goal on North Korea and supported each other's approaches. President Moon backed the \"maximum pressure\" approach to Pyongyang, while President Trump supported South Korea's leading role in fostering peaceful unification of the Korean Peninsula. They also discussed restarting dialogue with North Korea. The joint statement between Presidents Trump and Moon focused on North Korea and trade issues, with little mention of the KORUS FTA. President Trump emphasized the need to renegotiate parts of the FTA to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with South Korea. The absence of mention of the FTA raises questions about the alignment of U.S. government positions in bilateral discussions. The controversy over delaying the deployment of a U.S. missile defense system in South Korea was not publicly addressed, suggesting a possible understanding between the two sides. President Trump also mentioned a planned visit to South Korea later in 2017. During his visit to the United States, President Moon met with Members of Congress and visited the National Museum of the Marine Corps in Quantico, VA. He laid a wreath at a memorial commemorating the Korean War battle at the Chosin Reservoir, where over 10,000 U.S. troops were killed or wounded. The battle delayed a North Korean and Chinese advance, allowing U.S. forces to rescue tens of thousands of refugees, including President Moon's parents. Presidents Trump and Moon also met during the G-20 summit in Hamburg, where they pledged to work towards denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Dealing with North Korea is a key focus of the U.S.-South Korean relationship, with a joint goal of denuclearization. The two countries have maintained tight coordination on North Korea policy, emphasizing sanctions and military cooperation. They aim for complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization through a high-level strategic consultation mechanism. The U.S. and South Korea aim for denuclearization of North Korea through close coordination and a high-level strategic consultation mechanism. They apply maximum pressure on Pyongyang to return to talks, with the door to dialogue remaining open under the right circumstances. President Trump supports South Korea's leading role in fostering peaceful unification and restarting inter-Korean dialogue. The Trump Administration initiated a review of U.S. North Korea policy, aiming to pressure North Korea into dismantling its nuclear programs through economic sanctions and diplomatic measures with allies. Challenges may arise in future policy coordination efforts due to differing interpretations of joint statements on security dialogue with North Korea. Coordination between the U.S. and South Korea will be key in embarking on specific policy initiatives. The Trump Administration has taken aggressive steps to implement U.S. sanctions against North Korea, including targeting Chinese financial entities and urging other countries to reduce economic interactions with Pyongyang. Secretary of State Tillerson emphasized the goal of pressuring North Korea to de-escalate and engage in dialogue without nuclear weapons. The Administration's approach is seen as a departure from the Obama Administration's \"strategic patience,\" focusing on expanding sanctions and China's role in the process. The Trump Administration has escalated efforts to impose sanctions on North Korea, emphasizing China's role in pressuring Pyongyang. President Trump has prioritized the North Korea threat, accelerated U.S. action, and linked cooperation on North Korea to other aspects of U.S.-China relations. North Korea's continued missile tests in 2017 have heightened concerns about its WMD programs. In 2017, North Korea made advancements in its nuclear weapons program, with the Defense Intelligence Agency predicting they could deploy a nuclear-tipped ICBM in 2018. The U.S. passed sanctions to counter North Korea's weapons programs, and President Trump criticized North Korea for its reckless actions, including an assassination attempt using a banned chemical and the release of a detained U.S. student in a coma. In 2017, North Korea made advancements in its nuclear weapons program, with the Defense Intelligence Agency predicting they could deploy a nuclear-tipped ICBM in 2018. The U.S. passed sanctions to counter North Korea's weapons programs, and President Trump criticized North Korea for its reckless actions. Otto Warmbier, a detained U.S. student, returned to the United States in a coma after suffering brain trauma in North Korea and died shortly after. Efforts to secure Warmbier's release involved interactions between U.S. and North Korean diplomats, with an emphasis on pressuring China to implement UN sanctions. President Trump has called on China to use its leverage to pressure North Korea, but has also expressed doubts about Beijing's effectiveness in this regard. In late June 2017, FinCEN issued a rule prohibiting U.S. financial institutions from maintaining accounts for the Bank of Dandong, a Chinese bank linked to North Korea's weapons programs. OFAC also sanctioned a Chinese shipping company and individuals for aiding North Korea. The Trump Administration approved an arms sales package to Taiwan, leading to concerns about inconsistent remarks on North Korea. The Trump Administration's remarks on North Korea have been inconsistent, especially regarding pre-conditions for negotiations and the possibility of a preemptive attack. South Koreans are concerned about the potential for a military conflict. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Joseph Dunford, mentioned the possibility of military options to address North Korea's nuclear capabilities, emphasizing the goal of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula through non-military means. The Trump Administration has shown inconsistency in its approach towards North Korea, including willingness to engage in talks while also developing military options. President Moon has a history of promoting inter-Korean dialogue. The Administration initially approved visa requests for North Korean officials to visit the U.S. but later reversed the decision due to concerns over North Korea's actions. President Moon, known for promoting inter-Korean engagement, aims to reopen the Kaesong Industrial Complex and aligns his approach with the Trump Administration's stance on applying pressure on North Korea. President Moon aligns his approach with the Trump Administration's stance on engaging North Korea through dialogue alongside sanctions and pressure. He is willing to meet with Kim Jong-un under the right conditions, emphasizing the need for denuclearization policy and inter-Korean initiatives to operate on parallel tracks. President Moon is willing to meet with Kim Jong-un at any time and place if conditions are met to ease tension on the Korean Peninsula. He has lifted restrictions on South Korean NGOs contacting North Korea and proposed dialogues on family reunions and military tension reduction in the DMZ. North Korea has dismissed Moon's proposals, while the Trump Administration believes conditions for talks are far from being met. The Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated that now is not the time for talks with North Korea, but to apply pressure. This lack of coordination in messaging between the United States, South Korea, and Japan suggests differing views on when to propose talks. There are debates in South Korea about potentially building nuclear weapons due to concerns about North Korea's long-range missiles. However, South Korea's Defense Minister mentioned they are not considering nuclear weapons but are exploring the possibility of nuclear-powered submarines, which would require negotiations with the United States. Producing nuclear fuel for submarines would require negotiations with the United States. President Moon's government agreed to deploy the U.S. THAAD missile defense system in South Korea after North Korea's missile test. The deployment was initially delayed for an environmental impact assessment but was reversed. Moon had previously suspended the installation of launchers in the batteries. President Moon's government agreed to deploy the U.S. THAAD missile defense system in South Korea earlier than planned due to North Korea's missile launches. Critics, including some within the Moon Administration, questioned the decision after President Trump suggested South Korea should pay for the system. However, Trump's National Security Advisor clarified that the U.S. would cover the cost. This raised suspicions among some South Koreans about future financial obligations. Some South Koreans suspect the US may ask them to cover the cost of the THAAD system deployed in South Korea. The system's estimated cost ranges from $800 million to $1.6 billion. Local residents near the deployment site protested due to health concerns related to THAAD's X-band radar. China warned of consequences for the US and South Korea over the deployment. Chinese state media have encouraged consumers to boycott South Korean companies and tourism officials have ceased booking trips to South Korea. Chinese officials have suspended operations at Lotte retail stores in China. Lotte previously owned the land for the THAAD battery, which was transferred to the Korean government in 2017. Secretary Tillerson criticized China's economic retaliation against South Korea. President Moon urged China to help settle differences over the deployment by asking North Korea to cease provocations. The Trump Administration has expressed disappointment with the outcomes of the KORUS FTA and requested a meeting to discuss potential modifications. South Korea requested a delay in the meeting to finish a restructuring, including establishing a Trade Office and new Minister for Trade. MOTIE also asked for a joint evaluation of the agreement's effects on bilateral trade. The Trump Administration has requested a joint evaluation of the KORUS FTA's impact on bilateral trade with South Korea. The focus is on the U.S. trade deficit growth, but economists suggest other factors are at play. The extent of potential modifications to the agreement is unclear, with Congress having a key role in any negotiations. The Trump Administration has requested a joint evaluation of the KORUS FTA's impact on bilateral trade with South Korea. Congress highlighted its authorities and expectations for consultation regarding any changes to the agreement. The Administration has not officially notified Congress of its intent to negotiate with South Korea, which would be required under Trade Promotion Authority for expedited legislative procedures. President Moon's Minjoo party opposed the signing of the General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) between South Korea and Japan in 2012, but Moon has upheld the agreement since assuming the presidency. This agreement could institutionalize trilateral defense cooperation with the United States in response to North Korea's provocations. President Moon has upheld the GSOMIA agreement between South Korea and Japan since assuming the presidency. Tensions between Seoul and Tokyo may rise over historical issues, particularly the \"comfort women\" agreement, with calls for renegotiation from prominent politicians. Comfort women statues have been erected in South Korea, mirroring those in Seoul, as a symbol of protest. In response to South Korea's comfort women agreement, Japan withdrew its ambassador and suspended talks on a currency swap agreement. President Moon spoke with Prime Minister Abe, expressing South Koreans' rejection of the agreement without using the word \"renegotiation.\" A task force was created to review the agreement, with the assessment expected by the end of 2017. A strained relationship between Seoul and Tokyo could impact U.S. interests. A strained relationship between Seoul and Tokyo could impact U.S. interests, including trilateral cooperation over North Korea policy and responding to China. Some analysts suggest the U.S. should get more involved in improving relations between South Korea and Japan. Congress has passed bills encouraging greater trilateral cooperation. Five factors drive the U.S.-South Korea relationship, including challenges posed by North Korea. The challenges in U.S.-South Korea relations include North Korea's weapons programs, concerns about the Kim Jong-un regime's threat, China's influence in Northeast Asia, South Korea's economic growth and trade disputes, democratization, and South Korea's desire to use its middle-power status. South Korean leaders aim to leverage their middle-power status for a larger regional and global role. People-to-people ties, including 1.8 million Korean Americans and frequent trips between the two nations, strengthen the relationship. Past South Korean presidents have addressed joint meetings of Congress, showing strong support for the U.S.-ROK alliance. Opinion polls consistently show that South Koreans view the United States favorably. Many South Koreans view the United States favorably, but some resent U.S. influence and are wary of being drawn into policies that may antagonize China. Progressive groups in South Korea, like President Moon's Minjoo Party, express concerns about U.S. alliances and are critical of past leaders' approaches towards North Korea. The U.S. and South Korea have been allies since the Korean War, with strong people-to-people ties and support for the alliance. The United States and South Korea signed a Mutual Defense Treaty in 1953, following the Korean War. South Korea has supported U.S. military campaigns in Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan, deploying troops in noncombat roles. South Korea's rapid economic growth since the 1960s has elevated it to one of the world's largest industrialized countries. South Korea's economic growth and transition to democracy have elevated it to a mid-level regional power that influences U.S. policy in Northeast Asia, particularly regarding North Korea. South Korea's increasing economic, diplomatic, and military power has given it a more prominent role in U.S. planning on dealing with Pyongyang. However, North Korea's progress in developing the capacity to strike the U.S. directly complicates the security dynamics between the two countries. The United States' security is closely tied to South Korea's influence on North Korea. U.S. policymakers may feel the need to act unilaterally in response to perceived threats. Previous administrations adopted a joint approach with South Korea towards Pyongyang, known as \"strategic patience,\" which included conditions for restarting talks with North Korea and efforts to change China's strategic assessment. The United States and South Korea have adopted a containment strategy towards North Korea, focusing on increasing international pressure and tightening sanctions. However, critics argue that this approach allows Pyongyang to control the situation and continue developing its nuclear and missile programs. President Park's hardened approach in 2016 came in response to North Korea's provocations. The joint U.S.-ROK approach towards North Korea involved elements of engagement and pressure, with emphasis on pressure tactics during times of increased tension. Tension escalated after Lee Myung-bak's inauguration in February 2008, leading to multiple North Korean nuclear tests and long-range rocket launches. President Park's initiatives aimed to rectify perceived shortcomings in dealing with North Korea, but the country's refusal hindered the implementation of her policies. The 2010 sinking of the South Korean naval vessel Cheonan, the November 2010 North Korean artillery attack on Yeonpyeong Island, and the August 2015 landmine explosion blamed on North Korea near the DMZ heightened tensions. President Lee considered retaliatory air strikes but was restrained by rules of engagement and the US-ROK alliance. The response to the Yeonpyeong attack was criticized as insufficient, with limited military action taken. In 2016, Park Geun-hye focused on boosting deterrence against North Korea and vowed to retaliate if attacked. Washington and Seoul passed UNSC resolutions to expand sanctions, launched a global campaign against North Korea, and announced the deployment of a missile defense system in South Korea. In 2016, South Korea implemented a ballistic missile defense system and shut down the Kaesong Industrial Complex, a significant source of revenue for North Korea. Additionally, the US passed the North Korea Sanctions Enforcement Act in response to North Korea's nuclear test. President Obama signed H.R. 757 / P.L. 114-122, expanding U.S. sanctions against North Korea. The Obama Administration took steps to implement the act, including designating North Korea as a money laundering concern and holding Kim Jong-un responsible for human rights violations. Inter-Korean relations have been strained since the 2010 attacks, with President Park proposing projects to build trust between the two Koreas. President Park proposed initiatives to build trust between North and South Korea, including dialogues and projects. She aimed to deter North Korea's provocations by strengthening South Korea's defense capabilities while promoting small-scale dialogues. The Obama Administration supported her \"trustpolitik\" policy, allowing Seoul to lead in dealing with North Korea. President Park proposed initiatives to build trust between North and South Korea, including reunions for families separated since the Korean War, linking rail systems and ports, and launching assistance programs. Despite some positive responses in 2015, North Korea mostly did not cooperate. Relations worsened in 2016 after North Korea's nuclear test and missile launch, leading to South Korea imposing unilateral sanctions. Elite defections also increased in 2016. In October 2016, President Park of South Korea encouraged North Koreans to defect to the South for freedom. South Korea and the United States aimed to accelerate change in North Korea by pressuring for human rights improvements and increasing outside information penetration. North Korea responded with threats and personal attacks against President Park. Relations between the two Koreas worsened in 2016 due to North Korea's provocations. South Korea unlikely to provide direct humanitarian assistance to North Korea due to continued provocations. South Korean National Assembly passed a North Korean human rights bill in March 2016. The bill requires a human rights promotion plan and establishes a foundation to document North Korean human rights abuses. U.S.-ROK cooperation on North Korea may be influenced by Pyongyang's progress in missile and nuclear programs. President Obama reassured South Korea and Japan of the U.S. security guarantee, including extended deterrence. South Korea stated they would respond strongly to North Korean provocations, with plans to strike the origin of attacks. U.S. and ROK militaries have been preparing since 2015. Since 2015, the U.S. and South Korea have developed new war plans to target North Korean WMD facilities and leadership in emergencies. South Korean leaders have become more open to using force against North Korea since the 2010 shelling of Yeonpyeong Island. The alliance has adopted a \"proactive deterrence\" approach for more flexible responses to future attacks, including relaxing restrictions on South Korean ballistic missiles and rules of engagement. South Korean Defense Minister announced a plan to strike Pyongyang and North Korean leadership in case of a nuclear attack. Concerns have risen about potential escalation from small-scale North Korean provocations. U.S. defense officials emphasize strong communication in the alliance for new contingencies. The 2013 \"Counter-Provocation Plan\" was developed to address new threats from North Korea and South Korea's changing attitudes towards retaliation. Debate in South Korea about developing its own nuclear weapons capability has been reignited due to North Korea's nuclear tests and missile launches. Debates in South Korea have reignited about developing nuclear weapons capability despite reliance on the U.S. \"nuclear umbrella.\" A poll showed 65% in favor of nuclearization, the highest level since 2010. Following North Korea's nuclear test, there were calls for South Korea to consider developing nuclear weapons. In 2016, a report suggested South Korea should bring back U.S. tactical nuclear weapons, which were removed in 1991. President Trump supported South Korea developing its own nuclear arsenal to counter North Korea. However, analysts warn of negative consequences like high costs, reduced international standing, and potential sanctions. This move could also prompt Japan to pursue nuclear weapons. South Korea developing nuclear weapons could diminish U.S. influence in Asia and unravel the U.S. alliance system. The U.S. reassured South Korea of its security guarantee and established an Extended Deterrence Strategy and Consultation Group. The 1953 Mutual Defense Treaty binds the U.S. and South Korea as allies. The U.S. maintains a continuous military presence in South Korea to help defend against aggression from the North. South Korea is under the U.S. \"nuclear umbrella\" and has over 625,000 troops in its armed forces. The U.S. Air Force has increased its strength in South Korea through regular rotations of advanced strike aircraft since 2004. South Korea plans to reduce its armed forces by one-fifth by 2022. The country had the 10th largest defense budget in the world in 2015, constituting 2.4% of its GDP. Public support for the U.S.-South Korea military alliance has grown stronger in recent years despite occasional tensions. Tensions in the U.S.-ROK alliance arise over burden sharing, cost overruns, and sovereignty concerns. President Trump's push for allies to contribute more could strain the relationship. The alliance has evolved to a regional partnership, with increased planning for contingencies due to North Korean provocations. The U.S. and South Korea have enhanced their defense partnership through joint military exercises and high-level meetings since adopting a \"proactive deterrence\" policy in 2011. This includes the participation of U.S. bombers in exercises in South Korea in response to North Korean provocations. The alliance has also expanded cooperation beyond Korean issues. The U.S. and South Korea have strengthened their defense partnership through joint military exercises and high-level meetings since 2011. This includes a range of cooperative initiatives on cybersecurity, space, missile defense, nuclear safety, climate change, Ebola, and issues in the Middle East. The Korea-U.S. Integrated Defense Dialogue (KIDD) holds biannual meetings at the Deputy Minister level, with the latest meeting in Seoul in September 2016. The Security Consultative Meeting (SCM) between the Secretary of Defense and Ministry of National Defense reaffirms the alliance, analyzes key threats, and discusses mutual interests like the Opcon transition plan. The decision to deploy the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense missile defense system was made in July 2016. The decision to deploy the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense missile defense system in South Korea in July 2016 came after years of consideration and controversy. The U.S. Department of Defense had been exploring this option since 2014 due to the increasing threat of North Korean ballistic missiles. The United States and South Korea aimed to enhance their BMD capabilities to protect South Korea and U.S. forces. U.S. officials pushed for advanced BMD capabilities that are interoperable with allied systems, with some preferring an integrated regional missile defense system. South Korea initially resisted the idea of a regional integrated missile defense system due to desires for strategic autonomy, concerns about irritating China, and strained relations with Japan. They are developing their own missile defense system called Korea Air and Missile Defense (KAMD), which would be interoperable with alliance systems. South Korea is developing the Korea Air and Missile Defense (KAMD) system, which would be interoperable with alliance systems. The Ministry of National Defense announced a budget of $703 million to develop KAMD and Kill Chain within the next 10 years. South Korea plans to upgrade its Patriot Air and Missile Defense System batteries and PAC-2 interceptors, with a goal to upgrade to PAC-3 versions by 2022. Additionally, a PAC-3 interceptor unit was briefly transferred from U.S. Forces Japan to South Korea for joint training drills in July 2016. After the North Korean satellite launch in February 2016, U.S. and ROK officials considered deploying THAAD to South Korea, causing backlash from China and Russia. China raised concerns about THAAD's radar capabilities, fearing it could compromise their airspace. The Chinese ambassador warned of damaging the China-ROK relationship if THAAD was deployed. South Korean officials defended THAAD's utility in intercepting North Korean missiles. The planned realignment of U.S. forces from bases near the DMZ border with North Korea to bases farther south is progressing, with challenges remaining in USFK force posture. Troop levels are at about 28,500, and there is a shift towards a supporting role for USFK. The relocation plan involves transferring personnel to the new base in Pyeongtaek, including moving troops from the Yongsan base to USAG Humphreys and the Second Infantry Division from the demilitarized zone. The relocation of 10,000 troops from the Second Infantry Division to areas south of the Han River will result in a decrease in USFK sites from 174 to 96. The majority of U.S. forces will be concentrated in Osan Air Base/USAG Humphreys and USAG Daegu. U.S. counter-fires forces near the DMZ will not relocate until South Korea's reinforcement plan is completed around 2020. Dongducheon has protested this decision and withdrawn some cooperation with the U.S. Army. The relocations to Pyeongtaek were originally scheduled for completion in 2008. The relocations to Pyeongtaek were originally scheduled for completion in 2008 but have been postponed multiple times due to slow construction and financial difficulties. USFK commander stated that 65% of the relocation program was complete by the end of 2015, with majority of unit relocations expected by 2018. The cost estimates for the relocation program have increased from over $10 billion to over $13 billion, with South Korea funding 91% of the total $10.7 billion cost. The Defense Department is reexamining housing plans at USAG Humphreys, with the goal of phasing out one-year unaccompanied tours in South Korea for longer accompanied or unaccompanied tours. The development of the Yongsan Relocation Plan is complicated by the announcement in 2008 that U.S. military families would be allowed to join personnel in South Korea. The plan to normalize tours for U.S. troops in South Korea has faced strong opposition from some Members of Congress. The Senate Armed Services Committee passed amendments to prevent funds for tour normalization until a complete plan is provided to Congress. The Department of Defense has stopped pursuing Tour Normalization as an initiative for Korea since 2013. The Department of Defense has halted the initiative for Tour Normalization in Korea since 2013. USFK prioritized readiness improvements over tour normalization due to affordability concerns. A 2013 SASC report criticized the policy change for being costly and questioned the legality of DOD's housing allowance calculations. The U.S. Army implemented a program of rotating units to South Korea for a nine-month tour of duty instead of permanently basing combat units there. Defense analysts have debated the cost and effectiveness of rotational forces compared to permanently assigned forces, with the latter being favored for their familiarity with South Korea's terrain and climatic conditions. The Army suggests benefits of employing rotational forces in South Korea instead of permanently assigned units, citing reduced turnover and increased readiness. Since 1991, South Korea has provided financial support for U.S. forces stationed there. South Korea has been providing financial support for U.S. forces stationed in the country since 1991. In 2014, a new agreement was reached where Seoul increased its contribution by 6% to 920 billion Korean won ($867 million) and agreed to raise annual payments in line with inflation. South Korea also paid for the relocation of U.S. bases within the country and construction of new military facilities, totaling $9.74 billion. The new agreement aims to make the use of South Korean funds by the U.S. more transparent. The new SMA increases transparency in U.S. use of South Korean funds. ROK Ministry of Defense must approve contracts using SMA funds, and USFK submits annual reports to KIDD co-chairs. Korean lawmakers criticize the agreement as \"humiliating\" and express concerns about potential misuse of funds. The transfer of wartime command of Korean troops to South Korea has been postponed. The plan to transfer wartime operational control from U.S. forces to South Korean soldiers is seen as important for South Korean sovereignty. Progressive parties in South Korea support hastening the transition, citing the influence of the U.S. presence on North Korea's military buildup. The U.S.-ROK Combined Forces Command is to be replaced with separate U.S. and ROK military commands, with the provisional name of the new U.S. command being Korea Command (KORCOM). The plan to transfer wartime operational control from U.S. forces to South Korean soldiers is progressing. A bilateral Military Cooperation Center will handle military operations, exercises, logistics, and intelligence exchanges. The U.N. Command's role in the future arrangement is uncertain. South Korea aims to transfer Opcon in 2023, with the completion of the Korean Air and Missile Defense System by 2020 being a crucial step. $1.36 billion will be invested in the KAMD system in 2017. Concerns arose about the timing of transferring wartime operational control from U.S. to South Korean forces due to worries about military readiness and potential North Korean threats. The decision to delay the transfer was made to assess South Korean military capabilities and the security environment on the Korean Peninsula. This flexible approach was announced in a joint statement by the United States and South Korea in October 2014. The delay in transferring Opcon could be seen as adapting to changes on the Korean Peninsula or indicative of alliance decision challenges. General Scaparrotti outlined conditions for the transfer, including South Korea's need to enhance command capabilities and address North Korea's threats. The transfer may not happen until 2020 or later, with a focus on improving South Korea's C4, BMD, munitions, and ISR assets. South Korea's Ministry of National Defense aims to facilitate Opcon transfer by the mid-2020s, enhancing command capabilities and addressing North Korea's threats. South Korea is a major purchaser of U.S. weapon systems, with acquisitions totaling $22.5 billion from 2008 to 2016. South Korea is set to purchase 40 Lockheed Martin F-35 fighters at a cost of $7.83 billion, with the first delivery scheduled for 2018. The decision was made after the Ministry of National Defense rejected the Boeing F-15SE fighter due to cost concerns, opting for the F-35's advanced stealth capability. The transfer of advanced defense technologies to South Korea was a key factor in the contract with Lockheed Martin. The U.S. denied the transfer of key defense technologies to South Korea, causing a minor scandal in 2015. Concerns about exploiting U.S. technology led to the denial of advanced electronic scanner array technology. South Korea also plans to purchase four RQ-4 \"Global Hawk\" UAVs for $657 million. The Obama Administration faced concerns over the sale of four RQ-4 \"Global Hawk\" UAVs to South Korea for $657 million, with calls to ensure they are used only for reconnaissance. South Korea's Defense Reform 2020 initiative aims to develop indigenous defense capabilities by increasing funding for research and development. This increase in defense spending is tied to strategic objectives, including the integration of Korea Air and Missile Defense. South Korea aims to integrate its defense plans with USFK systems, improve defense industry competitiveness, and expand international arms sales, including to Southeast Asia. Reported reliability issues with certain systems pose a challenge. Lockheed Martin and Korea Aerospace Industries collaborated on the successful T-50 Golden Eagle aircraft. Recent sales include FA-50 aircraft to the Philippines and submarines to Indonesia. The 110th Congress passed legislation upgrading South Korea's arms purchaser status to NATO Plus Three, increasing the notification threshold for arms sales to $25 million. South Korea's relations with China and Japan are a mix of interdependence and rivalry. Trilateral cooperation among South Korea, China, and Japan increased after the 2008 global financial crisis, with annual summits, a trilateral secretariat, and FTA negotiations. Tensions between South Korea and Japan, and China and Japan, halted this cooperation until 2015. Despite the freeze, trilateral FTA negotiations continued, and relations between South Korea and Japan improved in 2015. Relations between South Korea and Japan improved in 2015, attributed to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's diplomatic approach and former President Park's decision to ease tensions. However, disagreements over historical issues continue to strain the U.S. policy options in Northeast Asia. The relationship between South Korea and Japan is challenged by historical disagreements, conflicting territorial claims, and economic competition. Some analysts suggest increased U.S. involvement to improve relations between the two countries, which is important for regional stability and coordination on North Korea policy. Despite growing cooperation, there are ongoing challenges in enhancing relations between South Korea and Japan. Despite growing cooperation, historical and territorial issues continue to strain the relationship between South Korea and Japan. South Koreans feel Japan has not adequately acknowledged its history of aggression, including the recruitment of \"comfort women\" during the 1930s and 1940s. This lingering mistrust hinders progress in the relationship. South Koreans' reluctance to form new institutional arrangements with Japan is influenced by domestic factors such as historical suspicions, sovereignty disputes over Dokdo/Takeshima, and the need for Chinese cooperation on North Korea. This caution is driven by concerns about Japan's historical denial and China's role in the region. China's influence over South Korean foreign and economic policy is significant, especially in relation to North Korea. China's support or opposition can shape South Korea's approaches to North Korea in both short and long term scenarios. North Korea's growing dependence on China has led South Korea to consider Beijing's actions and intentions in its North Korea policy. China's influence on South Korean foreign policy, particularly regarding North Korea, is significant. South Korea aims to align China's strategic interests with Seoul and Washington, rather than Pyongyang. Concerns arise over China's economic pull on North Korea and its support for Pyongyang, leading to tensions with South Koreans, especially conservatives. Issues such as China's treatment of North Korean refugees further strain bilateral relations. Since China's entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001, it has become South Korea's most important economic partner, accounting for over 20% of its total trade. Despite being a key source of economic growth, China also poses as a significant economic competitor to South Korea. The two countries signed a bilateral FTA in 2015, and China remains the top location for South Korean firms' foreign direct investment. There have been calls for a trilateral strategic dialogue among South Korea, the United States, and China to address various situations involving North Korea. South Korea's push for FTAs with major trading partners is driven by fears of competition with Chinese enterprises. Despite China being a key economic partner, South Korean officials are hesitant to publicly criticize Chinese behavior. Calls for South Korea to be more vocal about China's assertive actions in the South China Sea were made during the Obama Administration. In 2015, South Korean cabinet officials made oblique criticisms of China's actions in the South China Sea. Increased tensions between South Korea and China over fishing rights in the Yellow Sea have led to a rise in Chinese fishing vessels in disputed waters, causing concerns for South Korean fishermen. The presence of these vessels raises the risk of clashes between South Korean and North Korean coast guard or naval vessels in the area. Increased tensions between South Korea and China over fishing rights in the Yellow Sea have led to a rise in Chinese fishing vessels in disputed waters, particularly around the Northern Limit Line (NLL) that South Korea claims as the maritime boundary. In 2016, North Korea sold fishing rights to Chinese fishermen for foreign currency. The United Nations Command (UNC) announced joint patrols with South Korea to enforce armistice restrictions on illegal fishing in the Han River Estuary, leading to clashes between South Korean coast guard vessels and Chinese fishing boats. Criticisms of China within South Korea grew due to perceived economic penalties on South Korean companies. In early 2017, China's favorability rating among South Koreans fell below Japan's, leading to tensions over economic penalties imposed on South Korean companies. South Korea and the United States have a significant economic partnership, with two-way trade totaling $145 billion in 2016. South Korea is more economically dependent on the United States than vice versa, with the US being South Korea's second-largest trading partner. South Korea's economic interdependence with the United States has become more complex over the years. In 2003, China became South Korea's top trading partner, displacing the United States. Japan and the European Union have also rivaled the United States as South Korea's trading partners. Despite this, South Korea's position among U.S. trading partners has remained consistent. South Korea's export-driven economy has led to trade friction with the United States, with U.S. antidumping and countervailing duties on South Korean imports like steel, polyester, chemicals, and washing machines. The Trump Administration has taken new actions on imports that may impact U.S. trade with South Korea, including self-initiating AD/CVD cases and trade investigations under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. The U.S. has initiated trade investigations under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, focusing on the impact of steel imports on national security. South Korea is a major supplier of U.S. steel imports. The KORUS FTA, in effect since 2012, has been central to U.S.-South Korean trade relations, with modifications made to the original agreement regarding auto and agricultural trade. The KORUS FTA has significantly increased tariff-free trade between the U.S. and South Korea, with 82% of U.S. tariff lines and 80% of South Korean tariff lines being duty free. By the 10th year of the agreement, it is expected that 99% and 98% of tariff lines will be eliminated. The agreement also includes high standards for financial services firms and aims to reduce nontariff barriers in goods trade and barriers in services trade and foreign investment. The KORUS FTA has led to increased trade between the U.S. and South Korea, with tariffs being reduced or eliminated. Market opening for legal services and foreign direct investment has also grown. Reviews of the agreement are mixed, with proponents citing enhanced competition and protection of intellectual property. The KORUS FTA has increased U.S. exports to South Korea, with lower import restrictions benefiting products like beef and automobiles. U.S. beef exports have risen from $649 million in 2011 to over $1 billion in 2016, while U.S. auto exports nearly doubled from $1.1 billion to $2.2 billion during the same period. South Korea's auto tariff was reduced from 8% to 4% and eliminated in 2016. U.S. exports of services have also increased by nearly $5 billion since the agreement took effect. Since the KORUS FTA took effect, there has been a mixed impact on U.S. trade with South Korea. While U.S. exports of certain products have increased, overall exports have not changed significantly since 2011. However, imports from South Korea have grown by over 20%, leading to a rise in the trade deficit. The majority of this deficit increase is attributed to auto trade, with U.S. goods imports from South Korea rising by about $13 billion from 2011 to 2016. The elimination of the 2.5% U.S. car tariff in 2016 led to a significant increase in auto imports. Attributing changes in trade flows to the KORUS FTA is challenging due to various factors like tariff reductions, business cycle fluctuations, and growth rates. South Korean imports from top trading partners have declined since 2011, indicating slower economic growth. Without the agreement, the U.S. trade deficit with South Korea would have been even higher according to 2015 data. The Trump Administration has criticized the KORUS FTA for increasing the U.S. trade deficit with South Korea. Vice President Pence and President Trump have expressed concerns over the imbalance and are renegotiating the trade deal. There is ambiguity over specific measures to decrease the deficit. The Trump Administration has criticized the KORUS FTA for increasing the U.S. trade deficit with South Korea and is seeking to renegotiate the trade deal. There is ambiguity over which aspects of the agreement may be considered for renegotiation, with Congress playing a key role in any official negotiations. The Administration has not yet notified Congress of its intent to begin negotiations, potentially signaling a limited scope for talks. The deficit has been highlighted as a key concern in the call for a special session of the Joint Committee, although most economists argue that trade agreement provisions are unlikely to have a significant impact on the trade deficit. The Trump Administration is seeking to renegotiate the KORUS FTA due to the U.S. trade deficit with South Korea. Investigations are ongoing regarding trade deficit partners and existing agreements, including South Korea. Concerns exist over South Korea's implementation of the KORUS FTA commitments, with some arguing for a renegotiation based on slow implementation and non-compliance. The U.S. has raised concerns about South Korea's implementation of the KORUS FTA, including issues with origin verifications, auto regulations, data flows, transparency, pricing, pharmaceuticals, and competition enforcement targeting foreign firms. South Korea's enforcement agency has been accused of unfairly targeting foreign firms in recent antitrust activities, potentially violating KORUS FTA obligations. Despite challenges, the FTA provides a formal venue to address bilateral frictions. South Korean firms heavily rely on international markets, with exports accounting for half of GDP, making the country susceptible to global economic fluctuations. South Korea's economy dipped into recession but recovered to 6.5% growth in 2010 with government stimulus. Growth has since hovered around 3%, but remains vulnerable to slowdowns in major export markets. The government has used monetary and fiscal stimulus to support the economy, including a $17 billion package in 2016. The country's post-2008-crisis growth average of 3% is lower than the pre-crisis average of 5%, posing a policy concern. The South Korean economy's lower growth is a major policy concern, with calls for structural reforms to boost productivity in the services sector and address labor market rigidities. Disagreements among government, industry, and union leaders have stalled reform efforts, exacerbating tensions over inequality and privileges. The South Korean economy's lower growth has worsened tensions over inequality and elite privileges. The public's outrage at the presidential corruption scandal was fueled by allegations of special treatment for the elite class. Chaebol conglomerates, which employ a small share of the population but contribute significantly to the GDP, are criticized for perpetuating inequality. Chaebol leaders, accused of corruption, face challenges in addressing inequality through fiscal measures due to low social welfare rates. South Korea faces challenges including low social welfare spending, high household debt, and an aging population. The economy is vulnerable to currency fluctuations, with the depreciation of the Japanese yen impacting exports. The Japanese yen's devaluation, influenced by expansionary monetary policies, has boosted exports but caused tension with trade partners like the United States and South Korea. South Korea's exchange rate policies have also been a point of contention, with accusations of artificially depressing the value of the won for trade advantages. In 2016, South Korea intervened in foreign exchange markets to limit the won's depreciation. South Korea intervened in foreign exchange markets to limit the won's depreciation by selling $6.6 billion in foreign exchange. A report urges South Korea to be more transparent in its operations. South Korea satisfies two of the three criteria for more engagement on currency policy by the Treasury Department. South Korea is a founding member of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) has over 50 member countries, including South Korea, the United Kingdom, and Australia. The AIIB has sparked controversy due to concerns about transparency and governance in China-funded projects, potentially undermining efforts to improve standards at multilateral development banks. The United States and South Korea have a long history of cooperation in nuclear energy. On June 15, 2015, the United States and the Republic of Korea signed a renewal of their civilian nuclear cooperation agreement, known as a \"123 agreement.\" The agreement provides the legal foundation for nuclear trade between the countries, with a duration of 20 years and automatic renewal for an additional five years unless either party chooses to withdraw. It entered into force on November 25, 2015, after a mandatory congressional review period. Former President Park described the agreement as one of the three \"major institutional\" agreements during her October 2015 visit to Washington, DC. The civilian nuclear cooperation agreement between the United States and South Korea, known as a \"123 agreement,\" was renewed in June 2015. It establishes a high-level bilateral commission to review cooperation, with a recent meeting held in January 2017 in Washington, DC. The commission serves as a forum for dialogue on various nuclear cooperation aspects, including spent fuel management, nuclear exports, fuel supply assurances, and nuclear security. The meeting was co-chaired by the U.S. Deputy Secretary. The HLBC meeting, co-chaired by U.S. Deputy Secretary of Energy and Second Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, discussed the success of the new 123 agreement, emphasizing future-oriented cooperation and nonproliferation commitments. Fuel cycle technology in South Korea was a contentious issue due to U.S. policy on discouraging its spread. The agreement between the U.S. and South Korea allows for the reprocessing of U.S.-obligated spent fuel into mixed-oxide fuel, with advance permission. This resolves previous disagreements over the use of fuel cycle technology and ensures reciprocal consent rights over retransfers or subsequent enrichment of material subject to the agreement. The agreement between the U.S. and South Korea allows for enrichment up to 20% of fissile uranium-235 in South Korea, with consultation and written agreement by the United States. South Korea does not have an enrichment capability but sought language in the new agreement to open the possibility. Joint research projects on spent fuel have been ongoing for decades, focusing on technologies like the \"DUPIC\" process in the 1990s and pyroprocessing in recent years. Joint research between the U.S. and South Korea on pyroprocessing began in 2002 under the I-NERI program. In 2010, a 10-year Joint Fuel Cycle Study was initiated to study spent fuel disposition, including pyroprocessing. In 2013, a new agreement on R&D technology transfer for joint pyroprocessing work took effect as part of the study. Spent fuel disposal is a key policy issue in South Korea, with some officials considering pyroprocessing as a potential solution. The construction of new storage facilities is unpopular, and there is a need for a long-term plan for spent fuel. However, experts point out that by-products of reprocessing still require long-term storage. Proponents of pyroprocessing see it as a way to advance energy independence for South Korea, but there is not a consensus among government agencies, private sector, and the public. The support for pyroprocessing in South Korea is uncertain, with concerns about its economic and technical viability for commercialization. While there is political popularity for the technology as a symbol of technical advancement and energy independence, safety issues related to nuclear energy are a concern. Some view pyroprocessing as part of a long-term nuclear reactor export strategy to increase South Korea's competitive edge in seeking power plant export contracts. Some analysts criticize South Korea's development of pyroprocessing due to concerns about violating a 1992 agreement with North Korea. However, supporters argue that the US has allowed India and Japan to reprocess and South Korea should have the same opportunity. The technology is being developed with the help of the US and IAEA to ensure proper safeguards. South Korea is a strong supporter of global nonproliferation efforts, having destroyed its chemical weapons stocks by 2008 and being a member of the Nuclear Suppliers' Group. They are involved in various international initiatives to prevent the spread of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. The Joint Study is assessing the monitoring of pyroprocessing technology to prevent diversion to weapons programs, expected to be concluded in 2020. South Korea contributes funds to nuclear smuggling prevention efforts and supports the destruction of Syrian chemical weapons. They are a member of the Non-Proliferation Treaty and have an Additional Protocol with the IAEA for increased monitoring of nuclear technology. The Korean Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI) disclosed previously undeclared experiments on uranium enrichment and plutonium extraction. The experiments were reported to the IAEA in 2004, leading to the Korean government reaffirming cooperation with the IAEA and commitment to peaceful nuclear energy use. South Korea's past plans for a plutonium-based nuclear weapons program in the 1970s were also highlighted. South Korea's pursuit of nuclear fuel cycle facilities was influenced by past weapons plans, but under U.S. pressure, these plans were abandoned. Efforts have been made since 2004 to enhance transparency in nuclear programs and adhere to nonproliferation agreements. Concerns arise over North Korea's pursuit of nuclear technologies conflicting with South Korea's commitments. The 1992 Joint Declaration prohibits South Korea from possessing reprocessing and enrichment facilities, raising questions about its obligations. South Korea hosted the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit, showcasing its nuclear industry accomplishments and emphasizing its responsible role in the nuclear field. It continued its leadership by chairing the International Atomic Energy Agency's International Conference on Nuclear Security in 2016 and cooperating with regional partners to establish a Center for Excellence in Nuclear Security. From 2008 to 2016, South Korean politics were dominated by the Saenuri Party, which controlled the legislature and won the presidency in 2007 and 2012. Park Geun-hye, the daughter of former President Park Chung Hee, was elected as South Korea's first woman president in 2012 with 51.6% of the vote. She was impeached in December 2016 for constitutional and legal violations. In December 2016, Park Geun-hye was impeached on charges of corruption and abuse of power, leading to massive protests in South Korea. Her approval ratings dropped below 5% before her removal from office. She was the first South Korean president to be impeached since democratic elections began in 1988. Power in South Korea is shared between the president and the National Assembly, with members elected to four-year terms. In 2016 and 2017, President Park's removal from office and the Choi Soon-sil scandal sparked calls for constitutional reform to limit the President's powers. The Minjoo (Democratic) Party, South Korea's largest progressive party, advocates for a more conciliatory approach to North Korea and opposes South Korea-Japan agreements. Minjoo's surprise victory in April 2016 gave it control of the legislature for the first time since 2008. The Liberty Korea Party (LKP) is South Korea's second-largest conservative party, formed in late December 2016 after a split from Park's former Saenuri Party. The People's Party, South Korea's third-largest grouping, was formed in early 2016 by former Minjoo Party members led by Ahn Cheol-soo. Their stance on North Korea falls between conservative and progressive parties, advocating for engagement with tougher measures. The Bar e un (Righteous) Party, a conservative grouping formed after Saenuri's breakup in 2016, has more engagement than the former but tougher measures than the latter. U.S. ties historically have been stronger with South Korea's conservative parties."
