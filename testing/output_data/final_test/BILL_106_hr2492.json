    "content": "The Act titled \"Medicare Home Health Payment Improvement Act of 1999\" eliminates a scheduled 15 percent reduction. The Medicare Home Health Payment Improvement Act of 1999 eliminates a 15 percent reduction in the Prospective Payment System and makes amendments to the Interim Payment System. The Tax and Trade Relief Extension Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-277) is amended by striking subsection (e). SEC. 3. Extension of repayment period for overpayments. The home health agency can repay an overpayment to the Secretary of Health and Human Services over a 60-month period without accruing interest. Interest will accrue on any outstanding balance of overpayment after a 60-month period for agencies that do not make an election under subsection (a). The interest rate will be the same as the rate charged by banks for loans to their most favored commercial customers. The provisions of this section, including the termination of the election under subsection (a) for cost reporting periods after the implementation of the prospective payment system for home health services, will take effect as if included in the enactment of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. REPORT TO CONGRESS ON ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS FOR MEDICARE HOME HEALTH AGENCIES COMPLYING WITH OASIS REQUIREMENTS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must report to Congress on the costs incurred by Medicare home health agencies in complying with data collection requirements under the OASIS standard. The Comptroller General will conduct an independent audit of these costs and submit a report to Congress within 180 days. In this section, the definitions of \"comprehensive assessment of patients\" and \"Outcome and Assessment Information Set\" are provided. The former refers to a rule that requires home health agencies participating in the Medicare program to accurately assess a patient's current status using OASIS. The latter defines the standard data items needed for this assessment. The amendment eliminates the incremental billing requirement in Section 1895(c)(2) of the Social Security Act, effective as if included in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997."
