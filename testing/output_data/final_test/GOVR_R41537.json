    "content": "The U.S. plays a significant role in multilateral development banks like the World Bank and regional banks. The executive branch and Congress are involved in making and implementing U.S. policy towards these banks. The Secretary of the Treasury negotiates with other countries on MDB policies and funding agreements. The United States plays a key role in shaping policies of international financial institutions like the IMF and World Bank. Congress has authority over U.S. financial commitments to these institutions. The President appoints officials to manage U.S. participation in these organizations. The President delegates authority to the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct U.S. representatives at international financial institutions and provide consent to their decisions. This delegation is reflected in 22 U.S.C. 6593, giving the Treasury primary responsibility for coordinating U.S. participation in these institutions and multilateral efforts for currency stabilization and debt. The BWAA established an interagency committee to coordinate international economic policy, focusing on currency stabilization, debt reduction, and economic reform programs. The National Advisory Committee for International Financial and Monetary Policies coordinated U.S. programs involving foreign loans and financial transactions, advising the President and representatives to the IMF and the World Bank. The National Advisory Committee for International Financial and Monetary Policies, established by the BWAA, advised the President and representatives to the IMF and World Bank on major issues. The NAC included heads of key agencies and made policy decisions through majority vote. However, the NAC process was ineffective and was abolished in 1965, with its responsibilities transferred to the President. President Johnson then reorganized the NAC to give agencies exclusive control over specific programs, such as the Treasury Department managing U.S. participation in IFIs. President Johnson reconstituted the NAC as a forum for agencies to advise the Treasury Department on U.S. participation in IFIs. The NAC coordinates policies, advises on problems, and recommends legislation on international monetary affairs. It reviews proposed transactions to ensure they align with U.S. policies and makes recommendations to the Treasury Secretary for IFI representation. Congress requires annual reports on U.S. participation in IFIs from the NAC Chairman. The NAC serves as a coordinating framework for advising the Treasury Department on U.S. participation in international financial institutions. Treasury has had dominant policymaking authority since the 1970s, with former Secretary Michael Blumenthal emphasizing his control over directing executive directors' votes. Despite efforts to maintain the NAC, studies have found its implementation lacking. The General Accounting Office (now the Government Accountability Office, GAO) found in a 1973 report that the NAC process lacked guidelines and access to adequate information for decision-making. Recent studies also show challenges in policy coordination between Treasury and other agencies despite statutory requirements. Executive Order 11269 provisions are important for discussing the State Department's role in U.S. policy at international financial institutions. The State Department plays a crucial role in U.S. policy at international financial institutions, consulting with the Treasury Secretary and advising on development aspects. The Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs serves as an alternate U.S. governor at each MDB, but the department sometimes faces challenges in policy coordination. The State Department, through the Economic and Business Bureau, manages its involvement in MDB issues, focusing on how MDB activities impact U.S. relations with developing countries and other international organizations. Regional bureaus are concerned about how U.S. policy on specific loans may affect relationships with individual countries. USAID, integrated with the State Department, also participates in discussions on IFI concerns and monitors MDB operations' environmental impact in developing countries. The U.S. State Department, along with the Economic and Business Bureau, manages its involvement in MDB issues, focusing on how MDB activities impact U.S. relations with developing countries and international organizations. USAID, integrated with the State Department, monitors the environmental impact of MDB operations in developing countries. The Department of Commerce also participates in policy discussions regarding MDB operations, identifying procurement opportunities for U.S. firms. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and other agencies are involved in monitoring procurement opportunities and issues related to MDB agriculture programs. The Treasury Department took steps in 2009 to revitalize the NAC as an interagency forum for consultation and policy. The NAC has been revitalized as an interagency forum for consultation and policy formulation on IFI-related issues. Meetings are held at both Cabinet and staff levels, chaired by the Treasury Secretary. Discussions include MDB capital increases, IMF and MDB policy questions, and other major concerns. The NAC has been revived as a forum for discussing IMF and MDB issues, European monetary situation, MDB reform, Ex-Im Bank and USDA food export loans, debt forgiveness, and other international finance matters. Treasury Department sources state that the NAC was reinstated to address a wide range of important international finance issues and improve policy outcomes through advice from various agencies. Participants include Secretaries of State and Commerce, USTR, and other officials. The NAC, including key officials from various agencies, has been difficult to sustain in coordinating U.S. policy towards IFIs. Previous attempts to create formal interagency procedures have failed, with the NAC being the first attempt in 1945. The NAC was first created in 1945 but failed due to agencies prioritizing control over unity. It was recreated in 1965 with the Treasury Secretary having final authority. However, some Secretaries later disregarded the NAC's advice. In 1973, the DCC was established by Congress for coordinating U.S. policies affecting low-income countries. The President established the DCC in 1973 to coordinate U.S. policies for low-income countries. In 1979, an executive order made the DCC the central forum for aid policy coordination. The Treasury Department did not fully cooperate, leading to the creation of the Working Group on Multilateral Assistance (WGMA). In 1980, Congress created the International Development Cooperation Agency (IDCA) to coordinate aid, with the Treasury Secretary required to comply with IDCA policy determinations. The IDCA policy determinations were not fully complied with by the Treasury Department, exempting all IFI issues from the process. IDCA was abolished in 1998, transferring its authorities to the Secretary of State. The DCC chair and IDCA director lacked political weight to secure support or overrule Treasury decisions. An effective IFI interagency review process requires a leader with political influence, addressing the delegation of authority to the Treasury Secretary, and being cautious about blocking Cabinet officers' full authority. Congress plays a significant role in determining U.S. participation in Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), including setting terms for voting on loans and funding plans. While Congress cannot earmark funds or direct specific loan approvals, it has authority over policy decisions regarding MDB participation. The influence of Congress in U.S. policy regarding Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) is significant. The Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and House Committee on Financial Services have jurisdiction over MDB authorizing legislation. Both Senate and House leadership maintain an active interest in MDB and IMF issues. House and Senate Appropriations Committees also address MDB issues. Congress plays a significant role in U.S. policy regarding Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) through various committees and staff members. Legislative proposals related to MDBs are often included as riders on \"must pass\" legislation due to difficulties in enacting standalone bills. MDB legislation has been a subject of partisan controversy in the past, with Congress enacting legislation to authorize U.S. participation in MDB funding plans only once since 1980. Since 1980, Congress has enacted legislation authorizing U.S. participation in MDB funding plans through various means, including inserting policy initiatives at the subcommittee or committee level. MDB authorizations have often been included as amendments to larger bills, such as omnibus or year-end appropriations legislation, to ensure passage. In 1981, Congress consolidated policy directives on MDBs and IMF into the International Financial Institutions Act (IFI Act), containing over 25 titles specifying U.S. participation goals. Without congressional authorization, the U.S. cannot join MDB funding programs or vote on rule changes. The Bretton Woods Agreements Act set the precedent for U.S. involvement in the IMF and World Bank. The Bretton Woods Agreements Act (BWAA) established guidelines for U.S. participation in MDBs, including the IMF and World Bank. It prohibits the President or any agency from proposing changes to the U.S. quota in the IMF or making financial commitments to the World Bank without congressional authorization. Additionally, it restricts U.S. Governors from voting for capital stock increases in the Bank that would require additional U.S. subscriptions without congressional approval. The U.S. Administration has not complied with directives requiring specific actions within MDBs for some time. Congress has enacted laws instructing the Secretary of the Treasury to consult with other countries on coordinated actions, consult with relevant committees before supporting certain initiatives, and oppose loans to countries violating human rights or supporting terrorism. The U.S. Administration has not complied with directives requiring specific actions within MDBs for some time. Congress has enacted laws instructing the Secretary of the Treasury to oppose loans to countries violating human rights, supporting terrorism, or failing to cooperate in the suppression of illegal activities. This includes opposing loans for certain agricultural or mineral products in oversupply, education or healthcare projects charging user fees, and loans to specific countries like Serbia, Burma, Zimbabwe, Sudan, Belarus, and Sri Lanka. The U.S. representatives may abstain or cast negative votes in MDB decisions, and the Administration is required to pursue certain goals and advocate for specific policies in the MDBs. The U.S. Administration is required to pursue specific goals and advocate for certain policies in MDBs, such as workers' rights, poverty alleviation, debt restructuring for impoverished countries, women's integration in development, and increased assistance to countries like Haiti, East Timor, Tibet, Cambodia, Mongolia, and Ukraine. Authorization and appropriations committees hold hearings on funding requests for MDBs, allowing Administration witnesses to justify the resources needed for U.S. participation. Public witnesses are also invited to address concerns and potential legislative changes. Congress requires periodic reports on MDB topics to oversee U.S. policy. Before 1998, MDB information was hard to obtain, but reporting requirements now make it accessible to the public. These reports help Congress discuss MDB issues and U.S. policy towards multilateral banks. In 1945, Congress mandated annual reports on international financial institutions via the NAC to address congressional concerns. The Administration's explanations on U.S. directors' votes and policy goals are crucial for effective oversight. If reporting requirements become burdensome, the Administration may stop providing reports, leaving Congress with limited options to enforce resumption. Congress added detailed provisions to the NAC reporting requirement by 1992. In 1998, Congress simplified the NAC reporting requirement, dropping detailed provisions and requiring a general review of MDB operations and U.S. policy goals. The most recent report covers FY2014, discussing international economic issues, IFIs' roles, and U.S. policy goals. The Administration is now meeting major IFI reporting requirements, aided by the Internet's impact on report effectiveness. Treasury has started posting required reports on MDBs and the IMF on its website, including U.S. representatives' voting records. The MDBs fund their non-concessional loan operations through bond sales in global markets, backed by member countries' capital. This transparency has helped Congress and the public understand MDBs and U.S. policy towards them. Bond purchasers rely on member countries fulfilling their obligations. The United States subscribes a share of capital stock in MDBs to back their borrowings. Most of the cost of new shares is subscribed as callable capital, which member countries do not normally need to pay unless the bank becomes bankrupt. MDBs have triple-A creditor status, making the likelihood of bankruptcy small. U.S. subscription to MDB callable capital is a contingent liability. The U.S. subscribes to MDB callable capital as a contingent liability. Congress has changed its approach to funding MDB capital subscriptions since FY1982. Questions have been raised about how the U.S. budget acknowledges this liability, with concerns about inconsistent treatment and financial backing for different IFIs. The financial backing and budgetary treatment for International Financial Institutions (IFIs) vary between institutions. Congress may need to consider if all IFIs should be treated similarly and how to account for risks associated with U.S. involvement. Questions arise about appropriating money to cover potential liabilities and if the current budgetary treatment of MDB callable capital is sufficient. Concessional lending windows at MDBs do not use guarantees, with U.S. contributions paid directly to the institution."
