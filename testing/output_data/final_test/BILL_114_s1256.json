The Act titled \"Advancing Grid Storage Act of 2015\" defines key terms related to energy storage systems, islanding, loans, and microgrids. The \"Advancing Grid Storage Act of 2015\" defines renewable energy sources as biomass, geothermal energy, hydropower, landfill gas, municipal solid waste, ocean energy, organic waste, photosynthetic processes, photovoltaic energy, solar energy, and wind. These sources can connect and disconnect from the grid to operate in both grid-connected and island mode. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy and includes solar energy and wind as renewable energy sources. The Energy Storage Research Program is established within the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy for researching energy storage systems. $50,000,000 is authorized for this program. Additionally, there is an Energy Storage System Demonstration and Deployment Loan Program. The Secretary will establish a loan program for eligible entities to fund energy storage systems projects. Eligible entities include states, energy offices, and tribal organizations. The Secretary will establish a loan program for eligible entities, including tribal organizations, institutions of higher education, and electric utilities, to fund energy storage systems projects. Selection requirements will ensure regional diversity among recipients, with a focus on rural participation. The loan program for energy storage systems projects will prioritize regional diversity and rural participation. Selected projects must expand on existing technology programs and aim to achieve specific objectives, such as improving microgrids and transmission systems. The loan program for energy storage systems projects will prioritize regional diversity and rural participation. Projects will focus on improving reliability in rural areas, integrating with renewable energy sources, providing ancillary services for grid management, and advancing power conversion systems for efficiency and communication. The loan program for energy storage systems projects will prioritize regional diversity and rural participation. Projects will focus on improving reliability in rural areas, integrating with renewable energy sources, providing ancillary services for grid management, and advancing power conversion systems for efficiency and communication. Eligible entities receiving loans must use them for programs related to demonstrating and deploying energy storage systems in households, businesses, and communities. This includes optimizing transmission and distribution operations, managing peak loads, and meeting electricity demand during nonpeak generation periods. The loan program for energy storage systems projects will prioritize regional diversity and rural participation. Eligible entities must use loans for demonstrating and deploying energy storage systems in households, businesses, and communities, with specific terms and conditions set by the Secretary. The loan for energy storage systems projects will have a fixed interest rate similar to Treasury securities, with a repayment term not exceeding 20 years or 90% of the asset's useful life. Payments will support energy research and development activities and remain available until expended. The loan provided under this section does not have a penalty for early repayment. Eligible entities must return any unused portion of the loan to the Treasury. Workers on construction projects funded by the loan must be paid prevailing wage rates. The Secretary of Labor determines prevailing wage rates for construction projects. Rules and procedures for the loan program must be adopted within 180 days of the Act's enactment. Initial loans will be disbursed within 1 year of establishing the rules. Reports on the loan must be submitted annually for the loan term. An eligible entity receiving a loan must submit a report on program performance annually. Appropriations are authorized for this section. SEC. 5. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND GRANT PROGRAM. The Secretary will establish a program to provide technical assistance and grants for eligible entities to plan and design energy storage systems. The program established by the Secretary provides technical assistance and grants for eligible entities to plan and design energy storage systems. This assistance includes activities such as identifying opportunities, assessing technical and economic characteristics, utility interconnection, permitting, business planning, financial analysis, and engineering design. Information dissemination includes topics from case studies to computer software for system assessment, design, and operation. The program offers technical assistance and grants for planning and designing energy storage systems, including operation and maintenance. Eligibility is open to nonprofit or for-profit entities. Applications must be submitted to the Secretary, who will review them competitively and periodically. The program prioritizes eligible entities with projects that promote renewable energy use, enhance energy infrastructure resilience to extreme weather events, improve microgrid feasibility in rural areas, and reduce environmental impact. The program prioritizes eligible entities with projects that promote renewable energy use, enhance energy infrastructure resilience to extreme weather events, improve microgrid feasibility in rural areas, and reduce environmental impact. Grants may cover costs for initial assessments, feasibility studies, guidance on overcoming barriers, and detailed engineering of energy storage systems. The Secretary will establish rules and procedures for the program within 180 days of enactment. Grants will be issued within 120 days of the rules being issued. The Secretary will provide reports to Congress every 2 years on program performance and assess success upon program termination. Authorization of Appropriations: $250,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2016 through 2020 to support eligible entities' measures under the program."
