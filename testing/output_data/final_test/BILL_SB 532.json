    "title": "SB 532",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 35012 of the Education Code is amended to allow a school district's governing board to consist of five members elected at large for four-year staggered terms, or seven members in a unified school district as specified in a proposal for unification. The governing board of an elementary school district consists of three members selected at large. If the average daily attendance is 300 or more, procedures under Section 5018 shall be followed. A pupil petition can be submitted to appoint nonvoting pupil members to the board in a school district maintaining one or more high schools. (B) A pupil petition can be submitted to the governing board of a school district to allow preferential voting for the pupil member or members of the board, either in the original petition for pupil representation or as a separate petition after appointment. The petition for pupil representation in a school district must have signatures from either 500 pupils or 10% of the total number of pupils, whichever is less. The governing board must include at least one nonvoting pupil member within 60 days of receiving the petition, with the option to include more than one. Upon receiving a petition for pupil representation, the school district's governing board must add at least one nonvoting pupil member to the board, with the option to include more. Preferential voting for the pupil member(s) must be allowed upon request. The governing board of a school district may allow nonvoting pupil members to make motions, except on certain matters, and attend all meetings except executive sessions. Preferential voting is permitted for pupil members but does not affect the final outcome of a vote. A pupil selected as a nonvoting or preferential voting member of a school district must be enrolled in a district high school, may be under 18, and chosen by fellow students. The term is one year starting on July 1. The pupil member is entitled to a mileage allowance but not compensation, sits with the governing board, receives all materials, and can participate in discussions and questioning at meetings. The nonvoting or preferential voting pupil member of a school district is not included in determining votes or liable for board acts. A majority vote is needed to eliminate this position, and any state-mandated costs will be reimbursed to local agencies and school districts."
