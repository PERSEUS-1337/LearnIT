    "content": "Prior to the FY2008 defense authorization act, DOD was restricted from leasing a vessel or aircraft for more than five years without specific authorization. The act amended this to allow leasing for 2-5 years with notification to relevant committees and a cost-effective justification. The session of Congress has expired, and laws and regulations related to DOD leases of equipment include various provisions such as 41 U.S.C. \u00a711 and 10 U.S.C. \u00a77309. The Military Sealift Command has leased foreign-built sealift ships for up to 4 years and 11 months, with some leases being renewed. The Military Sealift Command (MSC) renewed leases of four foreign-built ships for up to almost 10 years, raising concerns among U.S. shipyard supporters. The American Shipbuilding Association (ASA) argues that leasing foreign-built ships for such long periods circumvents the requirement for U.S. military ships to be built in U.S. yards. ASA advocates for changes to limit leases of foreign-built ships. The American Shipbuilding Association (ASA) supports changing U.S.C. \u00a72401 to limit leases of foreign-built ships to no more than two years to encourage the Department of Defense (DOD) to purchase and have ships built in U.S. yards instead of leasing foreign-built ships for long-term military requirements. The ASA argues that long-term leases of foreign-built ships for up to 10 years circumvent the requirement for U.S. military ships to be built domestically. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 limits leasing contracts for capital assets by the Executive Branch to impose budget discipline and encourage purchasing over leasing due to higher costs. The Office of Management and Budget enforces this by scoring guidelines for vessels and capital assets leased for five years or longer, requiring budget inclusion in the year of contract and authorization for the total lease contract. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 imposed restrictions on long-term leasing of U.S.-built ships, requiring budget inclusion in the year of contract and authorization for the total lease contract. However, the Department of Defense has been circumventing these restrictions by entering 59-month lease contracts, renewing them for an additional 59-month period, resulting in foreign-built ships operating for nearly 10 consecutive years. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 restricted long-term leasing of U.S.-built ships, leading to the leasing of foreign-built ships by the Department of Defense for up to 10 years. This allows foreign owners to access private financing to convert commercial ships to meet military requirements, as U.S. shipbuilders struggle to compete due to financing constraints. The growing reliance on leasing foreign-built ships by the Department of Defense is resulting in the de-facto purchase of such ships for long-term military needs. The ASA recommends limiting DOD lease contracts of foreign-built ships to two years to control costs, but DOD argues that longer leases are more cost-effective. The Department of Defense (DOD) charters commercial ships to meet its requirements, often relying on foreign-built ships due to limited availability of high military utility ships from U.S. shipyards. Immediate or changing needs are met through commercial charters, while long-term needs may involve seeking authorization from Congress for new construction programs, which can take up to five years for delivery of the first vessel. The Navy establishes programs like LMSRs and Lewis and Clark dry cargo ships to meet long-term requirements. Acquisition of the JHSV is planned as a replacement for the WESTPAC EXPRESS Charter. DOD opposes a provision limiting leases to 2 years, as it would impact MSC's mission of providing sealift support for DOD activities. Military services maintain equipment on MSC chartered vessels for rapid deployment of forces. The Military Sealift Command (MSC) operates U.S.-flagged and U.S.-crewed vessels for up to five years, including chartered vessels for unique military requirements. Biennial charter solicitations would hinder effective planning and budgeting, impacting Combatant Commanders' mission readiness and DOD's ability to maintain equipment readiness. This disruption would defeat the purpose of the prepositioning program for forward deployment of fully-loaded ships in strategic locations. The restriction on chartering foreign-built vessels by the Military Sealift Command would negatively impact the U.S. merchant marine industry and hinder the prepositioning program's ability to deploy ships quickly. It would also go against DOD's objectives of supporting a competitive domestic ship repair industry. Restricting the lease/charter period to 24 months would not increase the number of U.S.-built militarily useful ships but would raise costs for chartering vessels. Restricting charter periods for foreign-built vessels by the Military Sealift Command would significantly increase costs without promoting U.S. ship construction. This limitation would hinder the deployment of ships and negatively impact the domestic ship repair industry. The Department of Defense is exploring a Joint High-Speed Vessel capability based on lessons learned from leased vessels, raising questions for Congress about future foreign-built ship leases. The Department of Defense is considering limiting leases of foreign-built ships to two years, which could impact U.S. shipyards, revenues, and employment levels. This raises questions about the national security implications and cost effectiveness of meeting sealift requirements. There is a concern about potential mismatch between sealift requirements and capacity if DOD decides to purchase U.S.-built ships instead of leasing foreign-built ones. The Department of Defense is considering limiting leases of foreign-built ships to two years, which could impact U.S. shipyards, revenues, and employment levels. The reports of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees did not comment on the issue of DOD leases of foreign-built ships. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about the Navy's extended leases for foreign-built ships, stating that recurring leases violate budget restrictions. They believe domestic shipbuilding industry could benefit from filling these roles and received a report from the Navy on ending foreign ship leases by 2012. The House Appropriations Committee is concerned about the Navy's extended leases for foreign-built ships, stating that recurring leases violate budget restrictions. They received a report from the Navy on ending foreign ship leases by 2012 and are interested in the Navy's updated plan for terminating this practice and using only domestic built ships by that year. The Secretary of the Navy is directed to submit a report with budget and funding plans to accomplish this no later than a specified date. The House Appropriations Committee received a report from the Navy on ending foreign ship leases by 2012. They are interested in the Navy's plan to use only domestic built ships by that year. The Secretary of the Navy must submit a report with budget plans by March 31, 2010. The final version of H.R. 3326 was signed into law on December 19, 2009, making appropriations for the Department of Defense for fiscal year 2010. The Secretary of the Navy is directed to update the report on leasing foreign built ships and its impact on American seafarers, sealift capabilities, and naval shipbuilding. The conference report on H.R. 2647 does not contain provisions on DOD leases of foreign-built ships. The House bill allows the Secretary of the Navy to use funds to lease and convert vessels that have defaulted on construction loan guarantees. The House bill allows the Secretary of the Navy to use funds to lease and convert vessels that have defaulted on construction loan guarantees, which are under the control of the Maritime Administration. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about the Navy bypassing long-term capital lease restrictions by leasing foreign-built military sealift mission ships, impacting American shipyards and the shipbuilding industry. The Committee directs the Navy to submit a plan to stop leasing foreign-built ships and use only American-built ships within four years. Section 1011 of the FY2008 defense authorization act limits the leasing of vessels by the Secretary of a military department. The Secretary of a military department may make a contract for the lease of a vessel for a period of greater than two years but less than five years, after notifying the relevant committees and providing detailed justification for the cost-effectiveness of the contract. The Secretary of a military department may lease a vessel for a period of more than two years but less than five years, after notifying relevant committees and justifying the cost-effectiveness of the contract. The plan must include meeting the contract requirement upon lease completion, with a 30-day notice to Congress."
