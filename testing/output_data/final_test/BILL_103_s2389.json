    "content": "The \"Habeas Corpus Reform Act of 1994\" is also known as the Special Habeas Corpus Procedures in Capital Cases, which amends Part IV of title 28, United States Code, by adding a new chapter 154 for special habeas corpus procedures in capital cases. The chapter applies to prisoners in State custody with a capital sentence, requiring appointment of counsel. It is only applicable if a State has a mechanism for appointment, compensation, and. The chapter applies to State prisoners with a capital sentence, mandating the appointment of competent counsel. Counsel appointed must not have previously represented the prisoner in the same case unless requested. Ineffectiveness of counsel during post-conviction proceedings is not grounds for relief, allowing for the appointment of different counsel if needed. Upon entry of an order pursuant to section 2260, a stay of execution for a State prisoner can be requested in any court with jurisdiction over post-conviction proceedings. The stay expires if the prisoner fails to file a habeas corpus petition within the required time. Upon completion of district court and court of appeals review, a petition for relief can be denied if the time for filing a certiorari petition has expired, if the Supreme Court denies the petition, or if the Supreme Court upholds the capital sentence. Additionally, a State prisoner can waive the right to pursue habeas corpus review before a court of competent jurisdiction. The conditions for a stay of execution in a capital case require the decision to be made before a court of competent jurisdiction, in the presence of counsel, and after being advised of the consequences. If these conditions are met, no Federal court can grant relief unless the claim was not previously presented and the failure to raise it is due to specific circumstances. The filing of a habeas corpus petition under section 2254 must be done within 180 days after filing in the appropriate State court. The petition must meet specific criteria, including new Federal rights, factual predicates not discoverable earlier, and facts that could undermine confidence in the jury's guilt determination or death sentence validity. The time requirements for filing a habeas corpus petition under section 2254 can be tolled in certain circumstances, such as when a petition for certiorari is filed in the Supreme Court or when a State prisoner has a request for postconviction review pending before a State court. The tolling rule for filing a habeas corpus petition under section 2254 can extend the time period in certain situations, such as when a State prisoner files for post-conviction review or when counsel for the prisoner requests an extension of time with good cause. This tolling rule does not apply during a petition for certiorari before the Supreme Court. The requirement of a certificate of probable cause for habeas corpus cases under this chapter does not apply except for second or successive petitions. Mechanisms for providing counsel in capital cases are outlined, including for indigents facing capital punishment charges or seeking appellate or collateral review. The chapter outlines mechanisms for providing counsel in capital cases, including appointing counsel for indigents sentenced to death seeking certiorari review in the Supreme Court. Standards for appointed counsel are also specified. The chapter outlines mechanisms for providing counsel in capital cases, including appointing counsel for indigents sentenced to death seeking certiorari review in the Supreme Court. States may establish up to three certification authorities to certify counsel in capital cases, which can be special committees, capital litigation resource centers, or statewide defender organizations. The certification authority certifies attorneys qualified to represent individuals in capital cases, publishes procedures for certification, and monitors attorney performance. The certification authority certifies attorneys for capital cases and monitors their performance, ensuring continuing competence. In states without a statewide public defender system, one appointed attorney must be employed by a state-funded public defender organization meeting court-approved standards. The certification authority ensures that attorneys representing indigents in capital cases demonstrate continuing competence. Noncomplying states must appoint experienced attorneys for pre-trial and post-trial appointments. Attorneys appointed under this chapter must have at least 5 years of experience in the state's highest court and 3 years of handling appeals in felony cases. The court may appoint a different attorney for good cause, considering the seriousness and complexity of the case. Additional services necessary for the defendant's representation can be paid for after ex parte proceedings. The court authorizes attorney compensation and payment for necessary services, regardless of usual limits, to ensure timely provision of services for defendants. The court authorizes attorney compensation and payment for necessary services at rates determined to be reasonably necessary. Amendments to the Table of Chapters in part IV of title 28, United States Code, include inserting a new chapter after chapter 153. Special habeas corpus procedures in capital cases are outlined in chapter 154, with provisions for attorney compensation and necessary services."
