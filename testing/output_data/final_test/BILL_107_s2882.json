The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows regulated investment companies to claim credits for qualified zone academy bonds. Regulations permit the separation of bond ownership and credit entitlement. The allocation of limitation among states is also addressed. The Secretary allocates zone academy bond limitations among states based on their populations below the poverty line. After 2002, the allocation is based on the amounts each state received for basic grants under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The limitation amount allocated to a State under subparagraph (A) shall be allocated to qualified zone academies within the State. The maximum aggregate face amount of bonds issued for a qualified zone academy in a calendar year cannot exceed the limitation amount allocated to that academy. Unused bond designation authority is subject to limitations. The amendments made to the limitation on bond designation include a new provision for reallocation of unused amounts after two years. These changes apply to obligations issued after December 31, 2001. The Revenue Code of 1986, as in effect before the enactment of this Act, will no longer have limitations for eligible taxpayers after the enactment of this Act."
