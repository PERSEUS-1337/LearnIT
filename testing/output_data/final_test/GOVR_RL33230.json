    "content": "Since 1913, military personnel serving in combat zones have had portions of their pay exempt from taxation under Internal Revenue Code Section 112. The exemption applies to warrant officers, enlisted members, and commissioned officers up to a certain limit. For FY2007, the officer exclusion was capped at $6,381 per month. Members of the U.S. Armed Forces serving in combat zones can exclude certain amounts from their income, including active duty pay, imminent danger/hostile fire pay, reenlistment bonuses, pay for accrued leave, pay for duties in nonappropriated fund activities, awards for suggestions or inventions made during service in a combat zone, and student loan repayments. Some states adopt federal procedures for combat zone income tax exclusion, while others have varying tax incentives for military personnel serving in combat. For example, Michigan exempts all military pay, Mississippi allows enlisted members to exclude all combat income, and officers up to $500 per month. Current tax law also provides exclusions for U.S. citizens working overseas. The proposed civilian combat zone exclusion would offer additional tax savings to U.S. federal civilian employees working overseas, who can already exclude certain special allowances under Section 912 of the Internal Revenue Code. This exclusion is separate from the one available to other U.S. citizens under Section 911, which allows for the exclusion of foreign earned income and housing expenditures up to $82,400. Qualifying for the income tax exclusion requires being a U.S. citizen, having a tax home in a foreign country, and being a resident of that country or having lived abroad for a certain period. The tax treatment of income earned by U.S. citizens abroad is often justified by pointing to differences in cost of living and income tax rates overseas. U.S. citizens working abroad may face high foreign taxes, which can be offset using the foreign tax credit. The foreign tax credit can offset expenses for individuals with low foreign taxes, reducing U.S. taxes paid. Proposals in recent Congresses aim to extend income tax exclusions to federal civilian employees in combat zones. For example, H.R. 294 in the 109th Congress proposed excluding compensation for certain DOD civilian employees in combat zones, similar to the provision for Armed Forces members. The proposal aims to extend the combat zone income tax exclusion to civilian DOD personnel and civilian contractors, treating their income favorably compared to other income. This subsidy can influence economic behavior. The military tax benefit aims to reduce tax burdens for military personnel during wartime. Tax incentives are typically used to encourage economic activity, but market failures may occur when resources are not efficiently allocated. Market failures can be caused by externalities, imperfect competition, and asymmetric information. Tax subsidies can be justified if they remedy market failures and improve efficiency. The combat zone income tax exclusion does not address a market failure and may not lower efficiency. The success of tax incentives can be measured by their impact on behavior. The combat zone income tax exclusion is an additional benefit for members of the Armed Forces. Extending it to civilian employees in combat zones raises questions about its purpose, which could be additional compensation or equity with the military. Efficiency concerns arise regarding whether a tax subsidy is the best way to provide compensation. A tax subsidy in the form of an income tax exclusion raises efficiency concerns due to its varying benefits based on household characteristics. Direct spending programs are considered more efficient as they do not have this unintended variance. Alternative subsidies for combat include hazardous duty pay and imminent danger pay, but increasing these incomes would have adverse budgetary effects. The exclusion of income tax benefits can impact taxpayers differently based on household characteristics like income, marital status, and number of dependents. This can alter the distribution of taxes among income groups. The distribution of taxes among income groups can be affected by differences in the number of dependents. The tax system is based on progressivity, where higher income earners pay a greater percentage of their income in taxes. Exclusions from taxation benefit individuals in higher tax brackets more than those in lower tax brackets. The lowest-paid individuals may owe little to no federal taxes due to exemptions and deductions. Certain civilians, including federal civilians, may not benefit greatly from tax exclusions, while commissioned officers with higher salaries benefit the most. There is a limit on the exclusion amount for officers and civilians. U.S. citizens working overseas may benefit from international tax provisions, but not all civilians. Federal civilians cannot benefit from the $82,400 income tax exclusion, but can exclude housing and certain allowances. Private sector civilians overseas for most of the required time may claim the income exclusion. An income tax exclusion for non-federal civilians in combat zones would primarily benefit high-income households, potentially reducing the progressivity of the tax system. Unlike the foreign tax credit designed to offset income taxation for individuals working abroad, personnel in combat zones are not subject to foreign taxes on their earnings in the region. Extending the combat zone tax exclusion to civilians may not be necessary for those already exempt from foreign taxes. The extension of combat zone tax exclusion to civilians may not be needed as they do not require an income tax credit to offset foreign taxes paid. Differences between military service and civilian employment, such as the ability to resign or refuse assignments, highlight the unique responsibilities of military personnel compared to civilians. Military members are subject to continuous duty and may not have the same contractual incentives available to civilian employees working in combat zones. Military members are under the authority of a commander through a chain of command, with disobedience leading to criminal punishment under the UCMJ. Civilian employees are not subject to military authority except in times of war. Advocates suggest expanding the income tax exclusion to civilians as a gesture of national gratitude for their service in dangerous situations. Civilians in combat zones, including government employees, contractors, and war correspondents, face the risk of being mistaken for combatants. Advocates argue for extending income tax exclusion to these civilians, citing their likelihood of becoming casualties. For example, in the Iraq war, five civilian DOD employees were among the 2,363 fatalities. In the Iraq war, civilian DOD employees accounted for a small percentage of fatalities compared to military personnel and contractors. Advocates suggest extending combat tax exclusion to civilians in combat zones for equitable treatment. Civilians in combat zones already receive danger pay allowances for hazardous conditions, administered by the Department of State. Imminent danger pay provides additional compensation for service in areas with civil insurrection, terrorism, or wartime conditions. DOD civilian employees receive varying rates of imminent danger pay based on the level of danger. Some argue against extending income tax exclusion to civilian contractors. Those who oppose extending income tax exclusion to civilian contractors argue that it could lead to an erosion of potential tax revenue for the government. Exempting civilian income from federal taxation may make civilian service in combat zones more financially attractive than military service, potentially impacting military recruitment and retention. Private contractors in Iraq can earn lucrative salaries, ranging from $350 to $1,500 a day, which some believe depletes the ranks of the Armed Forces. Private contractors in Iraq can earn lucrative salaries, with former military personnel making two to 10 times more than they would in the military. For example, a former Green Beret can earn up to $1,000 a day as a private contractor. Reports show that contractors can earn high rates, such as $350,000 per year for disposing of captured munitions. The Defense Contract Audit Agency found that contractors in Iraq receive significant pay in addition to base pay. Private contractors in Iraq receive significant pay in addition to base pay, with varying combinations of allowances, differentials, bonuses, and benefits offered. Hardship pay and danger pay allowances are common, along with assignment completion bonuses and foreign service premiums. In Operation Iraqi Freedom, 83% of deployed civilians were contractors, while 17% were civilian federal workers. Some contractors in Iraq perform civilian support roles like vehicle maintenance and repair, while others serve as security force members in dangerous roles. The distinctions between civilian DOD employees and contractors complicate equalization of benefits. Civilian DOD personnel operate with similar commitment and control as military personnel, while contractors may not. Commanders have control over civilian DOD employees, but penalties for failure to perform are administrative, not criminal. Contractors, unlike government employees, are employed by third parties under contract to the United. The ability to ensure that contractors abide by federal laws and codes of conduct is determined by the nature of the contract written and signed between the contracting firm and the DOD. Military commanders have less control over contractors and less recourse in the event of non-compliance. The combat zone income tax exclusion places the administrative burden on the employer to separate nontaxable income from taxable income and report it to both the employee and the IRS. Combat zones, designated by executive order or public law, may require new reporting for contractors employing civilians. The Department of Defense can extend tax benefits to military personnel supporting combat zones. Three combat zones are designated, including the Persian Gulf area. The Gulf of Aden and land areas of Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates are designated as combat zones for tax relief. Military personnel in Turkey, Israel, Jordan, Egypt, and the Mediterranean Sea are eligible for combat zone tax benefits. Certifications for Turkey and Israel were effective from January 1, 2003, while certifications for Jordan, Egypt, and the Mediterranean Sea were effective from March 19, 2003. Certifications for Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea area expired on April 20, 2003, and July 31, 2003, respectively. Military operations in Kosovo and Afghanistan have been designated as combat zones for tax relief under Code Sec. 112. Kosovo was designated effective March 24, 1999, while Afghanistan was designated effective September 19, 2001. These areas will continue to be qualified hazardous duty areas for as long as any member of the Armed Forces serving there is entitled to hostile fire/imminent danger pay. The DOD has certified military personnel in Uzbekistan, Kyrgystan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, and Jordan for combat zone tax benefits. Effective dates for certification vary. Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, and parts of the former Yugoslavia were designated as Qualified Hazardous Duty Areas for tax relief under P.L. 104-117. The law designates Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, and Macedonia as \"qualified hazardous duty areas\" and treats them as combat zones for U.S. peace-keeping troops participating in certain operations."
