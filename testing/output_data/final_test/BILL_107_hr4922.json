    "content": "The \"First Amendment Restoration Act\" may be cited as the short title of this Act. The findings section follows. The \"First Amendment Restoration Act\" acknowledges the fundamental right to practice religion and express religious thought. The Framers of the Constitution intentionally excluded federal government authority over religious affairs and free speech, as outlined in the establishment and freedom of speech clauses of the First Amendment. The First Amendment is a restriction on federal government power, not a grant of authority. The Supreme Court reversed its interpretation of the First Amendment in 1947, introducing the concept of separation of church and state. The Supreme Court has upheld the separation of church and state, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a high wall between the two. Recent rulings have restricted freedom of speech on religious matters, such as outlawing prayer in schools and displaying the Ten Commandments in public places, showing hostility towards religious thought. These decisions have undermined both our moral code and system of law and justice. The Court's abrupt change in rulings regarding prayer in schools and the First Amendment has been criticized for ignoring historical precedent, the wording of the Amendment, and the framers' intent. Congress is urged to review these rulings and the Amendment's history to determine original intent. The Supreme Court has ruled that prayer in schools is unconstitutional, even if voluntary and denominationally neutral. Freedom of speech and press are guaranteed to students and teachers unless the topic is religious, in which case it becomes unconstitutional. It is also unconstitutional for students to see the Ten Commandments as they might read, meditate upon, respect, or obey them. The Supreme Court has ruled that prayer in schools is unconstitutional, even if voluntary and denominationally neutral. It is also unconstitutional for students to pray aloud or display the Ten Commandments in public places. Additionally, students cannot engage in prayer when addressing an assembly of peers as it violates the establishment clause. The Supreme Court's rulings on prayer and religious speech in public places violate the free speech clause of the First Amendment. This constitutes de facto legislation, a violation of the separation of powers doctrine. The intent of the First Amendment was clear in prohibiting the Federal Government from favoring any religious denomination. The Supreme Court's rulings on prayer and religious speech in public places violate the free speech clause of the First Amendment. The Court has relied on the metaphor of \"Separation of Church and State\", which is not found in the Constitution. This metaphor was taken out of context from a letter by Thomas Jefferson to the Danbury Baptists expressing concerns about government intrusion in religious matters. The Court's interpretation of the Separation of Church and State has been criticized for taking Thomas Jefferson's words out of context and misrepresenting his intent. Justice William Rehnquist argued that there is no historical basis for the idea of a \"wall of separation\" between church and state as constitutionalized in the Everson case. The \"wall of separation between church and state\" is criticized for diverting judges from the intentions of the Bill of Rights drafters. The metaphor should be abandoned as it is based on bad history and clouds our perception. The Constitution does not prohibit the Alabama Legislature from endorsing prayer, as interpreted by the majority. George Washington himself would be shocked by this interpretation. The \"wall of separation between church and state\" is criticized for diverting judges from the intentions of the Bill of Rights drafters. Justice Rehnquist argues that the metaphor leads judges astray from the actual intentions of the drafters. It is necessary to review Jefferson's intent in using this \"wall\" and the involvement of the framers of the First Amendment. The Court could have referred to Jefferson's advice on interpreting the original intent of the First Amendment instead of relying on him as a legal authority. Jefferson emphasized understanding the spirit of the debates and conforming to the probable meaning at the time of adoption. The First Amendment's principal authors were Fisher Ames and Elbridge Gerry, not Thomas Jefferson. Other participants included John Vining, Daniel Carroll, Charles Carroll, Benjamin Huntington, Roger Sherman, Oliver Ellsworth, William Paterson, James Madison, and George Mason. Jefferson did not participate in the record. George Mason and James Madison proposed different wordings for the First Amendment, emphasizing the equal right to religious freedom without favoring any particular sect. Jefferson did not participate in the drafting of the First Amendment. The First Amendment ensures that civil rights are not restricted based on religious beliefs, and no national religion is established. The true intent of the amendment was to prevent rivalry among Christian sects and promote religious freedom. Justice Joseph Story emphasized that the amendment was not meant to promote other religions or infidelity but to protect Christianity. The First Amendment aims to prevent rivalry among Christian sects and avoid a national ecclesiastical establishment. George Washington's statements support the idea that the government should not restrict free speech in religious matters. George Washington emphasized the importance of prosperity, religion, and morality as pillars of human happiness. James Wilson, an active member of the Convention and later a Supreme Court Justice, highlighted the correlation between religion and civil laws, stating that they are friends and mutual supporters, not rivals. Wilson did not mention a \"separation of church and state.\" Enemies, religion, and law are described as twin sisters, friends, and mutual assistants by James Wilson. Fisher Ames, who played a key role in finalizing the First Amendment, did not mention a separation of church and state. The Congress is urged to defend the Constitution in light of the Court's reluctance to address this issue. The Constitution empowers Congress to check and balance other branches of government in case of power abuses. Congress must act to address such problems. SEC. 3. REMOVAL OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM-RELATED CASES FROM FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT JURISDICTION. The text chunk discusses the exclusion of jurisdiction over religious freedom-related cases from federal district court jurisdiction. It amends Chapter 85 of title 28, United States Code, by adding a new section that prohibits district courts from hearing such cases. The definition of a \"religious freedom-related case\" is also provided in the amendment. SEC. 4. Removal of religious freedom-related cases from federal claims court jurisdiction. The United States Court of Federal Claims will no longer have jurisdiction over any religious freedom-related cases, as defined by actions involving religious freedom provisions in State or Federal statutes. This amendment is added to Chapter 91 of title 28, United States Code. The amendments made by this Act will apply to cases filed on or after the enactment date."
