The Iran Human Rights Act of 2007 highlights the lack of democracy in Iran, where an unelected Supreme Leader holds ultimate power, appointing key officials and controlling the political system with little accountability. Members of the Council of Guardians, chosen by the Supreme Leader, vet all candidates in Iran. Since the rise of President Ahmadinejad in Iran, there has been a re-entrenchment of revolutionary forces in the political system. Human rights have steadily declined with rampant torture, executions, and censorship prevalent. President Ahmadinejad's regime in Iran has implemented harsh methods of punishment, including restrictions on media content, book publications, and an increase in the activities of the \"morals police.\" The United Nations General Assembly expressed grave concern over the deteriorating human rights situation in Iran, urging the government to respect freedom of assembly, opinion, and expression, eliminate torture, and discrimination. The 2006 State Department Country Reports on Human Rights Practices and Human Rights Watch's World Report 2006 highlight Iran's poor human rights record, with serious abuses committed by quasi-official \"parallel institutions\" like paramilitary groups and intelligence agents. These groups violently attack peaceful protesters and run illegal secret prisons and interrogation centers. Uniformed police officers are reluctant to challenge these plainclothes agents. According to the 2006 State Department International Religious Freedom Report, Iran's population is predominantly Shi'a Muslim with significant discrimination against religious minorities. The Secretary of State has designated Iran as a country of particular concern for religious freedom violations. United Nations Special Rapporteur Ambeyi Ligabo submitted a report on freedom of opinion and expression in 2004. In 2004, Mr. Ligabo reported to the Commission on Human Rights about the repression of critical views leading to self-censorship, hindering freedom of expression. In 2006, a student protestor died in Evin Prison due to medical complications from a hunger strike, as per the State Department Country Reports on Human Rights Practices. Amnesty International's 2003 Report on Iran highlighted the death of journalist Zahra Kazemi after being detained and beaten. Despite court orders for investigation, no progress has been made on her case. Women in Iran are legally deprived of their basic rights. In Iran, women face legal discrimination with their court testimony and compensation for crime victims being half that of men. Gender segregation is mandated in public spaces. Iran is identified as the most active state sponsor of terrorism. There is a growing movement for political change towards democracy and freedom in the country. The people of Iran are frustrated with the slow pace of reform and suppression of nonviolent change. Mohammad Khatami visited Washington, DC despite Iran's sponsorship of terrorism and human rights abuses. President Ahmadinejad is restricting freedom of expression in higher education. President Ahmadinejad expressed concern about the secular nature of universities in Iran and called for the removal of liberal and secular faculty members. AMENDMENTS TO THE IRAN FREEDOM SUPPORT ACT.

A report on activities must be submitted to specific committees annually. (c) Sense of Congress.--Title III of the Iran Freedom Support Act is amended to include the appointment of a Special Envoy to review strategies for improving human rights in Iran and submit annual reports to specific committees. The sense of Congress emphasizes the importance of human rights in Iran, linking it to democracy, freedom, nuclear weapons acquisition, and the global war on terror. It stresses that addressing human rights violations in Iran should be a top priority in U.S. foreign policy, separate from efforts to address the nuclear threat. Additionally, a regional framework is established. Establishment of a regional framework for discussing human rights, scientific and educational cooperation, and economic and trade issues, modeled on the Helsinki process by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Congress suggests exploring a regional human rights dialogue on Iran engaging all countries in the region in a commitment to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms. The United Nations plays a significant role in promoting human rights in Iran, as evidenced by Resolution 61/176 expressing concern over human rights violations. Various UN bodies are urged to address the severe violations in Iran. The Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women recommends that UN member states should not support Iran as a member of the UN Human Rights Council until Iran improves its human rights record and adheres to the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. The Special Envoy should collaborate with the UN to gather accurate statistical data on social and political conditions in Iran. The sense of Congress is that the commitment to human rights and democracy of an Iranian national applying for a US visa should be considered for visa eligibility."
