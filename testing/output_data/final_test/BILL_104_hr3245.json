It introduces a new section for higher education tuition and fees deductions in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Education Affordability Act of 1996\" introduces a new section allowing deductions for qualified higher education expenses paid by individuals during the taxable year. The deduction is subject to limitations, including a dollar cap of $5,000 ($2,500 for married individuals filing separately) and a reduction based on modified adjusted gross income. The deduction for qualified higher education expenses is subject to limitations based on modified adjusted gross income. The amount deductible equals the excess of the taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income over $60,000 ($80,000 for joint returns) divided by $15,000. The deduction for qualified higher education expenses is limited by modified adjusted gross income. Qualified expenses include tuition and fees for the taxpayer, spouse, or dependents. Adjusted gross income is calculated without considering this deduction. The term \"eligible student\" for higher education expenses does not include sports, games, or hobbies unless part of a degree program or deductible without regard to this section. Nonacademic fees like student activity fees are also excluded. The term \"eligible student\" refers to a student who meets specific requirements under the Higher Education Act of 1965 and is carrying at least half of the full-time workload for their course of study. The tax deduction for education expenses requires the taxpayer to provide the name, age, and taxpayer identification number of the eligible student on their tax return. An institution of higher education must meet certain criteria to be eligible for this deduction. Title IV of the Act outlines special rules for deductions related to qualified higher education expenses, including restrictions on double benefits and deductions for dependents. The deduction for qualified higher education expenses is limited to the amount exceeding the exclusion under section 135 for the taxable year.
