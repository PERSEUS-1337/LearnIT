    "content": "The United States uses various mechanisms and instruments to prevent nuclear weapons proliferation, including the NPT, IAEA safeguards, NSG, and economic sanctions. U.S. laws governing nuclear cooperation with other countries are also important in this effort. Congress is concerned that changes may be needed to prevent further proliferation due to the global interest in nuclear power. The report provides an overview of the global nuclear power industry and the state of the U.S. nuclear industry. The report discusses the U.S. nuclear industry's reliance on international trade and foreign suppliers, as well as nuclear nonproliferation mechanisms. It highlights U.S. nuclear cooperation agreements as a key tool to promote nuclear commerce while preventing clandestine weapons programs. Congressional regulations, such as the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act of 1978, play a significant role in overseeing civil nuclear commerce. In the 113th Congress, Members introduced bills to strengthen oversight of nuclear cooperation agreements to prevent proliferation of nuclear weapons. Concerns have risen about countries obtaining sensitive nuclear technology for enrichment or reprocessing, which can be used for both reactor fuel and nuclear weapons. The curr_chunk discusses the use of uranium for reactor fuel and nuclear weapons, as well as the production of plutonium through reprocessing spent nuclear fuel. It highlights the difficulty of obtaining fissile material for nuclear weapons and the congressional interest in nuclear cooperation agreements. Sixteen countries plan to build their first nuclear power plants by 2030. The World Nuclear Association reports that sixteen countries are set to construct their first nuclear power plants by 2030. Despite concerns about safety and economic competitiveness, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) predicts significant growth in nuclear power generation by 2030, driven by the Far East and Eastern Europe. The Fukushima disaster in 2011 led to a decline in global nuclear power generation, but the IAEA believes that nuclear energy will continue to play a crucial role in the energy mix due to population growth, electricity demand, climate change concerns, and energy security. The future of nuclear power is hindered by construction delays, cost overruns, and competition from renewable energy. China, India, and Russia lead in reactor construction, while ten countries are building or planning their first nuclear reactors. OECD reports that 36 countries are actively preparing or interested in starting a nuclear power program. The OECD categorizes potential nuclear newcomer countries based on their economies and electrical grid capacity. Only a few countries export nuclear reactors, with India trying to join. Some emerging nuclear power states have agreements with non-U.S. reactor suppliers. The United States has nuclear cooperation agreements with multiple countries and plans to negotiate more in the next three years. The United States is negotiating a 123 agreement with Jordan, with negotiations currently suspended. The most recent 123 agreement with Vietnam prohibits them from enriching or reprocessing U.S.-obligated nuclear materials without specific U.S. consent. The U.S. has also concluded Memoranda of Understanding regarding potential nuclear cooperation with Bahrain, Jordan, Mongolia, and Saudi Arabia. The Nuclear Suppliers Group recently added criteria to its guidelines for the supply of fuel cycle technologies. Commercial reprocessing is being done in France, the United Kingdom, Russia, Japan, and India. China has a pilot reprocessing plant and plans for a larger facility by 2017. South Korea is working on pyroprocessing research. Some countries have limited natural resources for nuclear technology. Argentina and Brazil are pursuing nuclear enrichment programs, with Argentina re-commissioning its enrichment plant and Brazil gradually developing its capabilities. Various countries, including the United States, Russia, France, Japan, China, and members of the Urenco consortium, are involved in commercial enrichment activities. France's Eurodif consortium operates an enrichment plant on its soil, while Argentina and Brazil are also enhancing their nuclear fuel production capabilities. Brazil is expanding its enrichment facility for nuclear power reactors, with the only currently operating U.S. enrichment plant being the Urenco USA facility in New Mexico. Reports suggest that current commercial enrichment capacity can meet global nuclear fuel needs, making new enrichment plants unnecessary. World enrichment capacity is expected to exceed nuclear fuel requirements through 2020. Most countries rely on foreign enrichment services for their nuclear fuel. There is a growing interest in multinational fuel cycle services to ensure fuel supply for nuclear power plants. Urenco, Eurodif, and the International Uranium Enrichment Centre in Angarsk, Russia, provide commercial enrichment services. Russian and U.S. stockpiles of high-enriched uranium are being down-blended for use as low-enriched uranium fuel. The expansion of enrichment capacity by current providers anticipates an increased market in the future. Countries without enrichment capabilities may consider domestic enrichment, leading to a potential shift in the market. The U.S. has seen a decline in its share of the global nuclear market, despite steady exports of nuclear plant components and technology. Non-Russian members of a multinational enrichment technology agreement pledge not to develop uranium enrichment on their own soil. The U.S. was once the dominant supplier of nuclear technology and fuel, but now faces competition from European commercial enrichment plants. Since the late 1970s, the U.S. share of world enrichment capacity has dropped to 7%, with only one Urenco USA plant remaining. General Electric and Westinghouse supplied reactors to foreign utilities in the past, but U.S. reactor technology has been gradually transferred to foreign firms. China is building reactors based on Westinghouse technology under a technology transfer agreement. The U.S. exported enriched uranium and nuclear materials worth $20.7 billion from 1994 to 2008, with Japan accounting for 63% of the exports. Sales of reactor components totaled $4.4 billion during the same period, with South Korea, Mexico, Spain, and the Czech Republic being major importers. South Korea's imports were a result of a technology transfer agreement with U.S. supplier Combustion Engineering. The U.S. exported nuclear services and materials worth millions in 2013. Bilateral nuclear cooperation agreements may be necessary for domestic energy production. U.S. companies designed and built the 100 nuclear power reactors currently operating in the country. The U.S. dominated the global nuclear market with companies like Westinghouse and GE building reactors worldwide. However, U.S. nuclear power development declined after the 1970s, while foreign projects continued. Westinghouse was acquired by a British firm in 1999 and then by Toshiba in 2006, while GE partnered with Hitachi for new projects. Former partners like Areva and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries are now independent in nuclear plant design. South Korea and China may also become independent in the future. Construction of new U.S. nuclear power plants began in 2012, marking a significant shift in the global nuclear industry. License applications for 12 more reactors are currently under consideration by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The current wave of applications for new U.S. nuclear power plants began in late 2007. Many key reactor components, such as large pressure vessel forgings, can no longer be made in the United States, leading to a reliance on non-U.S. manufacturers for major equipment. This shift means that the new U.S. nuclear plants will rely more on a worldwide supply chain than previous plants constructed before 1979. The construction of new U.S. nuclear power plants relies on a global supply chain for key reactor components. Japan Steel Works, Doosan, IHI Corporation, and Mangiarotti Nuclear are involved in producing various components for reactors. The U.S. imported $334.6 million worth of nuclear reactor components from 2006 to 2013, indicating the increasing globalization of the nuclear power industry. The globalization of the nuclear power plant supply chain is evident through the distribution of \"N-stamp\" certifications by ASME. The number of U.S. facilities with N-stamp certification decreased before rising slightly post-2007. In 2010, less than half of N-stamp holders were in the U.S., with 38% in Asia. China saw a significant increase in ASME N-stamp accredited manufacturers from 2009 to 2011. Both major U.S.-based reactor suppliers, GE-Hitachi and Westinghouse, plan to use a global supply chain for new nuclear projects but may use local suppliers for large nuclear construction programs. The domestic content of U.S. reactors could increase if new U.S. nuclear construction materializes, leading to an increase in U.S. supply capacity. The text discusses the involvement of various companies in the construction of nuclear plants and uranium enrichment facilities in the United States. This includes Babcock & Wilcox's restoration of an N-stamp in Mount Vernon, IN, Shaw Group's opening of a module fabrication facility in Lake Charles, LA, and plans for similar facilities by Areva in Newport News, VA. Additionally, there are mentions of URENCO and Areva using European gas centrifuge technology in enrichment plants, as well as Centrus Energy's plans to build an enrichment plant in Ohio with U.S.-developed gas centrifuge technology. The international community has adopted measures to impede nuclear weapons programs, including the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) which prohibits non-nuclear-weapon states from acquiring nuclear weapons. Various companies are involved in constructing nuclear plants and uranium enrichment facilities in the United States, such as Babcock & Wilcox, Shaw Group, Areva, URENCO, and Centrus Energy. GE-Hitachi is considering building an enrichment plant using Australian laser technology in North Carolina or Kentucky. The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) prohibits non-nuclear-weapon states from acquiring nuclear weapons. All U.N. member-states except for India, Israel, and Pakistan are parties to the NPT. NPT state-parties must have safeguards agreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to monitor nuclear facilities and materials to prevent diversion to military purposes. Comprehensive safeguards are in place to verify compliance and prevent the diversion of nuclear material to nuclear weapons. The IAEA uses safeguards to detect nuclear material diversion for weapons, inspecting declared facilities. Additional Protocols enhance the agency's ability to investigate clandestine nuclear activities, allowing expanded access and surprise inspections. 144 NPT states have signed Additional Protocols, with 124 in force. Over 80% of countries with significant nuclear activities have signed Additional Protocols, with 124 in force out of 144 NPT states. Six non-signatories with nuclear reactors under safeguards are Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Egypt, Syria, and Venezuela. Concerns about dual-use technology for weapons have not been realized, as all legitimate transfers are under IAEA safeguards. The United States, through the IAEA, has identified nuclear programs in countries like India, Iran, North Korea, and Pakistan that combine indigenous expertise with foreign assistance. Efforts to standardize nonproliferation criteria have been led by the Nuclear Suppliers Group, but there have been challenges in strengthening these conditions. The NSG has informal restrictions on transferring certain nuclear technologies to non-member states. The Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) has been working on tightening restrictions on the transfer of enrichment and reprocessing technologies to non-member states. Following revelations about a covert nuclear technology procurement network, NSG member states negotiated criteria that recipient states must meet before receiving such technology. The criteria include being an NPT state-party in good standing. The Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) has established criteria for recipient states to meet before receiving enrichment and reprocessing technologies. These criteria include being an NPT state-party in good standing, having comprehensive safeguards agreements, no breaches of obligations, bilateral agreements with nonproliferation assurances, commitment to physical protection standards, effective export controls, adherence to NSG guidelines, and implementation of Additional Protocols or appropriate safeguards agreements approved by the IAEA Board of Governors. Enrichment plants can only be exported if built to prevent technology replication. The Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) has established criteria for recipient states to meet before receiving enrichment and reprocessing technologies. The final guidelines differ from a November 2008 draft, with some subjective criteria removed. Negotiations over the guidelines were contentious, with Turkey raising objections during the 2010 NSG plenary meeting. The Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) has established criteria for recipient states to meet before receiving enrichment and reprocessing technologies. Developing countries, including Argentina and Brazil, have raised objections to the Additional Protocol requirement. The Group of Eight (G-8) nations have issued joint policy statements regarding enrichment and reprocessing supply, including a year-long suspension of transfers from 2004 to 2007. The 2008 Summit declaration emphasized the need for strict conditions on transfers of enrichment and reprocessing equipment to prevent replication of facilities. The G-8 countries endorsed the updated NSG guidelines in 2011. The United States proposed a ban on future transfers of such technology in 2004, facing resistance from developing countries with plans to acquire these technologies. The United States and others discussed multilateral nuclear fuel assurances at the IAEA to discourage states from acquiring their own fuel cycle capabilities. The IAEA approved a Russian-operated fuel reserve in 2009 and an IAEA-administered fuel bank in 2010, located in Kazakhstan. The United States also established its own fuel reserve program. Fuel banks aim to provide reassurance that fuel supply will not be disrupted for political reasons. Some countries are concerned that multilateral fuel arrangements could undermine their right to access nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. Others oppose the fuel bank, seeing it as creating a divide between countries with and without nuclear technologies. However, multilateral solutions remain attractive as domestic nuclear fuel programs may not be economically viable for most countries. Many states rely on foreign supply of LEU fuel for their reactors. Proposals for managing spent nuclear reactor fuel to prevent the spread of reprocessing technology are less developed. Some countries reprocess spent fuel rods into mixed-oxide fuel, while others store spent fuel on-site. Multilateral solutions, like a pyro-processing program in South Korea or an international spent fuel repository, aim to prevent the spread of reprocessing technology. States collaborate on advanced reactor research through initiatives like the Generation IV International Forum and the International Project on Innovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycles. The International Framework for Nuclear Energy Cooperation promotes international collaboration on proliferation-resistant fuel cycle development. The United States and the international community have developed mechanisms to control the spread of enrichment and reprocessing technologies, including UN Security Council resolutions. Bilateral pressure has been used to prevent sensitive fuel cycle technology transfers to countries like Pakistan and Iran. Existing laws require peaceful nuclear cooperation agreements for significant U.S. nuclear cooperation with other countries. No planned transfers of enrichment and reprocessing technologies are noted. Significant nuclear cooperation involves the transfer of U.S.-origin special nuclear material for various purposes. These agreements, known as congressional-executive agreements, set the terms for nuclear cooperation but do not guarantee material or technology transfer. The Atomic Energy Act (AEA) outlines requirements for agreement content, presidential exemptions, determinations, and congressional approval procedures. Section 123 of the AEA mandates that any nuclear cooperation agreement meet nonproliferation criteria. The President must submit any nuclear cooperation agreement that meets nonproliferation criteria to the House and Senate Committees on Foreign Affairs. The State Department provides an unclassified Nuclear Proliferation Assessment Statement (NPAS) and a classified annex to explain how the agreement meets nonproliferation requirements. The President must also determine that the agreement will not pose an unreasonable risk to national defense and security. Exemptions from certain requirements in Section 123a can be granted by the President if deemed necessary. The Atomic Energy Act (AEA) allows the President to exempt certain requirements in Section 123a if they would harm U.S. non-proliferation goals or national security. Congress has 90 days to review a 123 agreement, during which the President consults with the House and Senate Committees on Foreign Affairs. The President must submit the agreement, along with a classified annex and approval statement, after the consultation period. The President submits the agreement to Congress along with the classified annex and approval statement. The 60-day period begins after the initial 30-day period, during which Congress can adopt a joint resolution to approve or disapprove the agreement. If the agreement is not exempted, it becomes effective at the end of the 60-day period unless Congress disapproves it. Congress must adopt a joint resolution of approval within a 60-day period for the agreement to enter into force. Committees are required to hold hearings and submit a report recommending approval or disapproval. If a committee fails to report a resolution by the end of 45 days, it is automatically discharged. The President must keep the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee informed. The United States ensures that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee are kept informed about any new nuclear cooperation agreements. These agreements serve various policy goals such as promoting nonproliferation, supporting the U.S. nuclear industry, and maintaining bilateral relations. The Nuclear Nonproliferation Act of 1978 added new requirements for nuclear cooperation with the U.S. to ensure the peaceful use of transferred nuclear technology. The Nuclear Nonproliferation Act of 1978 added requirements for nuclear cooperation agreements to incentivize compliance with anti-proliferation measures and deter the spread of nuclear technology. Concerns have risen about the potential for countries to acquire sensitive nuclear fuel cycle components, leading to efforts to discourage enrichment and reprocessing. 123 agreements also facilitate valuable international collaborations and contacts. The Nuclear Nonproliferation Act of 1978 added requirements for nuclear cooperation agreements to incentivize compliance with anti-proliferation measures and deter the spread of nuclear technology. These agreements facilitate cooperation between business contacts and laboratories, as well as the Department of Energy and its counterparts, enabling the United States to establish relationships with foreign nuclear energy establishments. The AEA mandates that U.S. nuclear cooperation agreements require U.S. consent for any alteration in form or content of U.S.-origin material or material processed in a plant containing it. The Nuclear Nonproliferation Act of 1978 added requirements for nuclear cooperation agreements to prevent the spread of nuclear technology. These agreements require U.S. consent for any alteration of U.S.-origin material or material processed in a plant containing it. Additionally, U.S. law allows for sanctions on countries transferring or receiving enrichment or reprocessing technology. The Symington Amendment prohibits economic or military assistance to countries involved in such transfers unless under multilateral auspices and IAEA safeguards. The Nuclear Nonproliferation Act of 1978 added requirements for nuclear cooperation agreements to prevent the spread of nuclear technology, including sanctions for countries involved in enrichment or reprocessing technology transfers. The United States has been negotiating with countries to forgo enrichment and reprocessing in nuclear cooperation agreements, citing the example of the 2009 agreement with the United Arab Emirates as a precedent for mitigating nuclear proliferation risks. The 2009 agreement with the United Arab Emirates is seen as a model for responsible nuclear energy development, with unique nonproliferation provisions. The UAE must adhere to an Additional Protocol to its IAEA safeguards agreement before receiving nuclear exports from the US, and it is prohibited from possessing sensitive nuclear facilities or engaging in enrichment or reprocessing activities. The U.S.-UAE agreement allows the United States to terminate nuclear cooperation and reclaim any nuclear material if the UAE engages in activities related to enrichment or reprocessing of nuclear fuel within its territory. The U.S.-UAE nuclear cooperation agreement includes a provision that sets minimum standards for future agreements in the Middle East. If a future U.S. agreement with another regional government is less stringent, the U.S. will consult with the UAE to amend their agreement to match the new terms. This provision is similar to one in the 1981 U.S.-Egypt agreement. The United States has established a higher standard for future nuclear cooperation agreements in the Middle East, following the more stringent agreement with the UAE. Memoranda of Understanding have been signed with other regional governments expressing their commitment to nonproliferation, but these are not legally binding and do not guarantee future nuclear cooperation agreements. The Department of State argues that memoranda are useful for nuclear cooperation agreements, creating opportunities for specific commitments. Efforts to establish the UAE agreement as a model for future agreements in the Middle East may be faltering, with Jordan potentially not willing to include fuel-cycle commitments. Ambassador Richard Stratford mentioned close agreement on similar commitments, but negotiations are currently suspended. The Obama Administration does not see the U.S.-UAE agreement as a definite model for future agreements. The Obama Administration does not see the U.S.-UAE agreement as a definite model for future nuclear cooperation agreements with countries outside the Middle East. While they encourage other countries to make similar commitments, they acknowledge that each country's approach will vary. The Administration has not decided whether to seek similar commitments from other countries. U.S. nuclear cooperation agreements aim to promote growth in the U.S. nuclear industry by facilitating exports, which have remained steady since the mid-1990s. The global market for nuclear cooperation agreements has been steady since the mid-1990s, but new uranium enrichment plants in the US and contracts in China could change this trend. Plans for nuclear power expansion in China and India may lead to growth in US nuclear reactor exports. A consortium led by Westinghouse signed a contract to supply four AP1000 reactors to China, with more units planned for construction. The Westinghouse-China deal includes the transfer of AP1000 technology to Chinese firms for future reactor construction. India plans for up to 12 U.S. nuclear reactors, but projects are delayed by liability issues. U.S. uranium enrichment exports could grow with new plants despite decommissioning of the main plant. The first new commercial enrichment plant in the U.S. since the 1950s began production in June 2010. The U.S. subsidiary of the European enrichment firm Urenco, the Lea County plant reached full licensed capacity in April 2014, with plans for a 50% expansion by 2017. Two new enrichment plants by Areva and Centrus are planned in Idaho and Ohio, respectively, using advanced gas centrifuge technology. GE-Hitachi is considering building an enrichment plant with laser technology. If all planned U.S. enrichment capacity comes online, it would be six times the current level, requiring 123 agreements for construction and export of enriched uranium. 123 agreements benefit the U.S. nuclear energy program by facilitating the import of uranium and foreign firms' involvement in nuclear reactor projects. These agreements also serve as a diplomatic strategy to improve bilateral relations with other countries, as seen in agreements with India and Russia. The report focuses on nonproliferation and nuclear cooperation agreements. Foreign governments provide liability insurance for their nuclear industry, giving companies like Rosatom and Areva sovereign immunity. The U.S. nuclear industry faces challenges in competing for foreign contracts due to lack of similar liability protections. The U.S. has ratified the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage, but it has not entered into force yet. Ratification of the CSC by importing states is a requirement for many U.S. companies to do business abroad. The ratification of the CSC by importing states is a requirement for U.S. companies to do business abroad. French and Russian nuclear companies may be shielded from liability claims, but the specifics are unclear. France and Russia are discussing concerns with India's liability law, which is seen as inconsistent with the CSC. According to an analysis by the Nuclear Energy Agency, Russian and French companies may have less liability in the event of a nuclear accident compared to U.S. companies. This is because Moscow and Paris could negotiate settlements with the Indian government more effectively. Additionally, U.S. suppliers are more likely to face class action lawsuits than suppliers in Russia or France. The influence of the United States in regulating international nuclear commerce has decreased, as the U.S. nuclear industry's market power has declined and foreign competitors are making supply agreements with other countries. Some governments, like members of the NSG, have shown reluctance towards such regulations. Some NSG members resist proposals to restrict technology transfer. In 2008, India was exempted from export guidelines, potentially aiding its nuclear weapons program. China agreed to supply Pakistan with nuclear reactors. Israel and Pakistan, like India, seek exemptions from NSG guidelines. Israel proposed criteria to exempt itself from NSG guidelines and sought a nuclear cooperation agreement with the US. Israel sought a nuclear cooperation agreement with the United States, proposing restrictions on foreign nuclear firms' activities in the U.S. if they provide nuclear power plants to countries without nonproliferation agreements. This is to encourage other nuclear supplier countries to adopt similar export standards. In a letter to President Obama, nuclear energy policy experts targeted France, urging conditions on federal loan guarantees for French nuclear projects unless France adopts the U.S.-UAE framework and supports tough nonproliferation standards. Many foreign firms operating in the United States or participating in U.S. nuclear projects could potentially be subject to sanctions for not adhering to nuclear nonproliferation standards. This could impact companies like the French firm Areva, which has plans for nuclear projects in the U.S. and the Middle East. Denial of loan guarantees, licenses, and contracts by the U.S. could put pressure on these companies and their home governments, potentially affecting planned U.S. nuclear projects. The potential impact of sanctions on foreign firms involved in U.S. nuclear projects and the need for changes in U.S. laws to prevent nuclear proliferation are key concerns for Congress. Factors to consider include the 2011 Nuclear Suppliers Group decision, dependence of the U.S. nuclear industry on foreign suppliers, proliferation threats from nuclear power programs, effectiveness of nonproliferation mechanisms, and U.S. influence on other governments' nuclear supply policies. The curr_chunk discusses the status of worldwide nuclear power plants, U.S. nuclear cooperation agreements, and key articles of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. It outlines the obligations of nuclear-weapon states and non-nuclear weapon states to prevent the transfer or acquisition of nuclear weapons. The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty prohibits the transfer or acquisition of nuclear weapons by non-nuclear-weapon states and upholds the right to peaceful nuclear energy development for all parties. The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty allows for the exchange of equipment, materials, and scientific information for peaceful nuclear energy use. Parties cooperate to develop nuclear energy applications for peaceful purposes, especially in non-nuclear-weapon states. The Nuclear Suppliers Group consists of 48 countries as of November 1, 2014, with the European Commission participating as an observer."
