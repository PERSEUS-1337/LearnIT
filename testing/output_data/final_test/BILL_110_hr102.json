It emphasizes the importance of preparing the workforce for global technological advancements and highlights the role of scientific knowledge in innovation, national security, and economic growth. Strengthening postsecondary education in STEM fields is crucial for maintaining the country's competitiveness. Collaboration between associate degree-granting colleges and the nation is key to addressing shortages of skilled workers in these areas. Enlarging the role of community colleges in workforce training by creating seamless transitions from certificate programs to associate degree programs in STEM fields. SEC. 3. ARTICULATION AGREEMENT PROGRAM. This section introduces a new program aimed at creating seamless transitions from certificate programs to associate degree programs in STEM fields. The purpose of this section is to enhance scientific and technological education at associate-degree-granting public institutions by forming partnerships with bachelor-degree-granting public institutions. An articulation agreement is defined as a transfer agreement between higher education institutions. Grants will be awarded to public institutions under this program. Public institutions of higher education can receive grants to support programs for statewide articulation agreements. Private institutions can also participate in these agreements. Institutions interested in the program must submit an application to the Secretary. Funds from the grants can be used for various purposes. Funds from grants can be used to establish statewide articulation agreements in math, science, engineering, and technology between public 2-year and 4-year institutions. Additionally, funds can be used to create agreements within community colleges to increase completion rates for associate degree programs in these fields. The grant funds can be used to establish statewide articulation agreements between 2-year and 4-year institutions, develop a statewide articulation guide, and provide professional development for 2-year college faculty. The Secretary will collect data from State commissioners to monitor program progress and success. The Secretary will collect data from State commissioners to evaluate the success of the program authorized by this section. A report on the evaluation results will be submitted to Congress within 2 years after the first fiscal year of grant funding. Additionally, the Secretary will define 'degree programs in math, science, engineering, and technology' and authorize $10,000,000 for grants in fiscal year 2008 with additional funding for the following 4 years."
