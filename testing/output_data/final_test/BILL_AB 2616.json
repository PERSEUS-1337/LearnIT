    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 30013 is added to the Public Resources Code by the State of California. The Legislature emphasizes environmental justice and equality by applying anti-discrimination laws to the commission and public agencies involved in this division. No person in California shall be unlawfully denied access or discriminated against based on various factors in programs funded by the state. The Public Resources Code emphasizes environmental justice as fair treatment for all in the development and enforcement of environmental laws. The commission consists of 15 members including representatives from the Natural Resources Agency, Transportation, State Lands Commission, and public appointees. The Coastal Commission consists of 15 members, with six representatives selected from different coastal regions defined by specific counties. The Governor, Speaker of the Assembly, and Senate Committee on Rules each select two members from various coastal regions. The Coastal Commission is made up of 15 members, with representatives from different coastal regions like Los Angeles, Orange, and San Diego counties. The Governor appoints members to work with communities disproportionately affected by pollution and environmental justice issues. Section 30604 of the Public Resources Code is amended to require a coastal development permit to be issued before certification of the local coastal program. The permit can only be denied if the proposed development would prejudice the local government's ability to conform with Chapter 3 of the Code. After certification of the local coastal program, a coastal development permit shall be issued if the proposed development is in conformity with the certified program. The permit for development between a public road and the sea must also comply with public access and recreation policies. Development outside the coastal zone is not subject to these permit requirements, and the commission cannot deny a permit based on adverse environmental effects outside the zone. No coastal development permit can be denied based on a public agency's plans to acquire the property unless authorized and funded within a year. If a permit is denied for this reason and the property is not acquired promptly, the permit cannot be denied when the development application is resubmitted. The commission must promote housing opportunities for low and moderate-income individuals. When reviewing applications for low- and moderate-income housing, the agency cannot require density reductions unless there is evidence that the requested density cannot be accommodated on the site in compliance with relevant regulations. The commission aims to promote affordable housing for low and moderate-income individuals in the coastal zone. Environmental justice can be considered when reviewing coastal development permits."
