    "content": "System-wide airline passenger volumes have grown over the past four years, surpassing pre-9/11 levels. Flight delays and cancellations have also increased, with the percentage of delayed flights in 2007 expected to surpass the record set in 2000. Cancelled flights have also risen, although not as high as in 1999, 2000, and 2001. Airlines have extended scheduled flight times on congested routes, leading to longer trip durations compared to 10 years ago. Further schedule adjustments may increase travel times. The increase in airline passenger volumes has led to a rise in flight delays and cancellations. Despite airlines adjusting schedules to account for delays, passenger trips are getting longer due to increased wait times at security checkpoints. The DOT has formed a task force to address ongoing issues with airline delays. The DOT has formed a task force and a special aviation rulemaking committee to address airline delays and customer service issues in the New York metropolitan area. Recommendations are expected by the end of 2007, with proposed options to remedy these problems. Congress is also involved in addressing aviation congestion and delay at busy airports. There are concerns over aviation congestion and delay at major airports in the New York metropolitan area, with on-time arrival and departure statistics ranking Newark Liberty, John F. Kennedy International, and LaGuardia at the bottom among the busiest airports in the US. Delays at these airports have been around one hour in length between January 2002 and September 2007. Delays at Newark Liberty Airport averaged 67 minutes for departures and 73 minutes for arrivals from September 2006 to September 2007. In the New York, New Jersey, and Philadelphia region, 44% of all air delays in the US occurred over the summer of 2007. There was a significant increase in flight cancellations at JFK, LGA, and EWR in 2007 compared to previous years. JFK had 3.18% of flights cancelled, LGA had 4.81%, and EWR had 3.65%. These rates were higher than previous years and above the system-wide averages. Delays in air travel are not primarily caused by severe weather conditions, accounting for only 6% of all air carrier delays. Instead, the main reasons for delays are the system's inability to handle weather, congestion, and other factors, known as national aviation system delays, which make up 31% of all air carrier delays. The Department of Transportation believes that investing in new technologies and more efficient procedures for air traffic management can help alleviate these delays. Other sources of delays include maintenance difficulties and inefficiencies in air carrier operations. Maintenance difficulties and inefficiencies in air carrier operations contribute to 27% of delays, while cascading effects from late aircraft account for 36% of delays. Root causes of initial schedule delays are linked to system inefficiencies and scheduling constraints. Security-related delays have a minimal impact on air carrier operations. Analysis shows no single cause for delays, but rather a variety of factors grouped into three categories. The leading cause of flight delays is late aircraft arrivals, possibly due to airline over-scheduling or increased fleet utilization. Efforts to reduce operational costs have led to shorter turn times between flights, impacting airport infrastructure and air traffic management systems. The increase in operational tempo in the aviation system leads to cascading delays throughout the day. Despite a decrease in the number of operating passenger aircraft from 2000 to 2006, delays still increase as the day progresses. This trend is evident in statistics showing a rise in delays later in the operational day. The number of large jets in service has decreased significantly from 2000 to 2006, with a 14% decline. Large jets now make up about 58% of the total scheduled passenger service fleet, compared to 66% in 2000. The trend is towards reducing large jets and increasing smaller regional jets, resulting in a smaller average aircraft size and passenger capacity. The shift towards smaller aircraft has led to increased congestion at airports, with a 128% increase in aircraft with fewer than 100 seats and a 120% increase in flights using aircraft with 100 to 200 seats at JFK over the past five years. This trend is driven by passenger demand for air travel and the need for more airport gates, causing delays and cascading effects on flight schedules. The shift towards smaller aircraft has led to increased congestion at airports, with a significant increase in flights using aircraft with fewer than 100 seats and 100 to 200 seats at JFK over the past five years. This trend reflects a dramatic change in operations at JFK, historically known for widebody aircraft, with a similar but less pronounced shift at LGA and EWR. The comparison of flight schedules in August 2002 and August 2007 showed little change in the number of flights using aircraft with more than 100 seats. Factors like LGA slot rules and airlines operating unprofitable flights to keep slots influence scheduling practices, despite initiatives to reduce congestion. Airlines continue to use smaller aircraft instead of optimizing capacity with large aircraft at congested airports like LGA. At congested airports like LGA, airlines use smaller aircraft on routes with low load factors, impacting scheduling. Reasons include offering flexibility to consumers, serving smaller communities, and capturing market share. Political incentives like Essential Air Service subsidies also play a role. Despite chronic delays and customer dissatisfaction, airlines face a \"prisoner's dilemma\" due to intense competition and fear of losing market share. The aviation system in the United States is highly concentrated at a small number of airports, with the 35 busiest handling 75% of passengers. Demand for air travel is focused in major metropolitan regions like New York, leading to capacity strains for commercial and private jets. Airlines face a \"prisoner's dilemma\" in adjusting schedules due to fear of competitors gaining an advantage. The New York Metropolitan Area faces capacity strains for commercial and private jets, with limited options for expansion at major airports. A study in 2007 highlighted the need for additional capacity in the national airspace system, with Stewart International Airport seen as a potential solution. The FAA was slow to recognize this need, but the acquisition of SWF by the NY/NJ Port Authority may help address the capacity issue. The acquisition of SWF by the NY/NJ Port Authority may help address the capacity strains faced by the New York Metropolitan Area for commercial and private jets. Despite challenges like distance from Manhattan and lack of ground transportation infrastructure, experts are hopeful as options for airport expansion in the region are limited. The FAA/MITRE Corporation 2007 study identified multiple airports and metropolitan regions in need of additional capacity beyond ongoing expansion projects. Experts are focusing on overcoming technical and procedural constraints on airspace design in congested areas. Emerging technologies, such as precision satellite-based navigation, are key components of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NGATS) Concept of Operations (CONOPS). However, this system won't be fully operational for another 17 years. In the meantime, the FAA is working on improving the efficiency of the current air traffic system through airspace redesign initiatives. The FAA has implemented initiatives to improve air traffic efficiency, including the National Choke Point Initiative and the NY/NJ/PHL Airspace Redesign. These initiatives aim to reduce delays by 20% through airspace redesign and procedural changes. The FAA has implemented initiatives such as ground delays, airspace flow programs, and decision-aiding tools to mitigate air traffic delays. These tactical measures are seen as temporary solutions, as traffic growth continues to offset efficiency gains. Experts suggest a comprehensive systems-based approach is needed to address capacity needs and reduce delays nationally, particularly in the New York area. The airline industry advocates for maximizing airport and airspace capacity in the New York metropolitan region to reduce chronic delays. The Air Transport Association calls for a delay management \"czar\" to coordinate initiatives and involve stakeholders in finding operational solutions. The DOT's special committee aims to address system inefficiencies, but specific solutions remain unclear. The DOT's special committee aims to address system inefficiencies in the New York metropolitan region, but it is unclear what specific solutions they may offer beyond existing initiatives. Academic experts suggest considering demand-management or market-based approaches to reduce congestion and delays at high-density airports. Business jets and high-performance general aviation aircraft also play a role in the air transportation system. Business jets and high-performance general aviation aircraft contribute to air traffic congestion and carrier delays, with airlines arguing that their operations strain system capacity. General aviation makes up a small percentage of flight operations at busy airports, but the number of private jet aircraft in U.S. airspace has significantly increased over the years. The number of private jet aircraft in U.S. airspace has significantly increased from about 1,800 in 1970 to almost 18,000 today. The growth of business aviation and the proliferation of these aircraft have led to increased workload for the FAA. In the New York area, there is evidence of additional demand for air traffic services from general aviation, with a threefold increase in instrument operations at Teterboro Airport over thirty years. The impact of this increased general aviation utilization on airline operations and nearby airport delays is still uncertain. The impact of high-performance general aviation aircraft on flight delays at nearby airports is a point of contention among airlines and aviation interest groups. Options for reducing air traffic congestion and minimizing delays are being considered, with a focus on airspace redesign and new technologies. While long-term gains are expected through investment in Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) technologies, near-term fixes are being sought to address congestion in the current situation. The government and aviation industry are looking for near-term solutions to address congestion and delays, particularly in the New York area. Options include airspace redesign, opening military airspace to civilian flights, implementing congestion management tools, and utilizing larger aircraft at high-density airports. The FAA has finalized plans for airspace redesign in the NY/NJ/PHL region, with implementation set to begin soon. The FAA will soon implement the NY/NJ/PHL Airspace Redesign plan to increase efficiency at New York area airports and Philadelphia International Airport. The plan aims to reduce delays by 200,000 hours annually, saving $248 million in airline operating costs and $37 million during severe weather. This initiative offers significant potential to cut delays without impacting airline schedules. President Bush announced a plan to open military airspace along the east coast to airline flights during the Thanksgiving holiday period, establishing two additional flight paths. This move was seen as both unprecedented and as giving air traffic controllers existing authority to use military airspace during holiday periods when not in use for training. The Air Transport Association (ATA) reported moderate utilization of military airspace during the Thanksgiving holiday period, with 10 to 40 aircraft per hour using temporary flight paths. Experts have mixed opinions on whether more extensive use of military airspace along the east coast could alleviate airspace congestion and delays. Military airspace can potentially alleviate airspace congestion and delays by allowing more direct routing of civilian flights. However, coordinating civilian flight activity through these areas would require close collaboration between the FAA and the DOD, which may not align with the current airspace structure and procedures. The challenge lies in predicting when military airspace will be inactive and available for civilian use. Better coordination between the DOD and the FAA could open more routes for civilian flights, especially with the increasing use of satellite-based navigation. Decision aiding tools are being developed to optimize airspace utilization and minimize disruptions from weather events. However, the impact on airport capacity constraints along the east coast may be limited. The FAA has developed tools like ground delays and airspace flow programs to manage arrival delays and congestion in crowded airspace. Decision-aiding tools such as the flight schedule monitor and flight schedule analyzer are used to improve airspace efficiency. The FAA utilizes various tools like ground delay and airspace flow procedures to optimize air traffic flows and minimize delays. Collaborative decision-making tools and operational playbooks are also used to mitigate disruptions caused by severe weather. However, technological advancements in navigation and surveillance capabilities are needed to further improve delay reduction. Airport traffic is managed through metering at different points in the aviation system. Technology is crucial for improving air traffic flow and reducing delays. The Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) is a long-term solution to increase traffic density and airspace flexibility. Despite its potential, full implementation is still pending. By utilizing aircraft satellite-based navigation systems with required navigation performance (RNP) and area navigation (RNAV) procedures, the FAA and airline operators can enhance airspace utilization, increase system capacity, and reduce delays. Emerging satellite-based technologies offer opportunities for procedural changes that improve system efficiency, such as fanned departure headings, closely spaced approaches to parallel runways, direct routing capabilities, and flexibility in routing around weather systems. These advancements show potential for significant improvements in system efficiency and delay reduction at airports like New York and PHL. RNAV/RNP arrivals and departures are available at New York area airports and PHL, expected to be used more with airspace redesign. Upgauging larger aircraft and reducing schedules can help reduce congestion, but airlines have been downgauging to increase load factor and cut costs in a competitive market. Airlines aim to optimize fleet composition to serve various markets cost-effectively, balancing the need for upgauging larger aircraft in competitive markets to reduce congestion with the challenge of maintaining scheduling flexibility and load factors. Without incentives, airlines may be hesitant to upgauge on their own, as offering fewer flights could put them at a competitive disadvantage. Demand management in aviation involves controlling capacity and congestion through administrative or economic mechanisms, such as airport slot controls. Despite attempts to create a market for slots, these efforts have not met expectations. Congestion pricing has been a focus of policy discussions in addressing airport congestion. Congestion pricing is a form of demand management that aims to reduce congestion by using pricing techniques. It can be applied at the airport level, including landing fees. Limited experience with congestion pricing exists in the US and UK. Demand management techniques to ration transportation infrastructure have been supported by economists, but Americans have shown resistance to tolls and other pricing mechanisms. Some Americans resist tolls and other transportation pricing mechanisms, viewing roads as free goods paid for through taxes. Economists see fuel taxes as user fee proxies, not true user fees. Despite peak period pricing in other sectors, the national aviation system lacks differentiation in pricing. Congestion pricing in the national aviation system is opposed by various groups, including regional airlines, business aircraft operators, and general aviation operators. They fear discrimination and believe it will benefit large airlines. The airline industry also objects to congestion pricing at JFK. Residents of smaller communities worry about being priced out of major airports. The Airport and Airway Development and Revenue Acts of 1970 addressed capacity and delay issues in the national aviation system by creating a funding mechanism through the airport and airway trust fund. The FAA intervened in the late 1960s by implementing capacity controls at major airports like Chicago O'Hare, New York Kennedy, LaGuardia, and Washington Reagan National. The slot controls system was implemented at major airports in the late 1960s to allocate takeoffs and landings among incumbent airlines. These controls lasted for over 3 decades and were managed by scheduling committees largely composed of representatives from incumbent airlines. This arrangement was seen as a restraint on competition and hindered new entrant airlines from accessing slots. The slot controls system at major airports allocated takeoffs and landings among airlines. New entrants struggled to access slots, leading to FAA intervention. In 1986, a \"buy/sell\" rule allowed airlines to trade slots, but incumbent airlines were reluctant to give up control. Sales of slots occurred through mergers, but the system did not effectively increase competition. The slot controls system at major airports allocated takeoffs and landings among airlines. New entrants struggled to access slots, leading to FAA intervention. In the end, Congress legislated a phase out of slot controls at most airports, aiming to increase competition. The phase out of slot controls at major airports led to exemptions for certain aircraft types. At LaGuardia in 2000, regional jet traffic surged, prompting a moratorium on new service. Capacity controls were reintroduced after September 11th. At Chicago O'Hare, capacity was managed through voluntary reductions in scheduled traffic. The FAA implemented a rule in 2006 to limit operations until new airport capacity is available in 2009. The FAA is seeking to implement capacity controls at JFK airport due to a major increase in traffic. Options being explored include voluntary rescheduling actions by airlines or implementing peak period and congestion pricing. The FAA aims to limit JFK flights on a per hour basis by asking individual airlines to adjust their service accordingly. The FAA is considering implementing congestion pricing at JFK airport to manage increased traffic. In the past, temporary antitrust immunity was granted to airlines to coordinate schedules during specific events like the 1981 air traffic controllers strike. Legislation in 2001 proposed allowing airlines to discuss schedules when airport capacity was exceeded. The authors of bills proposed short-term solutions for airport capacity issues, hoping new capacity would alleviate the problem. Legislation in 2007 addressed congestion at airports, including LGA, with provisions in FAA reauthorization bills. The Bush Administration considered congestion pricing, while H.R. 2881 suggested a process similar to limited antitrust immunity for air carriers at congested airports. The FAA has the authority to facilitate schedule reduction at congested airports if voluntary meetings with air carriers are unsuccessful. Currently, efforts are being made to reduce flights into JFK airport next year through individual meetings with airlines. If this approach fails, there may be a request for antitrust immunity to address scheduling issues and prevent industry collusion. The aviation industry faces concerns about industry collusion on service and fares, as well as the potential for scheduling committees to become anti-competitive. Congestion pricing, while conceptually simple, is challenging to implement in the aviation sector due to the public sector's role in providing airport infrastructure and air traffic control services. Airports and ATC services are often monopolies, further complicating pricing strategies. Congestion pricing in the aviation sector is complex due to the public sector's role in providing airport infrastructure and air traffic control services. Unlike in a competitive marketplace, pricing is not profit-driven but focused on cost recovery or public goals. Research on congestion pricing in transportation infrastructure has mainly focused on surface transportation, with limited scope in aviation. The Bush Administration, led by Secretary of Transportation Peters, supports market mechanisms for infrastructure development in all transportation modes. A proposal for FAA reauthorization in 2007 included a review of congestion pricing, seeking to establish a pilot program at 16 airports. However, this proposal was not adopted in the House or Senate reauthorization bills. The proposal for FAA reauthorization in 2007 included a review of congestion pricing at airports, but it was not adopted in the House or Senate bills. Landing fees at US airports are currently based on aircraft weight and historical/administrative costs, not congestion levels. While landing fees are a significant revenue source for airports, they are not the only source and may not be the majority source of income at many airports. Congestion pricing at airports has not been widely implemented due to various reasons. It has only been applied at a few major airports like New York, Boston, and London Heathrow, with limited success. The theoretical definition of true congestion pricing has not been met in any of these cases. In 1968, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey implemented a $25 fee/surcharge on aircraft with 25 seats or less during peak hours at three air carrier airports to reduce GA operations. The goal was to encourage GA operations to move to Teterboro Airport, which had no scheduled air service. Despite attempts by GA interests to overturn the surcharges in federal courts, they were unsuccessful. The Court upheld the peak period surcharge at LGA, stating it was reasonable and not discriminatory against GA. TEB was seen as a viable alternative for GA aircraft. The surcharge successfully shifted most GA traffic to TEB, but its impact may not be directly applicable to airline traffic at JFK. Boston Logan's 1988 attempt at using pricing to modify airport traffic flow through the Program for Airfield Capacity Efficiency (PACE) raised landing fees for GA and smaller commuter/regional airline aircraft, incentivizing airlines to schedule fewer flights using larger aircraft and causing other aircraft to fly to alternative Boston area airports. The PACE program at Boston Logan Airport raised landing fees for GA and commuter/regional airlines, leading to a legal challenge. An Administrative Law Judge ruled that the program discriminated against these airlines due to the lack of alternative airports for users facing higher fees. The judge allowed the airport to adopt a different landing fee system in the future. Massport faced legal challenges over its PACE program at Boston Logan Airport, which raised landing fees for GA and commuter/regional airlines. The program was in place for only six months, and it is unclear if the reduction in flights during that time was directly linked to the program. Massport has since adopted a peak period surcharge methodology that will only be implemented when traffic delays reach certain levels. London Heathrow has had a peak period pricing regime since 1972, with landing fees based on various factors including flight length, passenger load, and time-of-day. The London Heathrow Airport (LHR) has a fee structure that includes elements such as passenger load, time-of-day, and weight-based factors. The fees have evolved over time, with changes made in response to protests from international carriers. In the late 1980s, U.S. air carriers sought international arbitration over the complicated and high landing fees at LHR, leading to a financial settlement with the airport operator. The London Heathrow Airport (LHR) has seen a consistent increase in landing fees over time, despite changes in the fee structure. LHR is a heavily congested airport with limited capacity allocated through international agreements. Access to LHR is highly coveted by airlines worldwide, leading major carriers to seek additional service opportunities at the airport. The London Heathrow Airport (LHR) has experienced a rise in landing fees over time, attracting major airlines despite congestion. However, peak period fees have not effectively redistributed traffic among airlines due to LHR's desirability as a destination. Airlines have passed on costs to passengers through higher fares, leading to a lack of true peak periods at the airport. The setting of landing fees at airports, particularly in the United States, is typically done by the airport operator with wide discretion. While landing fees can be challenged, airports have the authority to set fees as long as they are fair and non-discriminatory. Airport operators argue for the right to determine pricing policies, including fees for airside infrastructure. Congestion pricing discussions have focused on airports or airspace, with the FAA proposing user fees for airport airspace access. Congestion pricing fees are seen as a cost recovery mechanism, raising questions about their purpose and usage. High fees may be necessary for true congestion relief but could exclude certain user groups like regional airlines. The use of collected fees could impact public and airline industry acceptance of congestion fees. The use of landing fees to fund airport operating costs and infrastructure is widely accepted. Congestion fees may impact airline fares and market competition, potentially leading to higher prices and public dissatisfaction. The use of landing fees to fund airport costs is common, but congestion fees may lead to high airline fares and public discontent. Market forces for airport capacity allocation have been attempted, with some suggesting slot auctions as a viable option. Some researchers suggest a slot auction approach for allocating capacity at congested airports through long-term leases, a secondary market for trading leases, and a daily market for trading resources. The FAA could oversee the market with funds from slot auctions used for airspace improvements. Legal issues may arise from congestion pricing at airports, highlighting a tension in aviation law. The tension in aviation law between federal uniformity and local control over airports is highlighted by legal issues related to congestion pricing mechanisms. Local airport authorities have sought to implement such systems despite objections from the FAA and other parties. The FAA has not proposed a federal congestion pricing mechanism for local airports yet. The report will review current laws governing airports, including federal preemption statutes and constraints on local airport fees. It will also discuss the authority of local governments and airport authorities in implementing congestion pricing mechanisms. The report will review two previous examples of alternative pricing mechanisms proposed by local airport authorities, resulting in federal litigation. The first, at New York's LaGuardia Airport in 1969, was approved by the federal court, while the second, at Boston's Logan Airport, was rejected. Legal issues that may arise if the FAA attempts to offer congestion pricing as a federal mandate will be discussed, including questions about statutory authority and potential adjustments to laws related to airport financing and fund use. The federal government has aimed to establish a coherent national aviation policy since the passage of the Civil Aeronautics Act in 1938, balancing federal regulation with local control over certain aspects of the air transportation system. The Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938 aimed to balance federal regulation with local control over certain aspects of the air transportation system. The Federal Aviation Act of 1958 replaced it but retained similar policies, giving the federal government primary control over aviation, especially in airspace, safety, and discrimination issues. The Act also included a preemption provision prohibiting state and local authorities from enacting laws related to airline pricing. The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 eliminated most economic regulation in the aviation sector. Federal law controls U.S. airspace sovereignty, with the FAA responsible for airspace use and safety. State and local authorities are prohibited from enacting laws related to airline pricing, but retain authority over airport proprietary powers. The Supreme Court has found field preemption in situations where federal regulation is comprehensive or where the federal interest is dominant, limiting states and local governments from interfering with federal control of airspace and aviation issues. Local governments and airport authorities are restricted by federal law in their ability to raise and spend fees and taxes, including those imposed for use of airport facilities. The Anti-Head Tax Act of 1973 prohibits taxes and charges that unreasonably burden interstate commerce. Accepting federal funding, such as from the Airport Improvement Fund, also limits local authority by requiring non-discriminatory access to facilities and similar pricing for airlines. The Supreme Court established the \"proprietor exception\" in City of Burbank v. Lockheed Air Terminal, Inc., allowing local governments some authority over airport rate structures. Lower federal courts have since held that airports can only enforce reasonable, nonarbitrary, and nondiscriminatory rules that advance local interests. The Fifth Circuit rejected broad proprietary power for airport owners in 2000, emphasizing the need for regulations to advance local interests. However, the court did express a willingness to review proprietary powers in certain cases. The issue of congestion pricing remains unclear in terms of permissible authority. In 1968, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey attempted to impose a $25 minimum charge for landing during peak hours at four airports in and around New York City to relieve congestion and improve efficiency. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey imposed a $25 fee for landing during peak hours at major airports, excluding Teterboro Airport. A lawsuit challenged the fee, arguing it discriminated against general aviation and violated federal law. The plaintiffs argued that Teterboro Airport was not a suitable alternative to the major New York airports, leading to practical exclusion. They also claimed that diverting general aviation would not solve airport capacity issues caused by commercial airlines. The court addressed the preemption argument in response. The court found that Port Authority regulations did not conflict with FAA regulations and that Teterboro Airport is a valid alternative to major New York airports. The court upheld the validity of the landing fee scheme implemented by the Massachusetts Port Authority, allowing the fees to go into effect despite opposition from various groups. The fees included a flat-rate landing fee and a weight-based fee, with the court finding no facts relevant to the dispute raised by the plaintiffs. The FAA challenged the landing fees imposed by Massport, claiming they were unfair and discriminatory towards smaller aircraft. The DOT initiated an investigation and requested Massport to suspend the fees, but Massport refused and implemented them. Multiple lawsuits were filed in federal court, alleging that the new fees shifted the cost burden unfairly onto smaller aircraft, violating federal regulations. The district court ruled in favor of Massport, stating that the landing fees were not preempted by federal statutes and were constitutionally valid. The court found that Congress intended for the proprietor to set the fees and that they were reasonable and non-discriminatory. The court ruled in favor of Massport, stating that the PACE fees were not discriminatory and were in line with the airport's objectives. The PACE fee structure went into effect on July 1, 1988, and litigation then shifted to the DOT, where an ALJ concluded that the fees violated grant assurances, were unjustly discriminatory, and preempted by federal law. The ALJ found that the PACE fees at Hanscom Field were discriminatory, violated grant assurances, and were preempted by federal law. The Secretary of Transportation affirmed the ALJ's recommendations but noted that airports have the authority to impose reasonable landing fees. The FAA has authority to regulate air traffic, while airport sponsors can recover costs and improve facilities. Massport suspended the PACE fee pending appeal, which was upheld by the First Circuit Court of Appeals due to unreasonable fees. The court upheld the Secretary's discretion on the issue of the Federal Anti-Head Tax Act, finding Massport's fee structure outside the scope of the act. The appeals court also addressed preemption issues raised by sections 105 and 307 of the law. The appeals court disagreed with the district court and the Secretary on preemption issues regarding sections 105 and 307 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958. The court concluded that the district court erred by not deferring to the Secretary's primary jurisdiction, citing the doctrine of \"primary jurisdiction.\" The district court should have deferred judgment until after FAA and Secretary investigated. The court found Massport's fee structure interfered with air navigation, preempted by federal law. Constitutional issues were not addressed. Uncertainty remains on airport pricing mechanisms for congestion relief. The court found that alternative landing sites were viable for smaller general aviation planes affected by pricing schemes in New York and Teterboro, but not in Boston and Hanscom. The development of aviation law over 20 years played a significant role in the different outcomes between the cases. It is unlikely that another attempt to impose a similar pricing scheme without FAA approval would succeed. This analysis suggests that the fees at LaGuardia are unique. It is possible for local airport authorities to develop a fee structure to reduce congestion at LaGuardia that is not in violation of federal law or FAA regulations. Previous congestion pricing mechanisms have been locally generated, and the FAA has not attempted to impose such a scheme. If the FAA were to make such an attempt, it appears that it may not be impossible for local authorities to take action. The FAA may have legal authority to impose a congestion pricing system at LaGuardia airport based on its statutory mandate regarding airspace management. The FAA has the authority to develop plans and policies for navigable airspace, assign airspace use for aircraft safety and efficiency. This aligns with the FAA's control over air traffic and potential \"negative preemption\" argument for federal regulation. The federal statute allows agencies to set charges for services based on costs, value, public interest, and other factors. The FAA could potentially impose fees for airspace use under this statute, as it provides access to national airspace. This authority has been used by the Civil Aeronautics Board in the past. The Civil Aeronautics Board used the statute to impose and modify filing and licensing fees for airspace use. Questions arise regarding reasonableness and non-discrimination in setting airport fees if only the FAA can impose congestion pricing. If the FAA delegates this authority to local authorities, it may not be subject to current restrictions on fees and regulations. The FAA may have to waive restrictions or refuse to enforce violations if it delegates congestion pricing authority to local airport authorities. The statutes do not grant the Secretary or Administrator the power to waive taxes or non-discrimination requirements. The Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 requires approval only if the airport is available for public use without discrimination. The FAA may need statutory change from Congress to delegate authority over congestion pricing to local airport authorities. There is a question about how funds collected from a federally mandated congestion pricing scheme would be used, as agencies typically must deposit such funds into the federal Treasury unless they have statutory authority to retain them. The FAA may need statutory change from Congress to delegate authority over congestion pricing to local airport authorities. Agencies must deposit funds into the federal Treasury unless they have specific statutory authority to retain them. If the FAA lacks authority to keep fees from a congestion pricing scheme, it cannot delegate that power to local airport authorities. Congress would need to act if funds collected are to go elsewhere than the \"general fund.\" To retain and spend funds from a congestion pricing mechanism, Congress must pass a statute authorizing the use of the funds. Expenditures must be specifically approved and allocated by Congress."
