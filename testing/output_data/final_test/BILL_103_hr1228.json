    "content": "SECTION 1. FOREIGN COMPANIES CARRYING ON INSURANCE BUSINESS UNDER THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986. Treatment of Effectively Connected Net Investment Income of Insurance Companies is amended under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Foreign companies must recompute their net investment income for taxable years after December 31, 1987, by making specified adjustments. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 requires foreign insurance companies to adjust their net investment income for taxable years after December 31, 1987. Excess or lesser amounts in the recomputed effectively connected net investment income compared to the original year will impact the effectively connected net investment income for the adjustment year. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 mandates adjustments for foreign insurance companies' net investment income post-December 31, 1987. Any excess or shortfall in the recomputed effectively connected net investment income from the original year will affect the net investment income for the adjustment year. Interest on adjustments is payable based on the underpayment or overpayment that would have occurred if adjustments were made for the recomputed year. The term 'recomputed effectively connected net investment income' is defined as the greater of the cumulative effectively connected net investment income for the recomputed year and preceding taxable years after December 31, 1987, or the cumulative minimum effectively connected net investment income for the same period, minus the cumulative recomputed effectively connected net investment income for preceding taxable years. The term 'minimum effectively connected net investment income' is defined as the product of the required United States assets of a foreign company and the domestic investment yield applicable to the company for a taxable year. 'Effectively connected net investment income' refers to the net investment income connected with conducting an insurance business within the United States. Conforming amendments are made to section 842(b) of the Code. The text chunk discusses amendments to section 842 of the Code related to policyholder dividends for foreign mutual life insurance companies.
