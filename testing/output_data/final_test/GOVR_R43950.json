    "content": "The 2008 and 2014 omnibus farm bills included provisions supporting local and regional food systems. The 2014 bill expanded on these provisions and addressed specific issues related to local food systems. Several bills introduced in Congress before the 2014 farm bill aimed to provide additional support for local and regional food systems. The 2014 farm bill incorporated provisions from previous bills supporting local and regional food systems. Funding and implementation determine the local impact of these programs, which are also supported by certain child nutrition programs and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children. Congress periodically reviews and reauthorizes these laws. The most recent reauthorization of child nutrition programs was the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010. The 114th Congress is expected to consider child nutrition reauthorization. The farm bill contains various farm assistance programs supporting local food systems across different titles. USDA administers programs in categories like marketing, business assistance, rural development, nutrition, and farmland conservation. Other legislation has addressed specific issues, including support for non-traditional programs. The curr_chunk discusses proposals for targeted support for non-traditional and beginning farmers, nutrition, and enhanced access to food. Funding for local and regional foods has increased to approximately $90 million annually. This includes grants and loans for various programs supporting specialty crops and organic agriculture. Annual funding for grants supporting local food systems totals $26.6 million, divided between two grant programs. The USDA provides funding for various programs supporting local and regional food systems, including grants for direct farmer-to-consumer marketing projects, intermediary supply chain activities, basic food access for low-income families, research on marketing U.S. agricultural products, Farm to School grants, and loans for local and regional food enterprises. USDA provides funding for local and regional food systems through various programs, including grants for marketing projects, Farm to School grants, and loans for food enterprises. In FY2013-FY2014, USDA made over 500 infrastructure investments to create new markets for local food, connecting farmers with new revenue sources and creating jobs. Since 2012, the Farm to School program has funded 221 projects, with schools spending over $385 million on local food. In 2011-2012, schools spent $385 million on local food purchases. Over 5,000 farmers' markets now accept EBT for SNAP benefits, with $18 million redeemed in 2014. Funding for local food systems is available through various USDA programs, but the share used specifically for local and regional food is unknown. Statutory requirements only limit support to local food production in a few cases. Funding for local food systems is available through various USDA programs, with most support not specifically targeted towards local or regional food systems. Programs cover marketing, business assistance, rural development, nutrition, education, and farmland conservation.

The Farmer-to-Consumer Direct Marketing Act of 1976 promotes direct marketing of agricultural commodities from farmers to consumers through various channels like farmers' markets, farm stands, and community-supported agriculture. The act authorized the Farmers' Market Promotion Program (FMPP) to assist small and medium-size farmers, including fruit and vegetable growers. The 2014 farm bill expanded the program to include local and regional food enterprises. The 2014 farm bill reauthorized and expanded the Farmers' Market Promotion Program to include local and regional food enterprises. It was renamed the Farmers' Market and Local Food Promotion Program, with two competitive grant programs available: FMPP and the Local Food Promotion Program (LFPP). Funding was increased to $30 million annually, with half allocated to each program. Other USDA-administered farmers' market programs focused on nutrition assistance are also highlighted.

The 2014 farm bill expanded funding for the Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development Program to $20 million per year, with additional funding available until FY2018. A new microloan program was created by USDA to better serve the financial needs of beginning farmers, including military veterans. The FSA found that small farm operations, including nontraditional farms, specialty crop producers, and community-supported agriculture operators, face unique needs and limited financing options. The microloan program simplifies the application process, adds flexibility for meeting loan eligibility and security requirements, and can be used for various farm expenses. The USDA offers microloans up to $35,000 for small farm operations, including improvements like wells and coolers, hoop houses, essential tools, irrigation, and delivery vehicles. The program has issued over 4,900 microloans totaling $97 million. Additionally, the 2014 farm bill authorized a similar program for USDA to contract with community-based entities to provide loans or related services. The USDA offers microloans up to $35,000 for small farm operations, while the Agricultural Management Assistance (AMA) program supports technological innovations for small businesses with fewer than 500 employees. Grant amounts are limited to $100,000 or $500,000 per project, with funding totaling more than $20 million in recent years. Eligible projects include implementing a CSA model to bring locally grown food to inner-city households and schools. The Agricultural Management Assistance (AMA) program, established in 2000 and managed by USDA agencies, provides financial and technical assistance to producers in underserved states for risk mitigation through diversification or conservation practices. The program receives $15 million annually from FY2008 to FY2014, allocated to NRCS (50%), RMA (40%), and AMS (10%). NRCS offers assistance for conservation practices, while RMA helps farmers mitigate financial risk. The RMA portion of the AMA program provides assistance to farmers for financial risk mitigation through production or marketing diversification, including support for direct marketing and value-added processing. The AMS portion supports the transition to organic farming through organic certification cost-share assistance. Total payments from all agencies cannot exceed $50,000 per participant per fiscal year.

Funding can cover financing, equipment, and marketing for facilities like food hubs or commercial kitchen incubators. USDA's Food and Nutrition Service administers programs like the WIC Farmers' Market Nutrition Program and the Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition Program, providing benefits redeemable at farmers' markets. The WIC Farmers' Market Nutrition Program (WIC-FMNP) was established in 1992 under the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). It provides fresh, locally grown produce to low-income WIC applicants and recipients through farmers' markets and roadside stands. Participating state agencies must submit a plan for program implementation and contribute funds equal to at least 30% of the administrative costs. The WIC Farmers' Market Nutrition Program (WIC-FMNP) provides fresh produce to low-income recipients through farmers' markets and roadside stands. In FY2013, the program covered 1.56 million recipients and generated $13.2 million in revenue for farmers. The SFMNP, authorized in the 2002 farm bill, offers grants to states to provide fruits and vegetables to low-income seniors. Total grant funding for WIC-FMNP ranged from $19 million to $23 million per year between FY2010 and FY2013. The Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition Program provides coupons for eligible foods at farmers' markets, roadside stands, and CSAs. Funding in FY2013 covered 836,000 participants and supported farmers and markets. The 2014 farm bill extended annual funding of $20.6 million through FY2018. SNAP benefits also support farmers markets, with over 5,000 now accepting EBT and SNAP. In March 2015, USDA reported that over 5,000 farmers' markets accept EBT and SNAP, with redemption totaling $18 million in 2014, up from $4 million in 2009. The 2014 farm bill provided for SNAP Bonus Incentive Projects and grants, allowing participants to exchange benefits for vouchers at farmers' markets. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 authorized USDA's Farm to School program with funding for increasing fruit and vegetable consumption among students, supporting local farmers, and providing nutrition education. Farmers' markets can now easily participate in bonus incentive programs without needing a waiver from FNS. The Farm to School program, administered by FNS, offers grants and technical assistance to schools, agencies, producers, and nonprofits to improve access to local foods. Grants can be used for various activities like training, equipment purchase, and nutrition education. Schools and communities can implement programs such as agriculture lessons, school gardens, farm tours, and parent educational sessions. The program aims for geographical diversity and equitable treatment of urban and rural areas. The USDA's Farm to School program offers grants with criteria for selection, including serving free and reduced-price meals, nutrition education, collaboration with community partners, and evaluating results. Grant amounts do not exceed $100,000 per recipient, with the federal share not exceeding 75% of the total project cost. The program provides about $6 million annually in funding for planning, implementation, support service, and training grants. The USDA's Farm to School program offers grants to support schools in purchasing local food and promoting healthy food education. Since 2012, the program has funded 221 projects in 49 states, the District of Columbia, and the Virgin Islands, with schools spending over $385 million on local food purchases. The 2008 farm bill authorized a pilot program for high-poverty schools to promote healthy food education and hands-on gardening in the curriculum. The 2008 farm bill authorized a pilot program for high-poverty schools to support local farmers, provide nutrition and agriculture education, and develop community gardens. USDA awarded a grant to Washington State University for this program in 2011. In 2011, USDA awarded a $1 million grant to Washington State University for the \"Healthy Gardens, Healthy Youth\" pilot project, serving 2,800 students in 70 elementary schools across four states. The project was part of the People's Garden School Pilot Program under the USDA People's Garden Initiative. Funding was authorized through the 2008 farm bill and extended through the 2010 reauthorization of child nutrition programs. In previous years, USDA has utilized funding for various activities, such as the People's Garden Grant Program in FY2011, providing $725,000 for projects in Alaska, Arizona, California, and other states. The program aims to create gardens in urban and rural areas for non-formal education. Funding for the \"Visitor Center/People's Garden\" is approximately $0.9 million annually. The 2008 farm bill amended child nutrition programs to allow schools to use per-meal cash reimbursements to buy food from local sources. USDA was required to encourage institutions to purchase locally grown agricultural products. Geographic preference is structured as a preference, not a requirement for procurement. USDA guidance suggests using geographic preference points to help local products win contracts despite potential cost barriers. Schools receive federal assistance, including USDA commodity foods and funds for fresh fruits and vegetables. A partnership with the Department of Defense helps procure and distribute fresh produce labeled as \"local\" for schools to choose from. The 2014 farm bill continued funding for this program and mandated a pilot project for USDA. The Department of Defense Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (DoD Fresh) was created by USDA to increase fresh produce offerings to schools. States can allocate a portion of their commodity entitlement funds for school meals towards procuring fresh produce through DoD Fresh. The program began as a pilot project in 1996 with eight states participating, delivering $3.2 million worth of produce to schools. The 2008 farm bill amended policies for USDA's purchase of fresh fruits and vegetables through DoD Fresh, allowing for a geographic preference and encouraging the procurement of locally grown and raised agricultural products. The program delivered produce valued at $3.2 million to schools in eight states, part of a larger $70 million delivery to schools in all 50 states. The 2014 farm bill established a pilot program for up to eight states to explore local procurement of unprocessed fruits and vegetables as an alternative to commodity purchases through DoD Fresh. USDA's website provides more information on the implementation of this provision. Prior to this, the Administration administered a Healthy Food Financing Initiative. The 2014 farm bill created a Healthy Food Financing Initiative (HFFI) at USDA to expand access to healthy foods in underserved communities. This initiative aims to improve access to healthy foods in low-income areas and enhance USDA authorities to support these efforts. The 2014 farm bill established the Healthy Food Financing Initiative (HFFI) at USDA to enhance access to healthy foods in underserved areas. The initiative provides loans and grants to fresh food retailers to overcome barriers in low-income communities. Up to $125 million is authorized for the initiative, with $13 million proposed in the FY2016 budget for supporting increased access to healthy foods. The Healthy Food Financing Initiative (HFFI) aims to provide financial and technical assistance for market planning, infrastructure improvements, and enhancing retail outlets for farm products. Congressional funding for HFFI is currently unavailable, and it is uncertain which USDA agency would oversee its activities. Coordination with the U.S. Treasury's Community Development Financial Institutions Fund is planned. The Community Food Projects Competitive Grants Program, administered by NIFA, supports projects addressing food needs of low-income communities and promoting self-reliance. The Community Food Projects Competitive Grants Program supports low-income communities by promoting self-reliance through various projects, such as urban agriculture and targeted markets. The program was reauthorized in the 2008 farm bill with $5 million in funding annually, and in the 2014 farm bill, funding was increased to $9 million annually. Grants are awarded for community food projects, planning projects, and training and technical assistance projects, all requiring a match in resources. The 2014 farm bill increased funding for the Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentive Grant Program to $9 million annually. The program supports projects that incentivize SNAP participants to buy fruits and vegetables, with a federal cost share limited to 50%. It includes three categories of projects with varying award amounts over one to four years. The 2014 farm bill provided $100 million in mandatory funding for the program. The 2014 farm bill allocated $100 million in mandatory funding for the Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentive Grant Program, with additional discretionary funding of $5 million per year. The program, administered by NIFA, aims to support local and regional food systems. Other resources, such as the New Markets Tax Credit, are available to encourage private investment in low-income communities with limited access to fresh foods. The Healthy Food Financing Initiative (HFFI) aims to increase access to healthy, fresh foods in low-income, underserved communities. It is part of a multi-agency Administration initiative and has not received funding from USDA despite being established by the 2014 farm bill. Other programs support local food systems and encourage private investment in areas with limited access to fresh foods. The USDA has not provided funding for the Healthy Food Financing Initiative (HFFI). Other federal agencies supporting local food producers include the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Commerce Department's Economic Development Administration, and the Small Business Administration. States are also active in direct marketing and farmers' market activities. USDA's Strategic Plan FY2010-2015 focuses on enhancing rural prosperity, supporting sustainable agriculture, and increasing access to nutritious food through initiatives like \"Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food\" and the People's Garden Initiative. The Obama Administration has implemented departmental initiatives to support local food systems, such as the Innovation Initiative, Healthy Food Financing Initiative, and People's Garden Initiative. These initiatives aim to leverage existing USDA activities by promoting collaboration among staff and eliminating organizational barriers. They are not stand-alone programs, do not have separate budgets, and coordinate USDA's support for local and regional food systems. The \"Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food\" (KYF2) initiative, launched by USDA in 2009, aims to develop local and regional food systems, promote economic opportunity, and support local farmers. It is a departmental initiative that leverages existing USDA programs to create links between local production and consumption. USDA's Regional Innovation Initiative aims to support local farmers, strengthen rural communities, promote healthy eating, and protect natural resources. Programs include marketing, rural business development, research, and farm-to-school activities. Funding has been announced for projects promoting local-scale sustainable operations. The USDA's \"Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food\" initiative spans various existing agency programs to provide assistance to eligible farming businesses. Resources include financial and technical assistance for local food enterprises and community-level projects. Each state must fund at least one project supporting the initiative. The USDA's \"Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food\" initiative requires each state to fund at least one project that supports the initiative. This notice applies to available funding for USDA's Community Facilities programs, including loans and grants for various projects such as food banks, school cafeterias, farmers' markets, community gardens, and community kitchens. Eligible projects include building purchases, renovations, equipment purchases, and infrastructure improvements. The \"Local Foods, Local Places\" (LFLP) initiative, launched in June 2014, provides support for integrating local food systems into community economic development plans. Supported by USDA and other federal agencies, LFLP aims to boost economic opportunities for local farmers and businesses, improve access to healthy local food, and support downtown and neighborhood revitalization in rural and urban areas. The \"Local Foods, Local Places\" initiative supports local food systems in community economic development plans by investing in small-town, urban, and rural partner communities. Projects include business incubators, food hubs, cooperative grocery stores, and nutrition education programs to revitalize downtowns and improve access to healthy local food. The \"Regional Innovation Initiative\" (RII) supports rural development through projects in 22 states with a reported $650,000 investment. It focuses on rural broadband, biofuels, linking local production and consumption, ecosystem markets, and forest restoration. The Administration's FY2012 budget proposal endorsed strategic leveraging of existing resources to strengthen rural communities through the initiative, but Congress provided no funding for it. The House-passed Agriculture appropriations report stated that the committee is unable to provide funding for the initiative due to unanswered questions about its purpose and plans. The Senate bill did not restrict the use of USDA funds to support the initiative. The Healthy Food Financing Initiative (HFFI) was launched in 2010 to increase access to healthy foods in underserved areas through grants and loans. Funding for HFFI has been included in various agencies' budgets, but Congress did not provide funding for it in FY2012. The HFFI programs are funded by the Treasury's CDFI Fund and HHS's CED program, providing grants for projects that support access to healthy food in underserved areas. The CED program has dedicated a portion to HFFI since FY2011, supporting projects like grocery stores and farmers' markets. The HFFI program provides funding for projects addressing healthy food access needs of low-income individuals and families through creating employment and business opportunities. Eligible uses include startup or expansion of businesses, capital expenditures, operating expenses, and loans. Eligible applicants are private, nonprofit organizations like CDCs, faith-based organizations, and tribal organizations. USDA's Rural Business Services support businesses through loan, grant, and technical assistance programs. The 2014 farm bill may change the administration of HFFI in future years. The HFFI program authorizes up to $125 million for USDA to support food retail projects that expand access to staple foods and accept SNAP benefits. The FY2015 budget requested funding for USDA and CDFI, but not for HHS. Congressional appropriators have not yet provided funding for HFFI. USDA announced plans for a People's Garden in 2009 and has since funded other projects. USDA has funded initiatives to establish community and school gardens nationwide. More than 1,600 gardens are recognized as People's Gardens, involving over 750 partnering organizations. In FY2010, USDA provided $1 million for the People's Garden School Pilot Program, administered by FNS and awarded to Washington State University to serve 2,800 students in multiple states. In FY2011, USDA provided $725,000 in grants for the People's Garden Grant Program, benefiting 2,800 students in 70 elementary schools across four states. The program aims to create produce, recreation, and wildlife gardens in urban and rural areas, promoting science-based non-formal education. Additionally, funding for the \"Visitor Center/People's Garden\" in FY2015 was reported at $0.9 million. Other USDA agencies, such as NRCS and FSA, also support People's Garden efforts and volunteerism."
