Since 1868, almost all Supreme Court nominations have been referred to the committee for consideration. The committee's evaluation of a nominee typically involves three stages: pre-hearing investigation, public hearings, and a committee decision on a recommendation. The Senate Judiciary Committee evaluates Supreme Court nominees through pre-hearing investigation, public hearings, and a committee decision on a recommendation. The committee conducts an intensive investigation into the nominee's background, including a detailed questionnaire about biographical and financial information. The Judiciary Committee aids nominees in preparing and submitting detailed questionnaires for review. Members may request additional information, and nominees can provide written responses to clarify or expand on their submissions. This information is made available to all committee members before confirmation hearings. A Supreme Court nominee's background investigation includes reviewing past professional activities, examining work product quality, and seeking access to confidential documents. The Judiciary Committee may request records of written work product from past federal executive branch service, which could be resisted by a President citing confidentiality concerns. The Judiciary Committee may face challenges in obtaining confidential documents from a Supreme Court nominee, who may invoke executive privilege or attorney-client privilege to withhold information. This can lead to a significant amount of time spent on justifying the disclosure of specific documents and potentially exerting leverage over the Administration. During the confirmation process for Justice Rehnquist's elevation to Chief Justice, the Judiciary Committee faced challenges obtaining documents he authored. President Reagan claimed executive privilege to protect confidentiality, but after threats of a subpoena, access to some documents was granted. Rehnquist and Scalia were eventually confirmed. During the pre-hearing stage of the confirmation process, the nominee visits Capitol Hill for \"courtesy calls\" with Senators to discuss important issues. Confidential FBI reports on the nominee are available to committee members and designated staff under strict security procedures. These meetings allow Senators to gain firsthand impressions of the nominee before voting on confirmation to the Court. The nominee is evaluated by the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary during the pre-hearing stage of the confirmation process. The evaluation focuses on professional qualifications and aims to ensure the most qualified individuals serve on the federal judiciary. The ABA committee rates nominees as \"well qualified,\" \"qualified,\" or \"not qualified,\" with the rating reported to the Senate Judiciary Committee members. The ABA committee evaluates nominees for the federal judiciary, providing ratings of \"well qualified,\" \"qualified,\" or \"not qualified.\" The rating is shared with the Senate Judiciary Committee, White House, Department of Justice, and nominee. A positive ABA rating often leads to a favorable report by the Judiciary Committee, while a divided vote or lower rating raises concerns for further examination during confirmation hearings. This process has been in place since the late 1940s, primarily assessing Supreme Court nominees. The ABA committee evaluates federal judiciary nominees with bipartisan support but faced criticism in the 1980s and 1990s. Despite this, it continues to appear before the Judiciary Committee regularly. The ABA committee chair was the first public witness at Supreme Court confirmation hearings in 2005, 2006, and 2009. At Supreme Court confirmation hearings, the American Bar Association traditionally testifies first on judicial nominees. However, in 2010, the ABA committee chair testified in a third panel. Before hearings, public debate on nominees' qualifications and the Court's future begins in the news media, online, and by advocacy groups. Before Supreme Court confirmation hearings, public debate on nominees' qualifications and the Court's future starts on internet sites and by advocacy groups. Senators may also contribute to this debate. Groups mobilize members to influence the President's choice of nominee. The pre-hearing phase is crucial for defining the nominee and galvanizing support or opposition. The analysis, published in July 2005, considered the impact of quickly defining a Supreme Court nominee to polarize the Senate along party lines. First impressions are crucial, as creating a positive image early on can help the nominee withstand later criticism. Conversely, painting the nominee as ideologically extreme from the start could be detrimental. The pre-hearing stage is essential for shaping public perception and garnering support or opposition. The pre-hearing stage for a Supreme Court nominee may not lead to immediate polarization in the Senate, as seen with past nominees like John G. Roberts Jr. and Sonia Sotomayor. Senate Democrats refrained from criticizing the nominees right away, showing caution and measured tones in their responses. Senate Republicans responded with restraint to the announcement of Sotomayor's nomination, contrasting with past court battles. Judiciary Committee members and staff study the nominee's record and prepare questions for the upcoming confirmation hearings. Nominees also intensively prepare for the hearings, focusing on legal and policy questions likely to be raised. The Administration assists Supreme Court nominees in preparing for confirmation hearings by providing legal background materials and conducting mock hearing practice sessions. Nominees are questioned on a range of legal and constitutional issues that Senators on the Judiciary Committee may raise. Public confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominations have been held since 1949, with nominees testifying in-person before the Senate Judiciary Committee since 1955. Confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominees have been held since 1949, with nominees testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee since 1955. The process includes opening statements by committee members, introductions by a panel of presenters, and questioning of the nominee by Senators in a specific order. Since 1949, Supreme Court nominees have undergone confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The process involves rounds of questioning with a time limit for each Senator. Out of 38 nominations, 34 received hearings, while four did not, including Merrick Garland in 2016. The Garland nomination is distinct from Mr. Harlan's in 1954 as hearings were held for Harlan, who was confirmed, while Garland's nomination was withdrawn. Figure 1 shows the days from nomination to first hearing for nominees since 1975, with Robert Bork waiting the longest (70 days) and John G. Roberts Jr. the shortest (6 days). Judge Roberts's nomination to be Chief Justice was to fill an immediate vacancy on the Court after Chief Justice Rehnquist's death in 2005. Initially nominated to replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, his nomination was withdrawn after Rehnquist's death, and he was instead nominated for the Chief Justice position. This delayed his confirmation hearings for the O'Connor vacancy by several days. Judge Roberts's nomination to be Chief Justice was delayed by several days after Chief Justice Rehnquist's death in 2005. The average wait time for nominees from nomination to first committee hearing is approximately 40 days, with Judge Roberts waiting 45 days in total. Confirmation hearings for Judge Brett Kavanaugh are set to begin on September 4, 2018, marking a 56-day wait from his nomination to the first committee hearing. The hearings serve various purposes for Judiciary Committee members, shedding light on the nominee's fitness and influencing their voting decisions. During confirmation hearings, Senators may already have a favorable predisposition towards the nominee but remain open to counter-evidence. Some Senators may have already decided how to vote and use questioning to secure or defeat the nomination. Senators may also be undecided, questioning the nominee's commitment to a judicial philosophy. The hearings are crucial in determining the nominee's support for the Senator's preferred ideology. The confirmation hearings provide Senators with an opportunity to influence nominees' approach to issues, advocate policy preferences, and draw public attention to certain problems. Nominees undergo rigorous questioning on legal qualifications, backgrounds, and social/political issues. Senators may play multiple roles in the hearings. During confirmation hearings, Senators question nominees on various topics such as Court rulings, constitutional controversies, values, and judicial philosophy. Nominees may be hesitant to answer certain questions to avoid making commitments on future issues. Nominees may refuse to answer certain questions during confirmation hearings to avoid making commitments on future issues and to maintain their chances for confirmation. Committee members may have differing opinions on the relevance of these refusals, with some seeing it as commendable and others viewing it as a reason to vote against confirmation. During confirmation hearings, nominees may face protracted questioning if they are controversial or perceived as evasive. The Judiciary Committee also hears testimony from public witnesses, including the ABA's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary chair. Additionally, professional colleagues and advocacy groups may provide testimony. In a closed-door session, the committee addresses any confidential background questions about the nominee. The Judiciary Committee holds closed-door sessions to address any confidential background questions about nominees, even when there are no major investigative issues. This procedure was announced in 1992 by Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. The first closed-door session was held for Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 1993, and similar sessions were held for nominees John G. Roberts Jr., Samuel A. Alito Jr., Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Neil Gorsuch in subsequent years. During the Judiciary Committee's confirmation hearings, an executive session is held to determine the recommendation to report to the full Senate. The committee can report the nomination favorably, negatively, or make no recommendation. This allows the nomination to proceed while signaling reservations from committee members. Since 1971, nominations reported favorably are indicated by blue dots, while other than favorably are marked with orange dots. The level of support among committee members ranges from unanimous to party-line opposition. The number of colored circles at the top of each column shows the number of nominees in each category. Out of 13 nominations reported favorably, 6 were reported with varying levels of support. The committee reported 13 nominations favorably, with 6 receiving unanimous support. Recent nominations did not receive unanimous support, with some facing opposition from committee members not belonging to the President's party. Alito and Gorsuch's nominations had complete party-line opposition. Two nominations were not reported favorably. The Judiciary Committee typically reports Supreme Court nominations even if opposed by a majority of its members, allowing the full Senate to decide on confirmation. This tradition was reaffirmed in 2001 by Senators Leahy and Hatch. The Judiciary Committee's tradition is to report Supreme Court nominees to the Senate even if opposed by a majority of its members, as reaffirmed in 2001 by Senators Leahy and Hatch. Senate confirmation has not always followed favorable committee recommendations, as seen in instances from 1968 to 1970. The Judiciary Committee traditionally reports Supreme Court nominations to the Senate, even if there is opposition. Unfavorable committee reports have sometimes led to significant opposition in the full Senate, but a few nominations have been confirmed by narrow margins. In recent decades, printed committee reports have been common, but the five most recent Supreme Court nominations were reported without printed reports. The chair of the Judiciary Committee is not obligated to transmit a printed report to the Senate and may file a one-page document instead. The Judiciary Committee may file a one-page document reporting a nomination to the Senate and recommending whether the nomination should be confirmed. A printed report may provide valuable information for Senators not on the committee, but it may not always be necessary for the Senate as a whole. Some Senators may feel they have enough information from other sources, and preparing a written report could cause delays in the confirmation process. Creating a written report on a nomination could cause delays in the confirmation process, especially if there is a need to fill a Court vacancy quickly."
