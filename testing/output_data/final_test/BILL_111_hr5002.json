    "content": "The \"No Sanctuary for Illegals Act\" aims to address the security threats posed by illegal immigration, including the entry of dangerous gang members and potential terrorists. The cost to taxpayers for supporting illegal aliens is substantial, and securing the borders is crucial in dealing with this issue. Congress acknowledges the urgent need to address the illegal immigration crisis and emphasizes the importance of border security. The Secretary of Homeland Security must increase incentives for recruiting and retaining border patrol agents, including offering repayment of higher education loans and establishing a retention program. The Secretary is authorized to deploy new technologies to secure US borders and prioritize the construction of border fencing, with a report due to Congress by December 31, 2010 on progress and completion dates. SEC. 5. Mandated collaboration to end sanctuary of illegal aliens requires State and local law enforcement agencies to notify ICE immediately of any arrest of an unlawfully present alien. SEC. 6. Expedited removal and criminal penalties for criminal aliens. Upon notification of arrest of an unlawfully present alien, ICE will detain and present them before an immigration judge. The alien will be added to a watch list and immediately removed from the United States without further review. Additionally, the alien will be permanently ineligible for admission to the United States. The amendment to the Immigration and Nationality Act states that an alien unlawfully present in the United States will face permanent ineligibility for admission and potential criminal penalties, including imprisonment for up to 5 years and fines. SEC. 7. CITIZENSHIP AT BIRTH FOR CERTAIN PERSONS BORN IN THE UNITED STATES. SEC. 7 amends Section 301 of the Immigration and Nationality Act to define birthright citizenship for individuals born in the United States. It acknowledges the right established by the 14th Amendment and specifies criteria for being considered 'subject to the jurisdiction' of the United States. The amendment exempts aliens serving in the Armed Forces from changes to citizenship status for individuals born before the enactment of the Act. SEC. 8 prohibits the distribution of Federal funds to States or political subdivisions that interfere with enforcing Federal immigration laws. Funding can resume if the State or subdivision agrees to stop the interference."
