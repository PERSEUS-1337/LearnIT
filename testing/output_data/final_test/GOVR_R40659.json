    "content": "The President submits a federal budget proposal to Congress annually by the first Monday in February. The Congressional Budget Office analyzes the proposal, and the House and Senate Budget Committees develop their own resolutions. Differences between the two versions are reconciled by April 15. The budget resolution serves as a framework for legislative action, with a focus on Medicaid and CHIP. Contact information for CRS staff is provided in the report. In January 2009, policymakers were concerned about the economic slowdown, bankruptcy in various industries, and rising unemployment. These conditions influenced the President's FY2010 budget proposal and led to emergency legislation, including the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act. Contact information for CRS staff by topic area is provided in Table 2. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) and the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (CHIPRA) were passed in early 2009. ARRA provided $89.3 billion in additional federal Medicaid funding over five years, including enhanced FMAP percentages and expanded coverage. CHIPRA reauthorized the CHIP program through FY2013 with $44 billion in additional funds for states. The FY2010 Medicaid and CHIP budget proposals aimed to reduce expenditures rather than increase spending. The Obama Administration aims to reduce Medicaid and CHIP expenditures to fund a Health Reform Reserve Fund. Cost savings could help states maintain Medicaid coverage during the financial crisis. Some budget initiatives may not be necessary due to the passage of ARRA and CHIPRA. CBO and executive branch agencies provide baseline analyses of the President's budget. The HHS and OMB provide estimates of Medicaid and CHIP spending, but CBO and the executive branch differ in their treatment of proposals. CBO assesses likelihood of administrative actions before adjusting baseline, leading to differences in estimates. Prescription drug manufacturers must give states rebates on Medicaid drugs. Drug manufacturers are required to provide rebates to states for outpatient drugs purchased for Medicaid beneficiaries. These agreements guarantee Medicaid the best price and require manufacturers to offer their entire product line to Medicaid programs. Manufacturers must pay a 15.1% rebate on brand name products to each state, based on the average manufacturer price. Rebates vary by state. The proposal aims to increase the fixed rebate paid by prescription drug manufacturers from 15.1% to 22.1% of the average manufacturer price (AMP) for brand-name drugs in Medicaid. This change is estimated to reduce federal expenditures by $250 million in FY2010 and $2.1 billion over the period FY2010 to FY2014. Medicaid programs offer services through various delivery options, including fee-for-service, managed care, and hybrid models combining elements of both. Under full risk contracts, managed care organizations (MCOs) take financial responsibility for Medicaid beneficiaries' medical needs in exchange for a fixed payment. Medicaid programs increasingly use MCO contracts, especially for children and nondisabled adults. Prescription drug manufacturers must pay states discounts on brand and generic drugs sold to Medicaid. Under Medicaid law, prescription drug manufacturers are exempt from paying discounts on outpatient drugs delivered by MCOs and Part D. The loss of discounts has become significant with Medicaid's increasing use of managed care. States often exclude prescription drugs from full risk contracts to maximize Medicaid rebates. This proposal would allow states to collect rebates from drug manufacturers. This proposal authorizes states to collect rebates from drug manufacturers on outpatient drugs purchased for Medicaid beneficiaries under Medicaid MCO and other health plan contracts. The rebate structure for managed care contracts would mirror Medicaid's FFS process. HHS estimates a reduction in federal expenditures by $770 million in FY2010 and $3.8 billion over FY2010-2014. Drug manufacturers participating in Medicaid must report average manufacturer price (AMP) and best price to CMS for rebate calculations. They pay basic and additional rebates on single-source brand name drugs, with the additional rebate triggered when AMP exceeds the original Medicaid base price. This additional rebate helps offset rapid price increases by manufacturers. Proposal: The proposal aims to classify extended-release versions of existing products as the original product for calculating the additional Medicaid drug rebate. This would prevent manufacturers from increasing prices on new base prices and avoiding paying the additional rebate owed on the original version of the drug. The proposal aims to classify extended-release versions of existing products as the original product for calculating the additional Medicaid drug rebate, reducing the ability of manufacturers to avoid paying rebates. This would result in significant savings for federal Medicaid expenditures. Unlike Medicaid, the Medicare program is national and administered by CMS through contractors, primarily health insurance companies, for processing Part B Medicare claims. Under Medicare's Correct Coding Initiative (CCI) implemented in 1996, CMS' contractors review Part B health care providers' claims before payment using automated edits. These edits scan claims for inconsistencies that could render them invalid for reimbursement. Claims must follow standard formats and contain numeric codes classifying the patient's condition and services provided. The Healthcare Common Procedure Codes (HCPCS) system is used for this classification. CCI edits focus on identifying coding inconsistencies, such as duplicate services on the same date or erroneous billing of individual services. The proposal mandates that Medicaid participate in a national Correct Coding Initiative (CCI) similar to Medicare's. HHS estimates a CCI would reduce Medicaid expenditures by $10 million in FY2010 and by $175 million from FY2010 to FY2014. Medicaid paid for 40% of U.S. births in 2003, covering prenatal, delivery, and postpartum care for 1.5 million children and families. No other CRS reports currently address this topic. Medicaid covers prenatal, delivery, and postpartum care for 1.5 million children and families. Studies show high unplanned pregnancy rates, especially among low-income women. Family planning services are mandatory for women up to 133% of poverty, with some states extending coverage up to 200% of poverty. Medicaid eligibility for pregnant women varies by income level, with federal funding based on the FMAP rates. Medicaid services are matched for all states at higher rates, with a 90% FMAP rate for family planning services. The proposal aims to require states to cover family planning services for non-pregnant women aged 15-44 with family incomes not exceeding 200% of poverty. The rationale is to reduce unplanned pregnancies and Medicaid expenditures. CBO estimated 2.4 million women would be covered in 2014. The proposal would have no effect on federal expenditures in FY2010 but decrease them by $5 million from FY2010 to FY2014. Background: Biologics are drugs or vaccines made from living organisms, with spending exceeding $40 billion in 2007. About 75% of spending was on brand-name products losing patent protection. Generic non-biologic products are covered under the FDA's abbreviated regulatory process for approval. The FDA has authority to approve generic drug products that are chemically the same as brand-name products. However, for biologic products, there is no abbreviated regulatory authority for follow-on versions, leading to little competitive pressure on brand name biologic drug companies to reduce prices even after patents expire. It is illegal and cost prohibitive for generic drugmakers to fully replicate safety and efficacy research and manufacturing processes for biologic products to introduce biosimilar products. The proposal aims to establish an abbreviated regulatory pathway for biosimilars, similar to the FDA's authority for generic chemical drugs. This process would allow the approval of follow-on biologic products based on data submitted for the original single-source biologic. The goal is to encourage competition from multiple manufacturers, leading to lower prices and reduced prescription drug spending for Medicaid and other payers. The Medicaid Improvement Fund established under Sec. 7002 of the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2008 would not impact federal Medicaid expenditures in FY2010 but would decrease federal outlays by $10 million from FY2010 to FY2014. The fund was created to enhance the management of the Medicaid program, including oversight of contracts and evaluation of demonstration projects, with $100 million available in FY2014 and $150 million in FYs 2015-2018. The Medicaid Improvement Fund, established under the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2008, redirected funds from the Physician Assistance and Quality Initiative. The proposal aims to eliminate the MIF and allocate savings to support the President's health care reform initiative. Medicaid is generally available to specific groups, excluding childless adults and couples. Medicaid eligibility historically divided into \"categorically needy\" and \"medically needy\" classes, but distinctions have become less meaningful over time. Some benefits are mandatory for categorically needy individuals. Some states cover mandatory benefits for categorically needy individuals, while optional benefits are available for both groups. Home visitation services are not required under Medicaid law but could potentially be covered by states. Many states may not routinely cover home visitation services unless a need is demonstrated. Providers may demonstrate a need for home visitation services under Medicaid, which could be considered as part of Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) requirements. While home health services are mandatory for certain individuals, states are not required to cover them for medically needy individuals. The President's FY2010 Budget proposes a mandatory new program to fund evidence-based home visitation programs for low-income families, focusing on child health, development, school readiness, maltreatment prevention, and parenting support. Administered by the Administration for Children and Families, this initiative aims to enhance children's cognitive, language, social-emotional, and physical development. The Obama Administration's home health visitation program aims to reduce Medicaid and CHIP expenditures by providing preventive and early treatment for low-income children. It is estimated to save $1 million in FY2010 and $81 million over FY2010 to FY2014. The interaction with Medicaid would reduce federal expenditures by $77 million over five years, with the remaining $4 million reduction from CHIP. No other CRS reports address this topic. For more information on CHIP, refer to background information on Medicaid. The House and Senate considered the FY2010 federal budget in March 2009, adopting their respective budget resolutions on April 2, 2009. The Senate and House agreed to a Conference Agreement Report on April 29, 2009. The budget resolution establishes spending and revenue targets for discretionary spending. See CRS Report R40444 for more information on the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). The budget resolution for FY2010 establishes spending and revenue targets for discretionary spending, creating a framework for developing appropriations bills. The Senate and House passed their respective budget resolutions in April 2009, with provisions that could impact Medicaid and CHIP. The House and Senate passed a budget resolution for FY2010 with provisions affecting Medicaid and CHIP. The Conference Agreement Report included reconciliation instructions to reduce the federal budget deficit for specific committees. The House and Senate passed a budget resolution for FY2010 with provisions affecting Medicaid and CHIP. Committees were required to reduce the federal budget deficit by $1 billion for programs under their jurisdictions. The resolution included Senate and House Budget Neutral Reserve Funds, with provisions to transform and modernize America's health care system and improve the well-being of children. Budget enforcement rules in the Senate can be applied if legislation increases the budget deficit by more than $10 billion in any fiscal year covered by the concurrent budget resolution. The Medicaid and CHIP programs are not controlled through the annual appropriations process. Medicaid's spending is determined by benefit and eligibility criteria in law, while CHIP's federal spending is capped. The Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP Extension Act of 2007 provided funding for CHIP through March 31, 2009. With the passage of the Children's Health Insurance Reauthorization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA, P.L. 111-3), CHIP funding was extended through FY2013. Congress can influence Medicaid and CHIP spending through the appropriations process by restricting funds for specific activities, such as limitations on federal funds for abortions in the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill."
