    "content": "Since 1971, there has been disagreement over the use of the user-supported airport and airway trust fund's revenues. The disagreement revolves around whether the fund should primarily support infrastructure or also fund FAA operations and maintenance. This led to legislative mechanisms being enacted in 1976 to ensure that federal capital spending for U.S. airports and airways would be fully funded. Some supporters hoped for provisions to guarantee funding for the FAA's operating budget, a topic present in FAA reauthorization debates since 1976. The report discusses the establishment of the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, the conflict over its revenue use, and Congress's efforts to ensure full funding for FAA capital programs while also supporting operations. The report examines current spending guarantees for the FAA following the passage of AIR21 and Vision 100. It discusses various spending guarantee options for the upcoming FAA reauthorization debate, assuming the spending levels and program structure of the times. The FAA budget is divided into four categories, with two considered \"capital\" accounts. The FAA budget is divided into four categories, with two considered \"capital\" accounts - AIP and F&E. AIP funds airport development projects while F&E pays for air traffic control system modernization. Noncapital categories include RE&D for research and O&M for employee salaries and maintenance. The issue of funding FAA programs predates the aviation trust fund's creation in 1971. The creation of the aviation trust fund in 1971 by the Airport and Airway Development and Revenue Acts shifted FAA funding from the U.S. Treasury's general fund to dedicated tax revenues from aviation users. Conflicts arose over whether the trust fund should be a capital-only funding source or a full user-pay mechanism for all FAA funding. Studies by the CBO and GAO confirmed the intent for the trust fund to finance airport and airway projects. The 1970 Act established the aviation trust fund to finance airport and airway capital needs, with remaining funds used for air traffic control operations. The debate over the general fund share of the FAA budget has been contentious, with aviation user groups advocating for a larger share than government agencies and committees. The Nixon Administration's FAA budget requests for FY1971 and FY1972 under the new trust fund system led to conflict with Congress over budgetary treatment. The Administration viewed the trust fund as a user-pay system to fund the FAA budget, while many in Congress saw it as primarily a user-supported capital fund. Controversy arose over proposed funding amounts for airport and airway facilities, with the budget falling below authorized levels. The FY1972 budget proposed using the trust fund balance for FAA administration costs, leading to concerns in Congress about prioritizing operations over capital spending. The 1970 Act and unified budget concept influenced the budget treatment of trust fund revenues, impacting overall deficit or surplus totals. The inclusion of the aviation trust fund in the unified budget has historically affected trust fund spending levels. Excess revenues over expenditures can offset federal deficits, but the balance may also be used for non-aviation purposes. The balance, invested in Treasury notes, allows the government to free up funds for other budget areas without increasing the overall deficit. The aviation trust fund's unexpended balance, often mistaken for a surplus, has raised concerns about diverting funds from aviation programs. This has led to opposition from the aviation community and transportation committees, prompting efforts to ensure full funding for FAA's capital budgets. The Nixon Administration agreed to increase airport grants for FY1972 but Congress passed an amendment in 1971 banning the spending of trust fund money on FAA operations, narrowing the allowable use of trust fund revenues. The 1971 Amendment significantly narrowed the allowable use of trust fund revenues, making it a capital-only account temporarily. This change eliminated the user-pay component and left the FAA more exposed to fiscal pressures by depending on general fund revenues for noncapital components of its budget. Trust fund-appropriated share of operations was zero during FY1973-FY1976, with the general fund covering a majority of FAA appropriations during those years. The FAA appropriations for FY1973-FY1976 ranged from 56% to 83%, with an uncommitted end-of-year balance of $1.688 billion by the end of FY1976. Despite Congress acknowledging that aviation taxes were meant to fund both capital projects and operations costs, concerns remained about the Executive branch depleting the trust fund for FAA operations. The 1976 Act included \"cap and penalty\" provisions to address these concerns. The 1976 Act included \"cap and penalty\" provisions to prevent misuse of funds by the FAA. It placed caps on trust fund spending for air navigation services for FY1977-FY1980, with penalties for failure to fund airport grants at authorized levels. The caps would be reduced proportionally based on the Airport Development Aid Program obligation limitation. The 1976 Act introduced \"cap and penalty\" provisions to control FAA spending. It included penalties for not fully obligating F&E funding up to the appropriated level in FY1980 and FY1981. Despite a $17 million shortfall in FY1980, no penalty was imposed due to excess F&E appropriations. The cap and penalty system had a significant impact on FAA funding from the general fund. The 1976 Act removed the ban on O&M spending from trust fund resources, lowering the general fund share of the FAA budget. Despite efforts to limit trust fund spending on operations and maintenance, uncommitted aviation trust fund balances continued to grow, reaching roughly $3.8 billion by September 30, 1980. Disputes arose over what to do with the excess trust fund revenue. The legislative deadlock over the aviation trust fund balance and disagreements on trust fund revenues and taxes led to the lapsing of the fund's authorization in 1980. The uncommitted balance fell to $2 billion by the end of FY1982. The 1982 Act reauthorized the trust fund operation until 1987 and modified the spending provisions. The 1982 Act set dollar amounts to cap operations and maintenance spending from the trust fund. It established caps based on funds available for AIP times a multiplier for FY1982 and later years. However, Section 426 (c) of the STAA of 1982 later reduced the caps for FY1983-FY1985. The amended Act retained the $800 million cap for FY1982 but lowered the cap ratio for FY1983-FY1985. The ratios for FY1986 and FY1987 remained the same. Using ratios made the cap flexible, allowing more money for O&M as more funds were obligated for AIP. The penalty provision for airport grants under the 1982 Act was changed to focus on funds available for F&E. The penalty provision aimed to reduce O&M funds by twice the amount of authorizations exceeding appropriations for F&E. This change was made to incentivize higher spending on AIP and accommodate the increase in F&E authorizations influenced by the proposed NAS plan. The 1982 Act introduced a cap on spending for AIP to incentivize higher spending, while penalty provisions protected F&E funding. O&M spending was restricted to direct costs, with penalties imposed when AIP and F&E funding fell below authorizations. Despite penalties, O&M appropriations from the trust fund totaled $2.7 billion over FY1983-FY1987. The trust fund's uncommitted balance increased significantly from $1.992 billion in FY1983 to $5.559 billion in FY1987, with a surge in high penalty years. The cap and penalty provisions led to disagreements between committees regarding the fund's growth and the high general fund share. The cap and penalty provisions caused disagreements between authorizing and appropriating committees over spending restrictions on the aviation trust fund. Despite aiming to support AIP and F&E, the provisions did not result in full appropriation of authorized funding levels, leading to a shift in accounting for aviation spending. The 1987 Act extended excise taxes and reauthorized FAA programs for three years, leading to a rise in the uncommitted balance of the trust fund to $5.559 billion by the end of FY1987. This forced the general fund to finance more aviation spending, with each dollar exceeding tax revenues needing general revenue funding or producing a trust fund surplus for non-aviation expenditures. The 1987 Act extended excise taxes and reauthorized FAA programs for three years, substantially increasing authorizations for AIP and F&E. Air traffic surge increased pressure on airport capacity. NAS plan implementation delays were attributed to technological reasons and trust fund constraints. Changes were made to \"cap and penalty\" provisions on O&M spending. New provision amended the cap to 50% of total annual appropriations for AIP, F&E, and RE&D. Annual caps would be reduced by twice the amount of any shortfall between AIP obligation limitation and total appropriations. The 1987 Act amended the cap on O&M spending to 50% of total annual appropriations for AIP, F&E, and RE&D. Caps would be reduced by twice the amount of any shortfall between AIP obligation limitation and total appropriations, with additional penalties for discrepancies. The 1987 Act amended the cap on O&M spending to 50% of total annual appropriations for AIP, F&E, and RE&D. Despite reductions not equaling full penalties, the trust fund remained nearly $2.3 billion below the caps, with the general fund share exceeding 40%. In FY1989, penalties may have affected the general fund share, as the uncommitted balance in the trust fund rose significantly. Additionally, the 1987 Act included a provision triggering a reduction in aviation tax rates for FY1988-FY1989. The 1987 Act included a provision for FY1988-FY1989 that would reduce aviation tax rates if certain funding thresholds were not met. The tax penalty aimed to discourage cutting spending on capital improvements for non-aviation purposes. However, the trigger was never implemented due to reluctance and pressure to reduce the federal budget deficit. The House Ways and Means Committee proposed delaying the trigger mechanism for one year to save money, despite opposition from supporters of the trigger mechanism. The trigger date was extended to January 1, 1991 in the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1989. The uncommitted balance grew to $7.446 billion by the end of FY1990. As the 1990 FAA reauthorization approached, concerns were raised by appropriators and budgeteers. As the 1990 FAA reauthorization approached, concerns were raised about the \"penalty clause\" in Section 506 (c) of the 1982 Act, which led to general fund overpayments for FAA expenses. The Congressional Budget Office testified that the current surplus in the aviation trust fund is misleading, as private-sector users have actually received more in services than they have paid in taxes. The Airport and Airway Trust Fund is impacted by laws restricting trust fund financing for FAA operations. The Airport and Airway Trust Fund is affected by laws limiting trust fund financing for FAA operations. Appropriations for capital and research expenditures influence the level of funding, with a focus on aligning them with authorized levels to increase trust fund financing. Technical issues in airway system modernization have caused a discrepancy between authorized capital expenditures and actual appropriations, leading to a low proportion of FAA spending debited to the trust fund and an increase in its surplus. OBRA-90 authorized FAA programs through FY1992, with tax increases aimed at reducing the federal budget deficit. The OBRA-90 bill included provisions for increasing aviation taxes to contribute to federal budget deficit reduction. It also allowed airports to levy a passenger facility charge (PFC) on enplaning passengers, with the rationale that PFCs would reduce the need for funding from the Airport Improvement Program (AIP). Section 9107 of OBRA-90 changed the cap on funding to 75% of the total amounts available for various aviation programs. The penalty provision and tax trigger rate reduction mechanism were eliminated as part of an agreement between authorizing and appropriating committees for full funding of AIP in FY1991-FY1992. Under the OBRA-90 mechanism, trust fund spending for O&M was capped at 75% of total amounts available. The general fund share of FAA appropriations was 25% for FY1991-FY1993, with the uncommitted balance decreasing to $4.268 billion in FY1993. The 1994 Act reauthorized funding for FAA programs and the aviation trust fund through FY1996. The 1994 Act altered the operations spending cap for FAA funding, allowing for a reduction in the unexpended balance in the trust fund. Despite opposition, Congress was able to fund the FAA at a level that exceeded the statutory caps for FY1994-FY1996. President Clinton vetoed the budget reconciliation act of 1996, which included reauthorization of aviation taxes. The budget reconciliation act of 1996 was vetoed by President Clinton due to other provisions. The authority to collect taxes for the aviation trust fund expired on January 1, 1996, leading to a lapse in funding until August 27, 1996. The fund did not receive an estimated $4 billion during the first lapse and $1 billion during the second. The uncommitted balance of the trust fund decreased significantly, from $5.127 billion in FY1995 to $1.354 billion in FY1997. The 1996 Act reauthorized FAA operations, AIP, and F&E until September 30, 1998, and RE&D until September 30, 1997. It did not reauthorize the taxes supporting the trust fund. The spending cap was moved to 72.5% of total amounts available to the FAA. The uncommitted balance of the trust fund rebounded from $1.345 billion to $4.339 billion by the end of FY1995. Following the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, the uncommitted balance of the trust fund increased to $4.339 billion by the end of FY1998. The success of cap and penalty provisions had mixed results with unintended consequences, making it challenging to separate their impact from other influences. Adherence to fully implementing penalties was influenced by delays in FAA's NAS implementation. Attempts to reduce the budget deficit in the mid-1990s affected the budgetary treatment of trust fund revenues. The budget deficit impacted trust fund revenues, with penalties affecting FAA spending. The first Cap and Penalty regime successfully funded AIP and F&E near authorized levels. Critics noted trust fund money not being fully spent. Adherence to penalty provisions varied in the 1980s. In the 1990s, the elimination of penalties led to underfunded capital programs and trust fund exceeding caps. Budget deficit impacted AIP and F&E funding, with broader budget environment influencing spending mechanisms. The cap and penalty mechanisms aimed to restrict spending from the aviation trust fund but did not always ensure full appropriation of authorized AIP and F&E funding levels. This led to the growth of the trust fund's uncommitted balance and forced the general fund to finance more aviation expenditures. There is still an incentive to limit capital spending for aviation programs due to the need for general revenues to fund expenses exceeding excise tax revenue. The cap and penalty provisions aimed to restrict aviation trust fund spending, but did not always ensure full appropriation of authorized AIP and F&E funding levels. This led to a surplus in the trust fund, forcing the general fund to finance more aviation expenditures. Despite the intent to limit spending, the tax reduction trigger proved somewhat ineffective. The Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (P.L. 106-181; AIR-21) aimed to address issues with FAA capital budget accounts, trust fund revenues, and general fund share for operations. The legislation sought to ensure full funding of capital budget accounts, prevent accumulation of large trust fund balances, and maintain a significant general fund contribution. The AIR-21 legislation aimed to ensure full funding of capital budget accounts, prevent large trust fund balances, and maintain a significant general fund contribution for aviation purposes. Funding guarantees were enforced by points-of-order in Vision-100, making it out-of-order to consider legislation that does not use all aviation trust fund receipts annually. The \"capital priority provision\" also made it out-of-order to consider any bill providing a general fund appropriation for RE&D or O&M if certain funding criteria were not met. The AIP obligation limitation and F&E appropriation are below authorized levels. Failure to fully fund F&E results in increased AIP appropriation. FY2001-FY2003 saw F&E and AIP funded near authorized levels with small shortfalls. FY2003 showed guarantees were working or being acquiesced to. The general fund share of total FAA appropriations varied from 17% for FY2001, 8% for FY2002, and 24% for FY2003. Under Vision-100, AIP was nearly fully funded for FY2004-FY2007, with slight shortfalls in authorized funding. However, F&E appropriations fell below authorization during the same period. The current spending guarantees for F&E can be overridden by broader budget policy goals or spending priorities. AIP's funding success is attributed more to its popularity in Congress and nationwide than the guarantees. F&E spending benefits localities nationwide but does not receive the same attention as AIP grants. The aviation trust fund's uncommitted balance decreased significantly under AIR21 and Vision-100. The aviation trust fund's balance declined from $7.3 billion to $1.9 billion for FY2005 due to overestimates of revenues. Actual revenues were lower than forecast in multiple years, leading to a drawdown of balances. Concerns about revenue may arise during reauthorization debates in Congress. The aviation trust fund's balance declined from $7.3 billion to $1.9 billion for FY2005 due to overestimates of revenues. Concerns about revenue may arise during reauthorization debates in Congress. In the House, recent annual appropriations bills have had all points-of-order waived by the Rules Committee. Senators have chosen not to raise points-of-order against violations of the AIP and F&E funding guarantees. Points-of-order have not been allowed on appropriations bill conference reports. Congress has been rescinding the \"pop-up\" AIP budget authorities in recent years, impacting the future of FAA spending. The uncommitted balance in the aviation trust fund decreased from $7.674 billion in FY2000 to a projected $1.356 billion in FY2008. Commitments have exceeded trust fund income, potentially leading to a decrease in AIP and F&E spending. The authorization of FAA programs and taxes under Vision 100 expired in 2007, with short-term extensions in place. If taxes supporting the fund expire, the uncommitted balance could turn negative quickly. The Vision 100 authorization of FAA's programs ended in FY2007. Short-term extensions have allowed programs to continue. Reauthorization proposals are in the Senate, House, and FAA. The Senate bill (S. 1300) extends spending guarantees through FY2011. The House bill (H.R. 2881) changes the spending guarantee mechanism. H.R. 2881 would guarantee 95% of estimated receipts plus interest for FY2008-FY2009, and FY2010-FY2011. The bill proposes changes to the spending guarantee mechanism for FY2010 and FY2011, ensuring 95% of estimated receipts plus interest. This change aims to prevent overspending based on optimistic revenue projections and allow for a modest accumulation in the trust fund balance. The analysis of spending guarantees in the report assumes existing programmatic structure and funding levels. Advocates see fully authorized funding and general fund share as positive, while critics believe too much is spent on FAA programs, particularly AIP and F&E, leading to inefficiency and questionable federal purpose. Critics question the federal purpose of AIP resources going to small local airports and view F&E spending as wasteful. Some suggest downsizing FAA programs to fund the entire budget from the trust fund. FAA reauthorization bills may include language to ensure full funding of capital programs like AIP and F&E. The bill emphasizes the importance of fully funding AIP and F&E to shore up support for authorization legislation. Extending current guarantees could maintain a political advantage during reauthorization debates, with potential resistance to major modifications. Various options may arise during the debate, but past history suggests opposition from appropriations and budget committees, as well as DOT and the Office of Management and Budget. The authorizing and appropriating committees have different perspectives on funding FAA programs. Authorizers support full spending levels for AIP and F&E, while appropriators consider overall budget pressures. This conflict often results in appropriations being less than authorizations. Resolving this disagreement would require an agreement on trust fund spending between the committees. In 1990, a treaty was negotiated between transportation committees to fully fund AIP and eliminate penalty provisions. The treaty was in effect for two years but could be terminated by any participant. Reimposing penalty provisions from the 1970s or 1980s may be considered during reauthorization. The cap and penalty mechanism was most effective when first authorized in 1976. The cap and penalty provisions, initially effective in 1976, have had mixed success over time. They have led to unintended consequences such as growing trust fund balances and a higher general fund share of the FAA budget. Appropriators often absorbed the penalty, allowing the trust fund balance to increase and using it for other expenses. This history suggests that the cap and penalty may not ensure full funding for FAA capital programs like AIP and F&E. The historical cap and penalty provisions may not align with the current law on the \"Airport and Airway Trust Fund Guarantee,\" which aims to ensure that trust fund spending matches estimated receipts each year. Proposals to take the aviation trust fund \"off-budget\" have been suggested to ensure tax revenues are used for aviation purposes without budget constraints. Proponents argue that separating trust fund revenues from the federal budget deficit would prevent masking of the deficit. However, opponents believe trust fund revenues should not be isolated from national needs. Concerns have been raised about the trust fund potentially going into deficit as uncommitted balances decrease. The trust fund alone cannot cover all FAA needs, leading to competition for funding among different aviation activities. One alternative to removing the aviation trust fund off-budget is to amend the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 to create a discretionary spending guarantee for the FAA's spending. This would involve creating a separate budget category for aviation with annual spending caps, preventing the use of funds to offset spending increases elsewhere in the budget. This approach would ensure that trust fund revenues are still part of the congressional budget while discouraging reductions in FAA capital program spending. One option to ensure full funding for FAA programs is to amend the budget act to set annual funding guarantees, reducing appropriations committees' influence on spending. This would require approval from the House and Senate budget committees and could face resistance from appropriators. The funding of the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) has recently changed, with formula programs now funded entirely from the trust fund and the New Starts capital program funded from the general fund. A similar change for the FAA would involve funding all programs, except the AIP program, with trust fund revenues. This shift may require cutting parts of the budget with strong congressional support. The FAA budget may need to be funded with trust fund revenues, leaving the AIP program more vulnerable to budget cuts if deficit reduction or other priorities arise."
