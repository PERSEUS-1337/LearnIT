    "content": "In 1918, Congress enacted the Vocational Rehabilitation Act to retrain disabled military personnel. The program was initially administered by the Federal Board for Vocational Education and later transferred to the Veterans' Bureau in 1921. In 1930, the Veterans Administration was created by combining three bureaus. In 1943, eligibility was broadened for veterans to receive up to four years of training. Over the years, the program has been modified and expanded to better fulfill its mission. The Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E) program, housed within the Department of Veterans Affairs, underwent name changes over the years. In response to criticisms, a task force recommended focusing on employment services and clients' skills rather than disabilities. The program is authorized by Chapter 31 of Title 38 of the U.S. Code. The VR&E program, authorized by Chapter 31 of Title 38, is administered by the Veterans Benefits Administration. VR&E costs are divided between mandatory and discretionary spending, with total costs in FY2016 amounting to $1.315 billion. This includes $741 million for direct assistance and $573 million for subsistence allowances. In FY2016, the VR&E program's discretionary costs were $218 million, employing 1,538 full-time equivalents. Eligibility for VR&E services requires serving after September 16, 1940, receiving a discharge under conditions other than dishonorable, and having a service-connected disability rating of 10% or more. Active duty servicemembers are eligible if their disabilities are expected to be rated at least 20% post-discharge. Veterans can access VR&E services for 12 years after separation. Veterans are eligible for VR&E services for 12 years following discharge, or 12 years from the date of notification of a service-connected disability rating. Eligibility may be extended if the veteran has a serious employment handicap, is not yet employable, cannot perform required duties, or if occupational requirements have changed. An objective evaluation is needed for determination. For independent living services, eligibility may be extended if the medical condition prevents achieving vocational goals necessary for maximum independence. An applicant for VR&E services completes a comprehensive evaluation with a Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor to assess interests, abilities, and employment potential. Eligibility is based on having a service-connected disability rated at 20% or more with an employment handicap, or a 10% disability with a serious employment handicap. An employment handicap impairs the ability to secure suitable employment, while a serious employment handicap significantly hinders employment preparation. A serious employment handicap for a veteran is a significant impairment in their ability to work according to their abilities, aptitudes, and interests. To be eligible for VR&E services, the veteran's service-connected disability must contribute to the employment handicap. If found eligible, a case manager and Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor work with the veteran to set employment goals and develop a rehabilitation plan. The VR&E program provides a range of services to help veterans with disabilities achieve their employment goals. Services include funding for education, career counseling, and job search assistance. Veterans are assigned to a service delivery track based on their needs, with the option to change tracks if necessary. The VR&E program offers various services to assist veterans with disabilities in achieving their employment goals. Veterans can be placed on different tracks based on their needs, such as the reemployment track or the Rapid Access to Employment Track, which focus on workplace accessibility and immediate job placement. Assistance may include job readiness preparation, resume development, and counseling on disability rights. Veterans are considered rehabilitated after completing the program and maintaining suitable employment for 60 days. The VR&E program offers different tracks for veterans with disabilities, including a track for self-employment. Veterans on this track receive assistance in developing a business plan and training for small businesses. They are considered rehabilitated after maintaining a viable business for one year. This track targets veterans needing long-term employment training. Formal classroom courses are the most common long-term service under the VR&E program, with training also including on-the-job training, apprenticeships, internships, or other workplace preparation programs. Courses should be approved for the GI Bill, and services can last up to 48 months. Extensions beyond 48 months are possible in limited circumstances with approval from a counseling psychologist and a VR&E officer. The Independent Living (IL) Services Track in the VR&E program is for veterans who need additional rehabilitation to live more independently. It focuses on family and community participation, with the goal of potentially returning to work in the future. Veterans on this track may receive assistive technology, independent living skills training, and community-based support services. The IL track has a limit of 2,700 veterans per year, but this limit can be waived for veterans affected by disasters. The VR&E program offers Independent Living (IL) services for veterans needing additional rehabilitation for independence. The program can be extended for veterans affected by disasters or with severe disabilities. Veterans entitled to VR&E services may receive training benefits, employment services, and financial benefits, including a subsistence allowance. The VR&E program provides a subsistence allowance for veterans enrolled in eligible programs, varying based on program type and dependents. The allowance is $902 for full-time enrollment with two dependents as of October 1, 2017, and increases annually with inflation. It continues during enrollment and for two months after completion, with a two-month extension for disaster-displaced veterans. Veterans cannot participate in both VR&E and another VA educational program simultaneously. The Post-9/11 GI Bill allows veterans to collect a housing allowance based on their location while receiving training and benefits from the VR&E program. This policy aims to prevent disabled veterans from choosing the GI Bill over VR&E for higher cash allowances but fewer services. Chapter 33 housing allowances vary by location, ranging from $825 to over $3,000 per month. In FY2016, the VA reported that VR&E subsistence allowance benefits totaled $573 million, including traditional subsistence allowance and Chapter 33 housing allowances. Veterans entitled to VR&E benefits may also qualify for interest-free loans up to twice the weekly subsistence allowance amount. Repayment is deducted from future wages, pensions, or other benefits. 2,402 loans totaling $2.4 million were issued. The VA reported that 2,402 loans totaling approximately $2.4 million were made in FY2016 with a default rate close to zero percent. The VR&E loan program cost $464,000 in FY2016, with $367,000 for administrative expenses. Participation data from FY2011 through FY2016 shows the number of individuals progressing through the application process, including those who secured suitable employment or completed an independent living program. The VA is transitioning from using the VR&E rehabilitation rate to a new \"positive outcomes performance standard\" to measure efficacy. Data using this new standard are not yet available. Table 3 displays the types of programs beneficiaries participated in during FY2016, focusing on those receiving a subsistence allowance while completing an educational program. It does not include individuals in training without an accompanying allowance. In FY2016, 85% of veterans who completed VR&E rehabilitation achieved employment outcomes, with an average annual wage of $46,208."
