    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Fisheries Mitigation Coordination Act\" and includes findings related to fisheries. Congress finds that the operation of dams and water diversion projects benefit the American public, impacting water systems and fish populations, necessitating the construction and operation of fish hatcheries to mitigate these effects. This is in accordance with various acts and policies aimed at mitigating for fish, wildlife, and their habitats. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service operates fish hatcheries for mitigation fishery activities related to Federal water resource development projects. These activities are valued by State, Indian tribal partners, and the fishing community. Inconsistencies in authorities for water projects have led to various funding mechanisms for mitigation fishery activities. The Service uses its appropriations to offset mitigation fishery costs incurred by sponsor agencies. The sponsor agency is responsible for bearing the financial burden of these costs. The curr_chunk is a section header \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" which indicates that definitions will be provided in the following text. The definitions provided in this Act include terms such as \"sponsor agency\" referring to specific government agencies, \"Service\" referring to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, \"mitigation fisheries\" for compensating impacts of water projects on aquatic resources, \"mitigation fishery activities\" for stocking fish to replace lost harvest levels, and \"mitigation fishery costs\" for associated expenses. Mitigation fishery costs refer to necessary expenditures for operating facilities conducting mitigation fishery activities, including personnel, transportation, utilities, supplies, equipment, maintenance, fish health, and planning. Mitigation fishery facilities are owned and operated by the US Fish and Wildlife Service for conducting these activities. Fishery mitigation plans are resource management plans developed for mitigation purposes. A fishery mitigation plan is a resource management plan developed between the US Fish and Wildlife Service and sponsor agencies, in cooperation with affected States and Indian Tribes, outlining long-term goals and annual targets for mitigation fishery activities. The plan must be approved in advance by the sponsor agency and the Service. The sponsor agency is required to pay the Service the necessary funds for mitigation fishery costs by October 1st each year as outlined in the fishery mitigation plan for water development projects. The Director of the US Fish and Wildlife Service must identify the funds in advance."
