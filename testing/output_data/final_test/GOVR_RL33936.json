    "content": "Many experts believe that national reconciliation is crucial in stopping sectarian violence and displacement in Iraq. The Bush Administration in 2008 attributed progress in political reconciliation and reduced violence to the 2007 troop surge. The decrease in violence has prevented the displacement issue from worsening in 2008, with some signs of improvement. If political reconciliation continues after the January 2009 elections, it could lead to a decrease in displacement rates and prompt the international community to address the refugee crisis. Reconciliation is also seen as a way to strengthen Iraq's ministries. The ongoing violence in Iraq has led to significant civilian displacement, particularly since early 2006 due to sectarian violence. Estimates of displaced Iraqis vary, with the Iraqi Red Crescent Society reporting more than the Migration Policy Institute's figure of close to 4.5 million displaced Iraqis. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees now estimates close to 4.7 million Iraqis are currently displaced from their homes. The displacement crisis in Iraq has led to around 4.7 million Iraqis being displaced, with 2.7 million inside Iraq and 2 million refugees in neighboring countries. The humanitarian crisis that many feared after the 2003 war has now materialized, with concerns about the capacity of neighboring countries to handle the influx of refugees. This crisis is one of the largest population displacement crises globally, with rising food and fuel prices limiting aid agencies' ability to provide assistance. The displacement crisis in Iraq has led to around 4.7 million Iraqis being displaced, with rising food and fuel prices limiting aid agencies' ability to provide assistance. Despite some improvements, the situation remains serious, with over 1 million Iraqi IDPs in need of food and shelter. The impact of this displacement crisis, the largest in the Middle East since 1948, is significant for regional stability and humanitarian suffering. The displacement crisis in Iraq has led to around 4.7 million Iraqis being displaced due to sectarian conflict, armed violence, and other factors. The international community needs to develop a robust response, examine resettlement policies, and provide increased funding for humanitarian relief. Personal threats, abductions, and violence based on religious or political affiliations continue to pose risks for displaced individuals. The displacement crisis in Iraq has caused around 4.7 million Iraqis to be displaced due to sectarian conflict and armed violence. This has led to a generalized fear among ordinary Iraqis, with sectarian polarization and \"cleansing\" in mixed neighborhoods. The International Organization for Migration found that internally displaced persons (IDPs) tended to be from mixed neighborhoods and moved to homogenous ones, mostly within urban areas. Living standards in Iraq have sharply declined since 2003, affecting access to healthcare, social services, education, and employment. The displacement crisis in Iraq has caused around 4.7 million Iraqis to be displaced due to sectarian conflict and armed violence, leading to a generalized fear among ordinary Iraqis. Limited assistance activities and access by the international community have made implementation of long-term policy objectives difficult. Conditions are deteriorating in many areas, with approximately 17% of Iraq's population potentially displaced. Patterns of displacement have evolved, with some refugees being displaced multiple times within Iraq. Saddam Hussein's regime forcibly displaced Iraqi Shiites and Kurds to control territory and terrorize the population. Experts estimate 1.5 million were displaced over three decades. Iraq's population consists of various ethnic groups and religions, with Shiites moving south, Sunnis moving north, Christians fleeing to Ninevah Province, and Kurds ending up in Diyala or Tamim/Kirkuk Provinces. Palestinians in Iraq, mostly Sunni, have been vulnerable to reprisals. Many Palestinians in Iraq, mostly Sunni, have faced reprisal attacks due to preferential treatment from Saddam Hussein. Some have been killed or displaced, with around 3,000 living in refugee camps on the Iraqi-Syrian border. Efforts have been made to resettle some in Canada, Brazil, Chile, and Sudan. Vulnerable groups, including those who worked with the U.S. government, are particularly targeted. Displaced individuals have mostly moved in with family and friends. Many displaced individuals in Iraq have sought refuge with family and friends or in public facilities like schools and factories. Some have also resorted to squatting in damaged or abandoned properties. Repeat-displacement is common among those displaced by military operations, and daily behavior may involve micro and nighttime displacement to avoid predictability. The displacement of individuals in Iraq has led to various consequences, including a decline in basic humanitarian needs and services. Displaced Iraqis are in need of food, water, shelter, healthcare, and education. This has increased competition for limited resources and placed burdens on host communities. The Iraqi government ministries providing assistance to the displaced include the Ministry of Displacement and Migration, the Ministry of Trade, and the Ministry of Interior. The Iraqi government, through ministries like the Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Education, assists displaced individuals with services such as food rations and school enrollment. The Iraqi Red Crescent also provides aid through its branches. Concerns have been raised by neighboring countries and donors about the government's efforts, prompting a pledge of $195 million at a conference in Sweden in 2008. The International Compact with Iraq annual report states that $195 million has been allocated by the government of Iraq to support voluntary returnees and for emergency costs and housing rehabilitation. The United States, UNHCR, and other international partners are working with Iraq to assess policies and programs for accommodating returns. Some experts believe sectarian groups are providing services for the displaced due to the unstable security situation in Iraq. Since 2003, Iraq's neighbors have absorbed approximately 2 million refugees fleeing violence. Jordan and Syria are primary destinations, struggling to provide adequate services. Concerns arise about the situation deteriorating over time if existing refugee populations remain or new waves flood neighboring countries. The displacement of nearly 10% of Iraq's pre-war population into neighboring countries raises questions about their future status and potential impact on the geopolitics of the Middle East. Will Iraqis be integrated into the citizenry or treated as second-class citizens? Will they become politically active or be barred from politics, potentially leading to radicalization? Concerns also exist about sectarian violence spilling over into neighboring states, adding instability to the region. The displacement of nearly 10% of Iraq's pre-war population into neighboring countries raises questions about their future status and potential impact on the geopolitics of the Middle East. Many Iraqi refugees were from the middle class and fled to escape sectarian violence and kidnapping. Their status in neighboring states is unclear, as they have not formed makeshift tent cities but have blended into urban areas. Many Iraqi refugees have blended into urban areas in cities like Amman and Damascus, with some having temporary means of support. Wealthy Ba'th party members who fled to Jordan in 2003 were called \"Mercedes refugees.\" Newer waves of Iraqi refugees are poorer, making it crucial to prioritize assistance. Aid workers face challenges in identifying and helping Iraqi refugees living abroad. Iraqi refugees living abroad face social isolation, discrimination, and limited access to healthcare and education. Many are unable to work legally and rely on international aid agencies for support. Hundreds of thousands of Iraqi children are not attending school while in exile, with a significant portion being illiterate. Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon do not adhere to the 1951 United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. The United Nations plays a crucial role in addressing Iraq's humanitarian situation, political reconciliation, and economic reconstruction. Despite challenges in countries like Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon not recognizing the term \"refugee\" under international law, the UN assists displaced Iraqis through UNAMI and a coordinated Country Team of 16 agencies. The United Nations, through UNAMI, coordinates various clusters in Iraq including Agriculture, Food Security, Environment/Natural Resources Management, Education, Governance, Health, Infrastructure, Refugees, Electoral Process support. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1830 extended UNAMI's mandate to assist Iraq's democratization. UNAMI, under the United Nations, focuses on promoting political reconciliation, providing election assistance, monitoring human rights practices, and assisting with the constitution review process in Iraq. It played a key role in organizing provincial elections and resolving the Kurdish claim to Kirkuk. The referendum to incorporate Kirkuk into the Kurdistan regional government-controlled area has been postponed multiple times with no rescheduled date. In response to improved security, the United Nations has increased its presence in Iraq, with UNHCR leading the Cluster Approach on refugees and IDPs in coordination with the Iraqi Ministry of Displacement and Migration. Other partners include IOM, UNOPS, WFP, UNICEF, U.N. Habitat, and WHO. UNHCR also collaborates with U.N. country teams in neighboring countries. The U.N. and government of Iraq launched the International Compact for Iraq in 2006 to receive donor contributions for economic and political development. A three-year agreement was signed in 2008 to support the goals outlined in the Compact. The International Compact with Iraq focuses on reconstruction, development, and humanitarian needs, funded by the government of Iraq and international support. An international conference in Geneva approved a Strategic Framework for Humanitarian Action in Iraq, emphasizing coordination and expansion of assistance activities. Donor contributions have been made towards humanitarian appeals, but some consider the response inadequate. At a donor's conference, the Iraqi government pledged $25 million to assist Iraqi refugees in neighboring countries, with payments made to Syria and Lebanon. Jordan did not accept direct payment, instead, the money was contributed to UNHCR for its refugee program in Jordan. The Iraqi government also pledged $195 million to assist displaced Iraqis. UNHCR's budget for Iraq in 2003 was $150 million, increasing to $123.7 million in July 2007. Additionally, UNHCR and UNICEF launched a joint education appeal of $129 million to enroll 150,000 Iraqi children in Jordan and Syria. The UNHCR and ERF provide humanitarian appeals for Iraqi IDPs and refugees. The Consolidated Appeal Process for Iraq and the Region in 2009 is for $547.3 million, divided into Pillar I for vulnerable IDPs in Iraq and Pillar II for Iraqi refugees in neighboring countries. $355 million is requested under Pillar II to support Iraqi refugees in host countries. Resettlement applications from Iraqi refugees have increased in Europe, with Sweden experiencing a fourfold increase in 2007. UNHCR has over 300 staff working on its Iraq operation, registering refugees in neighboring countries and referring the most vulnerable to resettlement countries including the United States, Australia, Canada, and others. To offer protection and assistance to Iraqi refugees, UNHCR developed ten categories of risk. The UNHCR identifies vulnerable groups for resettlement in third countries, including those who have experienced severe trauma or torture, women at risk, individuals with medical conditions or disabilities, dependents of refugees, older persons, unaccompanied or separated children, high profile cases, stateless persons, and minority groups targeted for their religious or ethnic background. A Core Group on Iraqi Resettlement was formed in Geneva in 2008 to make decisions on policy and technical issues. The U.S. government has provided over $1 billion in support. The U.S. government has provided over $1 billion in humanitarian assistance to displaced Iraqis and vulnerable populations since 2003, mostly through emergency supplemental appropriations. After sectarian violence escalated in Iraq following the bombing of the Al-Askariya shrine in 2006, the State Department's Bureau for Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM) has been providing assistance to refugees through various international organizations. The Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) at the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is providing assistance focused on IDPs and host communities inside Iraq, with five implementing partners working with local agencies due to security concerns. OFDA's strategy is to support host communities to help meet their needs and maintain their capacity for helping IDPs through activities like emergency relief supplies and infrastructure rehabilitation. The NGO community in Iraq, including European NGOs and American NGOs through organizations like Interaction, provided humanitarian assistance totaling $171 million in FY2007 and $175.4 million in FY2008. This assistance supported various projects such as infrastructure rehabilitation, medical teams, livelihood projects, and education appeals. The United States provided $398.3 million in humanitarian assistance for displaced Iraqis in FY2008. The FY2009 budget did not include funding for Iraqi refugees or IDPs. $200 million was appropriated for Migration and Refugee Assistance, with $149.3 million obligated for Iraqi refugees. Additional funding requests were made in the FY2008 and FY2009 supplemental budgets. The Administration requested $191 million in FY2009 supplemental MRA funding, including $141 million for Iraqi refugees. The final FY2008/2009 supplemental appropriations bill provided $315 million for MRA to meet global refugee needs, including Iraqi refugees in various countries. The bill provided $350 million for MRA in the FY2009 supplemental, nearly 50% more than requested, to assist Iraqi refugees and IDPs. Additionally, $220 million was allocated for IDA in FY2008 for humanitarian crises worldwide, with some funds potentially aiding IDPs in Iraq and addressing the international food crisis in FY2009. The Bush Administration's FY2009 regular appropriations request did not include funding for Iraqi refugees or IDPs. However, funding was provided under a continuing resolution that allows foreign aid spending at the FY2008 level. PRM has obligated $3.03 million in FY2008 Supplemental carryover for programs for Iraqi refugees in Jordan and Syria. Refugee admission to the US is authorized by the Immigration and Nationality Act. The Department of State oversees refugee processing for individuals fleeing persecution based on various factors. Priority One (P-1) includes cases with no durable solution, referred by UNHCR or other organizations. Priority Two (P-2) covers groups of special concern to the U.S., including specified Iraqis under the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008. Priority Two groups of Iraqis eligible for refugee processing include those who worked for the U.S. government, media or NGO in Iraq, as well as persecuted religious or minority groups with family in the U.S. The FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act mandates in-country processing for these refugees. Priority Three (P-3) involves family reunification cases for spouses, children under 21, and parents of previous refugees or asylees, including Iraqis. Iraqis eligible for P-3 processing in FY2009 undergo enhanced security screening procedures by DHS. Applicants are checked through CLASS and undergo SAO process with FBI. USCIS conducts in-person interviews to determine refugee status and admissibility to the U.S. President submits a consultation document to Congress annually. The President submits a consultation document to Congress annually, containing the proposed refugee ceiling and regional allocations for the upcoming fiscal year. The FY2009 worldwide refugee ceiling is 80,000, with 75,000 allocated admissions numbers among regions and an unallocated reserve of 5,000 numbers. The Near East/South Asia region, including Iraq, has an allocation of 37,000 refugees. Admissions of Iraqi refugees to the United States have increased significantly in recent years. In FY2009, the Administration aims to admit 17,000 Iraqi refugees to the United States. Special immigration mechanisms are in place for Iraqis who have worked with the U.S. government or military. The program for Iraqi and Afghan nationals capped at 500 in FY2007 and FY2008 is now capped at 50 aliens for FY2009 and beyond. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 broadens DHS's authority to provide special immigrant status to certain nationals of Iraq who have worked for the U.S. government. Iraqi nationals are eligible if they have provided valuable service and faced a serious threat as a result. The special immigrant program is capped at 5,000 principal aliens. The special immigrant program for Iraqi nationals who have worked for the U.S. government is capped at 5,000 principal aliens annually from FY2008 to FY2012. They are eligible for resettlement assistance and benefits similar to refugees for up to eight months. In FY2008, 705 special immigrant visas were issued under this program. The 110th Congress addressed issues related to Iraqi refugees and IDPs, introducing legislation to support their resettlement in the United States. The 110th Congress passed several bills related to Iraqi refugees and IDPs, including increasing the number of translators admitted to the US and providing appropriations for veterans and Iraq accountability. Legislation before the 111th Congress focused on Iraqi refugees, such as the Iraqi Refugee and Internally Displaced Persons Humanitarian Assistance Act of 2009. The Displaced Persons Humanitarian Assistance, Resettlement, and Security Act of 2009 (Hastings) was introduced in the 110th Congress and referred to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the House Committee on the Judiciary on 1/15/2009. The return of refugees to Iraq in late 2007 was debated, with some attributing it to improved security and others to political pressure. UNHCR expressed concerns about the conditions in Iraq not being conducive for a voluntary returns program due to security issues and lack of capacity on the ground. Reports indicated that up to 70% of returnees to Baghdad could not resettle in their own homes. Many IDPs in Iraq face harsh living conditions with limited access to basic needs like water, shelter, and food. Infrastructure is damaged, public services need rehabilitation, and employment opportunities are scarce for returnees. The Iraqi MoDM's assistance to IDPs may be insufficient, and experts suggest better preparation and coordination for potential large-scale returns. Some Iraqis have been forced to return, such as those arrested in Lebanon. Iraqis arrested in Lebanon were given the option of \"voluntary deportation\" back to Iraq or staying in jail. European countries have also sent Iraqis back, mainly to the Kurdish-controlled north. UNHCR and humanitarian groups view Iraq as inhospitable for returns. The issue highlights the challenge of balancing asylum, obligations, and resettlement programs. Iraq's neighbors are displeased with the lack of support from the Iraqi government. Iraqis express displeasure over Iraqi government's lack of support for citizens who fled abroad. Experts suggest sectarian dimension to government's behavior. Congress raises concerns about resources dedicated to assisting refugees and IDPs. MoDM lacks capacity to respond to displacement crisis. International Organization for Migration (IOM) takes steps. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) ensured IDPs could vote in provincial elections in 2009, but Iraqi refugees were not included. Experts emphasize the elections' impact on IDPs' return decisions. More international aid is needed for host countries, NGOs, and organizations like UNHCR to assist Iraqi refugees. UNHCR lacks funds to provide adequate support and protection. The Iraq Study Group (ISG) highlights the lack of funds for assisting Iraqi refugees, emphasizing the need for the United States to lead in funding assistance requests from UNHCR and other humanitarian agencies. Pressure on other donors to participate in relief efforts could make a significant difference in the humanitarian crisis developing on the ground. The humanitarian crisis in Iraq due to internal population displacement requires difficult decisions on relief efforts and coordination. The role of the U.S. military and Provincial Reconstruction Teams in local humanitarian response is uncertain. The Iraq Study Group emphasizes the need for funding assistance for Iraqi refugees. Amid efforts to tackle rising U.S. budget deficits, finding resources to sustain U.S. aid pledges during disasters may be challenging. Depleting worldwide disaster contingency accounts to fund pledges could limit U.S. capacity to respond to future crises. Donor fatigue and concerns about funding priorities for humanitarian needs in Iraq are also issues. Some believe the U.S. should continue funding humanitarian needs of displaced Iraqis despite budgetary concerns. Increasing funding and resettlement numbers could encourage other countries to do the same. Finding a balance on burdensharing with the international community is crucial in the Iraq context. Repatriation of Iraqi refugees is hoped for, but security remains a key consideration. The security situation will remain important in repatriation of Iraqi refugees. Policy implications for refugee resettlement are unclear, with concerns about preference for Christian over Muslim Iraqis. Granting preference to vulnerable Iraqis may have unforeseen consequences and create resentment among Iraqis. Granting preference to vulnerable Iraqis for resettlement may lead to resentment among those who do not qualify. Some worry that Iraqis may view collaboration with the US as a way to resettle in the country, potentially leading to eagerness to take advantage of any opportunity."
