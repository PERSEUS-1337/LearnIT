    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Robin Danielson Act\" and focuses on research regarding risks posed by dioxin, synthetic fibers, and other additives in feminine hygiene products. The Congress finds that tampons are widely used by women in the United States, with potential exposure to dioxins, a probable human carcinogen. Dioxins are formed from combustion processes and chlorine bleaching, raising concerns about their presence in tampons sold in the US. Tampons in the US are made of cotton, rayon, or a mix. Rayon is from wood pulp. Most manufacturers use chlorine-free bleaching with chlorine dioxide, which still produces dioxins. The FDA hasn't banned chlorine in tampon production. Even chlorine-free and 100% cotton tampons may have trace dioxins due to pollution. Dioxin, a pollutant found in air, water, and ground, can be present in cotton and wood pulp used in tampon production. Women may be exposed to dioxin in menstrual products for up to 60 years. The FDA relies on manufacturers for product safety data and requires monitoring of dioxin levels in tampons, but this information is not easily accessible to the public. Recent studies have conflicting findings. Recent studies have conflicting information on the link between dioxin exposure and endometriosis risks. The EPA warns of noncancer effects from dioxin exposure, including immune suppression, increased pelvic inflammatory disease risk, reduced fertility, and fetal/childhood development interference. Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) is linked to tampon use, especially those with synthetic fibers and high absorbency. TSS is a rare bacterial illness primarily affecting menstruating women, causing deaths and nonfatal cases in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Manufacturers have stopped using certain synthetic fiber additives in tampons due to their association with toxic shock syndrome. However, highly absorbent viscose rayon is still used in tampon production, leading to concerns about increasing antibiotic resistance and virulence in the bacteria causing TSS. SEC. 102 of the Public Health Service Act amends Part F to include a section on certain projects regarding women's health. The Public Health Service Act includes a section on projects related to women's health. The NIH will conduct research on the risks of dioxin and other additives in feminine hygiene products on women's health, including cervical cancer, infertility, and toxic shock syndrome, as well as on the health of children of women who used these products during pregnancy. The NIH will conduct research on the risks of dioxin and other additives in feminine hygiene products, including tampons, pads, liners, and similar products used by women. Reports on the research results will be submitted to Congress, the FDA, EPA, and CPSC, and made available to the public. Reports on research results regarding risks of dioxin and additives in feminine hygiene products will be made public through established data systems or other appropriate means. TITLE II--COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS OF DATA ON TOXIC SHOCK SYNDROME\n\nSEC. 201. FINDINGS. The Congress finds that toxic shock syndrome cases in the United States are related to tampon use and occur in nonmenstruating women, men, and children. The Centers for Disease Prevention and Control estimates that 1-2 out of every 100,000 women aged 15-44 will develop the syndrome. Data on toxic shock syndrome cases are not systematically collected, and reporting by states to the CDC is voluntary. As of 2006, only 39 states required reporting of toxic shock syndrome to health officials. National surveillance is conducted through the National Electronic Telecommunications Systems. Cooperation between the CDC and states is needed to collect and analyze data on toxic shock syndrome, leading to increased awareness and understanding of the disease. SEC. 317U. COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS OF DATA ON TOXIC SHOCK SYNDROME. The Secretary will collect and analyze data on toxic shock syndrome, including its causes, to determine national incidence and prevalence. The program may involve cooperation with States and local health departments, with authorized appropriations for fiscal years 2012 through 2016."
