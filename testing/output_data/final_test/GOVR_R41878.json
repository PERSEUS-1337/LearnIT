    "content": "Human trafficking involves the exploitation of individuals for forced labor or commercial sex, occurring within U.S borders. Most victims of sex trafficking in the United States are women and children, including both U.S. citizens and noncitizens. The focus of this report is on the sex trafficking of children in the U.S, with all states having laws outlawing human trafficking. Congress has recently addressed domestic sex trafficking of children under the age of 18. Under the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA), sex trafficking of children is a federal crime, regardless of consent or representation as an adult. The exact number of child victims in the U.S. is unknown, with more U.S. citizens being victims of sex trafficking than labor trafficking. Data from the Department of Justice shows a snapshot of child victims from investigations by federally funded task forces. Between January 2008 and June 2010, federally funded human trafficking task forces opened 2,515 investigations, with 82% classified as sex trafficking cases. 83% of these cases involved U.S. citizen victims, and 40% included prostitution or sexual exploitation of a child. The National Human Trafficking Resource Center received information on 4,884 potential trafficking cases in 2013, with 69% categorized as sex trafficking incidents and 31% involving potential minor victims. Demand for child sex trafficking is steady, with profit to traffickers increasing. Pimps prey on vulnerable youth, grooming them for forced sexual services. Technological advances like cell phones and the Internet facilitate the demand for child sex trafficking, connecting buyers with victims while distancing perpetrators from criminal transactions. Buyers of sexual services from pimps are known as solicitors. The demand for child sex trafficking is steady, with profit to traffickers increasing. Pimps prey on vulnerable youth, grooming them for forced sexual services. Buyers of sexual services from pimps are known as solicitors. Factors such as homelessness, history of child abuse, family conflict, peer pressure, and societal sexualization of children can increase the risk of exploitation. Having one or more risk factors does not necessarily make a child vulnerable to sex trafficking. Other factors like the presence of unattached and transient males in communities can also heighten the risk of exploitation. The demand for child sex trafficking is steady, with profit to traffickers increasing. Pimps prey on vulnerable youth, grooming them for forced sexual services. Factors such as homelessness, history of child abuse, family conflict, peer pressure, and societal sexualization of children can increase the risk of exploitation. Unattached and transient males in communities also heighten the risk of exploitation. Sex trafficking is supply-driven as well as demand-driven, with federal legislation focusing more on penalizing traffickers than buyers of commercial sex. Efforts to reduce trafficking should address both the supply and demand. The TVPA authorizes services to trafficking victims, historically focusing on shelter and support services. The TVPA historically focused on providing shelter and support services to victims within the United States, particularly noncitizens who were not eligible for certain services available to U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents. U.S. citizen victims may be eligible for crime victim benefits and public benefit entitlement programs, but data on their access to these services is limited. The TVPA has been reauthorized four times since 2000, with increased focus on U.S. citizen and LPR victims through reauthorizations in 2006, 2008, and 2013. Congress has authorized services for these victims. In 2008 and 2013, Congress increased focus on U.S. citizen and LPR victims of sex trafficking within the United States. Services authorized through the TVPA primarily aid noncitizen victims, possibly due to stable funding levels since 2000. Congress has not allocated additional funds for services targeting a broader victim population. Congress has generally not appropriated additional funds for services targeting a broader spectrum of sex trafficking victims. Program funding decisions have been left to the DOJ and HHS. Congress may need to explore the adequacy of victim services for all victims of sex trafficking in the United States, especially for minor victims who lack specialized support and face limited housing and services. Youth shelters and foster care homes may not be sufficient for protecting sex trafficking victims from abusers. Child victims often face challenges with child protective services and may be arrested or placed in juvenile detention facilities. This report provides an overview of sex trafficking of children in the United States, discussing victims, perpetrators, and the federal response to investigating and prosecuting traffickers. The federal response to investigating and prosecuting sex trafficking of minors in the United States is outlined, with a focus on the definition of \"severe forms of trafficking in persons\" under the TVPA. This definition includes sex trafficking induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or involving individuals under 18 years old. The report discusses select issues related to the federal response to sex trafficking of minors. The definition of \"severe forms of trafficking in persons\" under the TVPA includes any sex act where something of value is given or received. This commercial aspect distinguishes trafficking from other crimes like molestation or rape. Experts agree that the prostitution of minors falls under this definition. There is a consensus that the term trafficking applies to children, regardless of whether their actions are forced or voluntary. Research on the number of child victims is lacking, with studies being inconsistent in their measurements and terminology. Approximately 1.7 million youth ran away from home or were forced to leave in 1999. 2.2% of these youth were sexually assaulted or engaged in sexual activity for necessities. Runaways are vulnerable to sex trafficking due to lack of resources. Approximately 28% of street youth and 10% of sheltered youth engage in survival sex to meet basic needs. Those under 18 are considered sex trafficking victims if they exchange sex for necessities. Risk factors for survival sex include victimization, criminal behavior, substance abuse, suicide attempts, STDs, and pregnancy. The Dallas Police Department found a strong link between sex trafficking and runaway status, with repeated runaways increasing the likelihood of victimization. Other risk factors for child trafficking victims include young age and prior victimization. Factors among child trafficking victims include young ages, prior sexual exploitation, and history of prostitution. Research shows that majority of prostituted women were runaways. Studies indicate that 21% to 42% of runaway and homeless youth were sexually abused before leaving home, compared to 1% to 3% in the general youth population. The Letot Center in Dallas reported that 9 out of 10 youth had experienced physical or sexual abuse, with 10% having previous involvement with child protective services. Foster youth are also vulnerable to trafficking. Foster youth are vulnerable to traffickers who target group homes and other settings where they congregate. Traffickers exploit victims of sex trafficking, ranging from individuals to organized criminal syndicates. Factors influencing traffickers include exposure to sex work, lack of job options, and encouragement from others. Pimps profit from the sexual use of individuals, with child prostitution being more profitable for them. Traffickers find it more profitable to prostitute children than to engage in other criminal activities due to the reusability of the commodity. Technological advancements have expanded their client base and facilitated quicker connections with buyers. The terms \"pimp\" and \"trafficker\" are interchangeable when referring to minors but not adults. Buyers of commercial sex with minors are challenging to identify, and there is limited research on them. Before 2000, U.S. laws were considered inadequate for addressing human trafficking and protecting victims. The Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA, P.L. 106-386) was enacted to improve the situation. Some buyers of commercial sex with minors may engage unknowingly, assuming the individual is an adult. Anti-trafficking legislation and programs have been implemented to combat online solicitations and exploitation. The TVPA, enacted in 2000, aimed to punish traffickers and support victims in the U.S. It was reauthorized in 2003, 2006, 2008, and 2013. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2005 addressed child victims and American victims trafficked within the U.S. The William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 created grant programs for U.S. citizen and LPR victims. The TVPA, enacted in 2000, aimed to punish traffickers and support victims in the U.S. It was reauthorized multiple times. The most recent reauthorization amended a grant program to combat sex trafficking of minors. The federal government investigates and prosecutes trafficking crimes and provides services to victims, including those who are sex trafficked. The TVPA is considered crucial in the fight against the commercial sexual exploitation of children. The State Department's 2013 Trafficking in Persons Report recommends increasing funding for victim services, improving interagency coordination, and enhancing screening to identify trafficked persons. The Departments of Justice and Homeland Security are responsible for investigating and prosecuting trafficking cases, with federal statutes outlawing sex trafficking of minors. The TVPA, federal legislation, authorizes services for victims of trafficking, primarily by DOJ and HHS. There has been confusion over the eligibility of U.S. citizen, LPR, and noncitizen victims for these services. A policy change in FY2012 allows funding for U.S. citizen victims. DOJ Grants for Victim Services in FY2009 specifically served U.S. citizen and LPR minor victims of sex trafficking. Table 1 summarizes programs authorized by the TVPA to combat trafficking of children in the U.S. The programs in the United States combat trafficking of children, addressing U.S. citizen, LPR, and noncitizen victims. Grants are provided for investigations, prosecutions, and victims' services. DOJ Grants for Victim Services and HHS's Victims' Assistance program have been funded, serving noncitizen victims. Challenges in human trafficking investigations include language barriers, humanitarian issues, and logistical difficulties. Unlike drug trafficking cases, these cases involve complex victim support needs. The investigation and prosecution of child prostitution and human trafficking in the United States involve challenges such as language barriers and logistical difficulties. DHS and DOJ are responsible for investigating and prosecuting sex traffickers, including those who traffic children. The majority of cases are handled by agents from DHS's ICE and DOJ's FBI, who coordinate as needed. The DOJ, through CEOS and HTPU, works with U.S. Attorneys' Offices to prosecute individuals violating federal laws on trafficking, child pornography, child prostitution, and more. CEOS prosecutes sex traffickers under the TVPA and other laws related to child sexual exploitation, using statutes like 18 U.S.C. \u00a71591. The DOJ prosecutes individuals for various offenses related to trafficking and child sexual exploitation, including recruiting individuals for commercial sex acts, transporting individuals for unlawful sexual activities, and engaging in interstate travel for sexual activities with minors. Only 18 U.S.C. \u00a71591 is an anti-trafficking statute created in the TVPA. The TVPA created a statute that allows prosecution for trafficking offenses without the victim needing to be taken across state lines. While most statutes focus on prosecuting traffickers, there is less emphasis on prosecuting buyers. Traffickers can be prosecuted regardless of whether the victim is moved across state lines, whereas buyers generally need to cross state lines or entice the victim to do so for prosecution. This provides federal prosecutors with more flexibility in prosecuting traffickers compared to buyers. The DOJ and DHS work together to combat trafficking, including child sex trafficking. The FBI's CRU oversees human trafficking cases involving adults and foreign victims, while the VCACS investigates cases of domestic minors being sexually exploited. These units collaborate with other FBI components to investigate sex trafficking cases. In FY2012, the CRU opened 306 human trafficking cases, and the VCACS opened 363 cases related to the commercial sexual exploitation of children in prostitution. The FBI, along with DOJ and NCMEC, participates in the Innocence Lost Initiative to combat sex trafficking of minors in the US. They have established 66 task forces leading to 1,300 convictions and the rescue of 2,700 children. Operation Cross Country in July 2013 recovered 105 exploited children and arrested 150 perpetrators. The FBI, along with DOJ and NCMEC, work together to combat sex trafficking of minors in the US through task forces. These task forces coordinate with law enforcement and social service providers to identify and recover trafficking victims. The Anti-Human Trafficking Task Force Initiative, funded by DOJ, supports nationwide anti-trafficking task forces composed of federal, state, and local investigators and prosecutors. Research shows that areas with task forces are more successful in identifying and prosecuting trafficking cases. The Anti-Trafficking Coordination Team (ACTeam) Initiative, launched in 2011, aims to streamline federal investigations and prosecutions of human trafficking offenses. Six pilot sites were established in Atlanta, El Paso, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Memphis, and Miami. The Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) Task Force program, funded in 1998, supports 61 regional task forces to combat online enticement of children and pornography proliferation. These task forces involve federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies in investigations and prosecutions. The ICAC program, established in 1998, has trained over 338,000 individuals to investigate and prosecute online child victimization cases. In FY2012, ICAC task forces reviewed 8,565 complaints and made over 6,900 arrests. The Human Smuggling and Trafficking Unit (HSTU) within ICE focuses on trafficking investigations, including sex trafficking, and collaborated with other units and agencies to combat sex trafficking. ICE initiated 894 human trafficking cases in FY2012, resulting in 967 criminal arrests and 559 indictments. In FY2012, 894 human trafficking cases were initiated, leading to 967 criminal arrests, 559 indictments, and 381 convictions. The data do not specify the breakdown between sex trafficking and labor trafficking, or cases involving domestic versus international victims. The Human Smuggling and Trafficking Center (HSTC) was established in 2004 to serve as a federal information clearinghouse for all agencies addressing human smuggling and trafficking. The Human Smuggling and Trafficking Center (HSTC) serves as an intelligence hub for federal agencies dealing with human smuggling, trafficking, and potential terrorist use of smuggling routes. However, there is a lack of focus on minor victims of sex trafficking, and no centralized database for information on trafficking perpetrators and victims, despite a 2008 mandate. The HSTC collaborated with DHS to assess the feasibility of creating a human trafficking database. The Interagency Task Force developed a strategic action plan in 2013 to provide services to victims of human trafficking, focusing on sex and labor trafficking. The plan includes goals to increase coordination, awareness, access to services, and promote victim well-being. Action items aim to develop tested approaches for victim services. The strategic action plan developed in 2013 by the Interagency Task Force focuses on providing services to victims of human trafficking, specifically sex and labor trafficking. The plan includes goals to increase coordination, awareness, access to services, and promote victim well-being. It outlines steps agencies are taking to identify promising practices for responding to trafficking victims, with a focus on child victims of sex trafficking. Funding from HHS is used to assist victims, including children under 18 and noncitizen adults certified as victims. The statute does not specify the citizenship of children, but HHS provides services only to noncitizen children. Noncitizen trafficking victims under 18 do not need certification for benefits, but HHS issues eligibility letters to them. There is confusion regarding eligibility for U.S. citizens for services provided by HHS and other federal agencies. Adult U.S. citizen and LPR trafficking victims do not require certification by HHS. The 2007 report by the Senior Policy Operating Group on Trafficking in Persons (SPOG) states that there are not many differences in trafficking victims' eligibility for services between citizens and noncitizens. U.S. citizen victims may receive less intensive case management services compared to noncitizens, and only noncitizen victims are eligible for refugee-specific programs. DOJ can use funds to provide services to both citizens and noncitizens, including adults and minors, under 22 U.S.C. \u00a77105(b)(2). DOJ had targeted funds towards Grants for Victim Services to provide emergency services to victims. In FY2009, DOJ awarded cooperative agreements to organizations working with domestic minor victims of sex trafficking, providing funding for a period of three years. Additional organizations received DOJ support for the same purpose. The grants were used to provide emergency services to victims before certification by HHS, with some funds now being used for victims post-certification. DOJ's policy change in FY2012 allowed federal funding to support U.S. citizen victims and foreign national victims. The grant aims to provide services to victims of sex and labor trafficking under 18, enhance community response to domestic minor victims, and produce a final report for dissemination. Other HHS and DOJ programs could serve minor victims but did not receive funding before FY2015. The William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 established programs to assist U.S. citizens or LPRs who are victims of sex trafficking or severe forms of trafficking in persons within the United States. It also created a grant program for services to U.S. citizen victims of severe forms of trafficking, but these programs have not received appropriations. The TVPA reauthorization created a grant program to combat sex trafficking of children in the US, which received funding in FY2015. The VAWA Reauthorization Act of 2013 amended grant programs to serve trafficking victims, including programs like Choose Children and Youth Grant Program and Grants to Indian Tribal Governments Program. Other programs outside of TVPA may also provide assistance to minors. In addition to the TVPA grant program, other federal programs like SNAP, SAMHSA, and Job Corps may offer assistance to child trafficking victims in the US. However, the extent of access to these services by victims and awareness among service providers is unknown. An issue is the provision of services to US citizen and lawful permanent resident trafficking victims by federal agencies. The TVPA primarily targeted services towards noncitizen victims who were not eligible for existing federal human service programs available to U.S. citizen and LPR victims. There is disagreement over whether services authorized by the TVPA are available to all victims regardless of citizenship status, with U.S. citizen and foreign national victims being treated differently when identified and offered services. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2005 aimed to address disparities in services provided to U.S. citizen and noncitizen trafficking victims, particularly in cases of commercial sexual exploitation. Federal legislation often focuses on foreign victims, making it challenging for service providers to secure social services for U.S. citizen victims. Congress highlighted concerns with the commercial sexual exploitation of U.S. and LPR children in particular. The United States faces an influx of international and internal trafficking victims, including minors for commercial sexual exploitation. The Committee amended Title II of the bill to address trafficking within the U.S. involving U.S. citizens or residents. There is a concern about U.S. persons being trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation, urging law enforcement to focus on prosecuting exploiters. The U.S. is facing an increase in trafficking victims, including minors, for commercial sexual exploitation. Efforts are being made to prosecute those who exploit others through prostitution and trafficking, with a focus on preventing victimization of U.S. citizens. Funding has been allocated for programs to assist victims of trafficking, including U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents. Funds from the Minor Victims of Human Trafficking program and HHS have been used to support Anti-Human Trafficking and ACT Task Forces. ORR has used HHS funds for certification, victim services, and a public awareness campaign. Services are not provided for U.S. citizens and LPRs due to lack of specific funding from Congress. HHS funding for combating trafficking remained stable until FY2014 when Congress increased appropriations to almost $14 million. Congress directed HHS to allocate a significant portion of the increase to improve services for trafficking victims. The FY2015 Conference report provides $15.7 million to HHS to combat trafficking, with a significant increase allocated for the Victims of Trafficking program to improve services for foreign national trafficking victims. Funding for U.S. citizens and LPRs may be available for benefits and programs under the TVPA authorization. DOJ began funding a grant in FY2009 for U.S. citizen and LPR victims of human trafficking. The grant authorized under 22 U.S.C. \u00a77105(b)(2)(A) does not differentiate between U.S. citizen and noncitizen victims. Funding inconsistencies have been noted, with a policy change in FY2012 allowing federal funding for victim services to support both U.S. citizen and noncitizen trafficking victims. Congress may need to clarify authorities and funding for services to U.S. citizen trafficking victims under the TVPA. Estimates suggest around 14,000 noncitizens are trafficked into the U.S. annually, not including U.S. citizens and LPR victims. The number of child victims of sex trafficking in the U.S. could be in the hundreds of thousands. Funding for victims' services has become an increasing concern, with approximately $58 million appropriated to HHS and DOJ in FY2015, a significant increase from previous years. The State Department's 2013 Trafficking in Persons Report recommends increasing funding for relevant agencies to provide victim services domestically and internationally to combat trafficking effectively. Questions arise about the adequacy of resources for trafficking victims, both citizen and noncitizens, and whether certain victims may face difficulties in obtaining services based on allocated funds. Differences in the needs of U.S. citizen and noncitizen victims are highlighted, with U.S. citizens and LPRs more likely to be victims of sex trafficking and noncitizens of labor trafficking. Sex trafficking victims, especially noncitizens, are more likely to be victims of labor trafficking. The question arises whether funding for trafficking victims should be targeted based on immigration status or the type of trafficking. Social services provide various strategies for child victims of sex trafficking, including direct care, shelter, education, prevention programs, and hotlines for assistance. Services for child victims and survivors of sex trafficking are provided by nongovernmental organizations with support from various entities. A survey found that most organizations offer community-based care, foster care support, and residential care. They have the capacity to serve 1,684 child victims and provide shelter for 226, but this may not be sufficient given the believed higher number of victims. The shelter and services available for child victims of sex trafficking may not reach all those in need, with limited knowledge on their effectiveness. Few evaluations have been conducted on victim support services, leading to a lack of evidence-based practices. However, programs like LIFESKILLS in San Francisco have shown promise in reducing contact with the criminal justice system for participants. The program showed improved outcomes for sexual assault victims and reduced contact with the criminal justice system. However, it had no significant impact on substance abuse, commitment to school, and most measures of victimization. Efforts have been made to identify best practices for serving child victims of trafficking, with recommendations including assessing individual needs, facilitating communication among service providers, and ensuring diverse placement options. The framework for residential facilities for trafficking victims includes tailored treatment plans, access to medical and case professionals, trauma-informed care, and promoting independence. Promising elements for these facilities include serving homogenous populations, smaller settings for easier relationships, and secure environments. Facilities for trafficking victims must be secure with undisclosed locations, security measures, and 24-hour staffing. Services should include basic needs, case management, mental health counseling, medical care, job training, and family reunification support. Child welfare agencies are responsible for promoting safety and well-being of all children, including victims of sex trafficking. Child victims of sex trafficking may be reported to child welfare services, including CPS hotline. Children in foster care are vulnerable to trafficking. State and local agencies may have limited capacity to respond due to inadequate training and resources. Child welfare group homes and foster care settings may not meet the needs of victims or prevent them from traffickers. CPS workers may also play a role in addressing trafficking. Reports of abuse and neglect can be screened and referred for investigation by CPS if they meet the state statutory definition. States receiving grant funds under CAPTA must define \"child abuse and neglect\" consistently with federal definitions. The law also expands on the term \"sexual abuse.\" The law defines \"sexual abuse\" as various forms of exploitation involving children, such as producing child pornography or child prostitution. Some states specify individuals who can be reported as perpetrators to CPS. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act requires state child welfare agencies to respond to concerns about sex trafficking of children in foster care, including those who run away from care. This law aims to address exploitation involving children and specifies individuals who can be reported as perpetrators to CPS. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act mandates state child welfare agencies to develop procedures for identifying and providing services to children at risk of sex trafficking. Agencies must collaborate with various entities and report cases to law enforcement within 24 hours. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act requires state child welfare agencies to report annually to HHS the total number of children and youth who are sex trafficking victims within three years of the law's enactment. Procedures to identify and provide services for victims of sex trafficking must apply to all children under the agency's care, including those in foster care, under age 18, with open case files, receiving services under the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program, and runaway children. Some states have started tracking commercial sexual exploitation and providing specialized foster care services for victims of sex trafficking, including children who are victims of sex trafficking regardless of their relationship to the offender. The Connecticut Department of Children and Families screens in these children and has a specialized team of clinicians to assess their needs. One policy response could be to require state child welfare agencies to screen in reports of commercial sex trafficking, including child prostitution, as a form of sexual abuse, regardless of the perpetrator's relationship to the victim. This could be done through amendments to federal child welfare programs to ensure victims receive necessary services and possible placement in foster care. The National Academy of Sciences recommends improving collaboration across multiple sectors to address child sex trafficking, including federal, state, and local governments, academic institutions, and NGOs. States may struggle to place children in specialized foster or group homes due to limited facilities. The role of the child welfare system in leading the response to child sex trafficking and the potential coordination by the federal government are also key considerations. Through the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, exploited children involved in commercial sexual crimes are to be considered victims. However, there are disparities in labeling these children at state and local levels, with some being treated as criminals rather than victims. This can lead to them being placed in juvenile detention facilities instead of receiving necessary social and protective services. Juvenile detention facilities may not effectively address the needs of sex trafficking victims, as they often provide services unrelated to the issue. This can result in re-victimization and hinder access to appropriate support services for these young individuals. Law enforcement may not always recognize trafficking victims, leading to their involvement in the juvenile justice system instead of receiving necessary assistance. Children who are victims of commercial sexual exploitation may be mistakenly charged with a crime if not identified correctly. They may use fake IDs to hide their identities, making it harder to prosecute pimps. Some officers may charge victims with a crime to place them in a safe environment like a juvenile detention center, as there are limited safe facilities for child victims of sex trafficking. Studies show that many victims end up in juvenile detention centers, highlighting the lack of comprehensive data on the issue. Two studies provide insight into the number of juveniles involved in prostitution incidents. A study using NIBRS data from 76 law enforcement agencies found that 229 juveniles were implicated as offenders in prostitution incidents between 1997 and 2000. Arrests were made in about 74% of these cases, indicating that juveniles were more likely to be treated as offenders than adults. In a study on juvenile prostitution, it was found that juveniles were more often treated as offenders than as victims. They were categorized based on how they were treated by police, with 53% classified as victims, 31% as delinquents, and some as both victims and delinquents. The study on juvenile prostitution found that 69% of juveniles were ultimately classified as victims, while 31% were classified as delinquents. Researchers changed the status to victim only in cases where initial charges were dropped or if the juvenile was charged to receive needed services. There was a strong association between how the case came to the police's attention and how the juvenile was treated by law enforcement. Juveniles reported by family or social service providers were more likely to be treated as victims than those identified through police action. Factors like age, gender, fear, and appearance influenced victim treatment. Congress provides grants for various juvenile justice programs, including counseling, mentoring, and substance abuse prevention. The current text discusses the need to expand juvenile justice grant funding to include services for victims of trafficking. Policy options include researching alternatives to detention for child sex trafficking victims and addressing the labeling of victims as perpetrators. Considerations include providing services for domestic and international victims and whether distinctions should be made. Congress may consider funding programs to train law enforcement and social service providers to recognize trafficking indicators and identify victims. Research is needed to assess the effectiveness of these trainings. Another option is to encourage states to adopt \"safe harbor\" laws to protect minor victims from prosecution and provide specialized services. Under the TVPA, individuals under 18 involved in commercial sex are recognized as victims. Victims of sex trafficking are eligible for specialized services. Victims of sex trafficking are eligible for specialized services, and states are recommended to adopt policies in line with federal laws to protect child victims. The Attorney General must create a model state trafficking statute with safe harbor provisions for individuals under 18 involved in commercial sex. A number of states have started adopting specialized courts to divert at-risk youth, particularly girls at risk of prostitution, from the justice system and provide them with specialized services. Examples include \"Girls Courts\" in California and Hawaii, as well as Human Trafficking Intervention Courts in New York. Policy makers may consider expanding grant programs to support these efforts and creating a separate path of federal support for diversion programs. Efforts to reduce child sex trafficking must address both supply and demand. Factors driving demand include belief in lower disease risk with younger girls and technology facilitating anonymous transactions. Additional research is needed on factors influencing men purchasing sex. Additional research is needed to understand the factors driving men to purchase sex, especially with minors, in order to address the biological, social, and cultural influences on this behavior. Policy makers may need to consider supporting increased research in both private and public domains. Demand reduction strategies recommended by experts include raising public awareness, prevention efforts, and increasing investigations and prosecutions of those buying illegal commercial sex. The federal government has already taken steps to address demand reduction, such as funding a national assessment of sex trafficking reduction efforts. The national assessment of sex trafficking reduction efforts involved sampling over 825 cities and counties with demand reduction programs. Researchers gathered information from 274 sites, finding robust evidence for the effectiveness of demand-reduction tactics compared to other approaches. However, no conclusions were drawn on the effectiveness of specific program models. Policy makers may consider alternative options, such as increasing public awareness through grant funding. Increasing the age of consent in commercial sex activities could reduce the risk of misidentifying minors as adults. Congress may also debate strengthening federal anti-trafficking laws to target buyers of commercial sex with minors, potentially decreasing the demand for such activities. Congress may consider prosecuting buyers of commercial sex across state lines or if they entice victims to do so. Strengthening state laws for harsher penalties and providing funding for investigations could deter individuals from engaging in commercial sex with minors. Studies on sex trafficking, especially involving children in the US, are limited. Estes and Weiner and Shared Hope International provide estimates on child sexual exploitation victims. The TVPA required the Department of Justice to provide demographic information on sex trafficking in reports to Congress, including the number and characteristics of victims, pimps/traffickers, and buyers of sex acts. This information is crucial for understanding the scope of sex trafficking in the United States. The Department of Justice (DOJ) provides demographic information on sex trafficking to Congress, including data on sex acts, the value of the commercial sex economy, and investigations/arrests/incarcerations related to sex trafficking. Approximately 40% of investigations involve children who are sex trafficked, but there is a lack of consensus on estimates of child victims. The National Academy of Sciences discussed studies on child sex trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation, highlighting the need for better prevalence and incidence studies despite challenges like cost. They recommended shifting focus and resources to more targeted counting methods. Estes-Weiner Study estimated over 244,000 at-risk youth in the US for prostitution and trafficking, with many being runaway or abandoned victims turning to prostitution for survival. Estes and Weiner found that 55% of girls on the streets in the US engaged in formal prostitution, with 75% working for a pimp/trafficker. The average age of entry into prostitution was 12-14 for girls and 11-13 for boys. Approximately 156,200 homeless youth in the US were at risk of commercial sexual exploitation. The National Juvenile Prostitution Study in 2005 reported 1,450 arrests and detentions related to juvenile prostitution. The study found 1,450 arrests and detentions for crimes related to juvenile prostitution, with 95% of law enforcement agencies making no arrests in such cases. In larger jurisdictions, 56% of agencies reported no arrests. Researchers suggested that police in larger communities were not addressing the issue adequately. Researchers followed up with agencies that reported arrests, classifying cases into third-party exploiters, solo juveniles, and child sexual abuse cases with payment. The study identified 1,450 arrests and detentions related to juvenile prostitution, with 95% of law enforcement agencies making no arrests. Cases were classified into third-party exploiters, solo juveniles, and child sexual abuse with payment. Most cases involved third-party exploiters profiting from selling juveniles for sex, followed by solo juveniles offering sexual services for money or items of value, and youth engaged in CSA with payment. Shared Hope International conducted a study in 2006 to assess the scope of domestic minor sex trafficking (DMST) in the U.S. The study found that 9 out of 10 youth involved were female, with over half aged 16 or 17. Most had a history of running away, and the study focused primarily on the prostitution of children within U.S. borders. The Ohio Trafficking in Persons Study Commission estimated that nearly 3,000 American-born youth in Ohio were at risk for sex trafficking, with 1,078 Ohio youth estimated to have been affected. The study highlighted the lack of accurate victim counts due to various factors. The Ohio Trafficking in Persons Study Commission estimated that 3,437 foreign-born persons in Ohio were at risk for trafficking, with 783 estimated to be victims. Additionally, 945 homeless youth in Ohio may be at risk for trafficking. Due to the nature of human trafficking, the exact number of victims in Ohio is difficult to determine. The study based on data from the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) from 1997-2000 highlighted differences between juvenile and adult prostitution. Juvenile prostitution was more likely to occur indoors, in large cities, and involve multiple offenders. Male juvenile prostitutes were older and operated outdoors, while law enforcement arrested more males than females for prostitution. Police often viewed juveniles engaged in prostitution as offenders rather than victims. The Trafficking Victim Services for Noncitizens are authorized by the TVPA and provided by DOJ and HHS, primarily targeting noncitizen victims. The TVPA of 2000 created a grant program through DOJ's OVC to develop services for trafficking victims, including emergency services like temporary housing and medical care. The Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) offers emergency services to victims of human trafficking, providing housing, medical care, counseling, and legal assistance before HHS certification. OVC grants support organizations in offering culturally competent services to trafficking victims and enhancing community collaboration for victim support. The program assists pre-certified trafficking victims and allows ongoing support for certified victims since FY2010. OVC and the Bureau of Justice Assistance jointly funded a grant in FY2010 to combat both sex and labor trafficking of foreign and domestic victims. The Bureau of Justice Assistance and the Office for Victims of Crime jointly funded a grant program to combat sex and labor trafficking of foreign and domestic victims. The program supported law enforcement agencies, victim service organizations, and projects aimed at addressing the needs of domestic minor victims of trafficking. The Department supports an advocate position in a nonprofit residential recovery program for prostituted youth and provides funds to the Sexual Assault Resource Center in Portland, OR for services to minor victims of sex trafficking. The Department of Health and Human Services administers grant programs for noncitizen trafficking victims, while the Office of Refugee Resettlement provides grants for victims' services. U.S. citizen victims of trafficking do not receive services from ORR due to lack of specific funding. To receive benefits and services through HHS under the TVPA, victims of severe forms of trafficking must be certified by the Secretary of HHS. Certified victims must assist in the investigation and prosecution of trafficking. ORR provides certification and eligibility letters for victims, with noncitizen victims under 18 receiving eligibility letters. The HHS issues eligibility letters to trafficking victims, including U.S. citizens and LPRs. Once certified, victims may access ORR services for economic and social self-sufficiency in the U.S., including housing, skills training, education, and legal aid. The HHS, through ORR, provides services such as transportation, education, legal assistance, case management, housing, employment support, mental health counseling, and foster care for trafficking victims. These services are not available to U.S. citizen trafficking victims. The Rescue and Restore Victims of Human Trafficking Campaign aims to raise awareness about trafficking, educate the public, and help communities identify and support victims. The HHS funds contracts to intermediary organizations to connect the Rescue and Restore campaign with local service providers, promoting public awareness and aiding in victim identification. Anti-trafficking coalitions, including various professionals and officials, work to identify and assist trafficking victims and educate the public about human trafficking. The Rescue and Restore campaign aims to educate the public about human trafficking and operates a toll-free National Human Trafficking Resource Center. In FY2013, the NHTRC received 20,579 phone calls, including 4,884 cases of human trafficking, with 3,392 involving sex trafficking and 119 involving both sex and labor trafficking. Policy makers and researchers are recognizing commercial child sexual exploitation as a form of human trafficking, with laws and programs addressing the issue. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Runaway and Homeless Youth Program, funded at $114.1 million for FY2015, provides shelter, counseling, and services to runaway and homeless youth who are at risk of becoming victims of sex trafficking. The program includes the Basic Center program (BCP) and Transitional Living program (TLP) to assist youth in need. The Street Outreach program (SOP) provides outreach, education, counseling, and referrals for runaway, homeless, and street youth at risk of sexual abuse and exploitation. Trained workers visit youth on the street to offer these services. The program also funds the National Runaway Safeline (NRS) to keep at-risk youth safe and off the streets with a 24-hour hotline. The National Runaway Safeline (NRS) operates a 24-hour hotline to help runaway and at-risk youth, providing crisis intervention, referrals to resources, and family reunification. Staff are trained on child sexual exploitation issues and provide training to youth and grantees. Training sessions familiarized staff with the work of grantees and developed modules on procedures for trafficked youth, highlighting differences between domestic and foreign victims and emerging service issues. The 2013 strategic plan on services for U.S. victims, outlined by the President's Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, emphasizes the need for greater support and training for runaway and homeless youth providers to identify and aid trafficking victims. HHS is working on efforts to prepare providers in responding to trafficking. The Department of Justice's Missing and Exploited Children's Program, authorized by the Missing Children's Assistance Act, funds efforts to prevent child abduction and exploitation. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children collaborates with the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to achieve the program's objectives. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) collaborates with OJJDP to provide technical assistance to law enforcement agencies in identifying and recovering child sex trafficking victims. NCMEC's Child Sex Trafficking Unit assists in identifying and recovering children victimized by sex trafficking in the United States. They also operate the CyberTipline for reporting child victims of prostitution and enticement. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) collaborates with law enforcement agencies to report child victims of prostitution, sexual enticement, molestation, child pornography, and sex tourism. NCMEC analysts send verified reports to Internet Crimes Against Children Task Forces or local police agencies. The CyberTipline also accepts reports of misleading domain names and unsolicited materials sent to children, which are referred to the Child Exploitation and Obscenities Section (CEOS) of DOJ. The FBI uses CyberTipline reports for their Innocence Lost Project on domestic child trafficking. The majority of reports are for child pornography. The Missing and Exploited Children's program supports the ICAC Task Force program to investigate online child sexual exploitation and provides technical assistance for the AMBER Alert system. It also funds smaller grant programs targeting victims of commercial sexual exploitation. For example, in FY2009, DOJ allocated funding for competitive grant programs addressing commercial sexual exploitation. The MEC program provides funding for initiatives addressing commercial sexual exploitation, including developing policies, conducting research, and providing training and assistance to identify and support victims. Safe Horizon, Inc. was funded to enhance efforts in identifying at-risk youth and providing services for victims. The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) Programs clarified that victim services include assistance to victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking who are also victims of trafficking. Congress amended several VAWA grant programs to specifically serve trafficking victims. The VAWA Programs amended grant programs to serve trafficking victims, including the Choose Children and Youth Grant Program and Grants to Indian Tribal Governments Program."
