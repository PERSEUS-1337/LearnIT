    "content": "The EPA has been evaluating PFAS under the Safe Drinking Water Act to determine if regulations are needed. While no regulations have been issued, the EPA has taken actions to address PFAS contamination. The 116th Congress has passed legislation to address PFAS contamination, including provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 includes PFAS provisions for the Department of Defense and other federal agencies. EPA provisions in Title LXXIII, Subtitle A, direct public water systems to monitor PFAS and establish a grant program for addressing contaminants. H.R. 535, a PFAS bill passed by the House, would regulate PFAS in drinking water and provide grants for treatment technologies. Other bills also aim to address PFAS contamination through regulatory actions under environmental statutes like the Safe Drinking Water Act. The PFAS compounds, including PFOA and PFOS, have been widely used in various applications since the 1940s. Legislation such as H.R. 535 aims to establish regulations for PFAS in drinking water and provide grants for treatment technologies. Manufacturers have phased out some PFAS compounds, but many are still in use today. Since 2002, U.S. manufacturers have phased out production of PFOS and completed the phase-out of PFOA production by 2015 in coordination with the EPA. Food, consumer products, and drinking water are common sources of exposure to PFOA and PFOS. Studies on PFAS health effects have mainly focused on PFOA and PFOS due to their historical use, with animal studies suggesting potential adverse effects on development, liver, immune, and thyroid functions at certain exposure levels. In 2016, EPA reported PFAS contamination in public water systems in 29 states, affecting approximately 5.5 million people. The contamination is linked to various health effects, including developmental effects, changes in liver, immune, and thyroid function, and increased cancer risk. PFAS may have been released from various sources such as manufacturing sites, industrial use, consumer products, landfills, and wastewater treatment facilities. The report discusses PFAS contamination in public water systems, highlighting the health effects and sources of contamination. There is uncertainty regarding health effects from exposure to PFAS above certain levels, leading to challenges for states, water suppliers, and homeowners. Calls have been made for federal leadership to establish drinking water standards for PFAS under the Safe Drinking Water Act. EPA has been evaluating PFAS like PFOA and PFOS for potential drinking water regulations under the SDWA. Despite not having set regulations yet, EPA issued a PFAS Action Plan in February 2019 to address PFAS contamination in public water systems. The EPA's PFAS Action Plan outlines efforts to address PFAS contamination through regulatory actions, public outreach, research on toxicity, water treatment effectiveness, and occurrence data generation. Collaboration with federal, state, and tribal partners is also planned for risk communication and mapping potential PFAS sources. The EPA is working on developing an interactive map on potential PFAS sources and occurrence, along with selected actions and timelines for addressing PFAS in drinking water. Regulating individual substances or categories of PFAS in drinking water poses challenges related to data availability, detection methods, treatment techniques, health effects, and policy considerations. The report provides an overview of EPA's actions to address PFAS under SDWA authorities, focusing on evaluating PFOA and PFOS for potential regulation. It also discusses PFAS-related legislation in the 116th Congress that could amend SDWA, but does not cover scientific research on health effects or federal actions under other environmental statutes like TSCA. The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) provides EPA with authorities to regulate contaminants in public water systems, including issuing health advisories for unregulated contaminants and taking action in the absence of state and local intervention to protect public health. The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) empowers the EPA to regulate contaminants in public water systems by evaluating potential health risks and determining the need for national drinking water regulations based on the presence and health impact of contaminants. EPA must find that a contaminant may have adverse health effects, is likely to occur in public water systems at levels of concern, and requires regulatory action to protect public health. The EPA Administrator regulates contaminants in public water systems to reduce health risks. Every five years, EPA publishes a list of contaminants that may require regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act. In 2009, PFOA and PFOS were placed on the CCL 3 list for evaluation among 116 selected contaminants. EPA evaluates contaminants for regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act every five years. In 2016, CCL 4 continued evaluation of PFOA and PFOS, among other contaminants. EPA conducts a monitoring program for unregulated contaminants to gather national occurrence data. Monitoring rules require testing for up to 30 contaminants, with a focus on smaller water systems. Data from monitoring helps determine the extent of contaminant occurrence in public water supplies. The EPA conducts monitoring programs for unregulated contaminants to gather national occurrence data in public water supplies. The Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCMR) sets minimum reporting levels for contaminants, with monitoring results made available to the public. Small water systems serving 10,000 persons or fewer receive funding for monitoring costs, while large systems cover their own expenses. In 2012, the third UCMR (UCMR 3) included testing for six PFAS, including PFOA and PFOS, with 4,864 public water systems participating between 2013 and 2015. EPA reported monitoring results for PFOA and PFOS, including detections above the minimum reporting levels. The EPA reported monitoring results for PFOA and PFOS in public water systems, with 117 systems detecting PFOA above 20 ppt and 95 detecting PFOS above 40 ppt. Out of 4,864 water systems, 63 reported concentrations exceeding the health advisory level of 70 ppt for PFOA and PFOS, serving approximately 5.5 million individuals. Of these, 9 systems detected both PFOS and PFOA above 70 ppt, 4 detected only PFOA, 37 detected only PFOS, and 13 detected PFOA and PFOS combined above 70 ppt. The EPA's PFAS Action Plan includes monitoring requirements for PFAS in drinking water supplies. EPA has developed an analytical method to detect 29 PFAS and plans to propose monitoring requirements for additional PFAS in UCMR 5 in 2020. EPA is working on developing analytical methods to support monitoring for more PFAS. EPA is required by SDWA to make a regulatory determination every five years for contaminants on the CCL. The EPA must conduct a regulatory determination every five years for contaminants on the CCL. To regulate a contaminant, EPA needs a peer-reviewed risk assessment and occurrence data. Priority is given to contaminants with the greatest public health concern, especially for vulnerable populations. EPA must find that a contaminant may cause adverse health effects, is likely to occur in public water systems at concerning levels, and regulation can reduce health risks. The EPA conducts regulatory determinations every five years for contaminants on the CCL to reduce health risks. EPA may make regulatory determinations for contaminants not listed on the CCL if statutory criteria are met. EPA has issued determinations for CCL 1 through CCL 3, including no regulatory action for certain contaminants. In the most recent determination, EPA found regulation unnecessary for four contaminants on CCL 3 and delayed a decision on strontium for further data review. In 2014, EPA published preliminary regulatory determinations for contaminants on CCL 3, excluding PFAS. In November 2016, PFOA and PFOS were added to the list of unregulated contaminants for RDs. The next round of determinations is set for 2021, with EPA planning to propose determinations for PFOA and PFOS by January 2021. EPA has 24 months to propose a national primary drinking water regulation once a contaminant is determined for regulation under SDWA. The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) allows EPA 24 months to propose a national primary drinking water regulation and establish a non-enforceable maximum contaminant level goal (MCLG) for each regulated contaminant. MCLG is set at a level with no known adverse health effects and incorporates uncertainty factors based on the best available studies. EPA must promulgate a final rule within 18 months after the proposal, with a possible extension of up to nine months. The EPA sets a non-enforceable MCLG for contaminants based on peer-reviewed studies and exposure estimates from various sources. The MCLG serves as the basis for developing drinking water standards. EPA considers the relative source contribution to ensure total exposure remains within safe levels. Water regulation for contaminants depends on peer-reviewed scientific studies. Drinking water regulations set a maximum contaminant level (MCL) for public water supplies. The EPA aims to set the MCL as close to the MCLG as possible, considering treatment technologies and costs. If treatment is not feasible, a treatment technique may be established instead of an MCL. Regulations include monitoring, treatment, and reporting requirements, typically covering multiple contaminants with an MCL for each. Regulations take effect three years after promulgation, with a possible extension of up to two years. The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) allows EPA to review and revise regulations every six years to ensure health protection. Health advisories are issued for unregulated contaminants, providing information on health effects, occurrence, and treatment guidance. EPA may grant extensions for public water systems to make capital improvements. Health advisories set non-enforceable levels of contaminants in drinking water to protect sensitive populations. They help address contaminants without established standards and can be used for interim guidance or short-term incidents. EPA issues health advisories for various reasons. EPA issues health advisories for over 200 contaminants to address different circumstances and has established regulations for many of them. In May 2016, EPA set a Lifetime Health Advisory level of 70 ppt for PFOA and PFOS in drinking water, with a 20% contribution from water and 80% from other sources. These levels aim to protect sensitive populations over a lifetime of exposure, replacing Provisional Health Advisories issued in 2009 for short-term incidents. EPA has emergency powers under SDWA Section 1431 to address imminent public health endangerment from contaminants in water systems. This includes issuing orders for alternative water supplies or contamination treatment. EPA coordinates with states when using this authority. EPA used emergency powers under Section 1431 to address PFOA and/or PFOS contamination at four sites, three involving the Department of Defense. Orders were issued for treatment of drinking water wells at Warminster Naval Warfare Center, Pease Air Force Base, Horsham Air Guard Station/Willow Grove, and Chemours Washington Works Facility. In 2002, 2006, and 2009, EPA issued emergency orders to Chemours Washington Works Facility in West Virginia/Ohio to address PFOA contamination. Legislation in the 116th Congress aims to address PFAS through various actions and federal agencies, including amending the Safe Drinking Water Act to reduce exposures to PFAS in drinking water. In the 116th Congress, legislation aims to address PFAS contamination by amending the Safe Drinking Water Act. Congressional focus has been on setting drinking water standards for PFOA, PFOS, and other PFAS, following a regulatory process that considers technical feasibility, health risks, and costs. Congress has directed EPA to regulate specific contaminants within set time frames to ensure science-based and risk-driven decision-making. Public water systems have cautioned against bypassing SDWA's regulatory process for PFAS. Some stakeholders urge federal leadership for more certainty in regulating drinking water contaminants like PFAS, as state actions may cause public confusion. The NDAA for FY2020 includes PFAS provisions for DOD, EPA, and other federal agencies. The NDAA for FY2020 includes provisions specific to DOD, EPA, and other federal agencies related to PFAS contamination in drinking water. It requires EPA to add PFAS to UCMR 5 and establishes a grant program for water systems to address emerging contaminants, with $100 million annually authorized for FY2020-FY2024. H.R. 535, a broad PFAS bill, passed by the House, includes provisions amending SDWA to address PFAS using multiple authorities. The bill includes provisions to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) to regulate PFAS in drinking water. It requires the EPA to establish national primary drinking water regulations for PFAS, including standards for PFOA and PFOS. The bill also accelerates the regulatory process for PFAS and allows EPA to rely on health risk information for one PFAS to determine regulations for others. Additionally, it prohibits EPA from imposing penalties for violations of PFAS drinking water standards. Section 6 of the bill prohibits EPA from penalizing violations of PFAS drinking water regulations for five years after promulgation. Section 7 establishes a grant program for community water systems to address PFAS contamination, with annual appropriations authorized. EPA must prioritize funding for disadvantaged or disproportionately exposed communities, those providing a cost share, or demonstrating technology maintenance capacity. Other bills in the 116th Congress may require EPA to set maximum contaminant levels for specific PFAS chemicals. Several bills in the 116th Congress would require EPA to establish maximum contaminant levels (MCL) for specific PFAS or PFAS as a group. Some bills also mandate monitoring for PFAS in drinking water by public water systems and authorize grants for treating PFAS in drinking water. Additionally, there is a proposal for PFAS manufacturing fees to support a \"PFAS Treatment Trust Fund\" for grants to water systems and wastewater treatment works for PFAS removal costs."
