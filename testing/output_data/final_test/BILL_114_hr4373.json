The \"End Drunk Driving Act of 2016\" highlights the prevalence of alcohol-impaired driving fatalities in the United States, with first offenders responsible for 75% of arrests. In 2013, there were 10,076 alcohol-impaired driving fatalities. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is working on alcohol detection technologies for vehicles to prevent drunk driving, potentially saving thousands of lives and billions of dollars over a 15-year period. The Secretary must issue a rule within 10 years to prevent drunk driving by implementing technology that stops a vehicle if the operator's blood alcohol content is above the legal limit. The technology must be reliable, accurate, unobtrusive, tamper-proof, work in extreme conditions, and be easily maintained. The funding and plans for a driver alcohol detection system for safety research are outlined in Section 4. Section 403(h) of title 23, United States Code is amended to allocate specific funding amounts for fiscal years 2017 through 2026. The Secretary shall obligate $12,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2017 and 2018, $16,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2019 and 2020, and $20,000,000 for each of years 2021 through 2026. Additionally, the amendment includes outlining the Administration's plans for a driver alcohol detection system for safety research. The Administration's plans to expedite research and development of driver alcohol detection technology are outlined in the amendment to Section 403(h) of title 23, United States Code. SEC. 5. USE OF IGNITION INTERLOCK DEVICES TO PREVENT REPEAT INTOXICATED DRIVING. Sec. 171 of title 23, United States Code, defines alcohol concentration and terms related to intoxicated driving. It sets the limit for blood alcohol concentration while driving as the lesser of the state limit or 0.08 percent. An ignition interlock device requires a breath sample before starting a motor vehicle and prevents it from starting if the driver's alcohol concentration is above 0.08 percent. A motor vehicle is defined as a vehicle primarily used on public highways and excludes vehicles operated on rail lines or commercial vehicles. A State must enforce a law requiring ignition interlock devices on vehicles for 180 days for individuals convicted of driving while intoxicated. The Secretary can withhold funds if the State does not comply with this law. The Secretary can withhold funds from a State if it fails to enforce a law requiring ignition interlock devices on vehicles for individuals convicted of driving while intoxicated. The withheld funds remain available for apportionment to the State until compliance is met. The Secretary can withhold funds from a State until compliance is met with the law requiring ignition interlock devices for individuals convicted of driving while intoxicated. If the State meets the requirements, the withheld funds will be apportioned to the State for expenditure. Funds withheld from a State must be spent within three fiscal years or they will lapse. If the State fails to meet the requirements, the funds will also lapse. The Act defines alcohol-impaired driving as operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content at or above the legal limit, which is 0.08 percent or higher according to federal law."
