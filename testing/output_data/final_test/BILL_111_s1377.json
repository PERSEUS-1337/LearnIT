    "content": "Automatic increase in the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage during national economic downturns. During national economic downturns, the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage is automatically increased to provide assistance to states. This adjustment is made under Section 1905 of the Social Security Act, where the Federal medical assistance percentage for states is determined based on the national economic downturn assistance FMAP. The national economic downturn assistance FMAP is determined based on a trigger quarter where the rolling average unemployment rate increases by at least 10 percent for 23 states. The national economic downturn assistance FMAP is determined based on a trigger quarter with specific criteria for state eligibility during a national economic downturn assistance period. The national economic downturn assistance FMAP is determined based on specific criteria for state eligibility during a national economic downturn assistance period. The FMAP is calculated by increasing the Federal medical assistance percentage for the State with the number of percentage points determined by dividing the Medicaid additional unemployed increased cost amount by the State's total Medicaid quarterly spending amount. The Medicaid additional unemployed increased cost amount is calculated by determining the State's increase in the rolling average number of unemployed individuals from the base quarter of unemployment. This amount is then used to adjust the Federal medical assistance percentage for the State during a national economic downturn assistance period. The Medicaid additional unemployed increased cost amount is calculated by subtracting the rolling average number of unemployed individuals in the State for the base unemployment quarter from the rolling average number of unemployed individuals in the State for the quarter. The State with the lowest rolling average number of unemployed individuals in the 12-month period preceding a national economic downturn assistance period is eligible for assistance. The State with the lowest rolling average number of unemployed individuals in the 12-month period preceding a national economic downturn assistance period will be treated as the base quarter for additional federal Medicaid spending. The federal Medicaid spending amount for each calendar quarter is determined based on the consumer price index increase. The Medicaid spending index is calculated by dividing the State expenditure per person in poverty by the National expenditure per person in poverty, with a maximum value of 1.00. The State expenditure per person in poverty is calculated by dividing the total annual expenditures for medical assistance by the State to nondisabled, nonelderly adults and children by the total number of nonelderly adults and children in poverty in the State. The National expenditure per person in poverty amount is calculated by dividing the total amounts determined for all States by the sum of the total amounts determined for all States. The State's total Medicaid quarterly spending amount is calculated by dividing the total expenditures for medical assistance by the State in the most recent fiscal year by 4. The Secretary uses data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for these determinations. The most recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census is used to determine the number of nonelderly adults and children below the poverty line in each State. Additionally, States report expenditures for medical assistance for nonelderly adults and children to the Secretary. In this subsection, the definition of 'rolling average number of unemployed individuals' and 'rolling average unemployment rate' is provided. The former refers to the average of the 12 most recent months of seasonally adjusted unemployment data for each State in a calendar quarter, while the latter pertains to the unemployment rate in a State for a calendar quarter. The text chunk discusses the calculation of the monthly unemployment rate for a State based on the most recent data available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Additionally, it mentions an increase in the cap on payments to territories during a national economic downturn assistance program. The national economic downturn assistance FMAP percentage applies to certain territories, increasing their amounts determined under specific subsections. This assistance only applies to payments under section 1903 for a quarter and excludes disproportionate share hospital payments. The national economic downturn assistance FMAP percentage applies to certain states, limiting their contributions during economic downturns for Medicaid expenditures. The amendments made by paragraph (1) take effect on January 1, 2012, and no retroactive application is allowed. The Comptroller General of the United States will analyze previous national economic downturn periods, including the most recent one in effect. The Comptroller General of the United States will analyze the effects of temporary increases in the Federal medical assistance percentage under the Medicaid program during national economic downturns. A report with recommendations for improving the national economic downturn assistance FMAP will be submitted to Congress by April 1, 2011. The Comptroller General will analyze the effects of temporary increases in the Federal medical assistance percentage under the Medicaid program during national economic downturns. Recommendations will be made to improve the application of the percentage, address State and regional economic variations, and be more responsive to actual Medicaid costs incurred by States."
