    "content": "GRANTS FOR SALARY DURING SABBATICAL LEAVE: Section 1 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include grants to encourage the use of sabbatical leave for professional development. The Secretary may grant funds to educational agencies for half of an eligible teacher's salary if they complete a study course during a sabbatical term instead of their regular teaching duties. Eligible teachers must be employed at a school providing free public education and have approval from the agency and relevant authorities. Teachers seeking sabbatical leave must obtain approval from the agency and submit an application with proof of enrollment in a study course. They must also assure the agency of their commitment to the course and notify them if they withdraw. Teachers seeking sabbatical leave must obtain agency approval and provide proof of enrollment in a higher education course. They must commit to completing the course, reimburse the agency if they fail to finish, and submit proof of completion within 60 days. The agency selects recipients based on their classroom needs. A sabbatical term is a leave of absence granted to eligible teachers for professional development purposes. It requires enrollment in a higher education course designed to improve teaching through academic and child development studies. Teachers receive half of their salary during the sabbatical term, which lasts not less than one academic semester and not more than one academic year. During a sabbatical term, eligible teachers can receive a leave of absence with half of their salary paid from State or local funds and the other half from Federal funds. Payments are made to teachers as if their regular employment and teaching duties had not been suspended. Any recovered amount must be repaid to the Secretary by the educational agency. The amendment authorizes $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2000 and additional funds for fiscal years 2001 through 2004 to carry out the section. The amendment will be effective starting from fiscal year 2000."
