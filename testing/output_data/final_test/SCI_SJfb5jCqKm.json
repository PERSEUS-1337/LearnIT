A new algorithm is proposed that selectively estimates uncertainty for confident points using earlier model snapshots, outperforming all known methods in extensive experiments. The algorithm provides superior uncertainty estimates compared to existing methods, crucial for applications like autonomous driving and medical diagnosis. Current feasible uncertainty estimation methods for deep learning rely on signals from standard networks, such as softmax responses, entropy, and MC-dropout. The curr_chunk discusses methods like embedding layers and MC-dropout for Bayesian inference using dropout sampling. A recent NIPS paper suggests that an ensemble of softmax response values from multiple networks outperforms other methods. The paper introduces a confidence estimation method to enhance these approaches, highlighting the need for improved confidence scoring in deep classifiers. The curr_chunk discusses the impact of erroneous confidence estimates during the training process with stochastic gradient descent optimizers. It suggests decoupling uncertainty estimation into ordinal ranking and probability calibration tasks. The focus is on improving confidence scoring in deep classifiers. The curr_chunk focuses on enhancing uncertainty estimation for classification tasks by proposing two methods to improve confidence scoring functions for deep neural networks. The first method involves selecting an appropriate early stopped model for each instance to enhance uncertainty estimation. The curr_chunk discusses two methods to improve confidence scoring functions for deep neural networks by selecting early stopped models and formulating a performance measure based on selective prediction concepts. Extensive experiments show consistent improvements over baseline methods, validated with calibrated uncertainty estimates using Platt scaling technique and negative log-likelihood and Brier score measurements. In this work, uncertainty estimation for a supervised multi-class classification problem is considered. Uncertainty is viewed as negative confidence, and terms are used interchangeably. Deep neural classification models with softmax layers are discussed for multi-class classification. The training process of a deep model through T epochs is also mentioned. The training process of a deep model through T epochs involves defining a confidence score function \u03ba(x, i, |f) for multi-class models. The function quantifies confidence in predicting x is from class i based on signals extracted from the model. The vanilla confidence score function for a softmax classifier is \u03ba(x, i|f) = \u2206f(x)i. In the domain of uncertainty estimation, there is no consensus on performance measurement for ordinal estimators. Different studies have used various metrics such as Brier score, negative-log-likelihood, and area under the ROC curve. A new unitless performance measure for confidence estimators is proposed, borrowing elements from existing approaches. This measure requires concepts from selective classification. In the context of uncertainty estimation, a new performance measure for confidence estimators is introduced, utilizing concepts from selective classification. The proposed measure evaluates the performance of a \u03ba function by calculating the area under the risk-coverage curve (AURC) of a selective classifier induced by \u03ba. This measure, termed \"excess AURC\" (E-AURC), normalizes the AURC by subtracting the AURC of the best \u03ba in hindsight, allowing for meaningful comparisons across different problems. The excess AURC (E-AURC) metric is introduced for evaluating \u03ba functions in selective classification. A selective classifier consists of a classifier (f) and a selection function (g), with performance measured by coverage and risk. The risk-coverage curve (RC-curve) can assess the overall performance of a family of selective classifiers optimized for various coverage rates. The text discusses measuring rates using the risk-coverage curve (RC-curve) and defining an empirical performance measure for a confidence score function \u03ba. It introduces the concept of a selective classifier and defines the performance of \u03ba in terms of the area under the (empirical) RC-curve (AURC). A better \u03ba will lead to a better selective classifier that rejects misclassified points first, resulting in a decreasing RC-curve. The RC-curve of classifier f trained on CIFAR-100 dataset shows decreasing risk with coverage. Selective risk increases monotonically with coverage, reaching 0.29 at full coverage. A selective classifier at coverage 0.5 has a risk of 0.06, rejecting half of the points. The RC-curve for the CIFAR100 dataset shows decreasing risk with coverage. A selective classifier at coverage 0.5 has a risk of 0.06, rejecting half of the points. The optimal function yields a zero selective risk at coverage rates below 1 \u2212r(f |V n). The AURC of \u03ba * reaches zero at coverage of 0.71. A unitless performance measure is obtained by normalizing AURC values. The Excess-AURC (E-AURC) is defined as the difference between AURC values, with the optimal \u03ba having E-AURC = 0. In the context of deep neural classification, BID9 introduced the Monte-Carlo dropout (MC-dropout) technique for uncertainty estimation in DNNs. MC-dropout calculates uncertainty at test time by analyzing variance statistics from multiple dropout-enabled forward passes. Confidence scores for DNNs are commonly obtained by measuring the classification margin, where large values indicate high confidence levels. This concept is widely used in classification with a reject option in linear models and SVMs. The BID4 and BID5 proposed a new approach for neural networks, outperforming MC-dropout on ImageNet. BID20 introduced a K-nearest-neighbors algorithm in the embedding space of DNNs. BID17 proposed an ensemble-based uncertainty score for DNNs, which requires large computing resources for training but shows significant improvement. The literature on ensemble methods for neural networks is sparse. BID14 and BID15 proposed ensemble techniques using fully converged models, while our method utilizes \"premature\" ensemble members before convergence. Our method utilizes \"premature\" ensemble members for classification performance, different from fully converged models. An example is presented using a deep classification model trained over epochs, monitoring softmax response quality on a validation set to assess confidence estimation. Instances in the validation set are grouped based on confidence assessment using softmax response values. The softmax response values in a deep classification model are used to group points in Vn into green (high confidence) and red (low confidence) categories. Green points are accurately classified earlier in training, stabilizing around Epoch 80, while red points lag behind in correct classification. The confidence scores of green points improve early on, while red points continue to improve throughout training. Intermediate classifiers like f 130 provide the best confidence estimation for green points, while the final model f [T] performs poorly in this regard. The confidence estimates for red points improve as training progresses, while green points show poor estimation by the final model. A proposed algorithm suggests using early stopping to find the best snapshot for uncertainty estimation. The algorithm presented is for confidence scoring in deep neural classifiers, utilizing a labeled training sample and an approximated version that does not require additional training examples. It involves a neural classifier trained using SGD variants for T epochs, with a set of intermediate models obtained during training. The Pointwise Early Stopping (PES) algorithm is used for confidence scores. The Pointwise Early Stopping (PES) algorithm for confidence scores operates by extracting the most uncertain points from a set V, determining the size of the layer with a hyperparameter q, finding the best model in F, and estimating confidence using the E-AURC measure. The best performing confidence score and threshold are saved for test time. The Pointwise Early Stopping (PES) algorithm extracts uncertain points from set V, determines layer size with hyperparameter q, finds best model in F, and estimates confidence using E-AURC measure. Best performing confidence score and threshold saved for test time. Algorithm produces partition of X with layers from least to highest confidence. Computational complexity of PES algorithm is intensive and requires additional labeled examples. Averaged Early Stopping (AES) is a simple approximation of PES for \"easy\" points learned earlier. The Averaged Early Stopping (AES) algorithm is a simplified version of the Pointwise Early Stopping (PES) algorithm. It leverages the observation that \"easy\" points are learned earlier during training. By summing the area under the learning curve, AES avoids inaccurate confidence assessments. The output \u03ba is the average of \u03bas associated with models saved during training. AES works well and is used in most experiments due to the computational burden of PES. The AES algorithm is applied to four confidence scores: softmax response, NN-distance BID20, MC-dropout BID9, and Ensemble BID17. Performance is evaluated on four image datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and Imagenet. Results are presented in Table 4, with each dataset having four rows for baseline methods. The AES algorithm is applied to different confidence scores on various image datasets. Results show E-AURC values reflecting the difficulty level of the learning problems, with Imagenet having the largest values. Among 42 experiments, the method consistently outperformed the baseline in 39 cases and reduced E-AURC when using AES with k = 30. The ensemble estimation approach of BID17 is currently the best among baselines and state-of-the-art for each dataset. While computationally intensive, the ensemble method and AES improvements achieve the best results, highlighting the importance of identifying top-performing baselines based on a single classifier. In CIFAR-10, the best single-classifier method is softmax response, improved by AES. NN-distance shows poor performance but is enhanced by AES. In CIFAR-100, NN-distance is the top method, improved by AES. AES with Platt scaling is compared to baseline methods on various datasets. Platt scaling is applied on AES algorithm results with k = 30, compared to independently scaled measures. Performance is evaluated using NLL and Brier score BID2. Results show consistent probability scaling with raw uncertainty estimates. AES improves calibrated probabilities of uncertainty measures. PES algorithm implemented over SR method for datasets, requiring independent training set split from validation set. The original validation set was split into two parts, with 70% used for training and 30% for validation. E-AURC values for the Pointwise Early Stopping algorithm (PES) were compared to softmax response (SR) on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN datasets. The time complexity of PES with NN-distance is nmT k, and with MC-dropout scores is O(dT C f). For n = 7000, T = 250, and d = 100, this results in 175,000,000 forward passes. The PES algorithm significantly reduced the E-AURC of softmax on all datasets, with the best improvement seen on CIFAR-100. The algorithm requires an additional labeled set and expensive computational resources. The results of the AES algorithm motivate further research to improve its efficiency. The presented algorithm requires additional labeled data and computational resources for training. The approximated version (AES) is simple and scalable, improving confidence scores on all evaluated datasets. Both PES and AES utilize snapshot models generated during training to overcome confidence score deformations. Future research could focus on developing a loss function to prevent deformations while maintaining high performance and incorporating distillation to reduce inference time. Another approach is to approximate PES using a single model per instance based on early stopping. Inference time is approximated using a single model per instance based on an early stopping criterion. Different methods such as Softmax Response, NN-distance, MC-dropout, Ensemble, and Platt scaling are implemented for uncertainty estimation. Extensions like embedding regularization and adversarial training are not included to avoid performance degradation. Platt scaling is applied to calibrate confidence measures from a validation set using logistic regression. The calibration is validated by splitting the test set into training and test subsets. Performance is evaluated using negative log likelihood and Brier score. Experiments for AES with softmax response and NN-distance are presented with standard errors. In Section 5, the method is motivated by dividing the domain X into \"easy points\" and \"hard points\". It is shown that \"easy points\" exhibit a phenomenon similar to overfitting during training. This observation drives the strategy to extract information from early training stages to improve uncertainty estimates for the easy points. The demonstration is extended to MC-dropout and NN-distance methods. In Figures 3 and 4, plots for MC-dropout and NN-distance show overfitting, with MC-dropout exhibiting it to a lesser extent. Results are consistent with AES algorithm, where E-AURC improvement over MC-dropout was smaller. NN-distance shows overfitting affecting easy points slightly and hard instances severely. Correction strategy proposed is potentially useful for all three cases."
