    "content": "The \"S Corporation Investment Act of 1995\" allows S corporations to have up to 40 shareholders, an increase from the previous limit of 35 shareholders. Additionally, family members are treated as one shareholder under this act. Paragraph (1) of section 1361(c) is amended to treat family members as one shareholder in an S Corporation, including husbands, wives, and their estates, as well as lineal descendants of a common ancestor. The amended section 1361(c) treats family members as one shareholder in an S Corporation, including spouses, lineal descendants of a common ancestor, and their spouses. An individual is not considered a common ancestor if they are more than 4 generations removed from the youngest generation of shareholders. Adoption and other relationships are determined according to the rules of section 152(b)(2). An election under subparagraph (A)(ii) can be made. An election under subparagraph (A)(ii) in section 1361(c) requires the consent of all shareholders, remains in effect until terminated, and applies to only 1 family in any corporation. SEC. 4. INCREASE IN PASSIVE INCOME PERMITTED. The percentage of passive investment income allowed is increased from 25% to 40%. This change also applies to former C corporations. SEC. 5. REINVESTMENT RESERVE. An election under section 1361(c) requires shareholder consent and applies to only 1 family in any corporation. SEC. 5. REINVESTMENT RESERVE. Part III of subchapter S of chapter 1 is amended to include a new section called \"SEC. 1376. REINVESTMENT RESERVE.\" In the case of an S corporation, a deduction is allowed for payments made to a reinvestment reserve, limited to 3 percent of taxable income. The corporation must establish a reinvestment reserve, with earnings from investments not taxed, for future use. The reinvestment reserve for an S corporation is used for acquiring tangible property for business purposes. Contributions to the reserve must be deductible payments. Any distributions from the reserve are taxable income for the corporation. Amounts not withdrawn within 3 years are subject to specific treatment. The reinvestment reserve within a 3-year period is treated as distributed at the end of the period. Any deemed distributions are taxed at the highest marginal rate, with the amount excluded from gross income and subject to a tax equal to the highest rate specified in section 1. Certain rules apply to these distributions. The rules of subparagraphs (B) and (C) of paragraphs (5) and (6) of section 7518(g) apply for this paragraph. A taxpayer is deemed to have made a payment to the reinvestment reserve on the last day of a taxable year if the payment is made within 2 1/2 months after the close of the taxable year. SEC. 1376 establishes a reinvestment reserve. The amendments in this Act will be effective for taxable years starting after the enactment date."
