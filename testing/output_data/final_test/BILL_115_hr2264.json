It establishes a program to designate and support manufacturing communities. The Secretary will establish a program to improve US manufacturing competitiveness by designating consortiums as manufacturing communities and supporting them through a competitive process. Eligible consortiums represent defined regions. The program aims to enhance US manufacturing competitiveness by selecting consortiums as manufacturing communities through a competitive process. Consortiums must include various entities like higher education institutions, private sector entities, and government entities. The program selects consortiums for manufacturing communities to enhance US manufacturing competitiveness. Consortiums must include entities like higher education institutions, private sector entities, and government entities, including district organizations, Indian tribes, or States engaged in economic or infrastructure development activities. The program selects consortiums for manufacturing communities to enhance US manufacturing competitiveness. Consortiums may include higher education institutions, private sector entities, government entities, and nonprofit organizations supported by a State, political subdivision, or native community. Consortiums can define their represented region if it is large enough to contain critical infrastructure. The program selects consortiums for manufacturing communities based on key technologies or supply chain elements. Designations are for two years and can be renewed for up to two additional two-year periods. The Act allows for renewals of consortium designations by submitting an application to the Secretary with any necessary modifications. The Act allows for renewals of consortium designations by submitting an application with necessary modifications. The Secretary evaluates the consortium based on performance against previous terms and project-specific metrics proposed in the application. An eligible consortium seeking a designation under paragraph (1) must submit an application with modifications, including metrics for tracking progress, potential changes to consortium composition, and other criteria deemed appropriate by the Secretary. An eligible consortium seeking a designation under paragraph (1) must submit an application to the Secretary with details on regional boundaries, manufacturing concentration, and competitive ranking nationally. The eligible consortium must submit an application to the Secretary with details on regional boundaries, manufacturing concentration, and competitive ranking nationally. The application should include an integrated assessment of the local industrial ecosystem, workforce and training, supplier network, research and innovation, infrastructure development, trade, international investment, operational improvements, and capital access components needed for manufacturing activities in the region. Additionally, an evidence-based plan for developing components of the ecosystem should be included in the application. The consortium must provide a description of the investments and implementation strategy to address gaps in the ecosystem, along with outcome-based metrics and evaluation methods to track progress. The consortium must demonstrate regional cooperation and competitive manufacturing ranking nationally in their application. Support for Designated Manufacturing Communities includes preferential consideration for members of designated consortia seeking assistance. Previously recognized manufacturing communities will retain their designation under new initiatives. When a manufacturing community seeks assistance, the head of the agency may prioritize them if it aligns with the economic strategy and all requirements are met. Other federal agencies may also be invited to participate in the program. The Manufacturing Community Support Program invites other Federal agencies to participate. Participating agencies must identify relevant programs. If multiple consortium members seek the same assistance, the agency will prioritize based on criteria. The head of a participating agency in the manufacturing community program can determine how preference is given to consortium members for financial or technical assistance. Coordination may be required among consortium members if multiple members are eligible for preference. The Manufacturing Community Support Program allows the head of a participating agency to provide financial or technical assistance to consortium members. The agency must submit a report to the Secretary outlining how preferential consideration will be given to consortium members. Additionally, a Federal point of contact may be available to help consortium members access funds and technical assistance. The Manufacturing Community Support Program allows the head of a participating agency to award financial or technical assistance to a consortium designated as a manufacturing community for improving US manufacturing competitiveness through investments in infrastructure. The Manufacturing Community Support Program aims to improve US manufacturing competitiveness through investments in infrastructure, access to capital, promotion of exports and foreign direct investment, equipment upgrades, workforce training and recruitment, energy efficiency, business incubators, site preparation, advanced research, supply chain development, and small business assistance. The Secretary of Commerce coordinates with participating agencies to identify programs for small business assistance. Participating agencies coordinate to leverage complementary activities and avoid duplication of efforts. The Secretary may accept transferred funds from other agencies to carry out this section."
