Congressional interest in these programs has grown due to their potential to stimulate economic activity and create jobs. The Small Business Administration (SBA) aims to aid small-business concerns, promote job creation, and strengthen the economy by ensuring government contracts are awarded to small businesses. The SBA gathers data from clients to support these goals. The SBA collects data on job creation and retention from its clients, referred to as \"jobs supported.\" Economists debate the effectiveness of federal assistance in creating jobs, suggesting it may reallocate rather than increase them. Economic research suggests that increased federal spending on small business assistance programs may lead to more jobs in the short term. Startups are crucial for job creation, but less than half are still in business after five years, with startups with fewer than 20 employees having a minimal impact on net job creation over time. Startups with 20-499 employees have a positive employment effect, as do surviving younger businesses of all sizes. Providing SBA assistance, such as guaranteed loans or venture capital, to startups is seen as a high-risk, high-reward endeavor. Critics point to the risk of default, citing the SBIC Participating Securities program as an example. The SBA created the SBIC Participating Securities program for equity investments in startup and early stage small businesses to address an investment gap. However, major losses led to the program's discontinuation in 2004. This report examines startups' experiences with SBA's management and technical assistance programs. The SBA offers various lending programs, including 7(a), 504/CDC, and Microloan programs, as well as the SBIC venture capital program. The agency also provides support through the growth accelerators initiative and the now sunset SBIC early stage debenture program. These programs aim to assist small businesses at all stages of development, with a focus on providing training, loans, and venture capital. The SBA offers various lending programs and support initiatives to assist small businesses at all stages of development. The agency collects data on the impact of these programs, with most participants reporting them as useful. However, the cost effectiveness of these programs is difficult to determine due to data limitations. The SBA has provided management and technical assistance training to small businesses since 1953, initially through its own programs and now increasingly through third parties. Over 1.5 million entrepreneurs receive training annually from SBA-supported partners. The SBA believes this training contributes to long-term success, job creation, and growth of small businesses. Financial support is provided to about 14,000 resource partners, including lead SBDCs. The SBA provides financial support to approximately 14,000 resource partners, including lead SBDCs, WBCs, and SCORE chapters. These programs offer training assistance to small businesses at all stages of development, with SBDC clients typically being larger in terms of revenue and employment. WBC clients are more likely to be female. SBDCs, hosted by universities and state agencies, provide management and technical assistance to small businesses and entrepreneurs. Services are offered on a nonfee basis through lead service centers across the US and territories. In FY2017, SBDCs assisted 245,329 clients and formed 14,491 new businesses. In FY2017, WBCs provided financial, management, and marketing assistance to small businesses owned by women, serving 114,310 clients with technical assistance and 26,318 clients with counseling. They helped form 17,438 new businesses. SCORE, a volunteer organization, offered management and technical assistance to small business owners, assisting 519,368 clients with training and 126,892 clients with counseling. They also aided in the formation of 54,027 new businesses. In addition to providing services to clients, the SBA's Office of Entrepreneurial Development conducts an annual survey to assess the impact of their programs on small businesses. The survey includes questions about the programs' effects on staffing decisions and management practices. The survey is sent to clients participating in SBDC, WBC, and SCORE programs, with responses from nascent, startup, and in-business clients. The 2012 survey conducted by the SBA's Office of Entrepreneurial Development included responses from 8,263 SBDC clients, 7,217 SCORE clients, and 340 WBC clients. The survey data showed that the programs assisted small businesses at all stages of development, with most respondents finding the assistance useful and resulting in changes to their management practices. However, few reported that the assistance led to hiring new staff, retaining staff, or increasing profit margins. The survey data conducted by the SBA's Office of Entrepreneurial Development showed that clients receiving three or more hours of counseling, female clients, startups, and clients owning relatively large small businesses were more likely to report positive financial impact. SBDCs, WBCs, and SCORE served businesses at all stages of development, with a significant percentage being nascent or startup clients. The survey conducted by the SBA's Office of Entrepreneurial Development found that SBDC, WBC, and SCORE clients rated the information received from counselors as extremely useful or useful. Additionally, more than half of SBDC and SCORE startup clients reported changing their management practices after receiving SBA training. The survey found that WBC startup clients changed their management practices as a result of the assistance received, with slightly higher percentages than in-business clients. Additionally, a small percentage of clients agreed that the training helped them retain current staff. The survey showed that SBA management and technical assistance training enabled clients to hire new staff and had a positive impact on profit margins. Growth accelerators help entrepreneurs access capital, mentors, and networking opportunities for business growth. The SBA hosted regional events in 2012 with universities and accelerators to support high-growth entrepreneurs. The Obama Administration requested $5.0 million for the SBA's growth accelerator initiative, but Congress recommended $2.5 million for FY2014. The SBA proposed using funding for matching grants to universities and accelerators to start or scale accelerator programs. Initially requesting $25 million for five years with a 4:1 private-sector match, they later dropped the match requirement due to budget constraints. In May 2014, 50 growth accelerator grants of $50,000 each were announced, receiving over 800 applications. Congress recommended funding of $4.0 million for FY2015 and $1.0 million for FY2016-2018. The SBA received funding of $4.0 million in FY2015 and $1.0 million in FY2016-2018 for the growth accelerators program. A total of 168 grants were awarded, supporting over 1,000 small businesses and creating or retaining nearly 4,800 jobs. The Trump Administration did not request funding for FY2018 and FY2019. The SBA's business lending programs aim to help small businesses access financing. Small firms may struggle to obtain loans due to their size, age, and innovative products. Government programs may be needed to address this market failure. The SBA's loan programs aim to improve small businesses' access to credit. In FY2018, the SBA approved $30.2 billion in loans, with the 7(a) program accounting for $25.4 billion and the 504/CDC program for $4.8 billion. The Microloan program provided $76.8 million in loans to small businesses, including startups. The SBA's 7(a) loan program provides guaranty of repayment to certified lenders for business loans to American small businesses. The guaranty amount ranges from 85% for loans up to $150,000 to 75% for loans exceeding $150,000, up to a limit of $5 million. Proceeds can be used for various business purposes such as establishing a new business, acquiring assets, financing working capital, and refinancing certain expenses. The SBA's 504/CDC loan program provides long-term fixed rate financing for major fixed assets, such as land, buildings, equipment, and machinery. It cannot be used for working capital or inventory. The program is administered through nonprofit CDCs, with a third-party lender providing at least 50% of the financing, the CDC providing up to 40% backed by a 100% SBA-guaranteed debenture, and the applicant providing at least 10% of the financing. The SBA's debenture is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. The SBA's 504/CDC program involves selling debentures backed by the full faith and credit of the United States to underwriters who form debenture pools. Investors purchase interests in these pools and receive certificates representing ownership. The SBA guarantees timely payment of the debenture, and pays the investor if the small business falls behind on loan payments. Borrowers must meet specified economic development objectives, such as creating or retaining jobs. Borrowers in the SBA's 504/CDC program must create or retain jobs based on project debenture amounts. Small manufacturers must create or retain jobs at a different rate. Job creation can be outside the project facility, but 75% must be in the project's community. If job creation is not met, borrowers can meet community development or public policy goals to retain eligibility. The SBA's Microloan program, authorized in 1991, aims to assist small businesses in gaining access to capital, particularly women, low-income, veteran, and minority entrepreneurs. The program became permanent in 1997 and provides loans for projects in special geographic areas. The Microloan program aims to assist small businesses, particularly women, low-income, veteran, and minority entrepreneurs, by providing loans up to $50,000 for working capital and materials. The program also offers grants for intensive marketing, management, and technical assistance to borrowers. The Microloan program provides loans up to $50,000 for working capital and materials. Loans cannot be used to acquire land or property and must be repaid within six years. Interest rates range from 7% to 9%, and borrowers are required to provide collateral and a personal guarantee. The SBA does not review the loan for creditworthiness. Each intermediary lender sets its own lending and credit requirements. The SBA provides lending support to small businesses through various programs, including Microloan, 7(a), and 504/CDC. Data shows that the Microloan program lends more to startups than the other programs. Borrowers report on the loans' impact on job creation and retention, with generally positive results. However, the data are self-reported and have limitations. The SBA's Microloan program provides a higher percentage of loan proceeds to startups compared to the 7(a) and 504/CDC programs. The SBA has two venture capital programs, including the flagship SBIC program and the smaller New Markets Venture Capital Program. The SBA sponsors the New Markets Venture Capital Program to promote economic development in low-income areas by addressing small businesses' equity investment needs. The SBA partners with privately owned SBICs to provide financing with private and borrowed funds. As of September 30, 2018, there were 305 licensed SBICs participating in the program. SBICs in the program can apply for financial assistance of up to 300% of their private capital, but historically, the SBA has approved up to 200%. Each SBIC can leverage up to $175 million, or $350 million for multiple licenses. SBICs invest in various industries, stages of investment, and geographic areas, providing equity capital through different means. The Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program provides financing to small businesses through equity securities, loans, debt securities, and guarantees. The program has invested or committed about $30.1 billion in small businesses, with the SBA's share of capital at risk around $14.3 billion. In FY2018, the SBA committed to guarantee $2.52 billion in SBIC small business investments, with an additional $2.98 billion from private capital for a total of $5.50 billion in financing for 1,151 small businesses at all developmental stages. The SBIC program provides financing to small businesses at all stages, with a focus on startups. The amount of SBIC financing for startups has increased since FY2014. The early stage debenture SBIC initiative was established in 2012 to encourage investments in startups. Early stage debenture SBICs must invest at least 50% of their financing in early stage small businesses. The early stage debenture SBIC initiative, established in 2012, aims to reduce risk for investments in startups by implementing new regulatory provisions. Early stage debenture SBICs are required to raise at least $20 million in regulatory capital and have special distribution rules for SBA leverage repayment. They are provided with less leverage (up to $50 million maximum) compared to debenture SBICs. The SBA's early stage debenture SBIC initiative, established in 2012, aims to reduce risk for investments in startups. Five out of 63 investment funds have been granted an early stage SBIC license, raising $246.9 million as of September 30, 2016. The SBA issued Green Light letters to six funds in October 2012, inviting them to file license applications. Subsequent annual calls for venture capital fund managers to apply took place in December 2012, February 2014, January 2015, and February 2016. The early stage SBIC initiative, established in 2012, aims to reduce risk for investments in startups. By September 30, 2016, 5 SBICs had raised $246.9 million in private capital, invested $160.7 million in 62 small businesses, and received $78.0 million in SBA-guaranteed leverage. In FY2016, $66.2 million was invested in 45 small businesses. Proposed changes were made to attract more qualified fund managers, but new applications were stopped in 2017 under the Trump Administration. The SBA proposed rule in September 2016 to encourage qualified SBICs to participate in the Early Stage SBIC initiative. Few funds applied, leading to the decision to stop new applications. The impact on SBA financing for startups is uncertain. The SBA's mission includes assisting small businesses, but it also supports all qualifying small businesses. The SBA has traditionally provided assistance to all qualified small businesses without focusing solely on startups that could contribute to job growth or wealth creation. This aligns with the SBA's mission to promote free markets and prevent monopoly formation. Recent initiatives to assist startups have not significantly challenged this tradition. The SBA's recent initiatives to assist startups, such as the early stage debenture SBIC initiative, recognize the potential role of startups in job creation. These programs are seen as supplements to existing programs rather than replacements. While some view the \"high risk-high reward\" nature of targeting SBA assistance to startups as controversial, most participants find the programs useful. However, limited data makes it difficult to determine if the risk of financial losses outweighs the potential job growth from these programs. The impact of programs on economic activity and job creation is limited and faces methodological challenges in measuring their reliability."
