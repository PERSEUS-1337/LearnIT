The \"Alien Child Protection and Deferred Enforced Departure Family Unity Act of 2000\" allows for the adjustment of status for certain aliens to permanent residence, as long as they meet specific criteria and are not inadmissible under certain grounds. Aliens present in the United States who have been ordered excluded, deported, or removed may apply for adjustment of status without needing to file a motion to reopen the order. If the application is granted, the order will be canceled; if denied, the order remains in effect. This provision applies to any eligible alien under the Alien Child Protection and Deferred Enforced Departure Family Unity Act of 2000. Aliens under 12 years old, physically present in the US, and with no living parent can apply for a stay of deportation. The Attorney General can allow them to seek a stay of removal based on an application. If an alien raises eligibility as a defense during deportation proceedings, they cannot be removed from the US. Aliens under 12 years old, physically present in the US, and with no living parent can apply for a stay of deportation. The Attorney General can allow them to seek a stay of removal based on an application. If an alien raises eligibility as a defense during deportation proceedings, they cannot be removed from the US. The Attorney General shall provide applicants for adjustment of status with the same right to administrative review as applicants under the Immigration and Nationality Act. When an alien is granted permanent residence status, the Secretary of State is not required to reduce the number of immigrant visas available. The Immigration and Nationality Act provisions apply to the administration of this section. The Attorney General's powers in immigration enforcement are not affected by this Act. Eligibility for permanent residence status under this section does not prevent seeking status under other laws. Deferred enforced departure is granted to alien parents of children born in the United States who are under 18 years of age. Deferred Enforced Departure allows alien parents of children under 18 born in the US to defer removal or enforced departure by the Attorney General if they apply for deferral, regardless of any previous orders under the Immigration and Nationality Act. Aliens eligible for Deferred Enforced Departure can file a motion to reopen, reconsider, or vacate an order. If the Attorney General grants the application, the order will be canceled. If the application is denied, the order remains effective. The benefits apply to aliens physically present in the US who are parents of a child under 18 born in the US. The Attorney General will provide regulations for aliens subject to a final deportation order. Regulations allow aliens with a final deportation order to seek a stay based on an application. The Attorney General cannot order removal if the alien is in proceedings and raises eligibility for adjustment of status, unless the application is denied. Administrative review is available for applicants of deferred enforced departure. The Attorney General provides deferred enforced departure applicants with the right to administrative review and work authorization in the United States during the application process. If the application is pending for over 180 days without denial, employment authorization is granted. During deferred enforced departure, the Attorney General allows aliens to work in the US. The Immigration and Nationality Act provisions apply, and the Attorney General's powers remain unaffected. Aliens granted deferred enforced departure status can still seek immigration status under other provisions of law."
