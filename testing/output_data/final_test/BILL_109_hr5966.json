    "content": "The \"Child Soldier Prevention Act of 2006\" may be cited as such. Congress finds that in the last decade, two million children have been killed in armed conflict, while six million have been disabled or injured. Over 250,000 children are exploited as child soldiers and tens of thousands of girls are subjected to sexual violence. The Child Soldier Phenomenon has spread to every continent except Antarctica and Australia. Many child soldiers are forcibly recruited through kidnapping or coercion, while others join out of economic necessity or personal safety. Some are forced to commit gruesome acts by military commanders. Female child soldiers often face rape, sexual abuse, and social stigma. Children are targeted for recruitment due to their psychological immaturity. Child soldiers, often separated from their families, suffer trauma and require counseling. They face hazardous conditions, physical and psychological risks, and death. The UN's Optional Protocol sets 18 as the minimum age for conscription. On June 18, 2002, the Senate unanimously approved the resolution for the ratification of the Optional Protocol, which was presented to the United Nations on December 23, 2002. One hundred and six governments worldwide have ratified the protocol, establishing a clear international norm against using children in combat. It is in the national and security interests of the United States to reduce the chances of encountering children in combat situations. The President is directed to conduct international security assistance programs promoting human rights and avoiding association with governments violating human rights. In this Act, a \"child soldier\" is defined as a person under 18 who is forcibly recruited or serving in hostilities in an armed force or group. It also includes anyone under 16 serving in any capacity in such groups. Congress condemns the conscription, forced recruitment, or use of children in hostilities. It is the sense of Congress that the US should support international standards to end this practice and provide rehabilitation services for recovered child soldiers. The United States should work with the international community to bring rebel organizations that kidnap children for use as child soldiers to justice, including the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) in Uganda, Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC), and the Communist Party of Nepal (CPN). This includes efforts to arrest the leaders of such groups and recover abducted children. United States diplomatic missions in countries with child soldiers should develop strategies to end the use of children in hostilities. They should prioritize programs and candidates that work towards this goal when allocating funds or recommending candidates for grants. SEC. 5. PROHIBITION. None of the funds appropriated for international military education and training, foreign military financing, foreign military sales, direct commercial sales, or excess defense articles may be used by countries identified as using child soldiers. The Secretary of State must notify any government identified as using child soldiers by March 15 each year. The President can waive the prohibition for a country if it is in the national interest of the United States, with each waiver published in the Federal Register and reported to relevant congressional committees. The President may reinstate assistance to a country prohibited under subsection (a) upon certification to Congress that the country is complying with the standards of the Act and implementing policies to prevent child soldiers. There is an exception for programs directly related to addressing the issue of child soldiers. The President may provide assistance for international military education and training to a country, prohibited under subsection (a), if it directly supports addressing the problem of child soldiers. This exception is limited to two years after notification to Congress. The Under Secretary for Democracy and Global Affairs leads on child soldier issues, advising the President and Secretary of State on policies towards governments using child soldiers and promoting their end in conflicts worldwide. They also prepare and submit required reports. The Secretary of State ensures consistent reporting and investigation of child soldier use abroad. The Under Secretary for Democracy and Global Affairs assists in preparing annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices related to child soldiers, including trends in their status. The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Under Secretary for Democracy and Global Affairs, determines violations of the standards of the Act regarding the use of child soldiers. The President must submit annual reports to Congress by June 15 each year. The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Under Secretary for Democracy and Global Affairs, determines violations of the standards of the Act regarding the use of child soldiers. The President must submit annual reports to Congress by June 15 each year.
