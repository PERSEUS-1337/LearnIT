    "content": "This paper reveals a universal pattern in neural network training, showing a one-to-one relationship between different types of losses across various architectures and algorithms. Despite the progress in using neural networks for tasks in machine learning, there is still a lack of understanding in their behavior due to the vast variation in deep learning models. The current paper proposes that despite the diverse structures of deep learning models like VGG, Resnet, and Densenet, there are similarities in their behavior during training. Training curves for different loss functions overlap across these models, indicating a universal pattern in neural network training. The paper suggests that despite diverse structures, deep learning models exhibit similar behavior during training. This universal pattern in neural network training is exciting as it allows for understanding different networks through a single approach. The setup, definitions, and experimental results are presented in different sections of the paper. The canonical basis for R K is represented as {e i , . . . , e K } where e ij = 1 if i = j else e ij = 0. The goal in learning a classifier is to map input space X to class labels [K]. The classifier C \u03b8 (x) maps input x to a class label in [K]. Training the network is a minimization problem over parameters \u03b8 with commonly used training loss functions. The paper discusses the differences between loss functions such as MSE and CE, and how they affect the training process of a neural network. It highlights the uniqueness of a function that relates the values of different loss functions during training runs. The paper discusses the uniqueness of a function f(\u00b7) that relates different loss functions during training runs for neural networks. This function is universal across various network architectures, training loss functions, and algorithms. The existence and monotonic nature of this function are surprising from a theoretical perspective. The paper discusses the surprising monotonic nature of a universal function that relates different loss functions in neural network training. Various architectures, datasets, training losses, and algorithms were considered, including MLP, VGG, Resnet, Densenet, and Fully Connected models, with different loss functions and training algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent. The study explores the training of neural networks using two algorithms, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and SGD with momentum (SGDm), with a batch size of 512 and a constant learning rate. The models are trained for 150-250 epochs on a fixed dataset, aiming to minimize the empirical classification error. The behavior of training surrogate losses and classification errors is observed, showing overlapping trends. However, this behavior does not extend to the test data. The study compares training surrogate loss and classification error trends between training algorithms SGD and SGDm on CIFAR-10 and IMAGENET-20 datasets. Results show a lack of overlap in trends for CIFAR-10 but a universal behavior for IMAGENET-20, prompting further exploration of universality patterns in test data. The study also examines trends across different random initializations of network parameters and different training algorithms, revealing similar patterns in both datasets. The study explores universality patterns in training algorithms on CIFAR-10 and IMAGENET-20 datasets. While CIFAR-10 shows no overlap in trends, IMAGENET-20 exhibits universal behavior. Comparisons across different datasets do not show significant overlapping behavior. The phenomenon seems to be specific to large models and not small models. The study demonstrates a universal training dynamics for various neural networks, with no overlap in trends for fully connected networks. The distribution of predictions during training may follow a universal law, requiring weaker distances like neural net distances BID0 for measurement. This observation could offer a new way to understand neural networks in a unified manner. Additionally, results on IMAGENET-20 show a similar overlapping trend of training loss and error. The study demonstrates universal training dynamics for various neural networks, with no overlap in trends for fully connected networks. Results on IMAGENET-20 show a similar overlapping trend of training loss and error, observed in both CIFAR-10 and IMAGENET-20 datasets. In continuation of the study on universal training dynamics for neural networks, this section extends the observations to different datasets with the same number of classes. The overlapping phenomenon is not observed in fully connected networks, as shown in Figure 9 and Figure 11 for CIFAR-10 and IMAGENET-20 respectively. In the study on universal training dynamics for neural networks, the overlapping phenomenon is not observed when switching datasets with the same number of classes. Figure 1 shows pairs of loss functions for IMAGENET-20 using SGD and SGDm across lMSE and lCE for all architectures."
