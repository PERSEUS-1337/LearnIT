    "content": "In May 2013, the DOJ subpoenaed telephone toll records of AP reporters without notifying AP, leading to criticism from media organizations. The DOJ's decision not to negotiate with AP allowed them to evade judicial review. The DOJ argued it followed internal guidelines for obtaining information from the media during criminal investigations. The government's requirement to negotiate with news media entities during investigations is debated due to concerns about integrity. Journalists argue for special protection under the First Amendment. An example is Judith Miller's contempt of court case in 2005 for not revealing a source, resulting in her jail time. The incident involving I. Lewis Libby's identity disclosure raised questions about journalists' rights to withhold information in legal proceedings. Congress considered creating a federal shield law in response. The DOJ's subpoenas of AP toll records in 2013 reignited the debate. While most states protect journalists' confidential sources, the existence of a federal privilege remains uncertain. The Supreme Court's ruling in Branzburg v. Hayes found no First Amendment privilege for journalists to refuse grand jury testimony, leaving open the question of privilege in other circumstances. The Supreme Court's ruling in Branzburg v. Hayes found no First Amendment privilege for journalists to refuse grand jury testimony, leaving open the question of privilege in other circumstances. Congress may provide a privilege for journalists through legislation. The reporters in the cases sought a qualified privilege not to testify unless sufficient grounds are shown for believing they possess relevant information. In Branzburg v. Hayes, the Supreme Court ruled that journalists have no First Amendment privilege to refuse grand jury testimony unless the investigation is not conducted in good faith. The reporters sought a privilege to not testify unless they have relevant information. In Branzburg v. Hayes, the Supreme Court ruled that journalists must respond to relevant questions in grand jury investigations or criminal trials. Justice Powell, in a concurring opinion, acknowledged a qualified privilege for reporters to refuse testimony on criminal conduct if it has a remote relationship to the investigation or implicates confidential sources unnecessarily. In Branzburg v. Hayes, the Supreme Court ruled that journalists must respond to relevant questions in grand jury investigations or criminal trials. Justice Powell acknowledged a qualified privilege for reporters to refuse testimony on criminal conduct if it has a remote relationship to the investigation or implicates confidential sources unnecessarily. Without a legitimate need of law enforcement, journalists can seek a protective order through a motion to quash, balancing freedom of the press with the obligation to provide relevant testimony. The First Amendment's stance on journalists' privilege remains uncertain, but courts have interpreted Powell's concurrence to create a balancing test for press testimony. Congress and state legislatures can enact statutory privileges, and federal and state courts may adopt common-law privileges. Congress has not enacted a journalists' privilege, but 33 states and the District of Columbia have shield statutes. Federal courts have not resolved whether common law provides a journalists' privilege. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia is divided on the existence of a common law privilege in federal court. The majority of states, 49 plus the District of Columbia, have a journalists' privilege, either through statutory or common law protection. Wyoming is the only state without such a privilege. The Department of Justice has a rule for obtaining information from media organizations, emphasizing the balance between law enforcement and fair administration of justice. In re: Grand Jury Subpoena, Judith Miller is a federal court decision that upheld civil contempt against journalists Judith Miller and Matthew Cooper for refusing to testify in an investigation. Matthew Cooper eventually testified, but Judith Miller was imprisoned for continuing to refuse. The court's opinion, citing Branzburg, stated that journalists cannot refuse to testify before a grand jury. The court was divided on the existence of a common-law privilege, with Judge Sentelle and Judge Henderson expressing differing views. Judge Tatel addressed both the constitutional and common-law privileges, expressing uncertainty about a constitutional reporter privilege in the grand jury context. He agreed that any privilege would not benefit Miller or Cooper. Judge Tatel found that there is support for a privilege for reporters' confidential sources, but in the case at hand, the special counsel has established the need for Miller's and Cooper's testimony. The existence of a qualified reporters' privilege, whether constitutional or otherwise, remained unresolved following In re Grand Jury Subpoena, Judith Miller. This report focuses on court cases analyzing the reporters' privilege in federal law. The DOJ subpoenaed two months of telephone records for AP reporters without consulting them, highlighting the lack of opportunity for journalists to oppose the requirement. Department of Justice guidelines aim to strike a balance between law enforcement and fair justice administration when requesting subpoenas for news media. Negotiations with the news media should be pursued before issuing a subpoena for telephone toll records, as long as it does not jeopardize the investigation's integrity. The Attorney General must authorize that negotiating would not pose a substantial threat. Subpoenas for toll records of news media members must also be authorized by the Attorney General. Attorney General Eric Holder recused himself in this case, and the deputy attorney general signed off on the subpoenas. Subpoenas should be limited in scope, time, and volume of unpublished material requested. Deputy Attorney General (DAG) James M. Cole subpoenaed AP's toll records for a criminal investigation into classified information leaks. The DOJ believed there was a threat to the investigation's integrity and did not negotiate with AP. The subpoenas were limited to a two-month period, but AP disagrees on the scope and duration. The DOJ subpoenaed AP's toll records for a criminal investigation into classified information leaks. The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press criticized the seizure as unprecedented and overreaching, calling for the records to be returned. Lynn Oberlander of The New Yorker argued that AP should have been notified before the subpoenas were issued. The DOJ subpoenaed AP's toll records for a criminal investigation into classified information leaks, sparking criticism from news media organizations and calls for a federal shield law for reporters. The controversy has reignited the debate over the need for such legislation. Under a federal shield law, the DOJ would not have been able to secretly seek the AP's toll records. Negotiations with the AP would have been required, with the possibility of opposing subpoenas in court. Representative Poe introduced H.R. 1962 for the Free Flow of Information Act in the House, while Senator Schumer introduced S. 987 in the Senate. The bills aim to protect journalists' privilege. The bills introduced by Representative Poe and Senator Schumer aim to create statutory procedures for federal entities to obtain testimony or records from journalists and their service providers. This would establish a privilege for journalists against testifying or providing documents to the government without notice and an opportunity to be heard in court. H.R. 1962 specifically applies the privilege in cases where a \"Federal entity\" seeks to compel testimony or document production. H.R. 1962 defines \"covered person\" as an entity or employee of the judicial or executive branch with the power to issue a subpoena, excluding the legislative branch. The privilege protects journalists from disclosing information created during journalism activities to federal entities, with limitations on compelled disclosure. H.R. 1962 places limitations on compelled disclosure for journalists, ensuring that any disclosure is not overbroad, unreasonable, or oppressive. There is debate over who should be considered a journalist under this legislation, especially in cases involving bloggers or websites like Wikileaks.org. H.R. 1962 defines a \"covered person\" as someone engaged in journalism for financial gain, including entities that employ them. The bill outlines journalism as the gathering, preparing, and publishing of news or information of public interest. Uncertainty remains regarding whether entities like Wikileaks.org would be considered journalists under this definition. H.R. 1962 would allow the government to compel testimony or information from journalists after giving notice and an opportunity to be heard in court. The burden of proof would be higher when seeking information revealing a confidential source. In civil cases, the government must exhaust all alternatives before compelling disclosure, and in criminal cases, the information must be necessary for successful completion. In criminal cases, a federal entity can only compel disclosure if all reasonable alternatives have been exhausted, there are reasonable grounds to believe a crime occurred, and the information is critical to the case. If the disclosure could reveal a confidential source, special circumstances must also be met, such as preventing terrorism or harm to national security. The disclosure of confidential source information can be compelled in certain circumstances, such as preventing imminent harm or identifying individuals who have violated specific laws. However, exceptions for national security threats only apply to preventing terrorist attacks or breaches of national security, not to identifying confidential sources who may have provided information about past incidents. The bill's privilege applies to journalists who may have leaked classified government information, with the court weighing public interest before compelling disclosure. The privilege also extends to communications service providers, with notice and opportunity for the covered person before disclosure. The bill would allow communications service providers to be compelled to produce documents or testimony under certain conditions, with a defined scope of providers. Notice of disclosure can be delayed in cases where it may threaten a criminal investigation's integrity, allowing access to journalist or media company records. The bill would allow the government to obtain telephone or communications records of journalists or media companies with court approval and a high burden of proof. Notice of disclosure can be delayed but not prevented entirely, and journalists must be informed after the threat to the investigation has passed. S. 987 creates a more narrow privilege compared to H.R. 1962, covering only specific information and defining eligible individuals more narrowly. This makes compelled disclosure by the federal government easier, especially in criminal investigations. The Senate's version of the Free Flow of Information Act of 2013 makes compelled disclosure by the federal government easier in criminal investigations compared to the House version. The privilege applies when a \"Federal entity\" seeks disclosure of \"protected information\" from a \"covered person.\" The Senate bill's privilege only applies to \"protected information,\" while the House bill's privilege applies whenever any information is sought from a covered person by a federal entity. The Senate's version of the Free Flow of Information Act of 2013 defines \"covered persons\" more narrowly than the House version, limiting it to individuals and organizations involved in news gathering and dissemination. The privilege provision in the bill does not apply in state courts or to state law claims brought in federal court. The Senate bill's definition of \"covered persons\" in the Free Flow of Information Act of 2013 requires intent to disseminate information at the start of the gathering process. It excludes individuals like agents of foreign powers and those on terrorist watch lists. Unlike H.R. 1962, S. 987 only applies to a subset of information defined as \"protected information\" obtained with a promise of confidentiality. S. 987 creates a tiered system for the federal government to obtain information from covered persons, making it most difficult in civil cases and easiest in criminal cases, especially those involving national security. Federal entities cannot compel disclosure of \"protected information\" from a \"covered person\" without a court order, except in certain circumstances. In civil cases, disclosure may be compelled if all alternative sources have been exhausted and the information is essential. The party seeking disclosure must show that the government interest outweighs the public interest. In criminal cases, the government can compel disclosure more easily without needing to prove public interest. In criminal cases under S. 987, disclosure may be compelled if the party seeking it has exhausted all alternative sources, there are reasonable grounds to believe a crime has occurred, and the information is essential to the investigation or prosecution. The burden is on the covered person to show that disclosure is not in the public interest. S. 987 outlines instances where the privilege of not disclosing protected information to the federal government does not apply. This includes information obtained through eyewitness observations of alleged criminal or tortious conduct by the covered person. The burden is on the covered person to show that disclosure is not against the public interest. The privilege of not disclosing protected information to the federal government does not apply in certain instances, such as when the information is reasonably necessary to prevent specific harm or in criminal investigations related to national security or terrorism. S. 987 would limit the availability of the exception for cases involving unauthorized disclosure of classified information to only those related to acts of terrorism or threats to national security, giving deference to the executive branch's assessment of harm. Under S. 987, documents or testimony related to acts of terrorism and threats to national security would be compelled with limitations to verify published information and avoid nonessential details. The privilege would apply to information held by communications service providers for covered persons. Under S. 987, disclosure of information related to covered persons would require notice and an opportunity to be heard, except in cases of disclosure pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a72709 for counterintelligence purposes. Notice may be delayed if a federal court determines it would pose a threat to investigations or in exigent circumstances."
