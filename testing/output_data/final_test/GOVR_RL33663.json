    "content": "The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) provides duty-free tariff treatment to certain products imported into the United States from designated beneficiary developing countries (BDCs). Currently, 121 developing countries and territories are GSP beneficiary developing countries. The program allows duty-free entry for over 3,500 products from BDCs and an additional 1,500 products from least-developed beneficiary developing countries (LDBDCs). In 2017, products worth $21.2 billion entered the US duty-free under the program. The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) provides duty-free tariff treatment to certain products imported into the United States from designated beneficiary developing countries. In 2017, products worth $21.2 billion entered the US duty-free under the program. President Trump signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, extending the GSP program until December 31, 2020, with retroactive renewal for eligible entries between December 31, 2017, and April 22, 2018. The U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) is required to submit an annual report to Congress on GSP countries meeting eligibility criteria. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) will issue automatic duty refunds during GSP program lapses under certain conditions. Importers can request refunds through various methods if criteria are not met, providing necessary information and a signed statement of GSP eligibility. President Trump reinstated Argentina's GSP eligibility in Proclamation 9687, while suspending Ukraine's eligibility for certain tariff lines due to inadequate protection of intellectual property rights. The President has the authority to designate additional duty-free products under GSP after a review by the U.S. International Trade Commission. Congress can also grant the President authority to declare duty-free access for specific goods. Section 202 of P.L. 114-27 allowed the President to amend the list of GSP-eligible products. President Obama implemented authority on June 30, 2016 to designate certain cotton and cotton waste products as duty-free for eligible least-developed beneficiaries. Section 204 of P.L. 114-27 also granted similar presidential authority to designate certain luggage and travel articles as eligible for GSP. The Obama Administration declared these goods eligible for duty-free treatment for GSP least-developed and African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) beneficiaries only. President Trump granted duty-free access for luggage and travel goods to all GSP beneficiaries in response to requests from industry associations and Members of Congress. GSP trade programs aim to provide developing countries with preferential market access to spur economic growth. The GSP concept and programs were established in 1968 by UNCTAD to promote export-driven industry growth in developing countries and reduce dependence on primary products. It aimed to reconcile different economic perspectives on trade equity during early GATT negotiations. The GSP concept was established in 1968 by UNCTAD to promote export-driven industry growth in developing countries and reduce dependence on primary products. It aimed to reconcile different economic perspectives on trade equity during early GATT negotiations. Developing countries called for \"special and differential treatment\" in trade benefits, leading to the creation of individual national GSP schemes based on common principles. The GSP concept was established in 1968 by UNCTAD to promote export-driven industry growth in developing countries. It became a system of individual national schemes with the goal of providing equivalent export opportunities. Preference-granting countries implemented various schemes of nonreciprocal preferences, with conditions such as excluding certain countries, determining product coverage, rules of origin, and duration of the scheme. The GSP concept, established in 1968 by UNCTAD, aims to promote export-driven industry growth in developing countries through nonreciprocal preferences. These preferences include lowering tariffs, preventing benefits concentration, safeguard mechanisms, and duty-free trade caps. While granting preferences conflicts with GATT's nondiscrimination obligation, they were accommodated to aid developing countries in transitioning to trade liberalization and economic development. The GATT Parties added Part IV to the General Agreement, recognizing the special economic needs of developing countries and the principle of non-reciprocity. Developed countries may forego reciprocal benefits for commitments to reduce tariffs on less developed countries. In 1971, a waiver of Article I allowed GSP programs to provide favorable tariff treatment to developing countries. The Enabling Clause, adopted in 1979, allowed a permanent deviation from MFN for developing countries. The Enabling Clause, adopted in 1979, allows differential and more favorable treatment for developing countries in various trade aspects, such as preferential tariff treatment and regional tariff arrangements. The Enabling Clause, adopted in 1979, allows preferential treatment for developing countries in trade aspects like tariffs. The Doha Development Agenda (DDA) negotiations aimed to provide duty free/quota free access to least-developed countries' products. In 2005, WTO members agreed to provide duty-free access to at least 97% of products from Least Developed Countries by 2008. Most developed countries and some developing countries have implemented this commitment. Various countries, including the US, Australia, Canada, the EU, Japan, and others, have GSP programs with similar characteristics. The GSP programs offered by various countries provide duty-free access to qualifying developing countries for most manufactured products and certain agricultural products. The criteria for defining beneficiaries vary among countries, leading to differences in the list of beneficiaries and exceptions. Political or economic changes in a beneficiary country may result in its exclusion from GSP programs in some countries but not in others. Some countries, like the United States, can exclude others from their GSP programs if they have other commercial agreements or if it affects their commerce. The EU's program is very inclusive, offering duty-free access for \"Everything but Arms.\" Countries may have incentive-based programs for additional benefits, like the EU's regulation for sustainable development and worker rights. Safeguards are in place to monitor significant increases in benefits. The preference-granting nation has safeguards to prevent adverse effects on the receiving country's domestic market from significant increases in imports under GSP. Quantitative limits are imposed on goods entering the program, with import ceilings and maximum country amounts set for certain products. Graduation criteria determine when beneficiaries no longer qualify for benefits. The United States uses \"competitive need limit\" thresholds to restrict duty-free imports under GSP. The preference-granting countries have safeguards to prevent adverse effects on the receiving country's domestic market from significant increases in imports under GSP. Quantitative limits and graduation criteria determine when beneficiaries no longer qualify for benefits. The EU Generalised Scheme of Preferences has three different preference arrangements: Standard GSP, GSP+, and specific product sector graduation for certain recipients. The EU Generalised Scheme of Preferences (EU GSP) program offers different preference arrangements: Standard GSP, GSP+, and Everything but Arms (EBA). GSP+ provides access to 66% of EU tariff lines for vulnerable countries that ratify core international conventions. EBA grants full-duty-free, quota-free access for all products except arms to least-developed countries. EU implemented changes in 2014 to focus on countries in need and promote sustainable development and good governance. The EU GSP program underwent changes in 2014 to focus on countries in need, promote sustainable development, and enhance stability. This included mandatorily graduating upper-middle income countries and above, and excluding countries with preferential market access. GSP benefits were extended for 10 years, with transition periods for countries losing eligibility. Currently, there are 23 beneficiaries of standard GSP, 10 of GSP+, and 49 of EBA. Negotiations are ongoing for Economic Partnership Agreements with developing country trading partners. Canada's General Preferential Tariff (GPT) program, implemented in 1974, provides duty-free or reduced tariff rates for designated developing country beneficiaries. The program was reviewed in 2012 due to changes in income levels and trade competitiveness of certain countries. As a result, GPT benefits were withdrawn from 72 countries, while 103 beneficiaries continue to receive preferential treatment. Canada's GPT program extends preferential treatment to 103 beneficiaries, with 48 also benefiting from LDCT. The program will review beneficiary countries biannually and automatically graduate those classified as high or upper middle income for two consecutive years. Japan's GSP program, established in 1971, provides preferential tariff treatment to 138 developing countries and 5 territories based on specific criteria. Japan's GSP program offers preferential tariff treatment to 138 developing countries and 5 territories. Duty-free or reduced tariffs are provided for 408 agricultural and fisheries products and 3,151 industrial products. Least-developed countries receive duty-free, quota-free access. Graduation from the GSP scheme can occur for high-income or upper-middle income countries exceeding export thresholds. The U.S. Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) scheme was authorized in 1974 and allows duty-free treatment for eligible products from developing countries. Countries can be graduated from GSP if classified as high-income for three years or if they exceed export thresholds for certain products, such as fish. The GSP scheme allows duty-free treatment for eligible products from developing countries. The President uses economic criteria to decide on GSP country eligibility changes. The TPSC conducts annual reviews and makes recommendations to the USTR. The President considers mandatory and discretionary criteria when designating BDCs and LDBDCs. The law prohibits the President from extending GSP treatment to certain countries based on specific criteria, including exclusion of industrialized countries, communist countries without certain qualifications, countries colluding to disrupt international trade, and countries providing preferential treatment to other developed countries. Countries that nationalize or expropriate U.S. citizens' property, infringe on intellectual property rights, nullify contracts, impose taxes, or restrict property face adverse impact on U.S. commerce unless compensation, negotiations, or arbitration is in progress. Countries that have failed to recognize or enforce arbitral awards in favor of U.S. citizens, grant sanctuary to terrorists, and do not support U.S. efforts against terrorism may face adverse impacts. Additionally, beneficiary countries must uphold internationally recognized worker rights and commitments to eliminate the worst forms of labor. The President has the authority to waive certain criteria for GSP designation if it benefits the national economic interest of the United States. Factors considered include a country's desire to be a beneficiary developing country, its economic development level, and its commitment to fair market access and labor practices. The President has the authority to waive certain criteria for GSP designation if it benefits the national economic interest of the United States. Factors considered include a country's desire to be a beneficiary developing country, its economic development level, and its commitment to fair market access and labor practices. The law further authorizes the President to withdraw, suspend, or limit GSP treatment for any beneficiary developing country based on various factors such as protection of intellectual property rights, trade-distorting investment policies, barriers to trade in services, and internationally recognized worker rights. The President can also designate any beneficiary developing country as a least developed beneficiary developing country based on specific conditions and factors. The United Nations' designation of LDCs influences GSP beneficiary determinations. U.S. officials also consider compliance with GSP requirements and public feedback before identifying a country as \"least-developed.\" The President can revoke GSP status if a country is deemed competitive or developed. Mandatory graduation occurs when a country reaches \"high income\" status. In 2015, Seychelles, Uruguay, and Venezuela were classified as \"high income\" countries. Seychelles, Uruguay, and Venezuela lost GSP benefits as they became \"high income\" countries in 2017. Countries excluded from GSP associations are also withdrawn. Bulgaria and Romania lost eligibility upon joining the EU in 2007. Developing countries entering FTAs with the US may lose GSP eligibility. President Trump reinstated Argentina's GSP eligibility in 2017. President Obama designated Burma as a least-developed beneficiary in 2016. Burma regained GSP benefits after a 27-year suspension due to worker rights violations. The reinstatement followed a review of compliance with eligibility criteria and became official on November 14, 2016. This was part of a broader review of the bilateral relationship in light of Burma's return to democratic governance. The President must inform Congress of any changes in beneficiary developing country status. The Trade Act of 1974 allows the President to designate certain imports for duty-free treatment under the GSP program. Eligible goods must meet rules of origin requirements and be imported directly from the beneficiary country into the United States. Certain products like textiles, apparel, electronics, and agricultural goods are excluded from preferential treatment. The GSP program allows duty-free treatment for eligible goods imported directly from beneficiary countries into the United States. Products must meet rules of origin requirements, with at least 35% of the appraised value being from a beneficiary developing country. Over 3,500 products are currently eligible for duty-free treatment, with additional products from LDBDCs also qualifying. The GSP program allows duty-free treatment for eligible goods imported directly from beneficiary countries into the United States. The GSP Subcommittee reviews and revises lists of eligible products annually based on petitions received, adding or removing products for GSP eligibility. The Subcommittee also reviews country practices and considers petitions to add or remove items from the list of eligible products. The GSP Subcommittee reviews and revises lists of eligible products annually based on petitions received, adding or removing products for GSP eligibility. Recommendations are made to the President regarding product waivers requested by BDCs, with waivers being country-specific and taking effect on July 1 of the following year. The results of the annual review are announced by proclamation, with the President able to suspend GSP treatment for individual products if imports reach a specified threshold value. The GSP Subcommittee annually reviews and revises lists of eligible products based on petitions, with waivers becoming effective on July 1 of the following year. Products exceeding the Competitive Need Limit become GSP-ineligible the following calendar year, with BDCs able to petition for waivers reviewed by the President. The President considers advice from the ITC, U.S. economic interest, market access, and IPR protection when granting waivers. The GSP law allows the President to revoke CNL waivers that have been in effect for five years if certain conditions are met. De minimis waivers are also granted based on the total dollar value of imported products. In Proclamation 9625, the President granted de minimis waivers to products from beneficiary countries like Brazil, India, Indonesia, and Thailand. The GSP law allows waivers for products from beneficiary countries like Brazil, India, Indonesia, Thailand, and Papua New Guinea. Waivers are granted for various agricultural and chemical products, as well as animal hides and skins. Recent amendments allow BDCs to apply for waivers for products not produced in the US for three years prior to the request. Interested parties can petition for waivers during the annual review process. The GSP eligibility of current beneficiaries can be reviewed upon request from interested parties. For example, India and Kazakhstan are under review based on petitions alleging market access issues and labor rights violations. Thailand is also being reviewed for not meeting market access criteria. Additionally, a new \"proactive\" process was announced in October 2017. In October 2017, USTR Lighthizer announced a new \"proactive\" process for ensuring GSP beneficiaries comply with eligibility criteria, including triennial assessments. The TPSC may self-initiate country practice reviews if compliance concerns arise. New reviews of India, Indonesia, and Turkey were self-initiated in 2018. On October 15, 2018, a hearing for ongoing reviews of specific GSP beneficiaries was announced. The USTR announced a hearing for ongoing reviews of GSP beneficiaries, targeting countries like Bolivia, Ecuador, Georgia, Indonesia, Iraq, Thailand, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. The hearing also included discussions on the ongoing country designation review for Laos. Additionally, a GSP country practice review of Turkey was initiated focusing on market access requirements. The USTR announced a hearing on ongoing country practice reviews for various countries, including Bolivia, Ecuador, Georgia, Indonesia, Iraq, Thailand, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. The hearing also covered an ongoing country designation review for Laos. The U.S. GSP program aims to promote the development of developing countries, trade liberalization, and stimulate U.S. exports in developing country markets. The U.S. GSP program aims to assist developing countries through trade initiatives, but economic success also depends on internal factors like governance, stability, and infrastructure. External factors such as global economic growth and exchange rates can also impact developing countries. Stakeholders have varying opinions on the program's value. Total U.S. imports from GSP countries increased from 2000 to 2008. Total imports from GSP countries increased from $172 billion in 2000 to a peak of $384 billion in 2008. In 2009, imports decreased by 36% to $246 billion due to the global economic downturn. Imports gradually decreased to $202 billion in 2016 but increased to $215 billion in 2017. The decline from 2012 to 2016 may be attributed to lower commodity prices, geopolitical tensions, and political instability in some countries. Imports from GSP countries have remained relatively stable at around 11% of all imports. Factors such as program renewals, country eligibility changes, and other trade preference programs may explain this trend. Some developing countries utilize trade preferences like the GSP to enter international markets with products they have a competitive advantage in, like India and Thailand with jewelry. While this can help industries grow, it may also lead to trade diversion and hinder the development of other potentially competitive sectors. Some economists argue that nonreciprocal trade preferences like the GSP could have long-term costs for developing countries by maintaining protectionist trade policies. They suggest that multilateral, nondiscriminatory tariff cuts would be more beneficial for efficient production and trade patterns. In 2017, the United States imported $21 billion duty-free under the GSP program out of $215 billion total imports from eligible countries. Overall, the impact of GSP on the U.S. economy is relatively small, with most import-competing products being protected. Textile and apparel products are ineligible for duty-free treatment, and CNLs are triggered for certain products when imports reach a specified threshold. The GSP program allows duty-free imports from eligible countries when certain conditions are met. U.S. manufacturers can petition to withdraw GSP benefits if they are harmed. The program cost the U.S. $1.4 billion in foregone tariff revenues from 2018 to 2021. Many U.S. companies benefit from lower costs of imported goods under GSP. The Coalition for GSP states that companies in 40 states paid higher tariffs due to the GSP expiration in 2014, with California firms paying $100 million. Small and medium enterprises bear a disproportionate burden during GSP expiration, leading to lower sales and lost jobs. Supporters of the program include beneficiary developing countries, U.S. importers, and manufacturers. Some Members of Congress support GSP renewal as an important development and foreign policy tool. The GSP renewal debate involves developing countries advocating for special trade treatment to access U.S. markets amid globalization. Some U.S. producers and Congress members prefer reciprocal trade policies. There is support for preference programs, but some seek reciprocal relationships with emerging markets. Developing countries express concern about the erosion of preferential margins due to tariff negotiations. A study by the OECD in 1997 highlighted significant preference erosion from previous tariff concessions. Economists warn that continued multilateral tariff reductions could lead to preferences disappearing unless GSP tariff headings are expanded to include more import-sensitive products. Preference erosion is a concern for developing countries due to tariff negotiations. Economists suggest expanding GSP tariff headings to include more import-sensitive products. Some African countries worry about dilution of preferential treatment through WTO efforts for duty-free, quota-free U.S. market access. Others argue that increased market access from trade liberalization could outweigh preference erosion. Instead of maintaining preferential programs, economists propose assisting countries in addressing trade and growth constraints. Some academic literature suggests that preference programs like GSP and free trade agreements are underutilized due to importers finding the benefits not worth the additional costs. Reasons for not using GSP include exporters' unfamiliarity with the program, lack of promotion by governments, inadequate infrastructure, import sensitivity of major products, or a combination of these factors. The GSP program is seen as an effective way to provide economic assistance to developing countries by encouraging trade through private companies. It is supported by many observers for its broad reach and low-cost nature compared to intergovernmental aid. This approach aligns with long-standing U.S. foreign policy on economic development assistance through trade. Assistance through trade is a key element of U.S. foreign policy, supported by programs like AGOA and CBTPA. GSP qualification conditions provide leverage for promoting U.S. foreign policy goals. For example, Bangladesh worked closely with the U.S. after losing GSP benefits in 2013. The Trade and Investment Cooperation Forum Agreement was signed in 2013 to address trade issues. In May 2017, U.S. officials expressed optimism about Bangladesh's progress in trade discussions but did not suggest GSP eligibility. The U.S. is involved in a \"Sustainability Compact\" with Bangladesh, the EU, Canada, and the ILO to improve labor rights and factory safety in the garment industry. The last review in May 2017 noted increased trade union membership and progress by Bangladesh's government, but also highlighted labor unrest in Ashulia that needed resolution. U.S. businesses importing duty-free under the GSP argue it lowers costs, making them more competitive. Some companies have petitioned for specific products to be removed from GSP eligibility, like Exxel Outdoors in 2010. Certain non-down sleeping bags were petitioned for removal from GSP eligibility due to harm caused by duty-free imports from Bangladesh. These sleeping bag categories were removed from GSP duty-free treatment in January 2012. Various reforms of the GSP program have been suggested, such as supporting reciprocal tariff benefits through FTAs or letting the program lapse altogether. Changes to the program may need to consider WTO requirements, including notifying and possibly consulting with other WTO members. The United States may need to notify and consult with other WTO members before making any changes to the GSP program. Some policymakers suggest that developing countries could benefit more from multilateral negotiations or FTAs. Economic Partnership Agreements, like those pursued by the EU, could stimulate developing countries' economies more broadly than GSP. Each of the US's current FTA partners could offer reciprocal trade benefits and improved market access. Some policymakers suggest that developing countries could benefit more from multilateral negotiations or FTAs. The GSP program may be modified to primarily benefit least-developed countries. Potential beneficiaries of an LDC-only GSP program include Afghanistan, Bhutan, Burma, Burundi, Cambodia, Congo (Kinshasa), Haiti, and others. In 2017, Cambodia, Burma, and Congo (Kinshasa) made the most use of the program by value. U.S. efforts through trade capacity building could help LDCs take greater advantage of the preference. Congress could modify the GSP for all BDCs by expanding the list of tariff lines, allowing import-sensitive products preferential access, increasing flexibility of rules of origin requirements, and eliminating competitive need limitations. Possible approaches to extend the GSP program while restricting imports include mandatory graduation for \"middle income\" countries, reconsidering graduation criteria, strengthening enforcement of eligibility criteria, allowing graduation of individual industry sectors, modifying rule-of-origin requirements, lowering withdrawal thresholds, and increasing monitoring by the President. The President may need to monitor beneficiary countries more frequently for economic progress and GSP criteria compliance. Additional eligibility criteria could be added, such as reciprocal tariff treatment, sustainable development, and environmental preservation. Appendices include GSP Implementation and Renewal, and GSP Beneficiary Countries."
