This amendment involves striking and redesignating certain sections within the Act. The National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966 is amended to include a new section on concession contracts for providing accommodations, facilities, or services to visitors for recreational, educational, or interpretive enjoyment of lands or waters in the System. Concessions must comply with contract requirements and be awarded through a competitive bidding process. The Secretary will establish a standardized contract for concession contracts in the National Wildlife Refuge System, with provisions for extenuating circumstances and compatible use requirements. The contract for using land or water in the System must be compatible and designed to conserve natural and cultural resources, enhance visitor enjoyment, and increase knowledge of the resources. The contract also includes provisions for maintenance and repair of any improvements on the land or water used for activities in the System. The contract for using land or water in the System includes provisions for maintenance and repair related to authorized activities. Costs incurred for maintenance or repair are considered as payment to the United States. The United States retains title to all property maintained or repaired. No compensable interest is granted for maintenance, repairs, or improvements on the land or facilities authorized for use. Amounts received by the United States as fees or payments for use of real property in the System can be used by the Secretary without further appropriation. These funds are designated for the refuge or refuge complex where they were received and can be used for improving visitor experience, backlogged repair projects, interpretation, signage, habitat enhancement, and facility upgrades. The fees and payments received for the use of real property in the National Wildlife Refuge System can be used by the Secretary for facility enhancement, resource protection, and administration of agreements. This provision does not affect the Refuge Revenue Sharing Act. The new regulations apply to concessions awarded after the publication date. The Secretary of the Interior must issue regulations for standardized contract requirements within 18 months of the enactment of the Act. Additionally, the comprehensive conservation plan for each refuge must include a description of permissible activities on the lands. The Secretary of the Interior must issue regulations for standardized contract requirements within 18 months of the enactment of the Act. This section does not affect any prior amendments made by the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966. SEC. 2. ANNUAL REPORT ON NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE CONCESSIONS.
