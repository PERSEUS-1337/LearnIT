Additionally, a new proposed rule is to be developed. The Secretary of the Army and the Administrator of the EPA are tasked with developing a new proposed rule to define \"waters of the United States\" under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. They must consider public comments on the previous proposed rule, economic analysis, and a report on stream and wetland connectivity. The Secretary of the Army and the Administrator of the EPA are required to develop a new proposed rule to define \"waters of the United States\" under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. This involves consulting with State and local officials, stakeholders, and preparing a regulatory proposal based on public comments and Supreme Court rulings. The Secretary and the Administrator must consult with State and local officials to define \"waters of the United States\" under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, seeking consensus and incorporating advice and recommendations from stakeholders. The consultation process under subsection (b) involves consulting with a broad cross-section of State and local officials to emphasize collaboration, allow for timely input, and protect the rights and responsibilities of States in water quality protection and land use planning. The consultation process involves recognizing Federal deference to State primacy in water law, incorporating advice from State and local officials, and ensuring transparency in the consultation process. The Secretary and the Administrator must consult with stakeholders and interested parties to identify representatives for advice on potential adverse impacts of new proposed rules and ensure transparency in the process. The Secretary and the Administrator must consult stakeholders and interested parties to ensure transparency in the process, including making all communications accessible to the public. Consultations with State and local officials, stakeholders, and interested parties must begin within 3 months of the Act's enactment. A report must be prepared responding to public comments on the proposed rule and its economic analysis. The new proposed rule addresses public comments and includes advice from State and local officials. Areas of consensus are detailed in the report. The new proposed rule addresses advice and recommendations from State and local officials, as well as stakeholders and interested parties. It details areas of consensus and addresses potential adverse impacts. The new proposed rule recognizes and protects the primary rights of States to control water quality and land use. It aligns with Supreme Court rulings on the scope of waters under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and includes regulatory and economic impact analyses on definitional changes. The new proposed rule will impact programs under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act for government agencies and stakeholders, including small entities. The Secretary and Administrator will publish the rule for comment in the Federal Register after consultations with State and local officials, stakeholders, and interested parties. The new proposed rule under subsection (a) will be open for public review and comment for at least 180 days. Procedural requirements from the Administrative Procedure Act will apply to the development and review of the rule. The term \"State and local officials\" refers to elected or professional government officials at the state and local levels or their representative organizations. SEC. 4. NO ADDITIONAL AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. No extra funds are authorized for this Act; existing funds will be used. SEC. 5. EFFECT ON STATE PERMIT PROGRAMS. If the EPA issues a final rule defining \"waters of the United States,\" they must review state permit programs under the Clean Water Act to ensure compliance within 90 days. The Administrator must notify the state of their determination within 10 days of completing the review. During a 2-year compliance period, the Administrator cannot withdraw approval of a State permit program for not complying with a final rule. This section does not limit the Administrator's authority under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. The Administrator cannot withdraw approval of a State permit program or disapprove a proposed permit under a State program, except as prohibited by law. The House of Representatives passed the document on May 12, 2015, as attested by Karen L. Haas, Clerk."
