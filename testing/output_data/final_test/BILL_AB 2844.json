    "title": "AB 2844",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. California is a leader in protecting civil rights and preventing discrimination with robust nondiscrimination laws covering various characteristics. California's strong public policy against unlawful discrimination is reflected in statutes such as the California Fair Employment and Housing Act and the Unruh Civil Rights Act, which prohibit discrimination based on personal characteristics in employment, housing, public accommodation, and services provided by business establishments. Section 11135 of the Government Code specifically prohibits discrimination in programs or activities funded by the state. California's Public Contract Code and state laws prohibit discrimination in contracts based on wages, workplace safety, rights to association, and nondiscrimination standards. The Legislature strongly supports freedom of speech and religion but emphasizes that exercising First Amendment rights does not justify unlawful discrimination. California is committed to preventing support or financing of unlawful discrimination against protected classes. California recognizes the importance of promoting fairness, equality, and combating unlawful discrimination. The state's significant influence in the marketplace allows it to take action against companies engaging in discriminatory practices that go against the state's nondiscrimination policies. The Legislature aims to prevent taxpayer funds from supporting entities engaging in discriminatory actions, particularly towards individuals of the Jewish faith protesting against Israel. This includes a new section added to the Public Contract Code. A new section (2010) is added to the Public Contract Code, requiring individuals submitting bids or proposals for state contracts over $100,000 to certify compliance with the Unruh Civil Rights Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act under penalty of perjury. The new section added to the Public Contract Code requires compliance with the Unruh Civil Rights Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act for state contracts over $100,000. Any policy or actions related to sovereign nations or their nationals must comply with federal or state sanctions or laws to avoid unlawful discrimination. The new section added to the Public Contract Code mandates compliance with civil rights and fair employment laws for state contracts over $100,000. No reimbursement is required by this act as it pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions."
