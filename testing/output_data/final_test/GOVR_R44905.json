    "content": "The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act introduced three new avenues for patent challenges at the USPTO: a \"transitional program for covered business methods,\" post-grant review, and inter partes review. The inter partes review (IPR) has been the most widely used and controversial, allowing individuals to petition the USPTO to invalidate a patent based on earlier patents or publications. A petitioner must show a \"reasonable likelihood\" of success for the IPR to proceed. The inter partes review (IPR) allows individuals to challenge patents at the USPTO based on earlier patents or publications. If the USPTO's Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) grants the petition, it will preside over the IPR and reach a final determination. The popularity of IPR proceedings suggests that they provide an expedient and cost-effective way to challenge patents issued erroneously by the USPTO. The inter partes review (IPR) process allows for challenging patents at the USPTO. Some view IPRs as shifting the patent battleground to the PTAB, with concerns about their impact on patent rights and confidence in the U.S. patent system. Former Federal Circuit Chief Judge Randall Rader has criticized the PTAB as a patent-killing \"death squad.\" The U.S. Chamber of Commerce noted a decline in the strength of the U.S. patent system, partly due to the introduction of IPRs. The report surveys the patent landscape with respect to IPRs, including an overview of the patent system, different patent challenge proceedings, recent legislative proposals, and issues identified by stakeholders. Applicants must submit applications to the USPTO for patent protection, with examiners assessing the merit of the application under the Patent Act of 1952. Artisans practice patent acquisition through the prosecution process. Examiners assess novelty and nonobviousness criteria based on prior art to determine patentability. The USPTO grants patents to inventors, giving them exclusive rights to their inventions for 20 years. This allows inventors to profit from their discoveries by charging higher prices. Patent owners must monitor competitors and may need to litigate to protect their intellectual property rights. The USPTO grants patents to inventors, giving them exclusive rights to their inventions for 20 years. Patent owners must monitor competitors and may need to litigate to protect their intellectual property rights. Litigation for intellectual property rights usually occurs in federal courts, with the Federal Circuit handling most patent appeals. The US Supreme Court can review cases from the Federal Circuit. Once a patent is issued, the USPTO's involvement typically ends, but it may reconsider its decision through various administrative review proceedings like reexamination and inter partes review. The USPTO conducts reexamination proceedings on issued patents, allowing for a dialogue between applicant and examiner to determine patentability. The AIA introduced post-grant review (PGR) and inter partes review (IPR) as new proceedings for challenging patents. Post-grant review (PGR) and inter partes review (IPR) are new proceedings introduced by the AIA for challenging patents. PGR applies to patents with filing dates of March 16, 2013, or later, and a request must be filed within nine months of the patent grant. The petitioner must present information to demonstrate that at least one claim is unpatentable. The USPTO charges fees for PGR, and the patent proprietor can file a preliminary response. The USPTO's Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) conducts the proceeding, and its final determination can be appealed to federal courts. Post-grant review (PGR) and inter partes review (IPR) are new proceedings introduced by the AIA for challenging patents. PGR applies to patents with filing dates of March 16, 2013, or later, and a request must be filed within nine months of the patent grant. The USPTO charges fees for PGR, and the patent proprietor can file a preliminary response. The USPTO's Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) conducts the proceeding, and its final determination can be appealed to federal courts. A PGR must be completed within one year of its commencement, with a possible six-month extension for good cause shown. The individual who initiated the proceeding and related entities are barred from raising certain issues in the future. IPRs, which apply to all granted patents regardless of filing date, allow any person who is not the patent owner to file a petition requesting an IPR at least nine months after a patent issues or reissues. The basis for requesting an IPR is limited to patents or printed publications. These proceedings were implemented on September 16, 2012. Under the AIA, inter partes review (IPR) is limited to patents or printed publications, focusing on novelty and nonobviousness issues. The petitioner must show a \"reasonable likelihood\" of prevailing on at least one claim to start the IPR, with fees of $9,000 for consideration and $14,000 if initiated. A patent can be challenged within nine months of issuance via post-grant review (PGR) for any patentability issue, and throughout its term via IPR for novelty and nonobviousness. Both PGRs and IPRs follow a trial-like procedure before a panel with at least three members. The AIA establishes rules for post-grant reviews (PGRs) and inter partes reviews (IPRs), limiting petitioners' ability to request these proceedings. PGRs focus on any patentability issue and can be initiated within nine months of patent issuance, while IPRs focus on novelty and nonobviousness and can be initiated throughout the patent's term. Both PGRs and IPRs follow trial-like procedures before a panel with at least three members, with opportunities for limited discovery and oral hearings. Additionally, the AIA includes provisions for stays of litigation in certain circumstances. The AIA established rules for post-grant reviews (PGRs) and inter partes reviews (IPRs), limiting petitioners' ability to request these proceedings. PGRs focus on any patentability issue and can be initiated within nine months of patent issuance, while IPRs focus on novelty and nonobviousness and can be initiated throughout the patent's term. The AIA also created a post-grant review proceeding for the review of the validity of certain business method (CBM) patents. This \"CBM\" proceeding is limited to patents related to financial products or services. The AIA established rules for post-grant reviews (PGRs) and inter partes reviews (IPRs), limiting petitioners' ability to request these proceedings. PGRs focus on any patentability issue and can be initiated within nine months of patent issuance, while IPRs focus on novelty and nonobviousness and can be initiated throughout the patent's term. Additionally, the AIA created a post-grant review proceeding for the review of the validity of certain business method (CBM) patents. Only individuals sued for infringement of a business method patent may petition the USPTO to commence a CBM, with fees involved for consideration and initiation of the procedure. CBMs apply to all business method patents regardless of their date of filing or issuance, and the program is subject to a sunset provision that will repeal it on September 16, 2020. The USPTO provides monthly updates on PTAB trials, including statistics on IPR, CBM, and PGR petitions. As of March 1, 2017, there were 6,139 IPR, 510 CBM, and 51 PGR petitions filed. Critics argue that a high percentage of challenged claims are invalidated in PTAB proceedings. The PTAB has a high rate of invalidating challenged claims, with only 14% being upheld. This is significantly higher than federal court invalidation rates. In district courts, the invalidation rate is lower at 46%. However, when considering denials of petitions and settlements, PTAB outcomes align more closely with federal courts. In 2016, PTAB instituted review in 72% of cases, with no claims surviving final written decision in 67% of cases. This means that challenged claims are killed in only about 48% of cases. After more than half a decade of experience with IPRs, stakeholders have called for modifications to the rules governing IPRs. The Support Technology and Research for Our Nation's Growth and Economic Resilience (STRONGER) Patents Act of 2017 proposes changes to address this. Patents, like other legal instruments, require interpretation as patent claims may have terms open to different interpretations. The courts and the PTO use different interpretational methodologies for patent claims. Courts aim to determine the \"ordinary and customary\" meaning based on the patent's specification and prosecution history. In contrast, the USPTO gives claim terms their broadest reasonable interpretation during patent acquisition to allow for amendments. The AIA did not specify these protocols. The AIA did not specify which standard should apply during IPR proceedings. The USPTO adopted the \"broadest reasonable interpretation\" standard in IPRs, upheld by the Supreme Court in Cuozzo Speed Technologies v. Lee. This allows for different constructions of claim terms between courts and the USPTO, potentially leading to different conclusions on claim validity. The Court recognized the agency's rational use of rulemaking authority in the 115th Congress. The STRONGER Patents Act of 2017 aims to align claim construction standards between PTAB and federal courts, making patent invalidation easier in administrative reviews. Former USPTO Director David Kappos notes that the speed of post-grant proceedings is causing conflicting decisions between court and USPTO interpretations of patent claims. While some argue for retaining the broader claim construction standard for clarity over prior art, others believe changes will undermine the effectiveness of post-grant review procedures. The IPR/PGR amendments are opposed by technology companies due to concerns that changes to claim construction standards will blur the distinction between court and USPTO proceedings. The amendments risk undermining the progress made in reducing the impact of invalid patents on the industry by making the process more costly and complex. The burden of proof in patent challenges is set as \"clear and convincing evidence,\" which requires challengers to prove that the patent does not fulfill statutory requirements. This standard is different in IPR and PGR proceedings under the AIA. The rules differ in IPR and PGR proceedings under the AIA. The STRONGER Patents Act proposes a presumption of validity for previously issued claims and requires petitioners to demonstrate unpatentability by clear and convincing evidence. This addresses a perceived shortcoming in administrative review proceedings. The ability to challenge patent validity through administrative proceedings addresses a perceived shortcoming in the patent system by allowing individuals to challenge patents without the need for a substantial controversy. This requirement stems from the \"standing\" doctrine, which limits public challenges to patents granted by the USPTO. The ability to challenge patent validity through administrative proceedings like IPRs and PGRs allows individuals to question patents without the need for a substantial controversy. Some believe that only parties who could have brought litigation should be able to initiate an IPR or PGR, while others suggest reconsidering the absence of a standing requirement for these proceedings. Some concerns have been raised regarding the absence of a standing requirement for IPRs and PGRs. These include the potential for \"reverse trolling,\" challenges by interest groups for non-patent related reasons, and strategic use of IPRs for financial gain, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry. The STRONGER Patents Act in the 115th Congress aims to address these issues by proposing a standing requirement for filing petitions. The STRONGER Patents Act proposes a standing requirement for filing petitions in IPRs and PGRs with the USPTO. Patent owners are allowed to amend their claims during these proceedings, including canceling challenged claims and proposing substitute claims. Additional motions to amend may be permitted to advance settlement or as allowed by regulations. The STRONGER Patents Act proposes a standing requirement for filing petitions in IPRs and PGRs with the USPTO, allowing patent owners to amend their claims during these proceedings. However, stakeholders believe that the PTAB rarely allows motions to amend claims, citing reasons such as failure to show patentability over prior art, lack of support in the original description, unclear claim construction, and failure to discuss the level of ordinary skill in the art. The Supreme Court also noted the low approval rate of motions to amend by the PTAB. The PTAB has a low approval rate for motions to amend claims, with only 5 out of 86 granted. The Federal Circuit is considering whether the burden of persuasion should be on the patent owner when amending claims. The PTAB has a low approval rate for motions to amend claims, with only 5 out of 86 granted. The Federal Circuit is considering whether the burden of persuasion should be on the patent owner when amending claims. The upcoming Aqua Products case and the proposed STRONGER Patents Act of 2017 could impact USPTO practices regarding claim amendments, potentially allowing for an alternative procedure for amending claims challenged before the PTAB. This legislation would give the patent owner the option to request an expedited patentability report on a substitute claim from a patent examiner, with the PTAB having the discretion to allow this alternative amendment pathway. The Federal Circuit has a broad jurisdiction, hearing patent appeals as well as cases involving veterans' rights, government contracts, federal taxation, takings, vaccine compensation, government employment, customs, and tariffs. This diverse jurisdiction was intentionally established to avoid the risks associated with specialized courts. The introduction of IPRs has significantly increased the number of appeals from the USPTO to the Federal Circuit, with a massive influx of new cases. As of Oct. 31, 2016, there were 586 pending appeals from the USPTO, compared to only 93 appeals on Oct. 31, 2012. The Federal Circuit reported a total of 1,526 pending cases as of April 30, 2017. The Federal Circuit reported 1,526 pending cases as of April 30, 2017, with 636 from the USPTO, 478 from district courts, 116 from the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, and 17 from the International Trade Commission, mostly involving patent matters. The court may see a shift towards more USPTO appeals replacing those from district courts. The landmark Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council decision guides Federal Circuit review of USPTO regulations. The Chevron test establishes a deferential judicial role in reviewing agency interpretations of statutes. The USPTO has relied on Chevron deference successfully. The USPTO has relied on Chevron deference in various aspects of IPRs, including claim construction standards and decision-making processes. Proposed bills in the 115th Congress aim to overturn Chevron deference by directing courts to decide all legal questions independently. The court shall not interpret gaps or ambiguities in statutory provisions as implicit delegation of rule-making authority to agencies, nor rely on them to expand agency authority or defer to agency interpretations. H.R. 76 may impact Patent Office regulations and the broadest reasonable interpretation standard in IPR proceedings. Proposed bills in the 115th Congress seek to eliminate Chevron deference in legal questions related to IPRs. The U.S. Constitution establishes the federal court system, ensuring the right to trial by jury in cases exceeding twenty dollars. Patent cases in federal court often involve juries. In a specific case, an IPR petitioner argued that IPRs violated Article III and the Seventh Amendment by delegating issues to the PTAB instead of a federal court. The Federal Circuit held that IPR proceedings are consistent with the Constitution as the agency's authority is to decide federal law issues. The PTO, created by Congress, has expertise in patent law and can correct its own errors in issuing patents. Critics argue that patents are property rights that must be considered in these proceedings. The MCM v. HP opinion asserts that patents are property rights that must be tried before an Article III court with a jury. The Supreme Court is set to hear a case on whether inter partes review violates the Constitution by extinguishing property rights without a jury. Critics argue that patents should be considered in administrative proceedings. The USPTO Director can only initiate an IPR or PGR if it is likely that at least one challenged claim is unpatentable. The STRONGER Patents Act of 2017 limits challenges to a patent claim to once. The USPTO can choose to initiate an IPR on only some of the challenged claims. The Federal Circuit upheld the USPTO's regulation allowing partial challenges. The Court of Appeals disagreed with the idea of partial institution, stating that the initiation decision should be made on a claim-by-claim basis. The Supreme Court agreed to hear a case on this matter in SAS Institute Inc. v. Lee, questioning whether the PTAB is required to issue a final written decision on every claim challenged or if it can choose to address only some claims. The ruling is expected by the end of 2017. The Supreme Court is expected to rule on the issue of partial institution in SAS Institute Inc. v. Lee by the end of 2017. Concerns have been raised about the potential hardships for both petitioners and patent proprietors due to the ambiguity created by partial institution in Inter Partes Reviews (IPRs). There are worries about the value and enforceability of patents with partially invalidated claims, as well as the effectiveness of the PTAB in serving as an administrative substitute for litigation. The AIA charges the PTAB with administering IPRs within a one-year period, and some argue that partial institution helps manage workload. Individuals starting an IPR or PGR are estopped from raising certain issues in later civil actions. The STRONGER Patents Act of 2017 proposes an exception to this rule in certain infringement cases. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, established specialized procedures for pharmaceutical patent infringement litigation between generic and brand-name drug companies. This includes identifying relevant patents to the FDA, publishing them in the Orange Book, allowing generic companies to challenge patent validity, and imposing a 30-month marketing approval stay. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) established a patent dispute resolution procedure for biologics, involving a \"Patent Dance\" where parties exchange information on patents and negotiate which ones will be litigated. Some believe that this process does not align well with the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act and BPCIA have created a system to introduce new medicines while allowing for generic and biosimilar alternatives. However, challenges like IPRs threaten this balance. The US's WTO membership requires ensuring patent rights without discrimination. Exempting medical patents from IPR procedures may violate the commitment to non-discriminatory patent rights. The Hatch-Waxman Act rewards the first generic firm to challenge a patent with a 180-day exclusivity period. The Medicare Prescription Drug Act of 2003 established forfeiture events that can cause a generic firm to lose this exclusivity. The Medicare Prescription Drug Act of 2003 established forfeiture events that can cause a generic firm to lose its 180-day exclusivity, which include specific timeframes after FDA approval, court judgments, settlements, or removal of patents from the Orange Book. There is a need for Congress to consider how Inter Partes Reviews (IPRs) should interact with these forfeiture events. The increased focus on intellectual property in the knowledge-driven economy has raised industry expectations for patent quality and efficiency. With 8,000 patent examiners at the USPTO, maintaining consistency in grant determinations is challenging. Post-grant proceedings involving private patent examiners help confirm the significance of issued patents, with only a small subset ever facing validity challenges. Post-grant proceedings at the USPTO focus on patents of particular significance and validity, aiming to provide a reliable and cost-effective reassessment process. This could lead to more certainty for commercial decisions regarding patent rights and reduce litigation costs, allowing resources to be redirected towards research and development. The perception of high invalidity rulings at the PTAB may be influenced by recent Supreme Court decisions making patenting requirements more stringent. The Supreme Court has made patenting requirements more difficult, potentially invalidating patents granted under earlier standards. Petitioners are strategically challenging weak patents, leading to a perception of high invalidation rates. Inter Partes Reviews (IPRs) are a less expensive alternative to litigation but still costly, with an average cost of $200,000 per party. Challenging a patent's validity is often more expensive than obtaining it initially. The PTAB, praised for its expertise, consists of experienced patent practitioners and judges with technical knowledge. They are thorough in their decisions, unlike many federal district judges and jurors. Critics argue that the IPR system is biased towards invalidating patents. The PTAB is criticized for creating a system that heavily favors invalidating patents, with features like broad claim construction, lower burden of proof for challengers, and lack of jury or impartial judge. Patent owners may struggle to keep up with the fast-paced IPR process, while challengers can strategically plan their petitions. Some patents face multiple IPR petitions, increasing costs and delays. The PTAB has been subject to numerous IPR petitions since 2012, allowing one individual to file multiple petitions against a single patent. Statistics show that most patents in these proceedings are also involved in litigation, with about 12.7% of litigated patents being challenged in the PTAB and 86.8% of challenged patents also being litigated in federal courts. The statistics show that PTAB-only cases are rare, with most challenged patents also being litigated in federal courts. Observers note that amending claims in IPRs is difficult, leading to concerns about the expense and complexity of patent enforcement. The tight deadlines and high demand for IPRs contribute to the PTAB's reluctance to allow amended claims, potentially impacting patent quality by invalidating patents. Critics of IPRs argue that they invalidate patents instead of improving patent quality, allowing anyone to file petitions and leading to misuse by larger competitors. The lack of a defined set of petitioners makes it challenging for inventors to avoid potential IPRs, impacting the innovation environment in the United States. IPRs have a deleterious impact on the innovation environment in the United States, increasing cost and uncertainty for patent owners. This can deter venture capital investment in start-ups and high-tech products, particularly affecting individual inventors and small firms. Critics and supporters agree that IPRs are a prominent component of the AIA, with detractors claiming they harm the patent system while proponents believe they meet the goal of challenging suspect patents effectively. The Inter Partes Reviews (IPRs) have raised concerns about their impact on the innovation environment in the United States, affecting patent owners by increasing costs and uncertainty. Critics and supporters acknowledge that IPRs are a key aspect of the America Invents Act (AIA), with detractors arguing they harm the patent system while proponents believe they effectively challenge suspect patents. As Congress considers potential IPR reform proposals, policymakers may find the five years of experience with these proceedings helpful in weighing competing views."
