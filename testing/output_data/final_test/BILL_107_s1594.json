    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nurse Retention and Quality of Care Act of 2001\". The current nurse workforce is aging rapidly, with the average age of registered nurses increasing significantly since 1983. This aging trend is outpacing other occupations in the US, leading to a decrease in nursing program enrollments and high vacancy rates in hospitals. Studies show that higher nurse staffing levels result in better patient outcomes and reduced risks. Retention issues are also contributing to the nursing shortage, with half of nurses considering leaving the profession. Nurses considering leaving the profession cite low job satisfaction and lack of decision-making involvement as key factors. Magnet hospitals, known for their participatory and patient-centered care, have lower turnover rates and higher job satisfaction among nurses compared to other hospitals. Magnet hospitals have lower mortality rates, higher patient satisfaction, and greater cost-efficiency, resulting in shorter hospital stays for patients. Title VIII of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include initiatives to improve nurse retention, the nursing workplace, and the quality of care through developing models and best practices in nursing care. The Secretary will award grants to eligible entities for nursing care demonstrations to develop innovative strategies for nurse retention. Eligible entities include health care facilities and partnerships with nursing schools. Health care facilities encompass various healthcare settings designated by the Secretary. Grants awarded under this section for nursing care demonstrations will be distributed among different regions and facility types. The grants will last for up to 3 years and can be extended if workplace quality improves or the facility is designated as a magnet hospital. Preference is given to entities that have increased retention rates, reduced workplace injuries, and decreased nursing-sensitive adverse patient outcomes when awarding grant extensions. The maximum duration of grants is 6 years. Grant funds must be used to demonstrate models and best practices in nursing care to promote nurse retention and satisfaction. The curr_chunk focuses on promoting retention and satisfaction of professional nurses, collaboration among healthcare professionals, nurse involvement in decision-making processes, organizing care to improve nursing workplace environment, promoting opportunities for career advancement, and enhancing patient care quality through measurement of outcomes and policy development. The curr_chunk emphasizes the importance of involving professional nurses in developing policies based on research findings, promoting a balanced work-life environment, and offering activities to enhance the workplace environment. Eligible entities seeking grants must submit applications to the Secretary as required. The application for grants must include a project description and demonstrate the entity's commitment through involvement of key personnel and management structures. The application for grants must include a project description, details of innovative models for nurse retention, funding information, retention rates, workplace injuries, and any other required information by the Secretary. The Secretary, in consultation with relevant agencies, will conduct an annual survey of projects under section 851 and provide results to Congress. A final report evaluating funded projects and their impact on patients and staff is due by December 30, 2007. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorization of appropriations for grants under section 851 is set at $40,000,000 for fiscal years 2002 through 2007, and for survey and evaluation under section 852 is set at $5,000,000 for the same period."
