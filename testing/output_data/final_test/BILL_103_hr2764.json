    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Ballona Wetlands Restoration Act of 1993\". Congress finds that wetlands play a crucial role in the ecological and economic well-being of the nation by providing food and water supplies, flood control, wildlife habitats, and maintaining biodiversity. However, a significant portion of wetlands in California, including Los Angeles, have been severely degraded or lost. The Ballona Wetlands in Los Angeles, California, are the last remaining wetlands ecosystem in the city and support 185 bird species. They are at risk of ecosystem collapse but could provide benefits like fish nursery habitat, water quality improvement, habitat for endangered species, and educational opportunities if fully restored. The purpose of this Act is to establish a demonstration program to encourage the full tidal restoration of the Ballona Wetlands and provide educational opportunities regarding wetlands functions for urban areas. It is a high priority for the Federal Government to support the full restoration of degraded wetlands. SEC. 3. DISCHARGE OF DREDGED OR FILL MATERIAL AT BALLONA WETLANDS.\n\nThe Secretary of the Army must issue regulations within 180 days for expedited permit consideration for dredged or fill material discharge at Ballona Wetlands, Los Angeles, California. Public hearings must be included in the process.\n\nSEC. 4. BALLONA WETLANDS DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in consultation with other federal agencies, will establish a program to restore the Ballona Wetlands in Los Angeles, California. Mitigation credits will be awarded to those conducting restoration activities, which can be used to obtain permits for activities in the specified area. The Administrator will establish a mitigation banking system to track credits awarded under the program. Credits can be sold to third parties, with priority given to water-dependent development in San Pedro Bay, Los Angeles. Regulations for the program must be issued within 180 days of the Act's enactment. Regulations for the mitigation banking system must include a scale for awarding credits and guidelines for their use in obtaining permits under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. The scale will consider the contribution to restoring the Ballona Wetlands and other mitigation options, while the guidelines will address the ecological and economic aspects. The demonstration program for awarding mitigation credits under the mitigation banking system will consider the ecological and economic benefits of activities, while ensuring that the issuance of permits based on these credits does not imply prior approval by any Federal or State agency. The demonstration program for awarding mitigation credits under the mitigation banking system will consider ecological and economic benefits of activities, ensuring permits based on these credits do not imply prior approval by any Federal or State agency. Additionally, a report to Congress will be provided. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will provide Congress with annual reports on the results of the wetlands restoration demonstration program, including the total acres restored, effectiveness in achieving policy goals, and functions of the restored wetlands. The annual reports on the wetlands restoration demonstration program will include an assessment of the program's impact on timely completion of mitigation activities and ease of administration, as well as a description of associated costs."
