    "content": "According to a U.S. Census Bureau report, in 2012, around 64% of individuals in the United States had private health insurance through an employer, union, or purchased from a private company. The federal government has become more involved in regulating health insurance since the 1970s, with the ACA greatly expanding federal regulation to increase access to private health insurance and improve healthcare quality. ACA includes new minimum standards for private health insurance coverage, such as extending dependent coverage to age 26, eliminating preexisting condition exclusions, and banning lifetime and certain annual benefit limits. The ACA imposes requirements on group health plans and health insurance issuers, including coverage of essential health benefits, prohibition on rescissions, and coverage of preventive health services without cost sharing. These requirements apply to both insured and self-insured group health plans, as well as health insurance issuers selling coverage inside and outside state health insurance exchanges. Title I of the ACA lacks explicit enforcement tools for violations. The ACA imposes requirements on group health plans and health insurance issuers, including coverage of essential health benefits, prohibition on rescissions, and coverage of preventive health services without cost sharing. Enforcement of these requirements may involve civil monetary penalties under federal law through existing statutes like ERISA, PHSA, and IRC. Traditionally, states regulate health insurance matters, requiring insurers to be financially solvent, pay claims promptly, and meet certain mandates. The McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945 grants states explicit authority to regulate insurance, recognizing their role in ensuring insurers are financially solvent, pay claims promptly, and mandate certain benefits. This law was passed in response to a Supreme Court ruling affirming federal regulation of insurers' competitive practices. Section 2(a) of the act states that insurance businesses are subject to state laws related to regulation or taxation. Congress reserved the right to enact federal statutes related to the business of insurance under the McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945. This led to the passage of laws like ERISA in the 1970s, which regulated private-sector employee benefit plans, including health plans. In 1996, HIPAA was passed to establish further regulations in the insurance industry. HIPAA established national standards for private health insurance, aiming to maintain coverage for individuals changing jobs or purchasing on their own. It limited exclusions based on preexisting conditions and prohibited discrimination in group health coverage based on health-related factors. The group health coverage requirements of HIPAA were established in three federal statutes: ERISA, the PHSA, and the IRC, which apply to different types of private health insurance coverage. Congress later enacted additional statutes mirroring this regulatory model, such as the Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act, Mental Health Parity Act of 1996, Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act, and Michelle's Law. These statutes set standards for benefits provided to mothers and newborns, ensure parity between medical/surgical and mental health benefits, require coverage for prosthetic devices and reconstructive surgery after mastectomy, and extend dependents' ability to remain on their parents' plan for a limited period. The federal health insurance standards, established by HIPAA and subsequent acts, serve as a minimum requirement while allowing states to regulate health insurance more comprehensively. ACA expanded these standards, adding new requirements for group health plans and insurance issuers. States can regulate as long as their requirements do not conflict with federal standards. The PHSA, ERISA, and IRC enforce federal health insurance standards for different types of private-sector health coverage. The Secretaries of HHS, Labor, and Treasury have interpretive and enforcement authority. PHSA applies to health insurance issuers in individual and group markets, ERISA regulates employer-provided health coverage, and IRC applies to self-insured governmental plans. ERISA regulates health coverage provided by private sector employers, including insured and self-insured group health plans. It does not apply to governmental or church plans. The IRC covers employment-based group health plans, including church plans, but not health insurance issuers. Enforcement mechanisms vary among the statutes, with states primarily enforcing private health insurance requirements for health insurance issuers. The Secretary enforces provisions of Title XXVII of the PHSA when states fail to do so. Regulations outline the procedure for determining federal enforcement. Some states lack authority to enforce ACA's health insurance market reforms. The Secretary can impose a civil monetary penalty on non-compliant insurance issuers, with a maximum penalty of $100 per day per individual. The Secretary can impose a civil monetary penalty of $100 per day per individual for violations of PHSA provisions. Penalties may vary based on previous compliance record and can be challenged in a hearing before an administrative law judge. Health insurance issuers can sell coverage through state-based or federally-facilitated exchanges. These exchanges must offer qualified health plans and adhere to PHSA insurance market reforms. States enforce exchange standards, and the Secretary of HHS oversees governmental plans. Penalties for violations can be challenged in a hearing before an administrative law judge. The Secretary of Health and Human Services enforces PHSA requirements for governmental plans, including those under ACA. ACA's provisions are part of ERISA, with the Secretary of Labor enforcing against employer group health plans. Section 502(a) of ERISA allows civil actions by participants or beneficiaries against group health plans and health insurance issuers. The Supreme Court has found that Section 502(a) of ERISA contains federal remedies and preempts state law claims. This can impact a plaintiff's ability to recover damages under state law. Section 502(a)(1)(B) allows a participant or beneficiary to bring an action against a plan to recover benefits or enforce their rights under the plan. Section 502(a)(1)(B) of ERISA allows a plaintiff to sue for unpaid benefits, seek future benefits, or prevent benefit denials. Compensatory or punitive damages are not available under this section. The group health provisions in the Internal Revenue Code apply to all group health plans except governmental plans and health insurance issuers. Excise taxes enforce group health plan requirements. The excise tax for group health plans is imposed on the plan under multiemployer plans. Noncompliance with IRC requirements may result in a tax penalty of $100 per day per individual. Penalties increase if failures are not corrected before a tax examination, starting at $2,500 and up to $15,000 for violations. Limitations on the tax may apply in certain circumstances. ACA provisions are referenced in these regulations. The ACA provisions are incorporated into the IRC, and failure to comply may result in an excise tax for group health plans. The PHSA, ERISA, and IRC outline enforcement mechanisms for violations."
