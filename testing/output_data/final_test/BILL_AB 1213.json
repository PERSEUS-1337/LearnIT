    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Chapter 2.7 of the Government Code establishes a statewide database for Global Positioning System (GPS) device data of offenders monitored by criminal justice agencies. This database aims to enhance supervision practices, promote rehabilitative services, assist investigations, and ensure offender accountability and community safety. The Department of Justice implements and maintains the Offender Global Positioning System Database for criminal justice agencies. Definitions for terms like \"Alert,\" \"Database,\" \"GPS device,\" \"Monitoring agency,\" \"Offender,\" and \"Reporting cycle\" are provided in this chapter. The Department of Justice is responsible for developing specifications and standards for offender GPS devices, ensuring they transmit data to the database at specified intervals. Data elements include latitude, longitude, offender's information, and device identification number. The GPS device must be able to receive commands from the database regardless of reporting cycle. The Department of Justice will develop specifications for a database that receives data from GPS devices, allowing users to track offenders' proximity and create monitoring alert zones. These zones include inclusion and exclusion areas triggering alerts if offenders leave or enter them. The database allows users to send commands to GPS devices, track offenders' locations, and consult with various entities during development. The California Police Chiefs Association, California Peace Officers\u2019 Association, and GPS device industry representatives may designate representatives to work with the Department of Justice to develop functional specifications and standards for GPS devices used by criminal justice agencies. Agencies should have the ability to choose from different manufacturers and vendors, promoting competition and preventing limitations to one supplier. The Department of Justice in California collaborates with various entities to develop functional specifications and standards for GPS devices used in monitoring offenders. These specifications are reviewed every three years to ensure they meet law enforcement needs and incorporate technological advancements. The Department of Justice in California provides connections to a database for sheriff's and probation department systems in each county. Before connecting, operating policies and security requirements must be adopted. Reimbursement for state-mandated costs will be made to local agencies if determined by the Commission on State Mandates."
