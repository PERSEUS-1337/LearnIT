    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Hydropower Improvement Act of 2010\" and includes a table of contents. The \"Hydropower Improvement Act of 2010\" includes provisions for grants, research, and development to increase hydropower production, streamlining review processes for hydropower projects, and worker training. It also addresses non-Federal hydropower development and a pumped storage study. Congress acknowledges that hydropower is the primary source of clean, renewable electricity in the United States, accounting for 7% of the nation's electricity generation and avoiding 225,000,000 metric tons of carbon emissions annually. With only 3% of the 80,000 dams in the U.S. currently generating electricity, there is significant potential for expanding hydropower generation, including efficiency improvements and capacity additions in every state. Hydropower in the United States has the potential to create new green jobs, increase clean energy generation, and provide ancillary benefits like grid reliability and energy storage. In this Act, a \"conduit\" is defined as a manmade water conveyance for distribution, and the \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy. Congress supports increasing hydropower resources to create green energy jobs and improve environmental quality. Grants are available for hydropower production improvements. The Secretary of Energy will establish a program to provide competitive grants for efficiency improvements and capacity additions at hydroelectric facilities, adding hydropower to nonpower dams, developing pumped storage facilities, addressing aging infrastructure, and developing hydroelectric generation within existing conduits. Terms and conditions for grant eligibility will be determined by the Secretary. The Secretary will ensure that powerhouses and projects needing new dam infrastructure are eligible for grants under this program. The program will be funded with $50,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2011 to 2015, with a limit of 20% for individual projects. Compliance with specific sections of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 is required. The program will fund research, development, and demonstration to increase hydropower capacity with $50,000,000 allocated annually from 2011 to 2015. Compliance with the Energy Policy Act of 2005 is mandatory. The Secretary must establish a plan to promote hydropower renewable resources and coordinate research on advanced hydropower technologies. The plan must be implemented promptly and reviewed annually. The program will be funded with $50,000,000 annually from 2011 to 2015, in compliance with the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The Secretary will coordinate activities with other programs and federal research programs. $50,000,000 annually from 2011 to 2015 will be used for this section in compliance with the Energy Policy Act of 2005. SEC. 7. NOTICE OF INQUIRY FOR MINIMAL IMPACT HYDROPOWER PROJECTS. The Commission defines \"minimal impact hydropower project\" as the addition of hydropower generation to an existing nonpower dam without significant environmental impact or closed-loop hydropower storage that does not require changes to existing river structures. Within 180 days of enactment, the Commission must issue a notice of inquiry for licensing proposed minimal impact hydropower projects. The Commission must issue a notice of inquiry for licensing proposed minimal impact hydropower projects that can be licensed within 2 years. Within 180 days of completion, a report on the inquiry results must be submitted to the Senate and House committees. FERC has the authority to extend preliminary permit terms for up to 2 additional years if activities are carried out in good faith and with reasonable diligence. Additionally, there is a streamlined review process for conduit hydropower projects. The Federal Power Act is amended to specify that hydroelectric projects using only the hydroelectric potential of a conduit on non-Federal or Federal lands are eligible. A savings clause excludes certain reclamation projects from this section, defining a conduit as a manmade water conveyance like a tunnel or canal. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will establish a streamlined process for environmental impact statements and expedited approval for conduit hydropower projects within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Commissioner of Reclamation and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will conduct public workshops and pilot projects to identify ways to reduce barriers for conduit hydropower projects and develop innovative solutions. The Commissioner of Reclamation and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will conduct workshops and pilot projects to reduce barriers for conduit hydropower projects. A report with recommendations for the conduit approval process will be submitted to Congress, and funding of $5,000,000 will be available for pilot projects from 2011 to 2015. Funding of $5,000,000 will be available for pilot projects from 2011 through 2015. SEC. 10. NON-FEDERAL HYDROPOWER DEVELOPMENT AT BUREAU OF RECLAMATION PROJECTS. SEC. 11. PUMPED STORAGE STUDY. Conduct a study on pumped storage to improve coordination and timeliness of non-Federal hydropower development at Bureau of Reclamation projects. The Secretary, in coordination with the US Geological Survey, will conduct a study on Federal land suitable for pumped storage near renewable resource sites. A report on the findings and recommendations must be submitted to the Senate and House Committees within a year. Additionally, there is a National Renewable Energy Deployment Program. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to establish a national renewable energy deployment program and a renewable energy construction grants program under the Secretary's authority. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to establish a national renewable energy deployment program and a renewable energy construction grants program under the Secretary's authority. The Secretary shall prioritize applicants with power costs 125% or more of national retail costs or those replacing fossil fuel projects with renewable electricity projects. SEC. 13 amends the American Clean Energy Leadership Act of 2009 to include hydroelectric power technology training. SEC. 14 requires a report on a memorandum of understanding on hydropower. SEC. 14 of the Act requires a report on the memorandum of understanding on hydropower, focusing on actions taken by relevant agencies to streamline the Federal permitting process for hydropower projects. SEC. 15 states that the Act does not apply to hydroelectric projects marketed by Federal Power Marketing Administrations and does not impact any additions or improvements to hydroelectric generation at Federal projects. It also clarifies that existing law allows Federal Power Marketing Administrators to modify operations at Federal projects with hydropower facilities. SEC. 16 of the Act addresses the budgetary effects and compliance with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010. The determination of budgetary effects will be based on the latest statement submitted by the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee before the vote on passage."
