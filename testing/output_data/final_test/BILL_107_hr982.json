    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Stabilization and Pacification of Southern Serbia Act\" and includes findings. Congress finds that in June 1999, NATO military operations in Kosovo led to the withdrawal of Serbian forces. A Military Technical Agreement created a Ground Safety Zone extending into southern Serbia, restricting the entry of Yugoslav or Serbian forces without KFOR permission. Incidents of infiltration by ethnic Albanian guerrilla forces from Kosovo into southern Serbia within the Ground Safety Zone (GSZ) were reported by KFOR during the winter of 1999-2000. The Liberation Army of Presevo, Medvedja, and Bujanovac (UCPMB) aimed to liberate the ethnic Albanian population from Serbian and Yugoslav authorities through tactics like assassinations and intimidation. United States and Russian troops in KFOR encountered these activities while patrolling on December 17, 2000. Federation troops in KFOR patrolling the boundary with Serbia were attacked by ethnic Albanians trying to infiltrate the GSZ from Kosovo. The Government of Macedonia has taken steps to establish normal relations with Kosovo. Fighting erupted along the border between Serbia and Macedonia in the village of Tanusevci on February 26, 2001. SEC. 3. POLICY. The Government of Macedonia has taken steps to establish normal relations with Kosovo. Fighting erupted along the border between Serbia and Macedonia in the village of Tanusevci on February 26, 2001. The United States Government aims to promote dialogue between the Albanian community in southern Serbia and Serbian authorities, address security issues in the Presevo valley with NATO and Serbian authorities, and encourage cooperation between Yugoslavia, Serbia, and Macedonia for border demarcation. The United States aims to support border demarcation between Serbia and Macedonia, maintain security along the border, establish international monitoring if requested, and oppose changes to Kosovo's political status until violence subsides. The United States supports border demarcation between Serbia and Macedonia, maintains security along the border, and opposes changes to Kosovo's political status until violence subsides. Separatist violence in southern Serbia or Macedonia has ceased. SEC. 4. PROHIBITION OF FUNDS. Prohibition of funds for assistance to Kosovo under certain conditions after June 30, 2001, unless the President certifies that residents or citizens of Kosovo are not supporting ethnically-motivated violence in southern Serbia. The major Albanian political parties of Kosovo are working to stop ethnic violence within Kosovo, and residents of Kosovo are not aiding organizations supporting ethnically-motivated violence in Macedonia. The President can waive these conditions if certified to Congress. If the President certifies to Congress by June 30, 2001 that it is in the national interests of the United States, certain conditions can be waived."
