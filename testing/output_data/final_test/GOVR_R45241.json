    "content": "Senate Rule XIX outlines language that violates decorum in debate, including imputing unworthy conduct or motives to a Senator and speaking offensively about any State of the Union. These rules prohibit any form of words that impugn a sitting Senator, including quotes or articles. These specific examples of disorderly language were added to the Senate's rules in 1902. The Senate has always emphasized decorum in debate, with rules to sanction Senators for disorderly language. Rule XIX, added in 1902, prohibits language that imputes motives or maligns a state. These concepts stem from English parliamentary practice and are not exhaustive. The Senate has rules to sanction Senators for disorderly language in debate, with Rule XIX prohibiting remarks about the House of Representatives and its Members. However, the rule does not apply to comments about the President, Vice President, or Administration officials. The presiding officer decides if a Senator has used disorderly language, with a mechanism for appeal to the full Senate. Rule XIX of the Senate allows the presiding officer to call a Senator to order for disorderly language during debate. The Senator must then take their seat and may not continue without Senate approval. Appeals can be made to the full Senate regarding the ruling of the presiding officer. Rule XIX of the Senate allows the presiding officer to call a Senator to order for disorderly language during debate. Appeals can be made to the full Senate regarding the ruling of the presiding officer, with the process involving the exceptionable words being taken down in writing and read at the table for the information of the Senate. The Rule XIX call to order is rarely formally invoked, with the presiding officer usually issuing a warning or reminding the Senate of the rules of decorum. However, a formal call to order can be made by any Senator who believes another Senator has transgressed the rules of decorum in debate. Rule XIX of the Senate allows the presiding officer to call a Senator to order for disorderly language during debate. A Senator can also call another Senator to order under Rule XIX, with the presiding officer able to do so without a formal call from the floor. The rule can be invoked at any time upon its violation, and any Senator can demand objectionable words to be read aloud. Rule XIX of the Senate allows the presiding officer to call a Senator to order for disorderly language during debate. A Senator can also call another Senator to order under Rule XIX. The chair would rule on whether the words in question were disorderly. If a Senator violated Rule XIX, they would be directed to take their seat. The ruling can be appealed by any Senator. The presiding officer can call a Senator to order for disorderly language under Rule XIX. If found in violation, the Senator must take their seat and can be appealed by any Senator. The appeal is debatable but can be tabled. A sanctioned Senator may not speak without Senate permission, but can be recognized on another matter. When a Senator is found to have violated decorum in debate under Rule XIX, their objectionable words may be stricken from the Congressional Record by unanimous consent or motion. The motion to proceed in order can be made by a Senator in possession of the floor, allowing the offending Senator to continue speaking. The mechanism for addressing disorderly language in Senate debate has been in place since the 1st federal Congress in 1789-1790, with Rule XIX allowing objectionable words to be removed from the Congressional Record by unanimous consent or motion. The Senate's Rule XIX allows the President to determine order without debate, with the option to call for the sense of the Senate. Amendments in 1856 and 1962 refined the call-to-order process for addressing disorderly conduct during debates. The 1856 amendment refined the call-to-order process in the Senate, requiring a Senator to immediately take their seat when called out for disorderly conduct, as illustrated in an exchange between Majority Leader Scott Lucas and the presiding officer in 1950. The Vice President clarified that Rule XIX does not give the Chair authority to determine if a Senator is violating it. The rule states that if a Senator is called out for violating it, they must take their seat regardless of what they are saying. Even if a Senator is reciting the Lord's Prayer, they must sit until permitted to continue. The 1962 amendment changed the interpretation of this rule. The 1962 amendment to Rule XIX changed the interpretation so that the presiding officer must rule on disorderly words before a Senator is required to be seated, preventing simple allegations from taking a Senator off their feet. The evolution of the Senate's call to order rule from 1789 to present is outlined in Table 1, showing amendments, rule text, and additional context. Rule XIX is rarely formally invoked but referenced in floor debates for maintaining decorum. The Senate's call to order rule under Rule XIX is rarely formally invoked but serves as a reminder to maintain decorum. Instances of formal calls to order are identified through full-text searches of the Congressional Record and Senate Journal. The most recent example occurred on February 7, 2017, when a Senator was called out for quoting a former Senator and reading passages that negatively characterized another Senator. The speaking Senator was warned about violating Rule XIX provisions for disorderly language. Despite objections, the Senator was instructed to sit down and appealed the ruling. The ruling was upheld after a quorum was established, and a subsequent motion to allow the Senator to continue speaking was rejected. Senators have used various techniques to address Rule XIX without formally calling for order. Senators have used informal methods to address disorderly language without formally calling for order, showing a preference for comity and senatorial courtesy over strict procedure. In a recent incident on January 21, 2018, a Senator requested Rule XIX to be read aloud during a heated debate on government funding. In a recent incident on October 4, 2013, a Senator mentioned Rule XIX standards of decorum in a debate on government funding, but did not formally call for order. The presiding officer read Rule XIX aloud for all Senators to hear, highlighting the importance of decorum in floor debates."
