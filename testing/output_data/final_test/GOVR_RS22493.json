    "content": "The Animal Welfare Act (AWA) applies to various warm-blooded animals used for research, exhibition, or as pets, excluding birds, rats, and mice bred for research, horses not used for research, and farm animals for food production. Retail pet facilities are not covered unless they sell wild or exotic animals. Cold-blooded animals like fish and reptiles are also excluded. An amendment in 2002 expanded the definition of \"animal\" to include birds, rats, and mice, but implementation is pending. Animal dealers and exhibitors must obtain a license with an annual fee. APHIS is working on a final rule for this change. APHIS issues licenses for facilities after inspections to ensure compliance with regulations. Those conducting research and carriers transporting regulated animals must register and undergo inspections. Dealers, including pet and laboratory animal breeders, auction operators, and sellers of exotic animals, need an APHIS license. Class A licensees breed and raise animals they sell, while Class B licensees are others. Retail pet stores, hobby breeders, animal shelters, and boarding kennels are exempt. Exhibitors must also be licensed by APHIS. Animal transporters, dealers, research facilities, and exhibitors must be licensed by APHIS. Class C licensees include zoos, circuses, and marine mammal shows. Agricultural shows, fairs, and private collectors are exempt. Animal fighting is prohibited by the AWA. The Animal Welfare Act (AWA) prohibits animal fighting, including dogfights, bear and raccoon baiting, and bird fights in most states. Spectators at animal fighting venues are now also in violation of the AWA. Retail pet stores were originally exempt from AWA licensure, but a regulatory change now requires them to be licensed and inspected. Retail pet stores are now defined as places where buyers can personally observe the animals prior to purchase. The Animal Welfare Act (AWA) now requires licensure and inspection for retail pet stores selling animals in face-to-face transactions. The regulation exempts sellers with less than $500 gross income from animal sales and allows up to four breeding female dogs or cats without AWA licensing. All licensed entities must comply with USDA-APHIS regulations on humane handling, shelter, feeding, sanitation, and veterinary care. (AWA regulations are found at 9 C.F.R. \u00a71.1 et seq.) APHIS's Animal Care (AC) program oversees AWA implementation. APHIS's Animal Care program oversees AWA implementation with a budget of $28 million in 2015. Inspections are conducted at registered facilities to ensure compliance with rules, with research facilities inspected annually. Federal research institutions are exempt from AWA licensing and inspection. Inspections for other facilities are based on risk, with moderate-risk facilities visited yearly. Failure to correct deficiencies can lead to confiscation of animals, fines, or license suspensions. OIG audit in 2010 focused on large-scale dog dealers not providing humane treatment. The OIG audit in 2010 found that AC did not aggressively enforce the Animal Welfare Act against violators, including dealers with repeated violations and breeders selling animals online. APHIS implemented most of the OIG's recommendations, including changing the definition of retail pet stores to no longer exempt those not selling animals in face-to-face transactions. The original law, known as P.L. 89-544, was passed in 1966 as the \"Laboratory Animal Welfare Act.\" The \"Animal Welfare Act\" of 1966 requires dealers in dogs and cats for research to obtain a USDA license and follow humane treatment requirements. It also mandates registration for research facilities using dogs or cats and sets humane handling standards for certain animals. Farmers and pet owners are exempt, and there are provisions for recordkeeping and penalties for noncompliance. The 1970 Animal Welfare Act covers warm-blooded animals used for experimentation or exhibition, excluding certain horses and farm animals. The 1976 amendments added Section 26, addressing animal fighting and prohibiting sponsoring or exhibiting animals in fights, interstate shipment for fights, and advertising such ventures. Hunting animals are generally exempt from the regulations. The 1985 amendments to the Animal Welfare Act, passed as part of the Food Security Act, set new minimum standards for the care of animals in transport and commerce. The law also includes provisions for research facilities to minimize pain and stress to animals, with a focus on the well-being of dogs and primates. The Animal Welfare Act amendments established an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee for oversight of animal experimentation, increased penalties for violations, and created an animal welfare information center. The 1990 farm bill extended protections for pets in shelters and research facilities, requiring a five-day hold period for dogs and cats before sale to dealers. Dealers must provide certified records on animal origin. Additional recordkeeping requirements were specified in the 2002 Farm Security and Rural Investment Act. The 2002 Farm Security and Rural Investment Act increased penalties for violating the Animal Welfare Act, specifically regarding bird fighting. It also excluded birds, rats, and mice bred for research purposes from AWA coverage. The FY2001 agriculture appropriation bill blocked a rule change regarding the Animal Welfare Act (AWA). The 2002 law made the exclusion of birds, rats, and mice bred for research purposes permanent. A 2007 law made violating animal fighting provisions a felony punishable by up to three years in prison. In 2002, animal fighting sanctions were removed from the farm bill, prompting calls for stronger deterrents due to the association with criminal activity and risks to public health. Opponents argued that such measures would infringe on states' rights and citizens' economic freedoms. The 2008 farm bill (P.L. 110-246) strengthened penalties for animal fighting activities, increasing maximum imprisonment to five years from three years. This provision was based on bills introduced after the indictment of Michael Vick on dog fighting charges. The bill also required regulations prohibiting the importation for resale of dogs. The 2008 farm bill strengthened penalties for animal fighting activities, including increasing maximum imprisonment to five years. Regulations were also put in place to prohibit the importation for resale of dogs unless they met certain criteria. Additionally, there were exemptions for specific purposes such as research and veterinary treatment. The maximum penalty for a general violation of the act was increased to $10,000 per violation. Live dogs imported into the US for resale, research, or veterinary treatment required an import permit from APHIS. Animal fighting and hosting exhibitions were prohibited, but attendance at such events was not. The Animal Fighting Spectator Prohibition Act was reintroduced in the 113th Congress to address this issue. The 2014 farm bill introduced a \"de minimis\" provision to the Animal Welfare Act, giving APHIS discretionary authority to exempt certain animal dealers and exhibitors from licensing and registration requirements based on business size. This provision is expected to allow many current dealers and exhibitors to avoid APHIS registration and licensing. The Horse Protection Act (HPA) prohibits soring of horses, primarily used in Tennessee Walking Horses. APHIS administers the HPA and conducts inspections at horse events. The 1976 Horse Protection Act Amendments established the Designated Qualified Person (DQP) Program for inspections. The Designated Qualified Person (DQP) Program was implemented in 1979 to detect sored horses at events. DQPs are USDA-accredited individuals with equine experience. A 2010 report by USDA's Office of the Inspector General highlighted shortcomings in the inspection process, including lax enforcement and inadequate self-regulation within the industry to prevent horse abuse. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service acknowledged the need for better enforcement of regulations under the Horse Protection Act (HPA). The Prevent All Soring Tactics (PAST) Act aims to ban \"action devices\" on certain horse breeds, modify the inspection system, and impose stricter penalties for HPA violations. This act would also eliminate industry-selected inspectors and require APHIS to appoint inspectors for HPA-regulated activities. The bill aims to increase penalties for violations of the Horse Protection Act (HPA), including raising the maximum fine to $5,000 and increasing the maximum prison sentence to three years. Trainers with three violations could face a lifetime ban from participating in horse shows, exhibitions, or auctions. The definition of \"event management\" would be expanded to include \"sponsoring organizations\" and \"event managers,\" making them potentially liable for HPA violations. Animal welfare organizations support the bill, while horse breeder associations generally oppose it. The Horse Protection Amendments Act of 2015 (H.R. 4105 / S. 1161) would establish a Horse Industry Organization governed by a nine-member board, with members appointed by the Commissioners of Agriculture for Tennessee and Kentucky. The Horse Protection Amendments Act of 2015 proposes a nine-member board to govern a Horse Industry Organization. Members would be appointed by the Commissioners of Agriculture for Tennessee and Kentucky, with additional representatives from the Tennessee Walking Horse Industry. The board would establish requirements for inspectors and prohibit conflicts of interest. The New York Times exposed animal welfare issues at the U.S. Meat Animal Research Center, prompting the Secretary of Agriculture to order a review and appoint an animal welfare ombudsman. The appointment of an animal welfare ombudsman was announced to oversee USDA's review of animal welfare at the U.S. Meat Animal Research Center and other ARS laboratories. Legislation was proposed to amend the Animal Welfare Act to include farm animals and federal research institutions under its regulations. Critics argue that Class B dealers prioritize profit over animal welfare by sourcing dogs and cats from random sources. The National Research Council (NRC) report from May 2009 found that while random source dogs and cats are important for research, they can be obtained from shelters and other sources instead of Class B dealers. Only 11 out of over 1,000 Class B dealers in the US acquire and sell live dogs and cats for research. The report focused on the advantages and disadvantages of using random source dogs for research. The report discusses the advantages and disadvantages of random source dogs and cats for research, evaluating the Class B dealer system and offering alternative options for obtaining animals. The Pet Safety and Protection Act aims to limit the sources of random source animals to licensed dealers, pounds/shelters, or donors who bred and raised the animal. The Animal Emergency Planning Act would require research facilities, animal dealers, and handlers to plan for disasters to protect vulnerable animals. The Enforcement Transparency Act would mandate the Secretary of Agriculture to publish guidelines on USDA's website for calculating civil fines under the AWA, with quarterly updates in the Federal Register. The Planning Act would require facilities to have a contingency plan for animal care during emergencies. The Orca Responsibility and Care Advancement Act aims to protect marine mammals by prohibiting their capture and breeding for public display. Animal welfare activists oppose hauling horses in double-decker trailers. The National Wildlife Refuge System allows wildlife trapping in many refuges, using traps that can harm non-target animals. The Refuge from Cruel Trapping Act aims to ban body-gripping traps in wildlife refuges to prevent cruelty. In March 2015, APHIS considered petitions to amend AWA regulations, including defining \"alternatives\" for research models and clarifying \"painful procedures\" causing more than momentary distress to animals. APHIS is currently considering public comments and supporting documents received by May 29, 2015 regarding the social and psychological well-being of primates in captivity. The New England Anti-Vivisection Society filed a petition with APHIS asking for specific rules on the care of all primates regarding their social and psychological well-being."
