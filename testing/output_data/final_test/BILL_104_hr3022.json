    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Cardiac Arrest Survival Act\". The Congress finds that increasing the number of individuals trained in lifesaving first aid, especially in responding to cardiac arrest, could save many lives. Approximately 350,000 individuals die from cardiac arrest each year due to various causes such as cardiovascular diseases, drownings, drug sensitivity, drug toxicity, and electrical shock. Over 65 percent of cardiac arrest deaths occur before victims reach hospitals. While CPR is crucial in responding to cardiac arrest, it alone cannot stop ventricular fibrillation in the heart. Ventricular fibrillation can be terminated with a defibrillator, especially in nonhospital settings. The most effective response to cardiac arrest includes recognizing warning signs, calling 911, performing CPR, and using an automatic external defibrillator. Establishment of a program for training in lifesaving first aid under Title XII of the Public Health Service Act, including CPR and AED use. The Secretary will implement a program to provide training in lifesaving first aid, including developing demonstration projects, recommendations, data collection, and evaluations. Training criteria will include techniques based on the victim's age, with specific criteria for infants and children. The Secretary will provide training in lifesaving first aid, including criteria for different age groups such as infants and children, training for the general public and health professionals as first responders, and recommendations for State policies on first aid provision. The Secretary will provide recommendations to States on first aid policies, including considerations for health professionals' licensure and training for 911 operators in instructing callers on lifesaving first aid. The Secretary will provide recommendations to States on first aid policies, including considerations for health professionals' licensure and training for 911 operators in instructing callers on lifesaving first aid. Additionally, the need for individuals in various fields such as law enforcement, fire fighting, education, sports, daycare, school transportation, and lifeguarding to undergo training in lifesaving first aid as a condition of employment is being evaluated. The Secretary may develop recommendations for Federal policies on providing lifesaving first aid, including suggestions on Federal laws. The Secretary may consult with experts on training in lifesaving first aid techniques based on victim age and may provide grants and contracts to public and private entities for training programs. \"SEC. 1272. AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATION AS RESPONSE TO CARDIAC ARREST.\" The Secretary must comply with specific requirements related to the use of automated external defibrillators in carrying out section 1271. This includes demonstration projects, training criteria, and recommendations regarding their use. Additionally, when providing recommendations to states, the Secretary must consider additional factors related to state policies. The discussion revolves around the requirement of automatic external defibrillators in public gathering places, patient-transport vehicles, and the policy regarding non-health professionals using such devices. The discussion focuses on policies regarding the use of automatic external defibrillators by health professionals and non-health professionals, potential modifications to tort laws, and liability protection under Good Samaritan laws. The Secretary will develop recommendations for Federal policies on the use of automated external defibrillators, including considerations for Federal laws in various settings such as office buildings and military facilities. The Secretary will develop recommendations for Federal policies on the use of automated external defibrillators, including considerations for Federal laws in various settings such as office buildings and military facilities. The discussion includes whether automatic external defibrillators should be required at Federal sites and if individuals should be trained in their use. Additionally, there is a consideration for modifying tort laws to limit compensation for manufacturers of these devices to ensure their economic feasibility. SEC. 1273. COLLECTION OF DATA; EVALUATIONS. The Secretary will collect data on cardiac arrest incidence, injuries leading to such conditions, age relevance, survival rates, and effectiveness of first aid in the United States. Training of first responders in providing aid will also be evaluated. The Secretary will evaluate programs providing training in lifesaving first aid, including consideration of techniques based on the victim's age. The Secretary is required to submit a biennial report to Congress detailing the activities, demonstration projects, recommendations, and evaluations conducted under this part. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to automated external defibrillators, external defibrillators, first responders, and lifesaving first aid. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to the performance of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, use of automated or manual external defibrillators, and relief for obstruction of a breathing passage by a foreign object, including techniques based on the age of the victim. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 1996 through 2000 for carrying out CPR and defibrillator relief techniques."
