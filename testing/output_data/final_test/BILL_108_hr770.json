Congress finds that Americans value the pristine wilderness of public lands, especially the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, as a crucial ecosystem to preserve for future generations. President Dwight D. Eisenhower played a key role in initiating protection efforts. President Dwight D. Eisenhower established the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in 1960 to preserve wildlife and wilderness values. Congress further protected the area in 1980 with the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, doubling the refuge's size and extending wilderness protection. The House of Representatives passed legislation to protect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, including the Arctic coastal plain, from industrial development. Canada has also taken steps to preserve its side of the wilderness ecosystem. The House of Representatives passed legislation to protect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, including the Arctic coastal plain, to preserve the habitat of the Porcupine River caribou herd that migrates annually through both countries. The extension of full wilderness protection for the Arctic coastal plain aims to honor bipartisan efforts in protecting the unique ecosystem while allowing for energy development in other parts of Alaska to meet the energy needs of the United States. The House of Representatives passed legislation to protect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, including the Arctic coastal plain, to sustain the natural treasure for current and future generations of Americans. The House of Representatives passed legislation to protect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, including the Arctic coastal plain, to sustain the natural treasure for current and future generations of Americans. This includes the designation of additional wilderness in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Alaska. The House of Representatives passed legislation designating approximately 1,559,538 acres of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska as wilderness, in line with the Wilderness Act. This area will be administered by the Secretary of the Interior according to the provisions of the Act."
