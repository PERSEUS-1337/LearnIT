    "content": "Variational autoencoders (VAEs) use Bayesian probabilistic inference to learn a low-dimensional manifold from high-dimensional data. The type of bound used as a cost function heavily influences the latent representation and performance of VAEs. Research has focused on developing tighter bounds than the original ELBO to better approximate the true log-likelihood. This study explores q-deformed bounds, such as ELBO and IWAE, and the upper bound CUBO, to contribute to this research direction. This study explores q-deformed bounds to improve the performance of Variational Autoencoders on the binarized MNIST dataset. Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are powerful Bayesian probabilistic models that combine neural networks with Bayesian inference. They consist of an encoder mapping high-dimensional input data to a low-dimensional latent representation through posterior probability distribution. Variational inference is used to optimize a tractable bound on the model evidence instead of the intractable model evidence itself. The output model is typically set as a Bernoulli or Gaussian probability distribution. The output model for VAEs is set as p(x|z), with a prior distribution of the latent space as p(z). The true posterior distribution, p(z|x), is unknown and intractable, so an approximate posterior distribution, q(z|x), is learned using the ELBO as a lower bound on the model evidence. The ELBO serves as the cost function during training, with the first term representing the reconstruction loss and the second term measuring the difference between the approximate posterior and the prior distribution. The performance of VAEs heavily relies on the type of bound used in training. A significant amount of work has been done to replace the ELBO with tighter bounds on the model evidence. The IWAE is one of the tightest bounds of VAEs, but increasing the number of importance samples in the objective can make learning more difficult due to increased noise in the gradients. Several strategies, like MIWAE, aim to address this issue. The IWAE is a tight bound on VAEs, but increasing importance samples can add noise. Different algorithms like CIWAE and PIWAE offer variations. Using R\u00e9nyi \u03b1-divergence leads to diverse bounds on model evidence, with lower bounds becoming competitive with IWAE at \u03b1 \u2192 \u2212\u221e. Tightening these bounds is done through importance sampling in BID15. The study tightens R\u00e9nyi \u03b1 bounds in BID15, replacing it with \u03c7 2 divergence for an upper bound on model evidence in CUBO BID1. The bounds lose interpretability as reconstruction loss and KL divergence, becoming just a cost function. The K-sample GLBO BID11 unifies different approaches with convex and concave functions. The study introduces maximizing \u03c6-evidence score with a concave function, offering flexibility in VAE training objectives. The CLBO provides a lower bound surpassing IWAE objective. The study introduces q-deformed functions to derive tighter lower bounds on model evidence in VAEs. Two novel lower bounds are derived by replacing the logarithm function in existing bounds with the q-deformed logarithm function. These bounds are shown to be closer to the true log-likelihood in experiments. The study introduces q-deformed functions to derive tighter lower bounds on model evidence in VAEs. Two novel lower bounds, qELBO and qIWAE, are introduced by replacing the logarithm function with the q-deformed logarithm function. The tightness of the gap between the classical logarithm function and the q-deformed one depends on the hyperparameter q, which can be optimized efficiently using standard algorithms. The q-entropy, introduced in previous work, extends traditional statistical mechanics to explain anomalous physical systems with rare events. The q-deformed logarithmic function is introduced to derive tighter lower bounds on model evidence in VAEs. By optimizing the hyperparameter q, an upper bound on the ELBO and IWAE can be obtained. Training a variational autoencoder with qELBO and qIWAE bounds involves replacing the logarithm function with its q-deformed version. This optimization algorithm for q is identical for both types of q-deformed bounds. The method for optimizing the hyperparameter q in q-deformed bounds involves starting with an initial value of q, computing the qELBO lower bound and CUBO upper bound, setting a desired value for qELBO*, finding the optimal value q*, and applying gradient descent using the scipy optimization package in Python. This process is repeated for all training batches in experiments conducted on the MNIST dataset. For experiments on the MNIST dataset BID5, a one-stochastic layer architecture is used with 200 nodes in the encoder and decoder, and a latent space dimension of 50. The approximate posterior is modeled as a Gaussian distribution with a diagonal covariance matrix. The output model is a Bernoulli distribution for each pixel. The binarized MNIST dataset from tensorflow is used with 55000 training images and 10000 test images. The learning rate is fixed at 0.005. Newly derived q-deformed bounds are compared with ELBO and IWAE on the benchmark binary MNIST dataset BID5, showing improvements on the test set. The study compares newly derived q-deformed bounds with ELBO and IWAE on the binary MNIST dataset. The bounds are computed with different numbers of samples, and the performance of the algorithms is illustrated on reconstructed and randomly generated images. The qIWAE algorithm with K=50 samples is evaluated after 3000 epochs of training. The study compares q-deformed bounds with ELBO and IWAE on binary MNIST images. The q-deformed bounds provide a more accurate approximation of the model evidence during training. Significant improvements are seen over traditional ELBO, with a large decrease in bound value for qELBO variants. The study explores tighter bounds on the model evidence of VAEs using the q-deformed logarithm function. The q-deformed bounds show promise in improving the estimated true log-likelihood compared to classical bounds. Training with these novel bounds as the cost function may enhance the learning ability of VAEs. Preliminary experiments indicate the merit of this approach, suggesting further research to produce more accurate bounds and assess their impact on VAE performance. In addition to investigating the impact of tightening the ELBO and IWAE on the learning process and latent space structure, the study aims to explore different optimization strategies for q in VAEs. The research will also focus on applying q-deformed bounds to study disentanglement in VAEs and compare them with other bounds on benchmark datasets."
