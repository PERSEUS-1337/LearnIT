Depository institutions are prohibited from engaging in unfair or deceptive practices related to overdraft coverage. They must disclose overdraft fees in marketing materials and obtain consumer consent for charging fees on ATM withdrawals or debit card transfers. Additionally, institutions are required to provide consumer disclosures. Each depository institution must clearly disclose to consumers in their overdraft protection program that they may be charged a limited number of overdraft fees per month and year. The institution also has the discretion to pay or reject overdrafts beyond these limits. Information about alternative overdraft products must be provided, including terms and fees. Each depository institution offering an overdraft coverage program must disclose all overdraft fees charged to consumers in periodic statements. The institution cannot include the overdraft coverage amount in the consumer's account balance information and must promptly notify consumers when overdraft coverage is accessed.

Institutions must also offer the same terms for transaction accounts to consumers who do not opt into overdraft coverage programs. Non-sufficient fund fee limits apply to ATM and debit card transactions. Depository institutions cannot report negative information on overdraft coverage to consumer reporting agencies under certain conditions.

The GAO will conduct a study and report as required by SEC. 6. The Comptroller General will study the feasibility of depository institutions providing a warning to consumers at point-of-sale terminals about potential overdraft fees and allowing them to cancel the transfer. The study will evaluate the benefits to consumers and the technology available for such warnings. The Comptroller General will submit a report to Congress on the feasibility of depository institutions providing a warning to consumers about potential overdraft fees at point-of-sale terminals.
