    "content": "The international saga of Andrew Speaker, a traveler with XDR-TB, raised legal and public health issues regarding containing contagious disease threats. TB is a bacterial infection spread through coughing or sneezing. The risk of transmitting TB on airplanes is influenced by factors such as disease extent, exposure duration, and ventilation. The World Health Organization reports that one in three people worldwide is infected with dormant TB bacteria, which can become active due to lowered immunity. Antibiotic resistance, including multi-drug resistant TB, is increasing due to medication misuse. Multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) is resistant to two effective antibiotics, while extensively drug resistant TB (XDR-TB) is resistant to first-line and second-line drugs. XDR-TB poses limited treatment options and can be deadly. In 2006, WHO issued a global alert about XDR-TB's potential to transform treatable infections into deadly diseases. In 2007, a man with XDR-TB traveled from Atlanta to Europe, raising concerns about transmission. The CDC confirmed that a patient was infected with XDR-TB and tried to prevent his return to the US via public transportation. The patient flew to Canada and entered the US by car. Despite alerts to CBP, he was not stopped at the border. He voluntarily went to a hospital in New York City where CDC issued a federal order of provisional quarantine. Mr. Speaker, infected with multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), was treated at the National Jewish Medical and Research Center in Denver. He underwent surgery to remove diseased tissue from his lung and was released on July 26, 2007, deemed non-contagious. He continued antibiotic treatment for two years under observation by health authorities. The Eleventh Circuit reversed the district court decision in a case where Mr. Speaker sued the CDC for violating the Privacy Act by disclosing his medical information. This prompted the expansion of public health measures for individuals with serious communicable diseases who disregard medical advice regarding travel. Quarantine and isolation measures are important public health tools. Quarantine separates individuals exposed to infection but not yet ill, while isolation separates infected individuals. Federal government has jurisdiction over interstate and border quarantine, outlined in Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act. The \"Do Not Board\" list was implemented in response to the Andrew Speaker incident in 2007. The Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) has the authority to enforce regulations to prevent the spread of communicable diseases, including infectious tuberculosis. In 2000, interstate quarantine authority was transferred to the director of the CDC. The CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine now handles interstate and foreign quarantine measures. HHS collaborates with DHS and its agencies, including U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the United States Coast Guard, to enforce quarantine rules. Other federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies may also assist in enforcing quarantine and isolation measures when authorized by the federal government. The primary authority for quarantine and isolation exists at the state level, with CDC deferring to state and local health authorities. Federal quarantine authority is rarely used, typically in time-sensitive situations like events at ports of entry. The federal statute does not directly address individuals, as seen in the case of Andrew Speaker. The federal statute authorizing quarantine authority does not address persons leaving the country, focusing on those entering the US or moving between states. Quarantine historically kept people out of an area or contained them if contagious, but in the age of global travel, detaining individuals to prevent the spread of infectious diseases may be necessary. The CDC proposed changes to quarantine regulations in 2005, the first significant revision in 25 years. The CDC proposed significant revisions to quarantine regulations in Parts 70 and 71, stemming from experiences during the SARS outbreak in 2003. The changes aimed to enhance reporting requirements for ill passengers on flights and ships from foreign countries, requiring detailed contact information and electronic submission of passenger lists to the CDC. The regulations also addressed due process rights of passengers facing quarantine after potential exposure to disease. CDC Director Dr. Julie Gerberding summarized efforts to control drug-resistant tuberculosis, emphasizing the need for preparedness in state and local TB programs, widespread TB training for healthcare providers, efficient lab testing for drug susceptibility, and collaborative isolation and quarantine measures with local health authorities. This response was prompted by the Andrew Speaker incident. The public health Do Not Board (DNB) list was developed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the CDC in response to the Andrew Speaker incident. It allows health officials to restrict individuals with communicable diseases from boarding commercial flights to prevent the spread of diseases. State and local health officials contact their local CDC quarantine station to place a person on the DNB list. The CDC determines if a person is likely contagious with a serious public health threat, unaware of public health recommendations, or likely to board a commercial aircraft. Once on the DNB list, airlines are instructed not to issue a boarding pass for domestic or international flights to or from the US. Noncontagious individuals are removed from the list within 24 hours. The list is not limited to specific diseases. The CDC released a report in September 2008 analyzing the first year's experience with the DNB list. 42 requests were received to add persons with suspected or confirmed pulmonary TB to the list, with 33 approvals. Two individuals on the list attempted to evade air travel restrictions and were detained. The CDC emphasized the importance of using the DNB list to prevent the spread of communicable diseases during air travel. The World Health Assembly revised the International Health Regulations in 2005, expanding the scope to include a wider range of diseases and emergencies. The new regulations require countries to notify WHO of potential public health emergencies. Compliance with the previous regulations was uneven due to resource limitations and political factors. The International Health Regulations (IHR) of 2005 require State Parties to notify WHO of potential public health emergencies and provide information. The IHR also include provisions for national points of contact, disease control measures, and recommend control measures that are not overly restrictive. The IHR were agreed upon through consensus among member states and aim to prevent the international spread of disease. The regulations are binding on all WHO member states, with some exceptions like the United States accepting them with reservations. The United States accepted the IHR(2005) with reservations related to federalism principles. State Parties have a two-year period to assess and develop plans for meeting surveillance and response capacities. Within five years, public health infrastructure must be in full compliance. Nations can implement additional health measures in accordance with the IHR. The IHR(2005) allows nations to implement additional health measures in response to specific health concerns, with the requirement to provide public health rationale and scientific information to WHO if the measures significantly interfere with international traffic. WHO updated its aviation guidelines for tuberculosis prevention in June 2008, noting that TB and other airborne infectious diseases can fall within the scope of the IHR(2005) in cases of serious public health risks. The guidelines require airline companies to comply with IHR requirements, including detection and control of public health risks. Confidentiality issues may arise when health authorities request passenger and crew lists for public health reasons. The situation presented by Andrew Speaker raises a civil rights issue regarding individual liberty versus the common good, balancing constitutional rights with community needs in the context of public health regulations. The advance of medical treatments, including antibiotics, has emphasized the civil rights of individuals with contagious diseases. Classic public health measures like quarantine and isolation are still used in certain situations. Balancing individual rights with public health needs in a modern culture is a critical issue, with constitutional rights to due process and equal protection being implicated. In O'Connor v. Donaldson, the Supreme Court ruled that a state cannot confine a non-dangerous individual who can safely live independently or with the help of family or friends without due process. However, a highly contagious individual with a serious illness may be subject to involuntary confinement if there is no less restrictive alternative. The lesson of Donaldson is that involuntary confinements must be carefully examined to comply with due process rights. It raises the question of whether less restrictive programs should be considered before resorting to isolation or quarantine. Unequal treatment of socially disfavored groups in quarantine raises equal protection issues, as seen in Wong Wai v. Williamson where Chinese residents were mandated to quarantine for bubonic plague. The court struck down a resolution suggesting a particular race was more susceptible to the plague, citing violation of the equal protection clause. While the Constitution does not explicitly grant a right to travel, the Supreme Court recognizes a fundamental right to travel. Restrictions on travel, like identification policies for boarding airplanes, have generally been upheld as constitutional. Public safety arguments could justify travel restrictions for serious public health threats, depending on the threat's severity and the due process procedures followed. Discrimination issues also arise in quarantine situations, as seen in cases like Wong Wai v. Williamson involving Chinese residents quarantined for bubonic plague. Discrimination against individuals with infectious diseases may be covered by federal laws like Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and the Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA). Individuals with contagious diseases may not be granted access to public places or employment if it poses a significant risk to others. The Supreme Court addressed discrimination issues related to tuberculosis and Section 504 in School Board of Nassau County v. Arline, emphasizing the need for individualized inquiries to prevent discrimination based on prejudice or fear. The Supreme Court addressed discrimination issues related to contagious diseases in School Board of Nassau County v. Arline, emphasizing the need for individualized inquiries to prevent discrimination based on prejudice, stereotypes, or unfounded fear. The Court adopted the test enunciated by the American Medical Association (AMA) amicus brief, considering factors such as the nature, duration, severity, and probabilities of disease transmission. The ADA provides nondiscrimination protections to individuals with contagious diseases while balancing public health concerns. Title I of the ADA prohibits employment discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities, including those with contagious diseases. The law allows for requirements to protect the health of others in the workplace. Similarly, Title III prohibits discrimination in public accommodations, stating that entities are not required to allow individuals with contagious diseases to participate in their services. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is tasked with maintaining a list of infectious diseases that may be transmitted through handling the food supply. Title II of the ADA requires individuals to be \"qualified\" to access state and local government services, meaning they must meet essential eligibility requirements. The term 'direct threat' refers to a significant risk to others' health or safety that cannot be eliminated by policy modifications or auxiliary aids. This interpretation aligns with Title III's stance on discrimination in public accommodations. The ADA's legislative history discusses contagious diseases and the need for qualification standards to protect public health. The ADA's legislative history discusses qualification standards for employment under Title I, including the requirement that individuals with contagious diseases must not pose a direct threat to others in the workplace. The Air Carrier Access Act prohibits discrimination based on disability but does not specifically mention communicable diseases in its statutory language. The ADA and its regulations consider individuals with communicable diseases as individuals with disabilities. Carriers are prohibited from refusing transportation, requiring a medical certificate, or imposing additional conditions unless the individual poses a direct threat to others' health or safety."
