    "content": "The \"Child Support Reserve Trust Act\" requires states to establish a reserve trust system for child support. This system must meet specific requirements outlined in the Social Security Act. The \"Child Support Reserve Trust Act\" mandates states to establish a State reserve trust unit to enforce laws requiring procedures for withholding anticipated future child support on real property sales or refinancing. The \"Child Support Reserve Trust Act\" requires withholding net proceeds from property sales or refinancing to apply to overdue support, determine future child support, and hold funds in trust for the benefit of the child. The \"Child Support Reserve Trust Act\" mandates withholding proceeds from property sales or refinancing to address overdue child support, ensuring funds are held in trust for the child's benefit. If all other remedies are insufficient, withheld amounts are promptly applied to satisfy overdue child support obligations. The State reserve trust unit adjusts support obligations for a child and distributes withheld amounts to the person if they do not owe overdue child support. The section defines \"anticipated future child support\" as the present value of future support payments due when the support obligation finally ceases, which can happen when the child reaches a certain age or due to death. The support obligation can be terminated due to a final judicial act or other circumstances under State law that result in permanent cessation, substantial, and not just a change in custody."
