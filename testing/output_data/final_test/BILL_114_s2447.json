The relationship between the United States and Vietnam has grown substantially since the end of the trade embargo in 1994, with annual trade reaching over $36 billion in 2014. However, Vietnam's economic progress has not been accompanied by improvements in political freedom or human rights. Vietnam remains an authoritarian state ruled by the Communist Party, denying the people the right to free and fair elections. According to the Department of State's 2014 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, Vietnam faces severe government restrictions on political rights, civil liberties, and due process rights. The government restricts speech criticizing leaders, political pluralism, and policies on sensitive matters. The Department of State documents arbitrary arrest and detention of political activists in Vietnam, with 29 activists sentenced in 2014. Some were convicted on national security charges for undermining unity policy, causing public disorder, and abusing democratic freedoms. By the end of 2014, over 125 political prisoners were reportedly held by the government. Nguyen Van Hai and Phan Thanh Hai were sentenced to prison for criticizing the Government and Communist Party of Vietnam in old blog posts. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights criticized the harsh prison terms as a violation of freedom of expression in Vietnam. Vietnam has faced criticism for backsliding on freedom of expression issues, with people being prosecuted for online speech under strict national security laws. The Constitution of Vietnam guarantees freedom of religion, but concerns remain about violations of this right. The Department of State's 2013 International Religious Freedom Report and the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom 2015 Annual Report highlight restrictions on religious freedom in Vietnam, with unregistered groups facing harassment and punitive actions. The Vietnamese government controls all religious activities, severely restricts independent practice, and represses individuals challenging its authority. The 2013 Annual Report noted Vietnam's designation as a country of particular concern for religious freedom in 2004, leading to positive changes. However, since the designation was lifted in 2006, religious freedom conditions in Vietnam have deteriorated. The 2013 Annual Report highlighted that after Vietnam was designated as a country of particular concern for religious freedom in 2004, there were positive changes. However, since the designation was lifted in 2006, religious freedom conditions in Vietnam have worsened. Testimonies suggest that religious freedom in Vietnam has been stagnant for several years. Sanctions imposed on individuals complicit in human rights abuses against Vietnamese nationals or their family members. In this section, definitions are provided for terms like \"admitted\", \"alien\", \"immigration laws\", and \"national\" as per the Immigration and Nationality Act. The term \"appropriate congressional committees\" refers to specific committees in the Senate and House of Representatives. The term \"Convention against Torture\" refers to the United Nations Convention against Torture. The United Nations Convention against Torture, signed in 1984, defines \"United States person\" as a citizen, lawful resident, or entity under US laws. The President must impose sanctions on individuals complicit in human rights abuses. The President must submit a list of Vietnamese nationals complicit in human rights abuses to Congress within 90 days of the Act's enactment. The list will be updated annually and made publicly available. The President must submit a list of Vietnamese nationals complicit in human rights abuses to Congress within 90 days of the Act's enactment. The list will be updated annually, made public, and individuals on the list are prohibited from entering the United States. The President is required to submit a list of individuals involved in human rights abuses in Vietnam to Congress. These individuals will be banned from entering the United States, and financial sanctions will be imposed on them if their property is in the US or controlled by a US person. The President can make exceptions to comply with international agreements. The Agreement signed between the United Nations and the United States allows the President to waive sanctions on individuals if it is in the national interest. Sanctions will be terminated when the President certifies that the Government of Vietnam has met certain conditions. The Government of Vietnam must release all political prisoners, stop violence and abuse during peaceful political activities, and investigate and prosecute those responsible for abuses against activists. The Sense of Congress on the designation of Vietnam as a country of particular concern with respect to religious freedom is highlighted in Section 4. The sense of Congress is that the relationship between the US and Vietnam is hindered by Vietnam's deteriorating human rights record. Designating Vietnam as a country of particular concern for religious freedom would help address abuses and promote respect for human rights, as recommended by the US Commission on International Religious Freedom."
