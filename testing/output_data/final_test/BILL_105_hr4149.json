    "content": "The Forest Service Cost Reduction and Fiscal Accountability Act of 1998 includes provisions such as a Short Title, Findings, Definitions, All Resources Reporting System, Limitations on costs charged to off-budget funds, Disclosure of indirect expenditures and general administration costs in annual budget requests, Cost reduction strategic plan, and Audit requirements. Congress finds that indirect expenditures and overhead costs within the Forest Service have significantly increased, hindering its ability to manage the National Forest System effectively. The Comptroller General reports an 80 percent increase in indirect expenditures for off-budget funds, now exceeding 27 percent of total annual expenditures. Forest Service data shows a 46 percent increase in general administration costs for the Federal timber sale program between 1992 and 1996, now making up 31 percent of total program costs. These costs exceed the combined total costs of various program components like environmental analysis, appeals, road maintenance, and reforestation. The Forest Service lacks a financial accounting system to manage expenditures, leading to declines in services provided to the public. A comprehensive strategy is needed to reduce indirect costs associated with managing the National Forest System. The Forest Service must establish tangible objectives and performance measures to measure agency performance and identify results. Any comprehensive strategy to manage indirect and total expenditures associated with the National Forest System should maintain or increase goods and services provided to the public and other users. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. For purposes of this Act, \"budget request\" refers to the Forest Service budget justification documents submitted to the Committee on Appropriations in support of the President's budget. \"General administration\" includes amounts for management and administrative support. \"Indirect expenditures\" cover support activities and other expenses like salary, travel, training, and vehicle use. Indirect expenditures cover various costs such as salary, travel, training, and nonpersonnel expenses related to office operations and employee workspaces. This includes expenditures for line officers, program support, and providing space for employees. The off-budget fund refers to trust funds or permanent appropriations administered by the Forest Service, including the brush disposal fund, cooperative work-other fund, Knutson-Vandenberg fund, and reforestation trust fund. The reforestation trust fund, salvage sale fund, and roads and trails fund are established under specific sections of laws. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the Chief of the Forest Service. SEC. 4. ALL RESOURCES REPORTING SYSTEM. The Secretary must implement an accounting system called the \"All Resources Reporting System\" within 180 days of the Act's enactment. This system will account for costs and revenues of Forest Service programs and must be fully implemented for all identified programs within two fiscal years. The system must include specific program areas. The All Resources Reporting System will account for costs and revenues of Forest Service programs, including land management planning, recreation use, rangeland management, timber management, vegetation management, soil/water/air management, minerals/geology management, wildlife/fisheries habitat management, land ownership management, infrastructure management, law enforcement operations, state/private forestry, and forest/rangeland research. Certain costs, like those of the commercial timber management program, will be allocated accordingly. The All Resources Reporting System will identify costs and revenues of Forest Service programs, including land management planning, timber management, vegetation management, and wildlife/fisheries habitat management. Indirect expenditures and general administration costs will be clearly identified for each program, with separate reports for each administrative unit. The Forest Service will ensure that the All Resources Reporting System complies with accounting principles. SEC. 5. LIMITATIONS ON COSTS CHARGED TO OFF-BUDGET FUNDS. The Secretary must cap total annual indirect expenditures from each off-budget fund at 20% of total expenditures within 90 days of the Act. A schedule to eliminate indirect expenditures from each fund by the end of the second full fiscal year must be prepared within 180 days of the Act, reducing indirect expenditures to at least 10% of total annual expenditures. SEC. 6. Disclosure of indirect expenditures and general administration costs in annual budget requests. SEC. 6 requires the Secretary to disclose indirect expenditures and general administration costs for each budget line item, expanded line item, or program in annual budget requests. This includes the total amount and percentage of these costs for the current fiscal year and the preceding three fiscal years. The Secretary must prepare a five-year strategic plan within 180 days of the Act's enactment to reduce indirect expenditures and costs while enhancing goods and services in the National Forest System. The plan includes implementing the All Resources Reporting System, eliminating off-budget funds' indirect expenditures, and annually identifying direct and indirect expenditures. The Secretary must prepare a five-year strategic plan to reduce indirect expenditures and costs while enhancing goods and services in the National Forest System. This includes implementing the All Resources Reporting System, eliminating off-budget funds' indirect expenditures, and establishing a framework for reducing total expenditures charged to each program by the Washington, regional, forest, and ranger district offices. Additionally, there is a plan to improve cost-effectiveness through increased private-sector contracting and providing annual incentives for meeting schedules. The Secretary must consult with the Comptroller General and the Inspector General of the Department of Agriculture to prepare a strategic plan. An annual review of the plan's implementation will be included in the budget request, detailing modifications and accounting changes. Changes to accounting methods for expenditures and administration costs in the previous fiscal year, along with updates on private contracting demonstration projects under subsection (e) and their outcomes. The Secretary may conduct projects to test cost-effectiveness of private contracting for Forest Service activities. SEC. 8. AUDIT REQUIREMENTS. The Comptroller General must provide an annual evaluation to Congress on the effectiveness of the strategic plan implementation. Additionally, a comprehensive audit will be conducted after five years to analyze expenditure trends and the effectiveness of the plan. The Comptroller General will evaluate the implementation of the strategic plan and its impact on indirect and total expenditures in various offices. Recommendations for further improvement will also be provided."
