    "content": "Federal advisory committees provide advice to the federal government from nonfederal sources. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) was passed in 1972 to address concerns about duplication and inefficiency in existing advisory committees. FACA sets requirements for advisory committees, including reporting and oversight procedures. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) sets requirements for advisory committees, ensuring fair balance, objective advice, and public accessibility. The General Services Administration (GSA) oversees FACA regulations and maintains the FACA Database. The GSA Administrator conducts annual reviews of FACA committees to assess their effectiveness and potential consolidation or abolition. The GSA Administrator has the authority to request necessary information from agencies for annual reviews of FACA committees. GSA collected data in paper form until 1997, when agencies started reporting directly into the FACA Database, managed by GSA. The database is a shared management system for accurate and timely information on committee membership, operations, and costs. Agency employees interpret data requests within the database, which may lead to varied interpretations. The accuracy and completeness of data in the FACA Database have not been independently validated by CRS. Data reporting in the database may be inconsistent, with some elements required and others optional. Agencies may report subcommittee meetings, membership, and costs, but it is not mandatory. Some agencies report subcommittee details according to committee charter requirements. The FACA Database requires all committee and subcommittee costs to be aggregated and reported as total costs. If a FACA committee does not report subcommittee information, users may not know if subcommittees exist. The total number of advisory committees established by the executive branch must not exceed 534, as per GSA's interpretation of Executive Order 12838 and OMB Circular A-135. The agency has a limit on the number of discretionary advisory committees it can create, with the overall governmentwide cap set at 534 total committees. Agencies must provide a \"determination of need\" for new discretionary FACA committees, even if they are within their allocated ceiling. There are no restrictions on the number of advisory committees Congress and the President can establish. The total number of advisory committees cannot be determined, but Figure 1 shows the total number of active FACA committees from FY2004 to FY2015. In FY2009, there were 907 active FACA committees, increasing to 1,029 in FY2011, and then 1,009 in FY2015. The number of FACA committees required by statute increased from 459 to 539 (+14.8%) from FY2004 to FY2015. The number of new active FACA committees created annually declined from 66 to 42 (-36.4%) during the same period. In FY2015, the Department of Health and Human Services reported the largest number of FACA committees with 248, accounting for 25.6% of total active FACA committees. GSA requires FACA committees to report their primary function, with options including non-scientific program advisory board, scientific technical program advisory board, national policy issue advisory board, grant review committee, special emphasis panel, regulatory negotiations committee, or other committee. Of the 1,009 advisory committees active in FY2015, 26.3% acted as non-scientific program advisory boards and 19.5% acted as scientific advisory boards. In FY2015, FACA committees served various functions: 19.5% as scientific technical program advisory boards, 13.2% as national policy issue advisory boards, 8.9% as grant review committees, 2.6% as special emphasis panels, and 29.1% as \"other\" committees. Approximately 70,000 members serve on FACA committees annually, with varying numbers of members per committee. In FY2015, FACA committees had around 70,000 members annually, with the exception of FY2009 when membership increased by 28.4% to 81,947. The growth in membership that year was mainly due to committees advising on the distribution of funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The increase was driven by a rise in peer review consultants at the National Institutes of Health. From FY2009 to FY2014, FACA member levels declined 16.8%, led by the decrease in peer review consultants. However, from FY2014 to FY2015, the number of members increased by 5.9%. The growth in membership mainly came from increases in peer review consultants and special government employees. In FY2015, FACA committees saw a 5.9% increase in members, with growth mainly from peer review consultants and special government employees. Some committees reported unlimited members, while others had specific membership caps. The Department of Health and Human Services FACA committee has the largest number of members at 11,620. Committee members are selected based on expertise or experience in policy or research. Not all members have to adhere to ethics and financial disclosure requirements like federal government employees. Some members may represent private companies to ensure industry interests are considered in policy decisions. Table 2 shows the number of committee members by designation category. The FACA Database defines peer review consultants as individuals qualified by training and experience in scientific or technical fields, serving on Department of Health and Human Services committees to provide expert advice on grant applications or proposals. They are expected to identify conflicts of interest that could bias their evaluations. In FY2015, approximately half of all FACA committee members served as peer review consultants, providing expert advice on grant applications or contract proposals. Peer review consultants must recuse themselves from reviewing proposals if there is a conflict of interest, which can include being a salaried employee of the applicant or a close relation. The Director of NIH can waive recusal requirements if no other expert advice is available. In FY2015, 32.3% of FACA members were special government employees (SGEs) subject to ethics and financial disclosure regulations. SGEs are defined as officers or employees of the U.S. government or its agencies, serving for up to 130 days within a 365-day period. GSA defines representative members as individuals selected for federal advisory committees to provide outside interest group perspectives. Representative members on federal advisory committees are selected to represent the point of view of a group or particular interest, such as industry, labor, or consumers. They do not need to disclose financial information as they serve to represent an interest. In the context of federal advisory committees, a small number of FY2015 FACA committee members were regular government employees subject to federal ethics requirements, including financial disclosures and outside employment restrictions. Ex officio members serve on committees by virtue of holding a specific governmental or organizational position. Ex officio members, who may be government employees or private sector individuals, serve on federal advisory committees without specified ethical requirements in the FACA Database. In FY2015, 720 ex officio members (1.0% of total) participated in advisory committees, some without voting rights. A total of 791 federal advisory committees held 7,494 meetings in FY2015, with 218 committees not holding any meetings. The Center for Scientific Review Special Emphasis Panel held the most meetings in FY2015, with 1,034 meetings. The number of meetings held per year by federal advisory committees increased by 11.2% from FY2004 to FY2015. The number of meetings has been inconsistent over time, with a decrease from FY2005 to FY2008, followed by an increase from FY2008 to FY2011. The increase in FY2011 was due to a significant rise in meetings by committees with a function of \"Other.\" Meetings then dropped in FY2012 by 8.2% to 6,996 meetings. The number of federal advisory committee meetings increased each year, reaching 7,494 in FY2015. Closed meetings inconsistently increased, with some declines in FY2010, FY2011, and FY2012. The number of closed meetings has increased by 14.9% since FY2012, with FY2015 having the highest reported percentage of closed meetings at 71.1%. Open meetings remained relatively steady, with some fluctuations in FY2011, FY2012, FY2013, and FY2014. The number of open meetings increased from 1,647 in FY2014 to 1,782 in FY2015. In FY2015, the majority of grant review committee and special emphasis panel meetings were closed to the public, accounting for 99.7% of closed FACA committee meetings. Grant review committees and special emphasis panels held 40.7% and 28.0% of federal advisory committee meetings, respectively. Since 2010, committees have been required to report the \"attendance type\" of meetings. Since FY2012, technology's role in federal advisory committees has increased, with webcast meetings up by 17.7%, teleconference meetings up by 46.5%, and videoconference meetings up by 130%. In FY2015, 53.2% of meetings were a mix of in person and virtual, 28.5% were in person, 16.2% were virtual, and 3.2% did not report attendance type. Scientific technical advisory board committees and special emphasis committees had the highest proportion of meetings. In FY2015, a majority of federal advisory committee meetings were a mix of in-person and virtual, with scientific technical advisory board committees and special emphasis committees holding the highest proportion of these mixed meetings. The majority of mixed committee meetings used a combination of virtual categories, with grant review and special emphasis committees leading in this regard. Teleconference was also commonly used in mixed meetings. Additionally, a majority of virtual committee meetings were held by teleconference. A majority of virtual committee meetings were held by teleconference, with non-Scientific, Scientific, National Policy, Special Emphasis, and Other committees leading in this trend. The total annual operating costs for federal advisory committees decreased by 3.3% from FY2004 to FY2015, totaling $367,568,370 in constant 2015 dollars. From FY2014 to FY2015, total annual operating costs for federal advisory committees increased by $32,917,950 (9.8%) primarily due to higher federal staff salaries. Despite fluctuations, there is a general trend of decreasing costs over time. Salary costs for federal staff, nonfederal members, nonmember consultants, and regular government employee members all saw increases. Since FY2004, federal staff has accounted for the largest proportion of FACA salary costs, increasing gradually from $164,550,752 in FY2004 to $205,500,103 in FY2015. In FY2015, federal staff costs increased by 6.2% from the previous year. Meanwhile, salary costs for nonfederal employees have decreased over the last five years. Table 7 shows that 90.3% of committees included salaries for federal staff in their costs. Since FY2004, FACA committees have reported salary costs for federal staff, as well as \"travel and per diem\" and \"other\" costs. The \"travel and per diem\" category includes all travel and per diem expenses authorized by 5 U.S.C. \u00a75703 for federal employees, federal members, nonfederal members, and consultants. \"Other\" costs encompass expenses like meeting room usage, transcript creation, and website maintenance. From FY2004 to FY2015, both \"travel and per diem\" and \"other\" costs fluctuated similarly, reaching peak levels in FY2006. From FY2004 to FY2015, FACA committees reported fluctuating \"travel and per diem\" and \"other\" costs, with peak levels in FY2006. Costs decreased from FY2008 to FY2010 but rose again until FY2015. Overall, \"travel and per diem\" costs decreased by 31.1%, while \"other\" costs decreased by 18.2%. In FY2015, 715 committees reported $57,241,860 in \"other\" costs. In FY2015, 715 committees reported $57,241,860 in \"other\" costs, averaging $80,059 per committee. The median for \"other\" costs per committee was $10,120, accounting for 15.4% of total committee costs. Travel and per diem costs varied widely, with 67.2% of committees reporting costs for nonfederal members and 11.9% for regular government employee members. Nonfederal member costs totaled $46,634,877, representing 85.1% of all travel and per diem costs in FY2015. In FY2015, the travel and per diem costs of advisory committees varied widely. Special emphasis panels had the highest average cost per committee at $2,766,336, with a wide range of costs from $15,815 to $29,107,010. The median cost for special emphasis panels was $1.285 million, providing a more accurate measure of costs. Averages do not reflect factors like number of meetings, members, and operations driving committee costs. In FY2015, special emphasis panels had the highest average cost per committee at $2,766,336, with a median cost of $1.285 million. The number of members and meetings likely influence costs incurred by committees, making it important for Congress to consider these factors when assessing advisory committee costs. Special emphasis panels have the highest average and median cost per committee ($2,766,336 and $1,285,711 respectively), with the highest number of members and meetings. Grant review advisory committees show similar costs due to more members and meetings. Federal advisory committees gather expertise but vary in structure and mission under FACA guidelines. FACA provides a common framework for federal advisory committees to communicate with the public and offer policy recommendations. Congress could amend FACA to potentially affect costs or operations. GSA requires committees to report certain data elements, but not others like subcommittee details. Congress could consider granting public access to data on subcommittee membership and costs. Access to data identifying subcommittee membership and costs could enhance transparency in FACA committee operations. However, reporting requirements may increase time spent on reporting and cause confusion over cost allocation between full committees and subcommittees. Clear guidelines from GSA on reporting procedures and data collection are necessary. Member names and affiliations are available in the FACA Database for easy access. Concerns exist over the consistency of member name inputs in the FACA Database. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell served on the most committees in FY2014, while the name \"John Williams\" appeared on 6 committees, raising questions about multiple individuals with the same name serving on advisory committees. Variations or misspellings of member names could lead to confusion for database users trying to identify the same person across different entries. The FACA Database may not effectively show when the same person serves on multiple committees, causing confusion for users. Legislation has been proposed to require unique identifiers for committee members to track their service accurately. This could help prevent identity mix-ups and provide a clearer picture of individuals' influence over time. Unique identifiers may provide anonymity for peer reviewers to protect them from criticism. However, public identification of grant committee members could deter qualified individuals from joining. Anonymity for grant reviewers may be necessary to prevent potential harm to relationships within academic communities. Congress may need to consider the trade-offs of implementing such changes to data entry practices in the FACA Database. In FY2015, FACA committee data showed that nonfederal members of federal advisory committees were paid $37.3 million, with an additional $46.6 million spent on travel and per diem costs. These members may represent private industry, government entities, or nonprofit organizations on the committees. In FY2015, 10 FACA committees compensated 659 representatives from universities or research institutions in addition to travel and per diem costs. These representatives can provide advice to the federal government without adhering to ethics requirements for federal employees, allowing them to benefit financially without recusal. Congress may consider whether these representatives should receive government compensation for their service. Congress may need to consider amending FACA to clarify if nonfederal members of advisory bodies should be compensated by the government. Providing compensation may attract more qualified members, as some may choose not to participate without fair compensation for their time and expertise. This could potentially reduce implementation costs by $37.3 million in FY2015. The analysis of FACA data shows that grant review committees and special emphasis panels hold a high percentage of closed meetings, with over 99.5% and 99.9% respectively in FY2015. Removing these committees from the analysis would increase the percentage of open FACA committee meetings from 24.8% to 73.5%. Grant review committees and special emphasis panels likely hold closed meetings for various reasons, such as allowing subject matter experts to provide honest advice on academic studies. Joining a FACA committee allows experts to provide honest advice on academic studies for federal grants. Meetings may be closed to protect proprietary information. FACA aims to make committee meetings transparent, but including committees with closed meetings may not align with this goal. Grant review committees and special emphasis panels have more meetings and members, showing differences in their operations compared to other committees. The text suggests that grant review committees and special emphasis panels within FACA may need to be removed from the jurisdiction of FACA to improve transparency. This could make oversight more challenging, but requiring these committees to report data elements to GSA could be a compromise solution. Legislation in the 114th Congress proposed amendments to the Federal Advisory Committee Act to address these issues. The Federal Advisory Committee Act Amendments of 2015 (H.R. 2347) would amend FACA by requiring clear designation of nonfederal advisory committee members, soliciting public input for committee member suggestions, appointing Advisory Committee Management Officers, and conducting reviews of agency compliance with FACA by the Government Accountability Office. The Federal Advisory Committee Act Amendments of 2015 (H.R. 2347) would require clear designation of nonfederal advisory committee members, solicit public input for member suggestions, appoint Advisory Committee Management Officers, and review agency compliance with FACA. Legislation similar to H.R. 2347 was introduced in previous Congresses. Raw data used to create figures and information on administratively inactive committees, committee membership, and meetings are provided in the report."
