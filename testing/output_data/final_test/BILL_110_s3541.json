SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\nIDPs are internally displaced people in Iraq. UNHCR refers to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Vulnerable populations in Iraq include various groups such as women at risk, elderly, survivors of violence, and religious minorities like Chaldo Assyrian Christians, Yazidis, and Baha'is. Since the start of the Iraq war, over 2 million Iraqis have fled to neighboring countries to escape violence. There are also more than 2.7 million internally displaced people in Iraq, lacking basic necessities. The security situation hinders aid provision, and the Iraq Study Group warned of a potential humanitarian crisis as more refugees relocate. Since March 2003, host countries have made it difficult for humanitarian agencies to reach Iraqi populations. While the United States has resettled less than 20,000 Iraqi refugees, Jordan and Syria have provided temporary asylum to 2,000,000 Iraqis. Sweden has accepted 40,000 Iraqi refugees, and Denmark has resettled 370 Iraqi interpreters and workers. The departure of the Danish contingent from Iraq in 2007 highlighted the challenges faced by Iraqi refugees.
