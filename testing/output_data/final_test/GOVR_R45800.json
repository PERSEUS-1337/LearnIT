    "content": "Historic preservation involves protecting sites, structures, and cultural resources of historical significance. Federal, state, and local government programs, along with private funding, support historic preservation in the United States. This report provides an overview of the federal role in historic preservation, including background and funding information for major programs authorized by Congress. Congress plays a key role in financing these programs through annual appropriations and reauthorization processes, making historic preservation a perennial interest for lawmakers. Some Members of Congress advocate for eliminating the federal role in historic preservation. Some Members support eliminating federal role in historic preservation, while others advocate for maintaining or increasing it. Recent natural disasters have highlighted the importance of incorporating preservation needs in federal disaster relief planning. The report outlines the federal government's historic preservation activities and grant programs. The report discusses various historic preservation programs such as HBCUs, JACS, NAGPRA, Save America's Treasures, and ABPP. It includes eligibility requirements, funding details, and potential issues for Congress to address. Early federal historic preservation efforts began in the 1890s. In the 1890s, Congress passed laws to protect ancient Puebloan sites and established Civil War national battlefield parks. The Antiquities Act of 1906 allowed the President to proclaim national monuments to preserve cultural resources on federal lands efficiently. This marked the genesis of the federal preservation program in the United States. The Antiquities Act of 1906 authorized the President to proclaim national monuments on federal lands containing historic landmarks and structures. Over 150 national monuments have been created since then. The Historic Sites Act of 1935 established a national policy on historic preservation, aiming to preserve historic sites, buildings, and objects of national significance for public benefit. The Historic Sites Act of 1935 established federal historic preservation activities under the National Park Service, leading to the designation of national historic landmarks. After World War II, rapid federal infrastructure projects caused destruction of historic buildings and cultural resources, prompting President Lyndon B. Johnson to address the issue. In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson convened a special committee on historic preservation, which led to the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA). The NHPA established the National Register of Historic Places, funded the National Trust for Historic Preservation, and required federal agencies to manage and preserve their historic properties. The National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 established the National Register of Historic Places and required federal agencies to manage and preserve historic properties. Congress has amended and expanded the NHPA multiple times, with the most recent amendment in 2016. Various federal programs and entities, including the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP), support historic preservation efforts in the United States. The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) oversees the Section 106 review process for federal agencies to assess impacts on historic properties before providing funding or licenses. ACHP is an independent agency funded through the Historic Preservation Fund (HPF) for preservation awards to states, tribes, local governments, and nonprofits. The Historic Preservation Fund (HPF) was established in 1976 to carry out activities specified in the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). It is funded through outer continental shelf mineral receipts and has been periodically reauthorized by Congress. Congress authorized the HPF to receive $150 million annually through FY2023, but has never fully appropriated this amount in a single fiscal year. The HPF funds historic preservation activities through formula-based grants and competitive grant programs. Most HPF funds are used for grants to SHPOs, THPOs, and CLGs. Congress also funds competitive grant programs for specific historic preservation activities. HPF grants are awarded annually to SHPOs of states, DC, and territories for various preservation activities. States receiving HPF funds are required to provide a 40% match, with flexibility to shape their historic preservation programs. SHPOs primarily use the funds for operational costs and programmatic activities. A portion of the allocations are sub-granted to assist CLGs with local preservation needs. Congress appropriated $49.7 million in FY2019 and $52.7 million in funding. Since 1996, NPS has awarded annual formula-based grants to Tribal Historic Preservation Offices (THPOs). Eligibility for grants is limited to federally recognized tribes with approved THPO agreements. THPOs must provide a program plan and have a 40% nonfederal match for activities like staff salaries, surveys, and compliance. The Tribal Historic Preservation Offices (THPOs) receive formula-based grants from NPS for various preservation activities. Congress allocated $11.7 million in FY2019 and $13.7 million in FY2020 for THPO grants. Additionally, 10% of annual HPF funding for State Historic Preservation Offices (SHPOs) must be sub-granted to Certified Local Governments (CLGs) for historic preservation efforts. CLGs are local government entities certified by NPS and SHPOs, demonstrating a commitment to preservation. The National Register of Historic Places is the official list of significant properties in American history, maintained by the Department of the Interior. Certified Local Governments (CLGs) receive funding from State Historic Preservation Offices (SHPOs) for preservation efforts, with states having the option to provide more than the required 10% pass-through. Grants are awarded through a competitive application process established by the SHPO. The National Register of Historic Places is maintained by the Department of the Interior under the authority of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). NHPA requires the Secretary of the Interior to develop guidelines for nominations, consider appeals, and make determinations of property eligibility. NPS has standards to help prepare nominations, typically coordinated by SHPOs, THPOs, or federal historic preservation offices. Various parties work through these offices to determine if a property meets listing criteria, with NPS deciding within 45 days of receiving a nomination. The National Register of Historic Places is overseen by the Department of the Interior through the National Historic Preservation Act. Properties can be listed within 45 days of a completed nomination, offering benefits such as access to federal grant funds and possible tax benefits. Listing does not restrict nonfederal owners, but properties must meet criteria to remain listed. The National Historic Landmarks program, like the National Register, is managed by the NPS and assists with nominations and technical support for landmarks. The National Historic Landmarks (NHL) program overseen by the NPS assists with nominations for new NHLs and provides technical assistance to existing landmarks. NHLs are places of national significance in U.S. history, listed in the National Register. Funding for NHLs falls under the National Register program, making them eligible for federal investment tax credits and consideration in federal undertakings. NHLs have a higher standard for protection than properties on the National Register under Section 106 of NHPA. The National Trust for Historic Preservation, chartered by Congress in 1949, encourages protection and preservation of historic American sites. It provides technical and educational services, promotes preservation activities, and administers grant programs with federal funding authorized in the NHPA of 1966. Federal funding for the National Trust in the NHPA of 1966 continued until FY1996, transitioning to private funding. From FY1998 to FY2001, there was no federal funding. In FY2002, Congress allocated $2.5 million from the HPF for an endowment. Additional funds were provided in FY2003 and FY2004. Funding from Congress ceased in FY2005, with the organization now relying on private donations. The Federal Historic Preservation Tax Incentives program, established in 1976, offers tax credits for rehabilitating certified historic structures. Property owners can receive a 20% federal tax credit for substantial rehabilitation while maintaining the building's historic character. Eligible buildings include those listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Federal Historic Preservation Tax Incentives program, established in 1976, offers tax credits for rehabilitating certified historic structures. Property owners can receive a 20% federal tax credit for substantial rehabilitation while maintaining the building's historic character. The program previously included a separate 10% rehabilitation credit for nonhistoric, nonresidential buildings built before 1936, but this credit was repealed in the 2017 tax revision. Over 44,000 projects have been completed under the program, leveraging more than $96 billion in private investment for the rehabilitation of historic properties. Congress has designated 55 national heritage areas (NHAs) since 1984 to protect and promote natural, cultural, historic, and recreational resources through partnerships with NPS, states, and local communities. National heritage areas (NHAs) are designated for distinctive lands with resources, built environment, culture, and history. NHAs are not part of the National Park System and have varied economic foundations like agriculture or industrial development. Each NHA has specific criteria outlined in enabling legislation, with a nonfederal management entity coordinating partners' work. Real property disposal is the process of federal agencies transferring or selling unneeded property. The federal government offers programs for state, county, and local governments, as well as nonprofits, to acquire surplus federal properties at no cost. Two programs focus on historic properties: the Historic Surplus Property Program and the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act Program. The NPS Historic Surplus Property Program, in partnership with the GSA, allows eligible applicants to obtain federally owned historic buildings listed in the National Register when declared surplus by the GSA. The NPS oversees the transfer of surplus historic properties, including lighthouses, to eligible entities. The National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act allows the U.S. Coast Guard to dispose of historic lighthouses listed in the National Register. The NHLPA allows the USCG to transfer historic lighthouses to eligible entities. Interested parties can acquire the light station at no cost by submitting a formal application to NPS for review. If no suitable applicants are found, the property is sold through competitive bid or auction. Congress may authorize NPS to establish national networks for preservation and education efforts. Congress has authorized the establishment of national networks for preservation and education efforts, including the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom, the African American Civil Rights Network, and the Reconstruction Era National Historic Network. Legislation is being considered to establish the African-American Burial Grounds Network. Sites in these networks can include federal, state, local, and privately owned properties with consent from owners. The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to provide educational materials, technical assistance, and develop a symbol/logo for the networks. The federal government supports historic preservation through various grant programs, with the largest funding source being the HPF. This funding supports state, tribal, and local historic preservation, African American civil rights grant programs, grants to underrepresented communities, tribal heritage grants, disaster recovery grants, and more. Other grant programs include funding for Japanese American confinement sites, Native American grave protection, and preservation grants for American battlefields. The federal government supports historic preservation through various grant programs, including funding for state, tribal, and local historic preservation, African American civil rights grant programs, grants to underrepresented communities, tribal heritage grants, disaster recovery grants, Japanese American confinement sites, Native American grave protection, and preservation grants for American battlefields. Congress and the executive branch use different designations for historic properties and sites, with details provided in Table 1 in the Appendix. The federal government provides technical and financial assistance for historic preservation through direct appropriations and grants to nonfederal entities. Funding is allocated to NPS-administered accounts within the annual Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill, supporting state, local, tribal governments, educational institutions, and nonprofit organizations in protecting cultural resources and promoting historic preservation activities in the United States. The funding is primarily distributed between the HPF and NR&P accounts, which fund federal historic preservation programs and other congressionally authorized grant programs. In 2016, Congress reauthorized deposits of $150 million annually into the HPF for FY2017 through FY2023. Regular appropriations to NPS's HPF account increased each year from FY2016 to FY2020. The FY2021 budget justification for NPS requests $40.7 million for HPF\u2014a 66% reduction in funding from FY2020 enacted amounts. This request would provide funding only for core grant-in-aid programs to SHPOs ($26.9 million) and THPOs ($5.7 million), as well as $8 million for grants to HBCUs. The FY2021 budget request for NPS includes $40.7 million for the HPF account, a 66% reduction from FY2020. Funding is allocated for core grant programs to SHPOs, THPOs, and grants to HBCUs. Congress also provides funding for other NPS-administered historic preservation grant programs under the NR&P account. The Administration requested a $33.9 million budget for NR&P in FY2021, a 52% reduction from FY2020. Historic preservation programs are a focus for Congress, with some supporting the elimination of federal involvement in funding and administration. There is debate on maintaining or expanding the federal role in historic preservation, with concerns about tension between preservation goals and federally controlled infrastructure projects. Federal funding for historic preservation programs is a topic of debate in Congress, with proposed budget cuts for FY2020 and FY2021. The House Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands expressed concerns about the impact of reduced grant funding on communities' ability to protect cultural and historical sites. The House Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands is debating federal funding for historic preservation programs, with concerns about proposed budget cuts for FY2020 and FY2021. Some argue that core NPS priorities like infrastructure should take precedence over historic preservation in funding allocation. Issues specific to NHPA and historic preservation laws are also being considered, such as the adequacy of the \"stop, look, and listen\" approach under Section 106 of NHPA. Some preservation advocates criticize the NHPA for not effectively protecting historic sites, as agencies are not legally required to address adverse effects on historic properties. Section 106 compliance can lead to delays and opponents may use it to stall federal projects. Some stakeholders find federal regulations for tailoring the Section 106 process time-consuming and not flexible enough for projects involving new technologies. Bills have been proposed to exempt or limit NHPA reviews for specific projects like rail and transit infrastructure. Various programs supporting historic preservation have also been under scrutiny, with inconsistencies noted in addressing National Register eligibility for railroad corridors. The National Register criteria are outlined in federal regulations, but inconsistent standards persist due to multiple entities conducting evaluations. Legislation has been proposed to establish a National Heritage Areas System to govern NHAs, with a focus on financial self-sufficiency and limiting federal funding. Congress also considers bills to designate historically important properties or areas. In the 116th Congress, P.L. 116-9 designated new historical sites and national heritage areas. Congress sometimes confers individual designations in law for historically significant properties. Various federal historic preservation grant programs require congressional action for new areas or designations. Table A-1 provides an overview of selected programs with a primary mission of historic preservation. In FY2020, Congress authorized new grant programs for historic preservation, including a civil rights grant program and two new grant programs under the American Battlefield Protection Program. These programs are subject to annual appropriations and eligibility requirements are yet to be published by the National Park Service. The new grant programs for historic preservation authorized by Congress in FY2020 are subject to annual appropriations and eligibility requirements, with details yet to be published by the National Park Service."
