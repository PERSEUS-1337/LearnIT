    "content": "American voters elect the President and Vice President of the United States through the electoral college system, which has resulted in contested outcomes in only a few elections. In some cases, candidates have won the presidency despite receiving fewer popular votes than their opponents, with the most recent instance occurring in 2000 when George W. Bush defeated Al Gore, Jr. In the 2000 presidential election, George W. Bush was elected President despite winning fewer popular votes than Al Gore nationwide. The close and contested results in Florida led to a prolonged struggle, culminating in a Supreme Court decision that certified Bush as the winner. The election highlighted issues with the electoral college system and election administration, leading to the enactment of the Help America Vote Act in 2002. The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) was passed in 2002 to address issues with voting administration and technology. It contrasted with the lack of legislative activity on electoral college reform. The electoral college system can only be changed through a constitutional amendment, making HAVA's passage significant. Proposals to alter or eliminate the electoral college have been consistently introduced in Congress since 1789. Two main categories of reform proposals have emerged: those advocating for direct popular election to replace the electoral college, and those aiming to fix perceived flaws in the current system. The direct election option would abolish the electoral college and elect the President and Vice President based on a nationwide popular vote. Proposals for direct popular election of the President and Vice President would require joint tickets of candidates, with a minimum threshold of 40% or a majority of votes needed to win. If no ticket reaches this threshold, a runoff election or Congress electing the winners in a joint session would be required. Supporters of direct popular election argue for its advantages. Supporters of direct popular election propose a simple, national, and democratic process where voters directly elect the President and Vice President. The candidates with the most popular votes would always win, and in case no one receives at least 40% of the vote, a runoff election or election by joint session of Congress would be held. Every vote would carry equal weight, regardless of location, eliminating potential complications. Direct election proponents argue that their system would eliminate complications that could arise under the current electoral college system, as winning candidates would be declared President and Vice President-elect as soon as popular returns are certified. They believe their plan is more democratic, despite critics pointing out potential flaws such as candidates winning with as little as 40% of the vote. Critics of direct election argue that the system could lead to acrimonious post-election struggles and undermine the stability of the federal government. They believe that close elections under direct election could result in nationwide disputes similar to the contested 2000 election, potentially harming political comity and legitimacy. Reform proposals for the electoral college include eliminating the office of elector and awarding electoral votes directly to candidates. Joint tickets of presidential-vice presidential candidates would be required, similar to direct election systems. The reform proposal for the electoral college suggests awarding all electoral votes in each state directly to the winning candidates based on the statewide popular vote. This would eliminate the \"winner-take-all system\" currently used in most states and the District of Columbia. Proponents argue that this change would maintain the balance between federal and state power, eliminate the possibility of \"faithless electors,\" and preserve the two-party system. The reform proposal for the electoral college suggests awarding electoral votes based on the popular vote in each congressional district, maintaining the two-party system. Opponents argue that the current system still allows for \"minority\" Presidents and does not recognize the views of voters who chose losing candidates. The proposal suggests awarding electoral votes based on the popular vote in each congressional district, reflecting the system used in Maine and Nebraska. Proponents argue that this method would better represent popular vote results and encourage voter involvement and party vitality in states dominated by one party. The district plan for awarding electoral votes based on popular vote percentages could potentially lead to minority Presidents and weaken the two-party system by promoting narrow geographical or ideological interests. Critics argue that it may encourage gerrymandering and disadvantage certain parties in presidential elections. Proponents of proportional electoral vote plans argue that it is a reform that comes closer to electing the President and Vice President by popular vote while still preserving the state's role in elections. Voters in Colorado rejected a proposed rounded proportional system in 2004. Proponents of proportional electoral vote plans argue that it reduces the likelihood of \"minority\" presidents and reflects public preferences more fairly. Opponents claim it retains indirect election of the President and could lead to more frequent electoral college deadlocks. Defenders of the electoral college argue that it is not undemocratic as electors are chosen by voters in free elections. The system was intended by the founders to involve citizens in a federal election for the President, with each state tallying votes. They believe the allocation of electoral votes, including the \"constant two\" for each state, is a federal element in the constitutional system. Defenders of the electoral college argue that it is a federal element in the constitutional system, justifiable like equal representation in the Senate. They believe the additional electors assigned to each state's House delegation compensate for any distortion. They reject the idea that less populous states are advantaged, pointing out that states like California have a significant voting power advantage due to their high number of electoral votes. The electoral college system promotes political stability by requiring parties to campaign nationally for a majority of electoral votes. Critics argue that the system is cumbersome, potentially anti-democratic, and in need of reform. The faithless elector phenomenon is dismissed as insignificant, with only nine electoral votes cast against instructions since 1820, none of which influenced an election outcome. Many reform plans aim to eliminate the office of elector to address this issue. The electoral college system is criticized as potentially anti-democratic and outdated. Direct election supporters argue that it is an 18th-century anachronism that does not accurately reflect state population changes. They also find the 12th Amendment provisions for contingent elections to be undemocratic. Critics of the electoral college system argue that it gives disproportionate advantage to less populous states, allows for political mischief with \"faithless electors,\" disenfranchises voters of losing candidates, and is a target for reform proposals like the automatic plan. Despite states allowing for the choice of electors by popular vote, state legislatures can still override this decision and select electors through other means. This option was considered in Florida in 2000 during post-election recounts. The electoral college system can result in candidates winning with fewer popular votes, as seen in 2000, 1888, and 1876. This highlights the potential for politically motivated state legislators to change the outcome arbitrarily. The Every Vote Counts Amendment, H.J.Res. 8, introduced in 2005, aimed to enable direct popular election of the President and Vice President. It also granted Congress and states the authority to establish voter qualifications. Sections 1, 3, 4, and 5 addressed the election process, specifying election by the people of the states and the district constituting the seat of government. The Every Vote Counts Amendment, H.J.Res. 8, introduced in 2005, aimed to enable direct popular election of the President and Vice President. It set a plurality requirement for election and established joint candidacies in the Constitution. Congress was empowered to address candidate deaths before election day and tie votes in presidential elections. This granted Congress broad authority, potentially allowing for rescheduling elections or a second round election in certain circumstances. It was unclear if Congress would have the authority to intervene in replacing party candidates, which historically has been handled internally by parties. The Every Vote Counts Amendment aimed to enable direct popular election of the President and Vice President, setting voter qualifications and empowering states to set less restrictive residence requirements. This would have constituted a departure from political tradition by giving Congress the authority to intervene in party candidate replacements. The Every Vote Counts Amendment aimed to allow direct popular election of the President and Vice President, giving Congress the power to establish uniform residence and age requirements for voters. This would potentially expand congressional authority over voting residence requirements traditionally handled by states. The proposed amendment set the effective time for ratification and detailed the process for direct popular election of the President and Vice President. Introduced in Congress in 2005, it aimed to establish direct popular election and included various election administration provisions. Section 1 of the proposed amendment aimed to establish direct popular election of the President and Vice President by U.S. citizens, allowing citizens to vote in a state regardless of residence if registered in that state. Section 2 outlined procedures for state action on popular vote results, transmission of returns to Washington, and the joint session of Congress for counting state returns and declaring the President and Vice President elected, superseding existing statutory provisions. The proposed amendment includes provisions for direct popular election of the President and Vice President, setting 40% of the popular vote as the minimum required to win the presidency. It also requires Congress to establish presidential election day as a national holiday and set national standards for voting registration. These provisions aim to ensure that the elected President has substantial voter support and involve federal involvement in election administration. Proposals for federal involvement in election administration include establishing election day as a national holiday and national voter registration, which could impact voter turnout and involve the federal government in functions traditionally handled by states. The federal government has been increasingly involved in election administration over the past 20 years, with laws like the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act of 1986, the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, and the Help America Vote Act of 2002 establishing national standards for federal elections. Section 4 of a proposed amendment would have set a timetable for implementation, while Section 5 expanded the definition of \"state\" to include U.S. territories like Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands for presidential voting. The proposed amendment aimed to extend presidential voting rights to U.S. territories like Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. H.J.Res. 17 and H.J.Res. 36 were introduced in Congress but did not progress further. The proposed amendment sought to allow direct popular election of the President and Vice President by all U.S. citizens, regardless of state residency. It specified a single vote for a joint candidacy and required candidates to receive a majority of votes to be elected. H.J.Res. 36 proposed direct popular election of the President and Vice President with a majority vote requirement. It lacked procedures for cases without a majority, but Section 3 could address such situations through congressional legislation. Section 4 included a timetable for the amendment to take effect after ratification. H.J.Res. 50, introduced in 2005, aimed to establish direct popular election of the President with voter qualifications similar to those for the House of Representatives. Congress would have the authority to set uniform age qualifications for voting for the presidency. Section 3 of H.J.Res. 50 aimed to incorporate joint presidential candidacies into the Constitution and remove the prohibition against voting for only one candidate from the same state as the elector. This provision was intended to encourage electors to consider candidates from other parts of the nation, reflecting the founders' desire to broaden political horizons. The proposed amendment in Section 4 of H.J.Res. 50 aimed to establish a simple plurality of popular votes as sufficient to elect the President, without provisions for a vote threshold or runoff election. Section 6 empowered Congress to provide procedures in case of a tie vote, while Section 5 sought to empower Congress to regulate the \"times, places, and manner of holding such [presidential] elections.\" The proposed language in Section 5 of H.J.Res. 50 aimed to give Congress authority over the \"times, places, and manner of holding\" presidential elections, potentially allowing for a wide range of activities. This would have provided symmetry in authority over both congressional and presidential elections, ensuring uniformity and equality in election rules for a fair expression of the public will. Opposition to this change would likely have focused on these broad implications. The proposed Section 5 of H.J.Res. 50 aimed to give Congress authority over presidential election procedures, potentially leading to concerns about federal overreach and imposition of unfunded mandates on states. This provision could have expanded federal authority into traditionally state-controlled areas like ballot access. The criticism of ballot access requirements for new or minor parties and independent candidates has been ongoing since the earliest years of organized political parties. Proponents argue for a federal standard to ensure fair representation on the presidential ballot, leading to increased voter turnout and public engagement. Opponents may raise concerns about federal overreach and unfunded mandates on states. Opponents of a federal standard for ballot access argue against congressional interference in state and local responsibilities, citing concerns about national power, unfunded mandates, and potential discrimination in political favoritism. The language in Section 5 of H.J.Res. 50 is similar to that of H.J.Res. 8, granting Congress authority over election logistics. The language in H.J.Res. 8 grants Congress authority over election logistics, specifying that these matters shall be determined by Congress. Section 6 would have given Congress the power to provide for instances of candidate disqualification or ties in the popular vote. This could have impacted party procedures for filling vacancies on the ballot before the election. The language in H.J.Res. 8 granted Congress broad authority over election logistics, including rescheduling elections, holding a second round election, or election by Congress in case of candidate vacancies or ties. It was unclear if the amendment would allow Congress to intervene in the process of replacing party nominees, which historically has been handled internally by parties. This would have been a significant departure from current political tradition. Section 7 specified that the amendment would take effect one year after the first day of January following its enactment. The proposed amendment in S.J.Res. 11, introduced by Senator Dianne Feinstein, aimed to establish direct popular election of the President and Vice President, eliminating the electoral college system. It also sought to set the same voting qualifications for President as for Representatives in Congress, allowing states to set \"less restrictive\" residence qualifications. Congress would have the power to establish uniform residence and age qualifications for voters in presidential elections. The proposed amendment aimed to establish direct popular election of the President and Vice President, eliminating the electoral college system. It would set the same voting qualifications for President as for Representatives in Congress, allowing states to set \"less restrictive\" residence qualifications. Congress would have the power to establish uniform residence and age qualifications for voters in presidential elections, potentially expanding federal authority over election aspects previously handled by states. The proposed amendment aimed to establish direct popular election of the President and Vice President, eliminating the electoral college system. It would grant Congress authority to supersede state laws for presidential elections and establish a lower voting age. Additionally, Congress would have power over voter qualifications in the District of Columbia and scheduling for presidential elections. The proposed amendment aimed to establish direct popular election of the President and Vice President, granting Congress authority to regulate the election process and vote counting. This would include setting uniform requirements for vote tabulation, challenges, recounts, and other related activities. The proposed amendment suggests broader federal control over election administration for presidential elections, potentially creating a two-tiered structure of election laws. Arguments for federal regulation include the importance of presidential elections as the ultimate expression of voters' will and the need for a simple, nationwide process to address election irregularities. The proposed amendment in 2004 suggests federal control over election administration for presidential elections to avoid a cumbersome two-tiered system. It would establish joint candidacies for President and Vice President to prevent different party anomalies. The proposed amendment in 2004 aimed to establish joint candidacies for President and Vice President to avoid party anomalies and ensure uniformity in the election process. It also granted Congress broad authority to address candidate vacancies, tie votes, and potentially intervene in the process of replacing party candidates. The proposed amendment in 2004 aimed to establish joint candidacies for President and Vice President to avoid party anomalies and ensure uniformity in the election process. It granted Congress broad authority to address candidate vacancies, tie votes, and potentially intervene in the process of replacing party candidates. S.J.Res. 11, introduced in 2005, included language for the amendment to come into force one year after ratification. Despite being read twice in the Senate and referred to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, no further action was taken during the 109th Congress. The volume of electoral college reform proposals has remained steady, with a noticeable decline in proposed amendments to reform the electoral college compared to those advocating for direct popular election. The support for eliminating the electoral college and implementing direct popular election has decreased significantly. The proposed amendments for direct popular election are becoming more detailed and complex. It is uncertain if the decline in support for the electoral college is due to lack of interest, lack of urgency, or a shift in priorities among Members of Congress. If a direct election amendment gains broad support, Members who support the current system may form groups to defend the electoral college or propose reform measures. Recent reform proposals for direct popular election amendments have expanded beyond simply replacing the electoral college. These amendments now include provisions to enhance federal government power in regulating areas such as residence standards, citizenship definitions, national voter registration, U.S. territories' inclusion in the election process, establishing an election day holiday, and setting ballot access standards for parties and candidates. This trend reflects frustration among voters and elected representatives over local election administration uncertainties and inconsistencies. The proposed amendments aim to address uncertainties in local election administration procedures from past presidential elections. They could establish national election standards, potentially imposing additional costs on state and local governments. This may lead to a call for federal funding to meet new expenses. A potential concern with proposed amendments is the debate over federal intrusion into state and local election responsibilities. Some argue for a national election administration system to ensure every citizen can vote and every vote is counted accurately, while others question the costs and efficiency of such a system. The long-term implications for federalism are also considered. In 2000, George W. Bush won the electoral college but lost the popular vote to Al Gore, leading to calls for electoral college reform. However, no significant proposals were passed in Congress. The Help America Vote Act was enacted in 2002 to improve election administration. The endurance of the electoral college system is influenced by the difficulty of amending the U.S. Constitution. Successful amendments require broad national consensus, urgency for reform, or long-term congressional support. The electoral college has ratified the people's choice in 92.2% of presidential elections since the 12th Amendment. The electoral college system's endurance is influenced by the difficulty of amending the U.S. Constitution. It has ratified the people's choice in 92.2% of presidential elections since the 12th Amendment. The system is likely to remain unless its alleged failings prompt significant reform or abolition efforts."
