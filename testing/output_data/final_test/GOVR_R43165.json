    "content": "Federal departments and agencies create federal records in accordance with the Federal Records Act (FRA), which defines records as all materials related to public business. The FRA mandates that agencies collect, retain, and preserve records to provide a history of public-policy execution. Agencies must document their activities and use standards to improve record management and security. The Federal Records Act (FRA) mandates agencies to maintain and secure records of permanent value, dispose of temporary records properly, and work with the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) to create records schedules. In 2012, NARA and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a directive requiring federal departments to designate a Senior Agency Official (SAO) to oversee their records management program, addressing challenges posed by emerging technologies in record-keeping. The challenges of using emerging technologies to maintain federal records may make it difficult for agencies to comply with the Federal Records Act. Congress may need to oversee agencies to ensure the authenticity and accessibility of electronic records. This digital environment raises policy questions for Congress regarding record management. The report highlights policy questions for Congress regarding the collection and retention of electronic records, their future accessibility, authenticity, and potential costs of not preserving them properly. It also discusses the challenges and implications of agencies using electronic media to create federal records. The report discusses actions taken by the Obama Administration to streamline agencies' recordkeeping responsibilities, focusing on electronic records. It does not cover all government records issues, such as Presidential records, federal records collection, and retention. The challenges faced by government agencies in record creation and retention are similar to those before the enactment of the FRA in 1950. The FRA in 1950 was prompted by the recommendations of the Commission on the Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government, addressing concerns about the accumulation of records at excessive costs. The Administrator of the GSA was given authority to manage federal agency records efficiently. New technologies have increased record creation, complicating and adding costs to record management. The FRA in 1950 was established to address concerns about the accumulation of records at excessive costs. New technologies have increased record creation, complicating and adding costs to record collection, retention, and preservation. Most records created by federal agencies are now \"born digital,\" presenting challenges to recordkeeping processes. NARA is evolving its information management strategy to ensure enduring access to government information. NARA is evolving its information management strategy to ensure perpetual access to government information. However, perpetual access to electronic records is challenging due to changing formats and platforms. Current records management approaches involve updating digital government information, taking snapshots of websites, and using aggregating technologies. New recordkeeping technologies may reduce costs over time, but access to digital federal records could become increasingly complicated and costly. NARA released a bulletin in 2010 defining social media and electronic platforms used by federal agencies to connect with the public and share information. The bulletin categorized platforms into Web Publishing (blogs, wikis, mashups) and Social Networking for user interaction and collaboration. Platforms like social networking tools, social bookmarks, virtual worlds, crowdsourcing, file sharing, and content storage are used for interactions and collaboration among users. Not all content created on these platforms qualifies as federal records, and NARA provides agencies with a list of questions to determine if the content is a federal record. In 2008, the Government Accountability Office found that certain federal agencies were not appropriately identifying and preserving email records. Federal records management has been given low priority within the government, with the creation of huge volumes of electronic information posing a major challenge. Poor federal records management poses a major challenge, leaving the government exposed to legal liabilities and risking the loss of historical records. Agencies face increased costs when searching for records to respond to FOIA requests or litigation. A 2011 report by NARA found that 90% of agencies had a moderate to high risk of records mismanagement. Additionally, GAO found that many agencies lacked a formal policy for capturing and maintaining federal records created on social media. President Barack Obama issued a memorandum on \"Managing Government Records\" in 2011, emphasizing the importance of well-managed federal records to assess program impact, reduce redundant efforts, save money, and share knowledge. The memorandum highlighted the challenges posed by technological advances in records management, stating that outdated policies could lead to overwhelmed systems, higher costs, and lost records. Agencies were given 30 days to designate responsibilities in response to the memorandum. President Barack Obama issued a memorandum in 2011 emphasizing the importance of well-managed federal records to assess program impact, reduce redundant efforts, save money, and share knowledge. Agencies were given 30 days to designate a senior official to supervise the creation of a report on agency plans for electronic recordkeeping. Within 120 days, agencies were required to submit a report to NARA and OMB detailing plans to improve electronic records management, identify obstacles, and propose policies or programs to enhance records management. The Managing Government Records Directive, released in August 2012, aims to reform and improve agency records management policies. It focuses on electronic recordkeeping for transparency, efficiency, and accountability, as well as compliance with NARA regulations. The Managing Government Records Directive, released in August 2012, aims to reform agency records management policies by directing agencies to manage electronic records in electronic formats, designate a senior agency official for oversight, and ensure NARA certification for records officers. The Managing Government Records Directive, released in August 2012, aims to reform agency records management policies by directing agencies to inform employees of their responsibilities, develop training, revise guidance on transferring electronic records, create new guidance for managing email, collaborate with the private sector for automation, and improve methods for managing records. The Managing Government Records Directive, released in August 2012, aims to reform agency records management policies by directing agencies to inform employees of their responsibilities, develop training, revise guidance on transferring electronic records, create new guidance for managing email, collaborate with the private sector for automation, and improve methods for managing records. The guidance includes holding periodic meetings with agency-appointed SAOs, establishing a community of IT scholars and legal counsel for additional guidance, creating training, and finding new electronic records management tools. It also directs the Office of Personnel Management to establish a formal records management occupational series for specific federal job titles. Records can take various forms, each requiring specific archival responsibilities and presenting unique challenges for perpetual retrieval. Agencies are required to collect, retain, and schedule records for NARA. NARA requires agencies to collect, retain, and schedule records for disposal or permanent retention. The Electronic Records Project faces challenges due to the increasing volume and complexity of e-records. NARA conducts annual self-assessments with agencies to ensure compliance with record management requirements. In the most recent assessment, 112 executive- and legislative-branch agencies participated out of 247 respondent agencies. NARA found that 112 executive- and legislative-branch agencies operated records management programs at \"high risk\" of mismanaging their records. Most agencies lack adequate controls for major activities and many staff have insufficient knowledge of electronic records. This leads to poor recordkeeping practices and may impact NARA's ability to accurately predict the volume of federal records. Despite this, there is an increase in agencies scheduling electronic records series. NARA reported an increase in agencies scheduling electronic records series, with a general trend towards more approvals over time. However, the records schedules may not accurately reflect the volumes of records created and platforms used today. In 2011, NARA approved schedules for 1,031 electronic records series or systems, the most in a single fiscal year. Approvals did not consistently increase over time, with 418 records series and systems approved in FY2012. The transfer of electronic records to NARA also did not consistently increase, with the greatest number of transfers in FY2011. Presidential records may be the best indicator of the actual volume of records. Presidential records, under the Presidential Records Act, are transferred to NARA at the end of each administration, showing the increasing volumes and electronic formats used. While federal agency records face challenges in collection and retention, electronic presidential records are often automatically captured and stored, unlike many agency records. Automatic capture of presidential records by electronic archiving technologies ensures a more complete collection compared to agencies relying on individuals to print and retain records. This method provides a more accurate measure of federal electronic records being created and helps anticipate future dispensation. Presidential Libraries have seen a significant increase in electronic records volume, especially White House emails. The report highlights the challenges posed by the increasing volume of electronic Presidential records, particularly White House emails. The George W. Bush Administration's email system alone is significantly larger than any other Presidential Library's textual holdings. This growth in electronic records complicates the processing and availability of Presidential records, requiring extensive search and redaction efforts. Additionally, the informal communication style in Presidential record emails often mixes personal and official information, further complicating the review process. The George W. Bush Administration provided 150 million e-mail records after his eight-year tenure, highlighting the challenges of managing electronic presidential records due to the huge volumes of electronic information. NARA reported that the Bush administration transferred 77 terabytes of data, demonstrating the significant technical challenge in organizing and accessing electronic information. The Bush administration transferred 77 terabytes of data to NARA on leaving office, which was 35 times more than the Clinton administration. NARA's blog post detailed the records transferred to the George W. Bush Library and Museum, including 70 million pages of textual records, 43,000 artifacts, 200 million emails, and 4 million digital photographs. This marked a 3,500% increase in electronic records compared to the previous administration. The 113th Congress may oversee agencies' management of federal records due to the rise in electronic records. The Obama Administration released new guidelines for agencies to improve federal recordkeeping. Congress may need to review laws governing recordkeeping to include records from different platforms and technologies. They should also ensure agencies are maintaining the authenticity of electronic documents. The guidelines make oversight easier for Congress, providing a single point of contact for recordkeeping information. Agencies may vary in resources, staffing, and authority levels for record management. The SAO may face challenges in administering agency records management responsibilities due to lack of resources and access to sensitive information. Congress may consider granting SAOs authority, resources, and access to improve records management processes, potentially enacting the SAO position into law for continuity across administrations. Congress may choose to continue oversight of federal records management, requiring SAOs to meet and share best practices. They could also mandate a website for best practices and address the gap between statutory definitions and digital content use in the FRA. The FRA does not address all complexities of creating digital content with multiple technologies. Federal agencies use social media platforms to combine content on their websites. It is unclear if integrating platforms creates new federal records. Agencies are not required to retain duplicates of federal records in most cases. The increasing use of electronic records raises questions about whether combining information from various platforms creates new federal records. Current laws and regulations do not provide clear guidance on this issue, and it is uncertain if recordkeeping software can capture all electronic content. Congress may need to consider legislative options or task NARA with addressing these concerns. The increasing use of electronic records requires agencies to ensure trustworthiness, authenticity, and protection of information. NARA provides guidance on maintaining trustworthy websites with reliable, authentic, integral, and usable records. NARA's guidance emphasizes the importance of maintaining trustworthy electronic records, including ensuring integrity, authenticity, and usability. Congress may oversee agencies to ensure they are safeguarding e-government initiatives and public electronic information, as well as preparing for potential risks associated with electronic records. NARA's guidance highlights risks associated with electronic platforms, such as the inability to document transactions and financial losses. Congress may require agencies to conduct risk assessments to address potential consequences of lost records and may have NARA collect and summarize these assessments for review. NARA collects risk assessments and submits a summary to Congress. Congress could address poor records management through appropriations if lack of resources is identified. Agencies are not required to report recordkeeping costs, making it unclear how resources are used for record administration. It is also unclear what constitutes a recordkeeping cost, such as storage, training, staffing, and oversight costs. Congress may require NARA to define recordkeeping costs and mandate senior agency officials to report these costs. Agency officials are tasked with reporting recordkeeping costs to NARA for aggregation and summary. This data could inform Congress and the public on agencies' recordkeeping costs and compliance with regulations. Congress may find data collection costly and time-consuming, and may consider requiring additional data points from senior agency officials. A more detailed records management report could provide Congress with valuable information about the federal government's records management status, including data points such as total records schedules submitted to NARA, electronic records submitted, unscheduled records series, and cost-saving methods. However, collecting this data would come with associated costs."
