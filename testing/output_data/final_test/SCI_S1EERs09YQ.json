    "content": "Deep convolutional networks have shown improved performance in natural language tasks but are often considered black boxes due to their interpretability issues. A study reveals that individual units in these networks respond selectively to specific language elements like morphemes, words, and phrases. A concept alignment method is proposed to analyze this phenomenon quantitatively, shedding new light on how deep models process natural language. Deep neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various tasks, but their lack of interpretability makes them challenging to understand and debug. Research is focused on making these deep networks more interpretable by understanding their hidden representations and how they encode information. Research has focused on understanding the information captured by individual units in visual representations learned for image recognition tasks. These studies have shown that some units are selectively responsive to specific visual concepts, providing more insights than analyzing representations as a whole. This analysis has led to meaningful connections such as generalization of networks, generating explanations for model decisions, and controlling generative model outputs. In computer vision tasks, little is known about the representation of models learned from NLP tasks. Previous studies analyzed individual units of natural language representations aligning with specific concepts. This study aims to discover the natural language concepts captured by each unit in representations learned from NLP tasks. The most activated sentences align with specific concepts in hidden representations of deep convolutional networks, suggesting selective responses to natural language concepts. Our approach proposes a concept alignment method to discover which natural language concepts are aligned to each unit in the representation. It identifies the most activated sentences per unit and aligns specific concepts by measuring activation values. This method allows for systematic analysis of concepts carried by units in various settings. The contributions of this work include showing that deep CNN units in NLP tasks can act as natural language concept detectors without additional labeled data. The study systematically analyzes the information captured by units across different network architectures, tasks, and datasets. It also examines how aligned natural language concepts evolve in representation. In analyzing deep CNN units in NLP tasks, it was found that they can serve as natural language concept detectors without extra labeled data. The study explores how aligned natural language concepts evolve in representation and how interpretations of learned representations can inform the design of network architectures with fewer parameters but comparable performance. Previous research in computer vision inspired the analysis of hidden representations at the unit level. In analyzing deep CNN units, researchers aligned visual concepts to each unit by optimizing images to maximize unit activation. This method resulted in interpretation through optimized images rather than natural language. This approach makes it challenging to quantitatively analyze discrete properties of representations. In the NLP domain, previous studies have analyzed the internal mechanisms of deep models and found intriguing properties in hidden representations. This study focuses on discovering a wider variety of natural language concepts, including morphemes, words, and phrases in the training data. This study is the first attempt to discover concepts in natural language from training data, extending the scope to meaningful building blocks of language. Previous work focused on downstream tasks predicting concepts, while this study explores how linguistic features are encoded in deep representations. This study explores how linguistic features are encoded in deep representations by identifying the role of individual units and focusing on fundamental building blocks of natural language. Our concept alignment method for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) does not require additional labeled data or re-training, providing deterministic interpretation results using only the training data. CNNs, particularly character-level variants, have been successful in various natural language applications. Compared to deep architectures with fully connected layers, CNNs are suitable for unit-level analysis due to their channel-level representations acting as templates for detecting concepts. Our concept alignment method for CNNs does not need extra labeled data or re-training, providing deterministic interpretation results using only the training data. By training a CNN model for each natural language task, we identify key concepts that significantly impact unit activation values. This involves retrieving training sentences that highly activate specific units and aligning concepts that contribute to unit activation. The method involves measuring the activation value of replicated candidate concepts and aligning them to the unit. Top K training sentences per unit with the highest mean activation are then retrieved, revealing natural language patterns such as morphemes, words, and phrases that frequently appear in the sentences. The method involves identifying key concepts that significantly impact unit activation values in CNNs. Candidate concepts are constructed by parsing top K sentences and breaking down words into morphemes. These concepts are aligned to the unit by measuring their activation values. This approach does not require extra labeled data or re-training, providing deterministic interpretation results using only the training data. The method identifies key concepts that impact unit activation values in CNNs by measuring how each candidate concept contributes to the unit's activation value. Candidate concepts are aligned to the unit by replicating them to match the average length of training sentences. The degree of alignment (DoA) measures the sensitivity of unit activation to the presence of candidate concepts. This approach provides deterministic interpretation results using only the training data, without requiring extra labeled data or re-training. In this experiment, candidate concepts aligned to units are analyzed based on their activation values. The study focuses on representations in encoder layers of ByteNet and convolutional layers of VDCNN. The decoder is specialized for predicting output rather than learning input semantics. Training details for various datasets are provided in the appendix. The study evaluates concept selectivity of units in encoder layers of ByteNet and convolutional layers of VDCNN by measuring their response to aligned concepts. The concept selectivity of a unit u to a set of concepts C*u is defined based on the average unit activation when forwarding a set of sentences. Three methods are used to create the set of sentences: replicate, one instance, and inclusion. The study evaluates concept selectivity of units in encoder layers of ByteNet and convolutional layers of VDCNN by measuring their response to aligned concepts. The concept selectivity of a unit u to a set of concepts C*u is defined based on the average unit activation when forwarding a set of sentences. Three methods are used to create the set of sentences: replicate, one instance, and inclusion. The selectivity values for all units learned in each dataset for the four categories show that units are selectively responsive to specific concepts. The study evaluates concept selectivity of units in encoder layers of ByteNet and VDCNN by measuring their response to aligned concepts. Results show that units are selectively responsive to specific concepts, with higher selectivity in replicate sets compared to one instance sets. Examples in FIG2 demonstrate top sentences activating specific units with aligned concepts. Patterns like '(', ')', '-' and 'soft', 'software', 'wi' frequently appear in top activating sentences for different units. The study shows that units in ByteNet and VDCNN are selectively responsive to specific natural language concepts, capturing meanings and syntactic roles beyond superficial patterns. For example, unit 690 in ByteNet captures concepts like \"what, who, where\", while unit 224 in ByteNet and unit 53 in VDCNN capture semantically similar concepts. This suggests that individual units can capture natural language concepts despite being trained on character-level CNNs. The communication discusses the purpose of a licensing agreement between Qualcomm and Microsoft, software upgrades for efficiency by Peoplesoft, access to Wi-Fi hotspots, software alterations by RealNetworks for iPod, and Apple's loss to Microsoft in a war over licensing. The speaker expresses confidence in finding a solution. Our method aligns abstract concepts in units of VDCNN, capturing relevant phrase-level concepts and higher-level nuances indirectly. The approach finds frequent concepts in training data, not always aligning natural language concepts to units due to the disparity in numbers. The approach aligns abstract concepts in units of VDCNN, capturing relevant phrase-level concepts and higher-level nuances indirectly. Units in the CNN respond selectively to specific natural language concepts, serving as detectors for these concepts. Syntactically or semantically related concepts are captured by some units, suggesting a modeling of meaning or grammatical roles shared between them. Visualizations show how concepts are distributed across layers in the CNN. In VDCNN and ByteNet encoder layers, concepts aligned to units are sorted by number of aligned units. Data and task-specific concepts are aligned to many units, with AG News focusing on categories like World, Sports, Business, and Science/Tech. Europarl units encode key words like vote, propose, and environment. Visual concepts are captured by units in CNN for computer vision tasks. In computer vision tasks, visual concepts in CNN representations evolve with layer depths. Color and texture concepts emerge in earlier layers, while more abstract concepts like parts and objects emerge in deeper layers. When applied to NLP tasks, concepts are divided into morphemes, words, and N-gram phrases. The number of aligned units varies across layers, with lower layers detecting fewer phrase concepts but more morphemes and words. Translation cases show significant concept changes in shallower layers, but less change in deeper layers. The evolution of concept granularity in deeper layers of translation datasets remains a question. The network's capacity may allow middle layers to provide sufficient information for the task. Retraining ByteNet with varying encoder layer depths shows performance drops with fewer than 4 layers, but remains stable with more than six layers. This aligns with the observation that concept granularity evolution stops around deeper layers. The evolution of concept granularity in deeper layers of translation datasets suggests that about six encoder layers are sufficient for optimal performance. Some concepts align with many units per layer, while others align with few or none. This raises the question of what factors contribute to the emergence of certain concepts. The emergence of dominant concepts in training data can be attributed to two possible hypotheses: concepts with higher frequency align to more units, and concepts with more influence on the objective function align to more units. The correlation between concept frequency and alignment in the topic classification model is shown. The effect of a concept on task performance can be measured using Delta of Expected Loss (DEL) formula. The text discusses the concept alignment method for character-level CNNs to analyze how hidden layers detect natural language concepts. It explores the impact of concepts on the loss function and how deep representations capture natural language under various conditions. Future directions include extending concept coverage to sentence structure, nuance, and tone.

Future directions include extending concept coverage to sentence structure, nuance, and tone. The Degree of Alignment (DoA) between concept c n and unit u is defined as the activation value of unit u for replication of c n. Various attempts were made to measure concept alignment, including Point-wise Mutual Information (PMI), but results were biased. The text discusses the bias of Point-wise Mutual Information (PMI) in measuring concept alignment in character-level CNNs. PMI tends to favor lengthy concepts, leading to high association scores for low-frequency pairs. This bias affects the correlation between concepts and units in earlier layers of the network. The text discusses concept alignment in character-level CNNs, highlighting the bias of PMI in measuring alignment. By using a concept occlusion method, the study identifies candidate concepts that consistently lower unit activation values, defining the degree of alignment between concepts and units. The Degree of Alignment (DoA) measures how candidate concepts contribute to unit activation in character-level CNNs. It assesses the alignment between concepts and units based on the top K sentences. However, DoA may not accurately compare the impact of different candidate concepts due to dependencies between concepts in sentences. The occlusion based metric in section 1 is dependent on concept length rather than attribution. Inclusion selectivity in section 4.2 is also used as DoA, calculated as equation 2. However, it induces bias towards lengthy phrases, favoring them even if they occur infrequently in the corpus. This bias can be alleviated in a large corpus where every concept occurs multiple times. In Section 3.2, candidate concepts are replicated in input sentences for computing DoA in Eq.(1). Normalizing input length is crucial for fair comparison of DoA values between concepts of different lengths. Without length normalization, DoA metric biases towards lengthy concepts, favoring phrases over single words. This work utilized ByteNet for translation tasks and VDCNN for other candidate concepts. The study utilized ByteNet for translation tasks and VDCNN for classification tasks to analyze language representations. Training details include setting M = 3 for selecting concepts per unit. Different M values have little impact on selectivity results. The CNN structure and hyperparameters were consistent, and the code was based on a TensorFlow implementation of VDCNN. Selectivity values were analyzed with different M values [1, 3, 5, 10], showing little variation in trends. The study used ByteNet for translation tasks and VDCNN for classification tasks to analyze language representations. The sensitivity of units varied, with some being sensitive to specific concepts while others were not. Units were classified as interpretable or non-interpretable based on their activation values. The study analyzed language representations using ByteNet for translation tasks and VDCNN for classification tasks. Units were classified as interpretable or non-interpretable based on their activation values. More than 90% of units were found to be interpretable across all layers and datasets. The study also identified concepts that are out of natural language form in the units.

Units were classified as interpretable or non-interpretable based on their activation values. More than 90% of units were found to be interpretable across all layers and datasets. The study also identified concepts that are out of natural language form in the units. Some units may be undetectable due to limited candidate concepts and dead units. Concept clusters with shared meanings were introduced, analyzing their formation and variation with the target task and layer depth using Euclidean distance of vector space embeddings. In fastText, concepts are projected into a vector space using character-level N-gram based word embeddings. Phrase embeddings are obtained by splitting phrases into words, projecting each word, and averaging their embeddings. The distance between clusters is defined as the distance between their centroids. The central heat map shows how often concept pairs align to the same unit, with stronger concept clusters observed in classification tasks compared to translation tasks. Units learned in DBpedia and AG News dataset exhibit highly evident concept clusters. The text discusses the benefits of units in concept clustering in classification tasks compared to translation tasks. It analyzes how concept clusters change by layer in each task and computes the pairwise distance between concepts. The text also mentions using pretrained embeddings like Glove, ConceptNet, and fastText for concept projection. In classification tasks, pretrained embeddings like Glove, ConceptNet, and fastText are used for concept projection. The text analyzes how concept clusters change by layer and computes pairwise distances between concepts. It shows that concepts in the same unit become closer in the vector space as the layer goes deeper, capturing more abstract semantics. The representations are learned for identifying concepts based on document frequency and expected loss. The text discusses how representations are learned for identifying important concepts in training sets for classification tasks. It visualizes concept distribution across layers using different datasets and highlights the presence of data-specific and task-specific concepts aligned in each layer. The text discusses how representations are learned for identifying important concepts in training sets for classification tasks, visualizing concept distribution across layers using different datasets. Task-specific concepts aligned in each layer are highlighted, with examples from Yelp Review and DBpedia datasets. The number of occurrences of each concept at different layers is shown in FIG5, with two concepts selected in the translation model and seven in the classification model based on their frequency. In the model, 30 concepts are selected in total, with no strong pattern between concepts and their occurrences at different layers. Aligned concepts per task and their occurrences over multiple layers can be seen in FIG5. See Appendix H for more details."
