    "content": "SECTION 1. JUDICIAL REVIEW. Section 611 of title 5, United States Code, is amended to allow affected small entities to petition for judicial review of a final rule within 180 days if the rule was certified to have no significant economic impact or if a final regulatory flexibility analysis was prepared. A court with jurisdiction to review the rule for compliance with section 553 or other laws can review the certification or analysis. The provision allows for judicial review of final agency regulations within 180 days, with exceptions for cases where a shorter period is specified by law or when an agency delays the issuance of a final regulatory flexibility analysis. The provision allows for judicial review of final agency regulations within 180 days, with exceptions for cases where a shorter period is specified by law or when an agency delays the issuance of a final regulatory flexibility analysis. For purposes of this subsection, the term 'affected small entity' means a small entity adversely affected by the final rule. Nothing in this subsection affects the court's authority to stay the effective date of any rule. In cases where the agency certified that a rule would not have a significant economic impact on small entities, the court may order the agency to prepare a final regulatory flexibility analysis if the certification was found to be arbitrary or not in accordance with the law. The court may order corrective action if a final regulatory flexibility analysis was not prepared properly. If the agency fails to comply within 90 days, the court can stay the rule or provide appropriate relief. The court may stay a rule or provide relief as deemed appropriate, considering the rule of prejudicial error. A regulatory flexibility analysis for a rule is part of the record for judicial review. Judicial review of impact statements or similar analyses required by other laws is not barred. The amendment applies to final agency rules issued after the enactment date of the Act. SEC. 2. RULES COMMENTED ON BY SBA CHIEF COUNSEL FOR ADVOCACY. The SBA Chief Counsel for Advocacy must receive proposed rules and initial regulatory flexibility analysis from agencies before publication. The SBA Chief Counsel for Advocacy may transmit a statement of the effect of proposed rules on small entities to agencies, which must publish the statement and their response in the Federal Register. Section 603(a) of title 5, United States Code, is amended to include provisions from section 612(d) in accordance with the proposed rulemaking. Congress believes that the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration should have the ability to appear as amicus curiae in court cases reviewing rules."
