    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Louisiana Rice Economic Relief Act of 2003\". It includes findings related to the economic situation. The Louisiana Rice Economic Relief Act of 2003 acknowledges the significant contribution of the rice industry in Louisiana to the economy, with an estimated annual value of $250 million. However, rice producers in Louisiana faced the lowest prices in over 50 years for the 2002 crop, leading to record low income levels despite federal support. The 2002 crop of rice in Louisiana resulted in significant financial challenges for rice producers due to historically low prices, leading to a shortfall in covering production expenses. Rice producers in Louisiana are facing dire economic circumstances due to historically low prices, which are 22 percent below the average income level for the state during 1998-2001. This has led to financial challenges and is crippling both producers and their communities. Economic disaster assistance is being provided for Louisiana rice producers. The Secretary of Agriculture will use funds from the Commodity Credit Corporation to make payments to Louisiana rice producers for the 2002 crop to address economic difficulties. Payments are based on the quantity of rice produced multiplied by a payment rate of $2.42 per hundredweight, with a limit of $40,000 per person. Regulations will be established for these payments. The Secretary will establish regulations to define the term \"person\" for payment limitations to Louisiana rice producers. Information will be used efficiently, and additional requirements will be minimized for eligible producers. Payments under this section exempt from administrative offset, including under title 31, United States Code, or the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act. The Secretary will utilize the Commodity Credit Corporation's resources to implement the Act. Regulations will also be established. The Secretary may issue necessary regulations to implement the Act without following certain procedural requirements. Congressional review of agency rulemaking will be conducted under specified authority. SEC. 6. EMERGENCY DESIGNATION. The entire amount made available under this Act must be designated as an emergency requirement for budget purposes."
