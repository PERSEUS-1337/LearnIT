    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Debt Cancellation for the New Millennium Act\". It includes findings related to debt cancellation. The Enhanced HIPC Initiative, developed by the G-7 countries in 1999, aims to provide debt relief to the world's poorest countries for investment in various programs. This initiative requires HIPCs to create Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers with civil society participation but does not cancel all debts. The IMF and World Bank have resources for full debt cancellation for HIPCs. The Enhanced HIPC Initiative mandates structural adjustment programs approved by the IMF, causing economic austerity and opposition from civil society. Developing and implementing PRSPs has delayed debt relief for HIPCs. The Enhanced HIPC Initiative requires HIPCs to continue debt service payments while developing PRSPs and implementing IMF structural adjustment programs. Many HIPCs have suffered revenue losses from export price reductions, diminishing debt relief benefits. Bangladesh, Haiti, and Nigeria were excluded from the initiative despite their significant debt burdens. Complete debt cancellation for impoverished countries would facilitate poverty reduction and economic growth, allowing resources to be allocated to healthcare and HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention.

Complete debt cancellation for impoverished countries would facilitate poverty reduction and economic growth, allowing resources to be allocated to healthcare, education, and HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention. Reforms of the Enhanced HIPC Initiative are being made to address issues with debt relief benefits for HIPCs. Bangladesh, Haiti, and Nigeria were excluded from the initiative despite their significant debt burdens. Complete debt cancellation for impoverished countries would facilitate poverty reduction and economic growth. Congress urges the President to immediately start efforts within the Paris Club, World Bank, IMF, and other multilateral institutions to modify the Enhanced HIPC Initiative by providing full debt cancellation and prohibiting structural adjustment programs. The provision of debt relief under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative shall not be conditioned on any country adopting structural adjustment programs. All HIPCs working on their Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) will have debt service payments suspended to invest in HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention. The Enhanced HIPC Initiative will provide debt relief to invest in HIV/AIDS treatment, health care, education, and poverty reduction programs. Country eligibility requirements will be revised to include Bangladesh, Haiti, and Nigeria. The Secretary of the Treasury will provide technical assistance to heavily indebted poor countries for compliance with debt relief conditions under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative. Countries will be informed of the availability of assistance within 30 days of the Act's enactment. The President must submit an annual report to specific Congressional committees on the activities and progress of the modifications to the Enhanced HIPC Initiative as per the Act."
