    "content": "The New Starts program provides federal funds for the construction and expansion of fixed guideway transit systems, including bus rapid transit (BRT) with high-frequency service and special features. Public transportation excludes school bus, intercity bus, and Amtrak services. The New Starts program provides federal funds for transit rail systems, including subway/elevated rail, light rail, and commuter rail projects. Many cities have opened new rail systems or expanded existing ones with federal support. Rail transit route-mileage has nearly doubled since 1985, with light rail mileage quadrupling and commuter rail mileage doubling. Transit rail systems now account for 44% of public transit trips, with bus services making up the rest. The New Starts program, funded by the Federal Transit Administration, supports transit rail systems such as subway, light rail, and commuter rail projects. BRT systems have also benefited from Small Starts funding. The program was reauthorized through FY2014 under MAP-21, accounting for about 18% of FTA's budget. The New Starts program, funded by the Federal Transit Administration, receives about 18% of FTA's budget. Funding comes from the general fund of the U.S. Treasury, averaging $1.5 billion per year from FY2004 to FY2008. Funding has been more variable since FY2009, with additional funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Rescissions affected FY2009 and FY2010 funding, with the cancellation of the ARC tunnel project in New Jersey contributing to the reduction of funding. In October 2010, the cancellation of the ARC tunnel project in New Jersey led to a reduction in funding for FY2011. Congress decided to fund bus rapid transit projects recommended by FTA for New Starts funding from the Bus and Bus Facilities program in FY2012. The Bus and Bus Facilities program funding was discretionary and heavily earmarked before MAP-21, but now it is about half its previous size and funding is distributed by formula. Federal funding for New Starts and Small Starts projects has traditionally come through the New Starts program, but other federal programs like the FTA's Urbanized Area Formula program can also support these projects. The majority of federal funding for New Starts and Small Starts projects comes from the New Starts program, with smaller amounts from other federal programs like the FTA's Urbanized Area Formula program and FHWA's CMAQ program. The maximum federal share for a New Starts project is 80%, and the Senate Appropriations Committee has directed FTA not to sign grant agreements for New Starts projects since FY2002. The GAO report includes a directive for FTA to not sign grant agreements for New Starts projects with over a 60% federal share, except for up to three BRT projects per year with an 80% federal share. On average, federal funding covered 45% of New Starts projects and 67% of Small Starts projects, with the majority of state and local contributions coming from public funds. Only a small portion of local funding for New Starts projects came from private investment. The New Starts program saw changes under MAP-21, allowing funds for core capacity improvement projects and interrelated projects. Since SAFETEA in 2005, projects are categorized as Small Starts or New Starts based on cost and funding sought. Local funding for New Starts projects mostly comes from public funds, with a small portion from private investment. Under MAP-21, Small Starts projects no longer have reserved funding but still undergo a simpler approval process. New Starts funding is now available for Fixed Guideway Capital Projects and Small Starts Projects, with specific cost and federal assistance criteria. Under MAP-21, Small Starts projects no longer have reserved funding but still undergo a simpler approval process. New Starts funding is available for Fixed Guideway Capital Projects and Small Starts Projects, with specific cost and federal assistance criteria. A corridor-based BRT is required to emulate rail service, but the buses do not need to run most of the way in a separated right-of-way dedicated to public transportation use. Core Capacity Projects involve expanding an existing fixed guideway corridor to increase capacity by 10% or more, aimed at eliminating core capacity constraints. These projects may be combined in a Program of Interrelated Projects, defined as the simultaneous development of two or more fixed guideway or core capacity projects. Federal funding for major New Starts projects is typically committed in a Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA), usually a multi-year agreement between the federal government and a transit agency receiving less than $75 million of federal assistance. Under MAP-21, the Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) establishes federal financial participation terms for transit projects. The approval process has been simplified to three stages: project development, engineering, and construction. The applicant now only needs to apply to the FTA and initiate the review process required by NEPA to enter the project development phase. The bill eliminates duplicative alternatives analysis previously required. The analysis evaluates solutions for a transportation problem in a specific area, with a locally preferred alternative chosen. Project sponsors must provide necessary information to FTA for project justification and local financial commitment. MAP-21 allows for expedited review of technical capacity for sponsors with past successful projects. Special warrants can advance projects with federal share of $100 million or less or 50% of total project cost. FTA special warrants allow projects to qualify for automatic ratings on project justification criteria without detailed analysis. For example, if a proposed project falls within defined cost parameters and transit ridership levels, it would be considered cost-effective by FTA. Once a project is selected as the locally preferred alternative, adopted into the metropolitan plan, and justified with local financial commitment, it can enter the engineering phase after the NEPA process. Core capacity projects have additional requirements. The engineering phase involves finalizing construction plans, cost estimates, and project implementation plans for interrelated projects. FTA determines project eligibility for construction through an FFGA after engineering work is completed. FTA oversees project construction to ensure compliance with the FFGA terms and requests funding as needed. The FTA requests funding for approved projects under the terms of the FFGA from Congress each fiscal year. An Early Systems Work Agreement provides funding for projects to begin before an FFGA is awarded. MAP-21 includes changes to expedite project delivery and a pilot program for New Starts projects. Small Starts projects request $75 million or less in federal assistance. Small Starts projects, requesting $75 million or less in federal assistance, have two phases: project development and construction. Entry into project development only requires applying to FTA and initiating the NEPA process. The formal decision for FTA is whether to award funding and move the project into construction. MAP-21 does not reserve funds for Small Starts projects in FY2013 and FY2014, potentially changing the funding mix between New Starts and Small Starts projects. Core capacity projects funded by newly permitted grants could impact funding for other projects. These projects are located in cities with fixed guideway service. The approval process for New Starts funding involves computing an overall project rating based on various criteria. Projects must achieve at least a medium rating to advance to construction. The project justification criteria for New Starts projects are outlined in MAP-21, with specific measures defined in rulemaking and proposed policy guidance. Mobility improvements are a key criterion, now measured by total trips on the project. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) has revised the mobility improvements criterion for New Starts projects. The measure is now based on total trips on the project, with extra weight given to trips made by transit-dependent passengers. This change simplifies the evaluation process and increases the importance of shorter transit trips. Additionally, FTA has expanded the environmental benefits criteria to include direct and indirect benefits to the natural and human environment, such as air quality improvement, reduced energy consumption, and reduced accidents and fatalities. The Federal Transit Administration has revised criteria for New Starts projects, including mobility improvements based on total trips with extra weight for transit-dependent passengers. Environmental benefits now include reduced greenhouse gas emissions, accidents, and improved public health. Congestion relief and economic development effects are also considered in project evaluations. Land use and capacity needs are evaluated for core capacity projects. The Federal Transit Administration has updated criteria for New Starts projects, including measuring existing land uses, parking supply, and publically supported housing in the corridor. Cost-effectiveness is now measured by cost per rider instead of cost and predicted travel time reduction. Operating efficiencies are no longer a project justification criterion, and congestion relief has been added. Equal weight is given to six factors in project evaluation, with project justification criteria accounting for 50% of the overall score and local financial commitment determining the other 50%.

Cost-effectiveness is now measured by cost per rider instead of cost and predicted travel time reduction. Operating efficiencies are no longer a project justification criterion, and congestion relief has been added. Local financial commitment is a key factor for federal funding approval, including stable financing, sufficient resources for maintenance and operation, and contingency funds for cost overruns. MAP-21 added considerations for private contributions to the project and public-private partnership strategies.

Cost-effectiveness is now measured by cost per rider instead of cost and predicted travel time reduction. Operating efficiencies are no longer a project justification criterion, and congestion relief has been added. Local financial commitment is a key factor for federal funding approval, with new criteria including stable financing, sufficient resources for maintenance and operation, and contingency funds for cost overruns. The proposed scheme for judging local financial commitment includes current capital and operating condition, commitment of funds, and reasonableness of cost estimates. If the New Starts funding share is less than 50% of the project's capital cost, the overall local financial commitment rating will be raised one level. Beginning in the 1970s, the Department of Transportation issued policy statements on distributing federal funding for \"new starts\" projects. These principles were later incorporated into federal law in the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987 (STURAA), setting criteria for projects to be eligible for funding. The STURAA criteria for federal funding of \"new starts\" projects required an alternatives analysis, cost-effectiveness, local financial commitment, and DOT recommendations in an annual report to Congress. ISTEA in 1991 added mobility improvements, environmental benefits, and operating efficiencies as justifications, along with lesser considerations like congestion relief and economic development. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) introduced new considerations for project approval, such as costs of sprawl and technical capacity. Projects were rated as \"highly recommended,\" \"recommended,\" or \"not recommended,\" with formal approval required to move from preliminary engineering to final design. The subsequent SAFETEA legislation changed the rating scale to a five-point system and elevated factors like economic development effects and land use policies. SAFETEA introduced the Small Starts program and emphasized cost effectiveness in project funding decisions. FTA required a medium rating for project recommendation and weighted cost effectiveness at 50% in project justifications, with the remaining 50% based on land use, economic development, and mobility benefits. The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and respondents criticized a proposal to combine cost effectiveness and economic development as criteria for transit projects. Concerns were raised that this would favor suburban projects over centrally located ones. Congress intervened to prevent the implementation of this rule in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008. In 2008, Congress amended 49 U.S.C. Section 5309 to require FTA to give comparable weight to project justification criteria. This was further detailed in MAP-21, with cost effectiveness accounting for 20% of the project rating, along with other factors like economic development, mobility improvements, land use, environmental benefits, and operating efficiencies. In 2010, FTA changed its policy to recommend projects with an overall medium rating or better for funding. FTA announced changes to the evaluation process for New Starts and Small Starts projects in 2010, recommending projects with a medium or better rating. A new NPRM was issued in 2012, with a final rule published in 2013. Congress enacted MAP-21, incorporating some of the proposed changes into law. The 2012 NPRM changes were incorporated into law under MAP-21, allowing warrants for projects with federal funding of $100 million or less or a federal funding share of 50% or less. Some elements of the program subject to new rules were altered by the law, such as dropping operating efficiencies as a project justification and adding congestion relief. FTA will address these issues in future rulemaking and policy guidance. The rulemaking and revised policy guidance introduce significant changes in evaluating New Starts/Small Starts projects, aiming to measure a broader range of benefits and simplify the evaluation process. For instance, environmental benefits will be evaluated by anticipating changes in air quality. FTA will evaluate environmental benefits by measuring changes in air quality criteria pollutants, energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, and safety. Simplifying measures, eliminating baseline alternative requirements, and improving data submission and evaluation processes are steps taken to achieve this goal. Mobility improvements will be assessed by estimating the total number of trips generated by the project, with extra weight given to trips by transit-dependent individuals. These changes, along with modifications to cost-effectiveness measures, are expected to enhance project ratings. Improving cost-effectiveness measures, particularly for projects with shorter trips like streetcars, is expected to enhance project ratings."
