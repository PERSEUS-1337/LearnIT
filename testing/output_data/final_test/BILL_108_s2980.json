Congress finds that the possession of weapons of mass destruction by hostile states or terrorist groups is the greatest threat to national security. It is a top priority to protect the US and its allies from such attacks. The US policy is to ensure compliance with the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Chemical Weapons Convention, Biological Weapons Convention, IAEA safeguards system, and control lists of MTCR, AG are key international agreements and mechanisms for preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction.

The Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program has been effective as of October 2004. As of October 2004, the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program has deactivated thousands of nuclear warheads, destroyed missiles and launchers, eliminated bombers, submarines, and nuclear test tunnels.
