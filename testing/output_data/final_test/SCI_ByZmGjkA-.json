Models must overcome learning challenges fundamental to infants learning their first words. AI researchers lack a clear understanding of how models without prior knowledge overcome these obstacles. This study aims to improve understanding of grounded language learning to inform future research and enhance confidence in model predictions. This study explores how an agent trained via policy-gradient methods interprets linguistic instructions in a 3D world, applying experimental paradigms from developmental psychology. It proposes a novel way to visualize and analyze semantic representation in language learning agents. The learning challenge faced by children acquiring their first words is a key focus, with neural network models also tackling similar tasks. Neural network models tackle learning tasks analogous to early human word learning, such as image classification and visual question answering. Situated language learning agents understand linguistic symbols in relation to visual input and motor responses, executing phrasal and multi-task instructions. Situated linguistic agents learn to execute complex instructions in a simulated 3D world, interpreting familiar language in novel environments. This technology has vast potential for applications like self-driving cars and domestic robots. Situated learning applications, such as self-driving cars and domestic robotic tools, pose challenges in understanding how agents learn and make decisions. Research in computer vision and natural language processing aims to address this uncertainty. As grounded language learning agents become more prevalent, understanding their dynamics and decision-making is crucial for future research and user confidence. This research aims to establish a better understanding of neural network-based models of grounded language learning, drawing parallels with neuroscience and psychology research on human language acquisition. This research focuses on neural network-based models of grounded language learning, utilizing experimental techniques from psychology. The experiments are conducted in a simulated 3D world with controlled environments to study human language acquisition. The methods are applicable to tasks combining linguistic and visual data, exploring the training environment's impact on learning outcomes and biases in decision-making. The research focuses on neural network-based models of grounded language learning in a simulated 3D world. By applying layerwise attention, the study reveals biases in decision-making and representation processing. The findings include shape/color biases and the challenge of learning negation in the agent. The experiments conducted in a simulated 3D world show that training neural network-based models on limited vocabulary initially helps in faster word learning. The agent also learns words of different semantic classes at varying speeds and represents them with different levels of visual processing depth. The environment used for the simulations includes a language channel where the agent receives textual instructions and is rewarded for following them. The agent in a simulated 3D world learns to perceive its environment through movement actions and execute tasks based on visual and textual instructions. It must actively control its view and navigate surroundings to solve tasks and receive rewards. The environment is specified with certain aspects while others are randomly determined, such as object positions and appearance probabilities. The simulated environment engine randomly instantiates episodes with objects and language instructions, creating millions of unique training scenarios for the agent. This environment allows for testing how agents respond to specific stimuli in grounded language learning models. The agent in the situated language learning environment observes 3D rotating objects and a language instruction to select the matching object. It combines modules for processing sequential symbolic and visual input, with a mixing module determining how signals are combined before passing to an action module. The agent in the language learning environment combines modules for processing symbolic and visual input. The mixing module determines how signals are combined before passing to an action module, which computes motor actions based on a probability distribution and state-value function. Weight updates are computed using the A3C algorithm. During training, a single parameter vector is shared across 16 CPU cores using the A3C algorithm and RMSProp update rule. The human shape bias is considered crucial for children's early word learning, where infants tend to associate novel words with the shape of an unfamiliar object. The simulated environment replicates an experiment designed to demonstrate the shape bias in humans, where the agent learns word meanings by receiving positive rewards for matching instruction words with objects and negative rewards for mismatching them. The agent learns the meaning of color, shape, and ambiguous terms through positive and negative rewards. Ambiguous terms always correspond to specific colors and shapes. Color terms refer to a range of RGB space with subtle variations. Bias is measured periodically through test episodes. The agent learns color, shape, and ambiguous terms through rewards. Bias is measured in test episodes where the agent must choose between objects based on shape and color. Different training regimes affect the bias exhibited by the agent. The agent's training regime influences its bias towards color or shape terms. Exclusive exposure to color words leads to a strong color bias, while equal exposure to shape and color terms still results in a color bias. Training exclusively on shapes before introducing color terms induces a shape bias. The network's rapid development of biases relevant to word learning highlights the progressive specialization of the agent's object recognition mechanisms. The training regime influences the bias towards color or shape terms in labelling mechanisms, allowing faster word learning. The cause of the shape bias in convolutional networks is attributed to the training data distribution rather than the architecture itself. Feed-forward convolutional architectures promote a color bias when operating on image pixels. The training regime influences bias towards color or shape terms in labeling mechanisms, affecting word learning speed. Data shows that machine-learning datasets contain more shape instances than color instances, leading to shape bias in training. The acquisition of negation in language learning models is explored through a simulation where agents are tasked with selecting objects based on instructions. Negated sentences pose challenges for language learners, impacting production and comprehension. The agent learned to follow both positive and negative instructions for various sets of words, but struggled to generalize negation from one set to another, especially with color terms. The agent struggled to generalize negation, especially with color terms, as the size of the training set increased. The model tended to associate 'not w' with avoiding specific objects rather than identifying and avoiding objects of type w. The model can effectively learn to respond to negated stimuli with broad exposure to instances of negation during training. Tailored architectures and computational biases may be needed for agents learning from constrained sets of linguistic stimuli. The agent struggles to interpret negative commands involving certain terms, but generalizes better with more exposure. Using LSTM instead of BOW encoder shows similar gradual improvement. Early exposure to simple linguistic input aids language acquisition, but not all agree. Artificial neural networks trained on symbolic data also show faster learning. Recent evidence suggests that curriculum training can be more easily realized for agents learning to act conditioned on language than those learning to map between linguistic inputs and outputs. Curricula are essential for agents learning to execute linguistic instructions that require resolving referring expressions and non-trivial action policies. In a study on curriculum learning in grounded language learning agents, the agent was trained to learn the meaning of 40 shape words under two conditions. One condition involved random presentation of all 40 words, while the other condition involved presenting subsets of words until mastery was achieved. This process was iterated for subsets of increasing size. Curriculum training was found to expedite vocabulary growth in the agent. The study on curriculum learning in grounded language agents showed that training with subsets of words led to faster learning compared to random presentation of all words. This approach accelerated vocabulary growth and highlighted the importance of training curricula for language learning agents. The study highlights the importance of training curricula for language learning agents, showing that starting with small and easy tasks and gradually increasing the language learning challenge can expedite the development of core linguistic and semantic knowledge in grounded agents. This approach accelerates vocabulary growth and improves learning outcomes. Neuroscientific theories of memory, representation, and learning have been developed to account for the effects of associating words with distinct brain regions. Understanding links between word classes, semantic domains, and learning patterns in artificial agents is crucial for designing architectures capable of learning abstract semantic phenomena in adult language. The order of word learning informs theories of child language acquisition and human semantic processing. In a study on word learning, an agent was exposed to training instances for words of six different classes. Two conditions were compared: fixed class-size with two exemplars per class, and variable class-size with different numbers of members per class. The training stimuli were randomly sampled from all word types, resulting in varied exposure to different word classes. The agent showed differences in learning speed for words of different classes. In a study on word learning, an agent showed differences in learning speed for words of different classes. In the fixed class-size condition, the agent learned blue and diagonal-striped words first, followed by brown, chair, suitcase, larger, and smaller. Category terms were learned after shape terms. In the variable class-size condition, the agent specialized in shape words before acquiring color words. Layer-wise attention was used to understand semantic processing and representation in the agent. The agent architecture is modified to learn to attend to different layers of its visual processing module based on linguistic input. The visual outputs are passed through linear layers to match the dimensionality of the language instruction. The agent architecture is modified to learn to attend to different layers of its visual processing module based on linguistic input. The final dimension is n i \u00d7 n i \u00d7 K, with v i stacked into a single tensor. T is multiplied by e l and passed through a softmax layer to yield a d dimensional probability distribution over all locations in each layer of the visual module V. Layerwise attention provides insight into important image locations and levels of visual abstraction for action selection. The agent architecture is modified to learn to attend to different layers of its visual processing module based on linguistic input. The attention distribution in an agent with layerwise attention is shown in a dashboard, highlighting the reliance on different layers of the convnet for agents trained on colour words. An agent trained on colour words relies more on lower layers of the convnet, while an agent trained on shape words focuses on upper layers. The agent's architecture includes layerwise attention, with a visualization showing how words cluster in semantic classes in the linguistic memory. In contrast, a language learning agent trained on color terms uses feature detectors from lower layers to distinguish objects, showing word-class-specific processing. Grounded language learning models enhance human-technology interaction. A language learning agent built from neural-network components overcomes early language learning challenges by acquiring first words and phrases, testing factors that speed up learning, and using layerwise attention for semantic and visual processing. Experimental paradigms from cognitive psychology are applied to understand deep neural nets, with a focus on convolutional architectures exhibiting a shape bias. The study explores abstract aspects beyond previous research. The study explores abstract linguistic operations and curriculum effects on word learning, complemented by computational analysis of representation and processing through layerwise attention. Future research may involve training agents on naturalistic data and conducting experiments with robots communicating with humans.
