    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Federal Integrated Spent Fuel and High-Level Waste Management Act of 1994\". It includes findings and purposes. The Congress finds that transportation, storage, and disposal of high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel is a national urgency. Utility generators have met their obligations under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. Some utilities have exhausted their spent nuclear fuel pool storage capacity. Federal efforts to site, license, construct, and operate disposal facilities in accordance with the provisions of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 have not met the timetables contemplated by such Act. The Secretary of Energy has an obligation to take possession of high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel by January 31, 1998, but delays have persisted for 12 years since the Act's enactment. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 requires the payment of over $8.4 billion into the Nuclear Waste Fund and sets a projected date of 2010 for the commencement of operations at a repository. Interim storage for high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel is necessary until a repository is operational. The Secretary of Energy must establish an interim storage facility by January 31, 1998, to fulfill obligations. The Act specifies the Federal Government's obligation to take possession of and safely dispose of high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel. It aims to provide incentives for the Secretary of Energy to establish storage and disposal facilities. Additionally, it requires the establishment of an interim storage facility by January 31, 1998, to fulfill obligations under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. The Federal Government is obligated to take possession of high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 is amended to require the Secretary to begin taking possession and removing high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel by January 31, 1998. This obligation is part of the Federal Integrated Spent Fuel and High-Level Waste Management Program. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 is amended to require the Secretary to take possession and remove high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel by January 31, 1998. Title to the waste or fuel transfers to the Secretary upon removal. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 is amended to establish a federal integrated spent fuel and high-level waste management program. The Secretary will establish a Federal Integrated Spent Fuel and High-Level Waste Management Program to safely manage high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel. This program includes the development and use of a multipurpose canister system for transportation, storage, and disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The Secretary will establish a Federal Integrated Spent Fuel and High-Level Waste Management Program, including the development of transportation infrastructure, an interim storage facility, and disposal of high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel. Progress reports will be submitted to Congress regularly. The Secretary will implement the Federal Integrated Spent Fuel and High-Level Waste Management Program, providing progress reports to Congress with recommendations and proposed legislation. Comments will be solicited from interested parties before the submission of each report."
