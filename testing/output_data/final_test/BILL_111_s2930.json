    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act\". Congress finds that international terrorism poses a serious threat to the United States, impacting vital interests. The Constitution grants Congress the authority to punish crimes against the law of nations and enforce treaty obligations. International terrorism hinders interstate and foreign commerce, affecting trade, market stability, and travel for both US citizens and foreign visitors. Foreign terrorist organizations raise significant funds outside the United States for conduct directed at the United States. Contributions to these organizations facilitate criminal conduct, making civil liability necessary to deter terrorism financing. Judge Richard Posner emphasized the importance of imposing damages in cases involving terrorism funding. Damages are a less effective remedy against terrorists and their organizations than against their financial angels. Suits against financiers of terrorism can cut the terrorists' lifeline. The statute of limitations for such claims must be extensive, as seed money for terrorism can lead to acts of violence long after the investment. The decision in In Re: Terrorists Attacks on September 11, 2001 undermines important counter-terrorism policies by providing undue protection from civil liability to those supporting terrorist organizations. Persons, entities, or states that knowingly contribute material support to terrorist organizations pose a significant risk to the security of the United States and should anticipate being held accountable in U.S. courts. The U.S. has a vital interest in providing access to courts for individuals and entities injured in terrorist attacks within the country. The purpose of this Act is to allow civil litigants in the United States to pursue claims against those who have supported terrorist organizations, whether directly or indirectly, to seek relief for injuries caused by terrorist activities. SEC. 3. FOREIGN SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY. Section 1605(a)(5) of title 28, United States Code is amended to include tort claims regardless of where the act occurred, such as extrajudicial killing, terrorism, or material support for such acts. The amendments made by subsection (a) expand the scope of tort claims against foreign states or officials, with retroactive application to pending and dismissed actions under section 1605(a)(5) of title 28. The amendments expand tort claims against foreign states or officials under section 1605(a)(5) of title 28, with retroactive application to pending and dismissed actions. If an action meets certain criteria, it can be given effect as if originally filed under the amended section. If an action has been dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction in relation to claims arising from an act of terrorism, plaintiffs can move to reinstate the action in the United States district court where it was originally filed. SEC. 4 amends Section 1604 of title 28, United States Code, stating that any claim against a foreign state or its officials for acts within their official capacity shall be asserted against the foreign state. The amendment applies to proceedings commenced after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 5 addresses aiding and abetting liability under the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1991. In a suit arising under subsection (a) of this section, liability may be asserted against those who committed an act of international terrorism or aided, abetted, provided material support, or conspired with the perpetrators. Additionally, any action seeking recovery under this chapter for conduct dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act is not subject to dismissal under the doctrine of claim preclusion. The amendment applies retroactively to all pending and future proceedings related to the act of international terrorism, preventing dismissal under claim preclusion. SEC. 6 of the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1991 expands the jurisdiction of district courts over individuals aiding international terrorism or providing support for acts of terrorism causing harm to U.S. nationals. The amendment applies retroactively to all ongoing and future legal proceedings related to international terrorism. SEC. 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1991 limits liability for government officials in suits under section 2333 of title 18, United States Code. The amendment applies retroactively to all pending and future proceedings. The amendment to Section 2335 of title 18, United States Code increases the penalty from four years to 10 years. It applies retroactively to all pending and future proceedings. Private civil actions dismissed as time-barred can be refiled within 90 days. Private civil actions dismissed as time-barred can be refiled within 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act. SEC. 9. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Act or the amendments made by this Act is held invalid, the rest of the Act or amendments, or their application to other persons or circumstances, will not be affected."
