Trump proposed a wealth tax plan that he believed would benefit the economy and the 1 percent. He described it as a conservative approach and estimated it could raise $5.7 trillion to pay off the national debt. Many conservatives supported the idea of reducing taxes. Many prominent conservatives argue that reducing the national debt is crucial for economic health and prosperity. According to a 2011 Heritage Foundation Report, lowering the debt will prevent financial crises, restore investor confidence, reduce the burden on future generations, and secure prosperity. Reince Priebus, former Republican National Committee Chairman, also emphasized the importance of addressing the national debt increase in 2014. The statement on the national debt increase emphasizes the immorality of spending more money than we have, highlighting the impact on future generations. Republicans advocate for fiscal responsibility in Congress. The Cato Institute also stresses the importance of reducing the debt, citing its unfairness to future generations and its negative effects on economic growth and wages. Interest on the debt is projected to increase significantly in the coming years. The national debt is projected to exceed $500 billion by 2020. President of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, Maya MacGuineas, emphasizes the importance of reducing long-term debt for economic growth. The GOP Platform in 2016 calls for firm caps on future debt and accelerated repayment of current debt. Since the beginning of the Global War on Terror, Overseas Operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and related activities have added an estimated $1.7 trillion to the national debt. Academic and media reports project future spending and obligations for these operations. The Global War on Terror, including activities in Iraq and Afghanistan, is estimated to cost between $4 trillion and $6 trillion. A recent report by the Cost of War project at Brown University puts the cost at $4.792 trillion through 2053. President Trump's proposed Wealth Tax could potentially cover all current and future obligations of the War on Terror, reducing the debt to GDP ratio from 77% to 46%. In a speech before Congress, Trump called for bipartisan unity for the good of the country and introduced the Donald J. Trump Wealth Tax. President Trump's proposed Wealth Tax aims to fulfill his promise to the American people and substantially reduce the national debt. President Trump's proposed Wealth Tax, known as the Donald J. Trump Wealth Tax, is intended to reduce the national debt. The Donald J. Trump Wealth Tax imposes a 14.25 percent tax on the net worth exceeding $10,000,000 of US citizens, residents, or applicable trusts. Net worth is determined based on rules similar to estate tax rules, with joint determination for married individuals. Applicable trusts include domestic trusts and certain portions of foreign trusts. The net worth of any grantor trust is included in determining the tax under the Donald J. Trump Wealth Tax. The value of a principal residence and its related debt is excluded from the calculation."
