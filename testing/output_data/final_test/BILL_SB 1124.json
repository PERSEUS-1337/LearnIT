    "title": "SB 1124",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 2869 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to require independent solar energy producers to disclose key information to buyers or lessees of solar energy systems for residential use. This includes providing an estimate of kilowatthours delivered, pricing calculation terms, and maintenance responsibilities. The contract provisions for the transfer of ownership of the residence and the costs associated with the solar energy system at the end of the contract must be explained in plain language. Additional disclosures may be required by the commission for ratepayer funded incentives. When a solar energy system is installed on a property for residential use, a Notice of an Independent Solar Energy Producer Contract must be recorded within 30 days of signing the contract. This notice is filed with the county recorder's office and includes specific information about the contract. When a solar energy system is installed on a property, a Notice of an Independent Solar Energy Producer Contract must be recorded within 30 days. The contract is between the property owner and an independent solar energy producer, who provides electric service through a long-term contract. The producer must provide a copy of the contract to a prospective buyer upon request. If the solar energy system is on an adjacent property, a notice must be prominently displayed. The real property receives electric service from an independent solar energy producer through a long-term contract. The producer must provide a copy of the contract to a prospective buyer upon request. The notice includes the address, assessor's parcel number, and contact information of the producer. The contract must include details on whether it is for the sale of electricity or the lease of a solar energy system, along with start and end dates. It should also outline potential costs and responsibilities in case of termination. The recorded Notice of an Independent Solar Energy Producer Contract does not create a title defect or lien on the property, and the producer is responsible for its accuracy and recording. The independent solar energy producer must record a subsequent document to extinguish the Notice of an Independent Solar Energy Producer Contract if the contract is voided, terminated, sold, assigned, or transferred. Any changes in obligations or contact information must be reflected in a new notice within 30 days. Additionally, upon termination of a contract for electricity use or sale, or lease of a solar energy system, the producer must record a document to remove the Notice from the property titles within 30 days. An independent solar energy producer must provide a copy of the existing contract to a prospective buyer of real property within 10 days of a written request from the current owner. Contracts for the sale of electricity to a residential dwelling must be made available to the commission upon request and kept confidential, with disclosures subject to public inspection by the commission. A contract provided to the commission shall not be open to public inspection, except on order of the commission. Confidentiality rules for information submitted to the commission remain unchanged. Master-meter customers purchasing electricity from independent solar energy producers must provide service to tenants of residential complexes. The provision states that users under a submetered system should be charged a rate for solar-generated electricity not exceeding the rate of the solar energy producer or the electric utility's rate. Compliance with specific regulations and rules set by electric utilities is required for master-meter customers. Failure to comply does not invalidate real property transfers, but civil liability may arise for willful or negligent violations."
