    "content": "The \"Zeroing In American Energy Act of 2008\" aims to establish a clean energy future through innovative solar technologies. Solar energy is seen as a significant domestic energy source, particularly in the Southwestern United States. Scientific American proposed a \"Grand Plan for Solar\" in 2008, suggesting that solar power could potentially supply 69% of America's electricity by 2050. Developing solar energy on federal lands will require a strong public-private partnership. The Secretary of the Interior will implement a program for leasing Federal lands for commercial photovoltaic and concentrating solar power energy systems. They will identify 6,400,000 acres of suitable lands in Arizona, California, New Mexico, Nevada, and Utah for this purpose. The Secretary of the Interior will release lease sites for solar energy development on federal lands in Arizona, California, New Mexico, Nevada, and Utah. Each lease site will be between 1280 to 12,800 acres, with annual milestones for acreage release by 2010, 2011, and 2012. The federal lands leasing program for solar energy development in Arizona, California, New Mexico, Nevada, and Utah saw significant growth in acreage from 2011 to 2019, reaching 6,400,000 acres. Certain federal lands, such as components of the National Landscape Conservation System, Wilderness and Wilderness Study Areas, Wild and Scenic Rivers, National Scenic and Historic Trails, Monuments, and Resource Natural Areas, are excluded from the program. The Secretary accepts nominations for leasing land at any time from qualified individuals. All land not subject to specific exemptions must be leased to the highest responsible bidder through annual competitive lease sales held by the Secretary. The Secretary can make land available for noncompetitive leasing if no bids are received in a competitive lease sale. Priority is given to processing lease applications for solar energy systems on Federal lands. Leases are effective for 30 years with an option to renew for another 30 years. \"Royalty is addressed in Section 4.\" Production of solar energy under a lease under this Act is subject to a royalty assessed and collected by the Secretary of the Interior. The royalty rates vary from 0.25 percent to 1 percent per kw/h based on the years of the lease. The royalty rates for solar energy production under a lease vary from 0.25 percent to 1 percent per kw/h based on the years of the lease. Royalties are to be paid to the United States, with a portion allocated to the State and county where the lands are located. Leaseholders are responsible for making royalty payments as prescribed by the Secretary. Royalty payments under this section require joint and several liability for all payments due. Payment responsibility must be affirmed in writing, and records must be kept for 7 years after release. The Secretary may conduct audits of leaseholders involved in solar energy production on leased lands to ensure compliance with requirements. Records must be maintained for 7 years after release, unless an audit or investigation is ongoing, in which case records must be kept until the Secretary releases the operator from the obligation. The Secretary has the authority to conduct audits on leaseholders in solar energy production to ensure compliance. Access to relevant documents is granted upon request. Trade secrets and confidential information may be shared with other Federal agencies for compliance purposes. Penalties apply for underreporting royalties owed on energy production. Penalties of up to 10 percent may be assessed for underreporting royalty payments on energy production. The Secretary can waive or reduce penalties if the underreporting is corrected before receiving notice or within 90 days of enactment. The Secretary must waive any assessment attributable to the underreported portion. The underreporting of royalty payments on energy production can result in penalties of up to 10 percent. The Secretary has the authority to waive or reduce penalties if the underreporting is corrected promptly. The person responsible for paying the royalty can demonstrate authorization or substantial authority for reporting royalty values to mitigate penalties. The term \"underreporting\" in royalty treatment refers to the difference between reported and actual production values, with penalties up to 10%. The Secretary can waive penalties if underreporting is promptly corrected, and exceptions may be established. Penalties received by the United States are not subject to federal share treatment. SEC. 5. PROGRAMMATIC ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT. The Secretary of the Interior must complete a programmatic environmental impact statement for the solar leasing program within 18 months of this Act. A final regulation implementing this section must be published within 6 months of the statement's completion. SEC. 6. STUDY. The Secretary of the Interior must complete a study within 2 years of this Act, focusing on Federal lands for potential compressed air energy storage, barriers to energy transmission on Federal lands, and the need for energy transmission corridors on public lands."
