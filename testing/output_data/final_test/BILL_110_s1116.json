The Act titled \"More Water, More Energy, and Less Waste Act of 2007\" aims to address the issue of water extracted during energy resource development. Most of this water is currently disposed of as waste, but by increasing its availability for irrigation and other uses, it could augment water supplies and reduce costs for energy developers. The \"More Water, More Energy, and Less Waste Act of 2007\" aims to optimize energy production by reducing waste water disposal, increasing efficiency in energy development, and promoting the use of produced water for irrigation and other purposes without harming water quality or the environment. The \"More Water, More Energy, and Less Waste Act of 2007\" aims to promote the use of produced water for irrigation and other purposes without harming water quality or the environment, and to demonstrate means of achieving these results. SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, key definitions include Lower Basin State (Arizona, California, Nevada), Produced water (water from underground sources used in energy development), Secretary (Secretary of the Interior), and Upper Basin State (Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming). SEC. 3. IDENTIFICATION OF PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS. The Secretary, along with other agencies, will conduct a study to identify obstacles to reducing produced water quantity, increasing its use for irrigation, and actions to overcome these obstacles, along with associated costs and benefits. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress one year after enacting the Act, detailing the results of the study on overcoming obstacles to reducing produced water quantity and increasing its use for irrigation. SEC. 4. IMPLEMENTATION. The Secretary will provide financial assistance for projects to optimize energy resource production by reducing produced water or increasing its recovery for various uses. Assistance will be limited to $1,000,000 per project and must include projects in both Upper and Lower Basin States. Financial assistance for projects in Basin States will not exceed $1,000,000 per project, covering up to 50% of the total project cost. The funds cannot be used for facility operation or maintenance and may be in addition to federal assistance from other laws. SEC. 5. CONSULTATION, ADVICE, AND COMMENTS. In implementing the Act, the Secretary must consult with relevant officials, review research findings, and seek advice from experts. The Secretary must consult with experts in academia and individuals with industrial experience in energy production, and solicit public comments. SEC. 6. RELATION TO OTHER LAWS. This Act does not override state laws or federal laws related to water use, quantity, or quality. SEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. $1,000,000 is authorized for section 3, and $7,500,000 for section 4."
