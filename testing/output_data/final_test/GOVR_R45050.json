    "content": "Vessels discharge various wastes and contaminants into U.S. and international waters, including nutrients, pathogens, oil, metals, toxic compounds, suspended solids, and invasive species. These discharges come from shower and laundry water, deck washdown, bilgewater, fuel, machinery wastewater, and ballast water. The contaminants can harm aquatic species and human health. The types of vessels releasing these discharges range from commercial fishing vessels to emergency response vessels. Ballast water discharges from vessels, including recreational vessels, are a concern due to the potential introduction of nonnative species that can threaten native species and various activities dependent on affected waters. The establishment of nonnative species, like zebra mussels in the Great Lakes, can lead to significant economic losses and ecological damage. Ballast water discharged from ships is a significant pathway for the introduction of aquatic nonnative species (ANS) in many U.S. areas. Ships use ballast water to stabilize during transport, taking it on in one region and discharging it in another, potentially releasing ANS into lakes or rivers. The introduction of aquatic nonnative species (ANS) through ballast water discharge can disrupt aquatic ecosystems. Legislation has been passed to prevent and control ANS invasions introduced through ballast water. Various entities regulate vessel discharges, including the Coast Guard, EPA, and some states. \"Vessel discharges\" refer to discharges incidental to the normal operation of vessels, including ballast. The Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990 (NANPCA) requires the Coast Guard to manage ballast water in U.S. waters to prevent the introduction and spread of aquatic nonnative species (ANS). NANPCA directed the Coast Guard to establish regulations for ballast water management in the Great Lakes, which were promulgated in 1993. Congress amended NANPCA in 1996 (NISA) to create a national ballast water management program. The NISA amendment in 1996 created a national ballast water management program modeled after the Great Lakes program. Ships entering U.S. waters were required to conduct midocean ballast exchange, retain ballast water onboard, or use approved alternative measures. These practices became mandatory in 2004, but some argue that midocean ballast exchange has limitations in removing organisms effectively due to safety concerns. The Coast Guard used its authority under NISA to establish ballast water treatment standards and protocols for testing technologies. A rule published in 2012 set new requirements for ballast water management, including numeric standards for living organisms and human health indicator microorganisms in discharged water. The rule established standards for ballast water management for vessels in U.S. waters, with compliance options including eliminating discharge, using approved treatment systems, or drawing water from compliant sources. Compliance was required for all vessels by January 1, 2016. The Coast Guard established standards for ballast water management, requiring vessels to use a type-approved Ballast Water Management System (BWMS). The rule also allowed for the use of Alternate Management Systems (AMS) approved by foreign administrations, deemed as effective as ballast water exchange, for up to five years after a vessel's compliance date. Compliance options included eliminating discharge, using approved treatment systems, or drawing water from compliant sources. The IMO convention on ballast water discharge standards, adopted in 2004, is similar to the 2012 Coast Guard Rule. The standards specify allowable organisms and concentrations of microbes in ballast water. The EPA also has authority to regulate vessel discharges under the Clean Water Act. The Clean Water Act gives EPA authority to regulate vessel discharges, including ballast water. EPA initially exempted vessel discharges from permitting requirements, but a court ruling in 2006 overturned this exemption, leading to stricter regulations on ballast water as a source of Aquatic Nuisance Species (ANS) in U.S. waters. The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld a ruling in 2008 that could impact over 140,000 vessels, including commercial fishing and recreational boats. The 110th Congress passed two bills in response, one providing a permanent exemption for recreational vessels from CWA permitting requirements, and the other imposing a two-year moratorium on certain commercial fishing vessel discharges. EPA and the Coast Guard were directed to create regulations under new CWA Section 312(o), but as of now, no regulations have been issued. The moratorium on certain commercial fishing vessel discharges, excluding ballast water, has been extended multiple times by Congress. The 2008 Vessel General Permit (VGP) issued by the EPA covers vessels larger than 79 feet and addresses various pollutant discharge types, including ballast water. The 2013 VGP, issued by the EPA, regulates additional waste streams like fish hold effluent and sets numeric discharge limits for ballast water. Compliance options are similar to the 2012 Coast Guard Rule, with available technologies to meet the limits. The 2013 VGP sets numeric discharge limits for ballast water, with compliance deadlines similar to the 2012 Coast Guard Rule. The 2012 Coast Guard Rule applies to about 3,050 vessels, while the 2013 VGP applies to approximately 72,000 vessels, including those that may discharge other waste streams. The Coast Guard exempts tankers in coastwise trade from NISA regulations, but they must comply with the 2013 VGP which covers ballast water and other waste discharges. Both the 2012 Coast Guard Rule and the 2013 VGP have similar ballast water discharge standards but differ in monitoring and reporting requirements. The 2013 VGP includes monitoring for biocides in ballast water discharge. The Coast Guard and EPA have enforcement authority under NISA and the CWA, with citizen suits allowed under the CWA. States can regulate vessel discharges in addition to federal requirements. NISA and the CWA do not preempt states' authority in regulating vessel discharges, allowing states like Michigan and California to have more comprehensive ballast water management programs than the Coast Guard's rules. CWA Section 510 allows states to adopt water quality standards more stringent than federal rules, giving them flexibility to address local conditions. Some states issue permits independent of the VGP to regulate ballast water discharges. CWA Section 401 requires certification for any activity with potential water discharges into the US. States have the power to impose conditions on federal permits under CWA Section 401, including additional limitations on ballast water discharges. Twenty-five states certified the 2013 VGP with supplementary conditions for effluent streams, with 14 states imposing specific numeric discharge limits for ballast water. Some states imposed additional conditions on federal permits for water discharges, including stricter discharge standards for specific pollutants like chlorine. Oregon, Washington, California, and New York have adopted various requirements and standards for ballast water discharges, with California and New York setting numeric standards much more stringent than EPA's and the Coast Guard's. California has delayed the implementation of its standards. The commercial shipping industry and environmental groups challenged state permits with stricter discharge standards, but courts generally upheld them. Congress has considered legislation for over a decade to address complex policy issues related to federal and state requirements for ballast water discharges. The maritime industry has pushed for harmonization of federal rules on vessel discharges, particularly ballast water, to reduce complexity and costs. Some advocate for centralizing regulation with the Coast Guard, while environmental groups prefer EPA's oversight due to its focus on public health and the environment. Centralizing ballast water management authority with the Coast Guard could lead to considerations on how to address additional incidental discharge waste streams in the 2013 VGP. Options include eliminating regulation, centralizing with the Coast Guard, or having EPA regulate them. If EPA continues regulating other incidental discharges, vessels would still be subject to the VGP, leading to dual regulatory regimes. Policymakers should also consider the implications of selecting the Coast Guard or EPA as the centralized regulatory authority. The Clean Water Act (CWA) allows for citizen suit enforcement, unlike the National Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act (NANPCA). Industry groups have raised concerns about state conditions attached to EPA permits, arguing they create inefficient and burdensome requirements. A federal court ruled that EPA cannot amend or reject state certifications under the CWA, leading to challenges from commercial shipping operators. Similar concerns were raised about the Coast Guard's 2012 rule, with commenters requesting preemption of state ballast water treatment standards. In response to industry requests, the Coast Guard declined to preempt state ballast water treatment standards, citing legal limitations under NANPCA. States with additional requirements oppose preemption, arguing it goes against Congress's intentions. The debate over preempting state authority in setting ballast water treatment standards continues, with arguments against it based on Congress's intentions in the CWA and NISA. The 2012 Coast Guard Rule and 2013 VGP established numeric discharge standards for ballast water in line with the IMO convention. For nonconventional pollutants like ANS, the CWA directs EPA to set effluent limitations based on BAT, considering various factors including equipment age, process changes, cost, and environmental impacts. EPA and the Coast Guard both assessed BAT for ballast water treatment. The EPA and Coast Guard found ballast water treatment technologies meeting numeric limits in the 2013 VGP and 2012 Coast Guard Rule. Environmental groups challenged the VGP, leading to a court ruling that the EPA acted arbitrarily and capriciously. The court remanded the permit for the agency to revise the ballast water sections. EPA was criticized for not adequately explaining why IMO standards were chosen over stricter ones. The court ruled that the EPA did not adequately justify choosing IMO standards over stricter technology-based effluent limitations for ballast water treatment. The court instructed the EPA to reconsider the VGP ballast water provisions but allowed the VGP to remain in effect until 2018. New York and California have adopted more stringent ballast water standards, with New York initially setting standards 100 times stricter than IMO standards. EPA has not yet responded to the court's ruling. The New York Department of Environmental Conservation postponed compliance with stricter ballast water standards to December 2013 due to technology shortages. The state recommended EPA adopt standards 100 times more stringent than IMO by June 2016. California already has standards 1,000 times stricter than IMO. In 2008, California certified the VGP with conditions including more stringent ballast water discharge standards, with implementation dates phased until 2020. The state delayed the implementation date to enable further research on treatment technologies. The Coast Guard's 2012 rule called for a review of its standards in 2016. The Coast Guard's 2012 rule called for a review of its standards in 2016, concluding that technology for significant improvement in ballast water treatment efficacy onboard vessels was not practicable at that time. Debate on appropriate and practicable standards will likely continue among policymakers and stakeholders. Vessels operating in US waters must comply with numeric ballast water discharge standards through various options. The 2012 Coast Guard Rule required vessels in US waters to comply with numeric ballast water discharge standards by January 2016. Compliance options included using approved ballast water management systems or other methods. The Coast Guard did not approve any systems until December 2016, causing delays in compliance. The Coast Guard approved six ballast water management systems in December 2016. Vessel owners/operators using an AMS were compliant with regulations, but AMS can only be used for five years. Some operators may hesitate to invest in AMS due to uncertainty about long-term compliance. The Coast Guard can grant extensions to vessels unable to comply, while EPA lacks this authority. EPA indicated vessels in compliance with the 2013 VGP and granted a Coast Guard extension would not face enforcement for noncompliance with ballast water discharge standards. The Coast Guard has approved several ballast water management systems, but vessel owners can still request extensions for noncompliance due to unavailability of approved systems. Some argue that the testing protocol for system effectiveness is too restrictive. The Coast Guard has approved ballast water management systems based on a \"live/dead\" standard for testing effectiveness. Some argue for a \"viable/nonviable\" standard. IMO guidelines require BWMS to be tested based on a live/dead standard, defining \"viable\" as \"living.\" In 2016, IMO adopted revised guidelines. In October 2016, IMO adopted revised G8 guidelines for approval of BWMS, redefining \"viable\" as organisms capable of reproducing. Prior to this, IMO Administrators used reproductive ability tests to determine viability when approving BWMS, leading to discrepancies with Coast Guard approvals based on a live/dead standard. Some systems approved by IMO are not accepted by the Coast Guard, causing frustration among manufacturers and the shipping industry. The Coast Guard argues that nonviable organisms may become viable over time. The Coast Guard argues that nonviable organisms may become viable over time, with proposed legislation in the 115th Congress seeking to address challenges in culturing all types of organisms found in ballast water. Debate surrounds the treatment of vessels operating exclusively in the Great Lakes, with some arguing they do not introduce aquatic nuisance species (ANS) while others disagree. Under the 2013 VGP, Lakers built before January 2009 are exempt from meeting the numeric ballast water discharge standard. Lakers built after January 2009 must comply with ballast water treatment limits in the 2013 VGP. EPA stated that pre-2009 Lakers were unable to meet treatment limits due to unavailable technology. The Second Circuit found EPA's decision on ballast water treatment for Lakers arbitrary and capricious, as onshore treatment was not properly considered. Coast Guard regulations exempt Lakers from complying with discharge standards, but intend to expand them in the future. Congressional policymakers also face issues with a temporary moratorium on EPA permitting for commercial fishing. The temporary moratorium on EPA permitting for commercial fishing and small vessels expired in January 2018. Nonrecreational vessels and fishing vessels under 79 feet now require coverage under EPA's small Vessel General Permit (sVGP). Commenters argue that discharges from these small vessels are not a significant harm to aquatic life compared to larger vessels. Some argue for excluding small vessels from CWA permitting due to minimal harm to aquatic life compared to larger vessels. Bills like H.R. 1154 and S. 168 aim to address regulatory issues for ballast water and incidental discharges. S. 168 was reported out of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation in March. The committee reported S. 1129, the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2017, which includes the text of S. 168 as Title VIII. Bills like S. 2194 and H.R. 4656 aim to extend the moratorium on CWA permitting for certain incidental discharges. S. 2331 proposes to extend the moratorium through March 23, 2018. Each of the VIDA bills would create a free-standing statute for vessel incidental discharges. The Vessel Incidental Discharge Act (VIDA) would establish a federal ballast water management standard, superseding state standards and EPA requirements. The Coast Guard would review the standard every 10 years to reduce the risk of Aquatic Nuisance Species (ANS) invasions. The Vessel Incidental Discharge Act (VIDA) would establish a federal ballast water management standard to reduce the risk of Aquatic Nuisance Species (ANS) invasions. States could petition for stricter standards, and if revised, it would become a national requirement. The legislation also directs the Coast Guard and EPA to establish best management practices for vessel discharges. S. 168 specifies using Best Available Technology (BAT) for the standard, while H.R. 1154 does not. The implications of this difference are unclear. The difference between S. 168 and H.R. 1154 is unclear for two reasons. S. 168 requires BAT for vessel discharges but does not define it, while H.R. 1154 does not specify pollution control levels for ballast water discharge standards. This ambiguity raises questions about how the Coast Guard and EPA would implement these regulations. The discussion outlines the provisions of Senate legislation S. 168, focusing on establishing national standards for ballast water and other discharges. The legislation aims to clarify regulations and management of ballast water discharges that can introduce aquatic nuisance species into U.S. waters. Many in the maritime industry support the bill, citing confusion and inefficiencies in the current regulatory scheme. The regulatory scheme for ballast water and other discharges is a topic of interest to Congress, with some supporting national standards while others oppose aspects like preemption of state authority."
