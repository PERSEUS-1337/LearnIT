The text chunk discusses the repeal of certain sections of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, specifically Subtitles A and E of Title V. It also mentions amendments to section 901 and conforming amendments to section 511 of the same Act. The repeal of certain sections of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 is hereby enacted, reverting the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to its original state. The Estate and Gift Tax rates are reduced to 15 percent or the generally applicable capital gains rate for individuals. The Estate Tax under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to compute the tax based on the taxable estate and adjusted taxable gifts, with a deduction for tax paid on gifts made after December 31, 1976. The taxable gifts are the total amount of gifts made by the decedent after December 31, 1976, excluding gifts included in the gross estate. The applicable percentage is defined as the lesser of 15 percent or the rate in section 1(h)(1)(C). Conforming amendments adjust the applicable credit amount to be a percentage of the applicable exclusion amount. The tax computation for the estate includes the applicable percentage of the sum of the taxable estate and adjusted taxable gifts, minus the total tax paid on gifts made after December 31, 1976. Amendments have been made to sections 2101 and 2102 of the tax code. Amendments to tax laws include changes to exemption amounts and rates for estate and gift taxes. The tax imposed by section 2501 is based on the applicable percentage of taxable gifts for each calendar year, to be paid by the donor. Amendments remove section 2504 and apply to estates and gifts after December 31, 2003. Additionally, a $5,000,000 exemption from estate and gift taxes is introduced. The amendment introduces a $5,000,000 exemption from estate and gift taxes, applicable to estates of decedents dying and gifts made after December 31, 2003."
