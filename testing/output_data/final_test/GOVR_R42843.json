    "content": "Article I of the U.S. Constitution establishes a bicameral Congress with a House of Representatives and a Senate. The House has 435 members serving two-year terms, while the Senate has two Senators per state serving six-year terms. Both chambers have equal legislative roles, but only the Senate confirms nominations and approves treaties, while only the House can originate revenue legislation. Both chambers must agree on a bill before it is presented to the President. The House and Senate have different ways of processing legislation due to their constitutional differences. House rules allow for quick processing with a numerical majority, while Senate rules prioritize deliberation and give individual Senators procedural leverage. Party leaders in each chamber coordinate congressional action, with majority party leaders in the House having significant powers to set the policy agenda. In the House and Senate, party leaders coordinate congressional action and set the policy agenda. Majority party leaders propose items for consideration, but must negotiate with minority party leaders. Policy expertise resides in standing committees, chaired by majority party members and often working closely with minority party leaders. Members serve on committees for many years, becoming highly knowledgeable in specific policy areas. Committees in Congress reflect the partisan ratio in the chamber and play a key role in drafting legislation. They also oversee policy implementation and conduct investigations. While Congress is the main driver of legislative ideas, the President can influence the process through budget recommendations and veto power. The power to veto legislation can significantly impact bills passed by Congress, as it is rare for a law to be enacted over a presidential veto. Congress must usually accommodate the President's position on policies. The legislative process for bills can vary and may not follow the typical stages. Different types of legislation can be enacted during a two-year Congress. Simple and concurrent resolutions do not make law but can be used by each chamber or both. Members of the House or Senate introduce legislation, often with assistance from nonpartisan attorneys. Bills are circulated for co-sponsors and introduced in the House by dropping it in the hopper or in the Senate by submitting it to clerks. Upon introduction, the bill receives a designation. In the House, bills are referred to committees based on jurisdiction determined by standing rules. If multiple committees are involved, each works on its designated portion. One committee is designated as the primary jurisdiction and leads any actions. In the Senate, bills follow a similar process. In the Senate, bills are referred to committees based on jurisdiction, with the committee chair having the authority to set the agenda for formal actions such as hearings or markups. Each committee receives numerous bill referrals, but only a limited number can be pursued in detail. Hearings provide a formal public setting for feedback on policy proposals from selected parties. Witnesses give oral remarks and submit written feedback, followed by committee members asking questions. Additional assessment of the approach is done through informal briefings. A hearing is not required for a bill to receive further action from the committee. A committee markup is a formal step for a bill to advance to the floor. The committee chair selects the proposal for markup, where members consider changes and vote on amendments. The markup concludes with a majority vote to report the bill to the chamber, usually only if expected to receive majority support. The committee may report a referred bill with recommended changes or an original draft. During a committee markup, members consider changes and vote on amendments to a bill before voting to report it to the chamber. Subcommittees within House and Senate committees may focus on specific policy areas, but only full committees can report legislation to the chamber for consideration on the calendars. In the House, majority party leadership decides which bills will be considered on the floor, either through expedited consideration or through the Rules Committee for more thorough review. In the Senate, majority party leadership does not have similar procedures for bringing bills to the floor. The Senate does not have procedures like the House for bringing bills to the floor. One way is by agreeing to a motion to proceed, which can be initiated by the majority leader. The Senate can then debate the motion and begin consideration of the bill if it passes by a majority vote. Alternatively, the majority leader can ask for unanimous consent to take up a bill, allowing immediate consideration if no objections are raised. Party leaders in both chambers inform members of the anticipated floor schedule using various methods. The House considers bills under various procedures with different debate times and amendment opportunities. Most bills are debated under \"suspension of the rules\" procedures, limiting debate to 40 minutes without allowing floor amendments. Passing a bill under this procedure requires two-thirds of Members voting to agree. Bills not under this procedure are considered under terms tailored for each bill, established through a special rule adopted by a House resolution reported by the House Rules Committee. The House Rules Committee reports special rules that dictate the procedures for considering bills in the House. These rules, established through a House resolution, outline details such as the text to be considered, debate time, and limits on amendments. The majority party members outnumber minority party members on the committee. Special rules can either allow numerous amendments or restrict them to predetermined ones, with House rules imposing additional limitations on amendment content unless waived by the special rule. After the Rules Committee reports a special rule for a bill, the House first debates and votes on adopting the rule before proceeding to consider the bill itself in the Committee of the Whole. Members can offer and vote on amendments, with each requiring a simple majority for approval. The Committee of the Whole then reports any recommended amendments to the full House for approval. In the House, votes are taken by voice or electronic device. The Senate must agree to consider a bill before proposing amendments. The Senate often faces challenges in reaching a final vote on a matter. Senate rules do not allow for a simple majority to impose a debate limit and move to a final vote, leading to the possibility of filibusters. Cloture rule, or Senate Rule XXII, allows a supermajority to limit debate on a bill, amendment, or motion. The cloture rule in the Senate allows a supermajority of 60 Senators to limit debate on a bill, amendment, or motion. This process can require significant Senate floor time and provides leverage to individual Senators during floor debate and amending. The Senate can effectively process its business through unanimous consent agreements, tailored to each bill, to limit debate and amendments. Recorded votes are conducted through a roll call, unlike the House's electronic system. The Senate has unique responsibilities outlined in the U.S. Constitution. The U.S. Constitution gives the Senate the power to confirm presidential nominees for the judiciary and executive branch, approve treaties, and conduct hearings for nominees. Treaties and nominations require Senate approval, with treaties needing a two-thirds majority vote for ratification. Nominations only need a simple majority vote for confirmation on the Senate floor. The Senate requires a simple majority vote to confirm presidential nominees, but nominations are debatable. Supporters may need to use cloture to reach a vote, which requires a three-fifths majority for most questions but a simple majority for nominations. Bills must be agreed upon by both chambers before being presented to the President, with identical proposals potentially moving through each chamber separately. This process may take significant floor time. When one chamber receives a bill passed by the other, it may amend it or consider its own bill first. Once a chamber passes a bill, it is engrossed and sent to the other chamber. The second chamber may agree to the exact text or amend the bill, potentially proposing an alternative version with minor or substantial differences. The process of amending bills between the House and Senate involves proposing alternatives, sending proposals back and forth, and potentially resolving differences through a conference committee made up of members from both chambers. A conference committee, comprised of Members of the House and Senate, negotiates a compromise on a bill by drawing on elements from competing proposals. If the proposal is supported by a majority of both House and Senate conferees, it is embodied in a conference report. This report is then considered in each chamber, following specific procedures and potentially requiring a cloture process in the Senate. Once both chambers of Congress have agreed to a bill in the same form, it is enrolled and presented to the President. The President has 10 days to sign or veto the bill. If the President does not act, the bill becomes law without his signature. If the President vetoes the bill, it can be overridden by a successful vote in the originating chamber. When both chambers of Congress agree on a bill, it is presented to the President who has 10 days to sign or veto it. If vetoed, a successful override vote by two-thirds of voting Members in each chamber is needed for the bill to become law. Successful overrides are rare, and enacted bills are then assigned a public law number and included in the United States Statutes at Large."
