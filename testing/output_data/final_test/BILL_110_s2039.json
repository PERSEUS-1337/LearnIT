    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Strategic Deterrent Sustainment Act of 2007\" and includes findings. Congress finds that the strategic forces of the United States, including ICBMs, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and long-range bombers, are crucial for national security. The Minuteman III system is highlighted for its responsiveness, stability, and cost-effectiveness. This is in line with the 2001 Nuclear Posture Review and the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act. The Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile modernization program is nearing completion, with no future program to sustain the capability of the US industrial base for replacing these missiles. Motor production for the Minuteman III Propulsion Replacement Program is scheduled to end in fiscal year 2009. The Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile modernization program is ending soon, with the PRP program concluding in fiscal year 2009. This will severely diminish the US industrial base's ability to address issues related to the aging and obsolescence of the missiles, potentially leading to the loss of critical program knowledge and making the current missile design irreproducible.

SEC. 3. REPORT ON CAPABILITIES FOR SUSTAINMENT OF THE MINUTEMAN III INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC MISSILE. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report to Congress by March 1, 2008, on the US industrial base's capability to maintain the Minuteman III ICBM system until 2030 and replace it with a new system after 2030. The report should include plans for extending the Minuteman III system beyond 2030 and testing for aging and obsolescence issues. The report to Congress must include plans for maintaining the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile system after 2030 and assessing associated risks. It should also explain why the system is no longer considered a top national defense priority. The Trident II D5 missile system remains on the \"DX-list\" and an analysis is needed to compare its service life extension program with the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile system. Additionally, an assessment of current programs like missile defense and space launch is required to support industrial needs. The Comptroller General will review the impact of extending global strike programs to the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile system, including materials, suppliers, production facilities, and workforce. The report will assess the consistency of the President's budget for fiscal year 2009. The report under subsection (a) is reviewed pursuant to section 1105 of title 31, United States Code. The term \"congressional defense committees\" refers to specific committees in the Senate and House of Representatives."
