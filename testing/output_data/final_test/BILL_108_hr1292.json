    "content": "The \"Remote Sensing Applications Act of 2004\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. Key findings are outlined in the following section. The Congress recognizes the importance of federal involvement in innovative land use planning and growth management, as well as the value of remote sensing and geospatial data for societal goals. Landsat data and earth observation data have shown significant potential for assistance. Remote sensing and geospatial information can assist various agencies in urban planning, coastal management, resource management, and disaster monitoring. The potential of integrating remote sensing with geographic information systems and satellite data for societal needs has not been fully explored. Various policies support the development of these technologies. The Space Act of 1998 supports and promotes the development of commercial remote sensing capabilities in the United States. Many agencies are unaware of the benefits of remote sensing and geospatial information, hindering their ability to effectively manage resources, as highlighted in a 2003 Government Accounting Office report. (10) Remote sensing and geospatial information are valuable for urban planning, wildland fire management, and disaster relief. (11) NASA, in collaboration with other agencies, can demonstrate how scientific data can assist in decision-making for agriculture, weather forecasting, and forest management. NASA, along with other agencies, can stimulate the development of remote sensing and geospatial information by demonstrating the value of integrating governmental and commercial data for useful applications. The Act defines key terms such as \"Administrator,\" \"geospatial information,\" and \"institution of higher education.\" It also includes provisions for pilot projects to promote public sector applications. The Administrator will establish a grant program for pilot projects using remote sensing and geospatial information to address agency needs. Preference will be given to projects using existing data sets, integrating multiple geospatial sources, involving non-Federal contributions, and collaborating with commercial entities. Opportunities for assisting in the development of commercial applications, growth management, and wildland fire detection using remote sensing and geospatial information technologies. Assistance for pilot projects will be provided for a maximum of 3 years. Recipients of grants must submit a report on the project results within 180 days of completion and conduct a workshop within the same timeframe to share lessons learned. The Administrator will establish regulations for application, selection, and implementation procedures, as well as guidelines for reports and workshops. SEC. 5. PROGRAM EVALUATION. The Administrator shall establish an advisory committee with expertise in various fields to monitor the program under section 4. The committee will consult with relevant industry representatives and organizations. An evaluation of the program's effectiveness in utilizing remote sensing sources must be submitted to Congress by December 31, 2008. The program will be evaluated by an independent entity to assess the integrated use of remote sensing and geospatial information for State, local, regional, and tribal agency needs. The Administrator will ensure that pilot project results are accessible through an electronic database. An educational outreach program will be established to raise awareness of remote sensing applications. A study on the impact of remote sensing imagery costs on agency applications will be conducted and results will be reported to Congress within 2 years. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration will submit a report to Congress on agencies' implementation of recommendations from a 2003 report on geospatial information for wildland fire management. $15,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2005 to 2009 for this Act."
