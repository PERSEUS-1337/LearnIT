    "title": "SB 909",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 20583 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to define \"residential dwelling\" as a dwelling occupied as the principal place of residence of the claimant, including the land surrounding it necessary for home use. This definition includes condominiums assessed as realty for property tax purposes and parts of multidwelling or multipurpose buildings. In this chapter, \"owned\" in reference to ownership interests in residential dwellings includes the interest of a vendee in possession under a land sale contract or the holder of a life estate, but not the interest of any remainder interest or reversionary interest holders. The interest in a residential dwelling held in tenancy by the entirety, community property, or trust is protected by the Controller. Ownership of a residential dwelling must be evidenced by a recorded instrument in the county office. A residential dwelling does not include properties where owners have less than 40 percent equity, as determined by property taxation or fair market value. The Controller protects interests in dwellings held in tenancy by the entirety, community property, or trust. The Revenue and Taxation Code specifies conditions under which a residential dwelling may be subject to tax postponement and creation of a lien in favor of the state. This includes situations where the claimant's interest is held under a contract of sale or life estate, or as a possessory interest. Section 20583 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to define a \"residential dwelling\" as the claimant's primary residence and surrounding land necessary for home use, including condominiums and parts of multi-dwelling buildings. In reference to ownership interests in residential dwellings, \"owned\" includes the interest of a vendee in possession under a land sale contract or the holder of a life estate, but not remainder or reversionary interests. The interest in a residential dwelling can include ownership in tenancy by the entirety, community property, or held in trust, subject to protection by the Controller. Ownership of a residential dwelling must be evidenced by a recorded instrument in the county office. A residential dwelling must have owners with at least 40 percent equity to be eligible for certain provisions.
