    "content": "The Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause prohibits states from denying equal protection of the laws. The Supreme Court has extended equal protection principles to the federal government. Courts apply different levels of scrutiny to government actions that classify people, depending on the level of suspicion or discrimination involved. The three levels of scrutiny are strict scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, and rational basis review. Strict scrutiny is the most rigorous form of judicial review, applied to governmental classifications that are constitutionally suspect or interfere with fundamental rights. It is used for classifications based on race, national origin, and alienage. Courts consider historical discrimination, unchangeable characteristics, and inadequate political protection when determining suspect classifications. The government must prove that its actions are narrowly tailored to a compelling interest when subject to strict scrutiny. Intermediate scrutiny is a less rigorous form of judicial review than strict scrutiny, applied to classifications like gender or illegitimacy. Courts assess if the government's actions are substantially related to an important interest under intermediate scrutiny. The government must prove the constitutional validity of its actions under this level of scrutiny. Rational basis review is the least stringent form of scrutiny and applies to classifications not subject to strict or intermediate scrutiny. Rational basis review is a form of judicial scrutiny that applies to classifications not subject to heightened levels of scrutiny. It requires governmental action to be rationally related to a legitimate government interest. Courts consider the legitimacy of any possible governmental purpose behind the action, and the action only needs to be a reasonable way of achieving a legitimate government purpose to pass this review. Rational basis review is deferential to the government, with courts generally presuming the constitutionality of actions subject to this review. Parties challenging governmental actions bear the burden of proving their invalidity under rational basis review. There is a debate over whether state same-sex marriage bans violate the Constitution's equal protection and substantive due process principles. The U.S. Constitution's due process guarantees are found in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution contain due process guarantees that protect individuals from government deprivation of life, liberty, or property without following certain procedural and substantive requirements. The Fifth Amendment applies to federal government actions, while the Fourteenth Amendment applies to state actions. Substantive due process prohibits the government from unduly burdening fundamental rights and requires strict scrutiny for governmental actions that infringe upon these rights. The government's infringement upon fundamental rights is subject to strict scrutiny, requiring actions to be narrowly tailored to a compelling governmental interest. The government must demonstrate a substantial need in furtherance of a compelling interest, ensuring that actions do not encumber fundamental rights more than necessary. The Supreme Court recognizes rights such as the right to have children, use contraception, and marry as fundamental. Parties have sought to invalidate same-sex marriage bans under the Constitution's substantive due process. Parties have challenged same-sex marriage bans under the Constitution's substantive due process guarantees, arguing that they violate the fundamental right to marry. Circuit courts have differed on whether these bans violate the Fourteenth Amendment, interpreting Supreme Court precedent in varying ways. The Supreme Court's decision in Baker v. Nelson previously seemed to protect state same-sex marriage bans from equal protection and due process challenges. The plaintiffs argued that prohibiting same-sex marriages violates the fundamental right to marry and denies equal protection of the law. The Minnesota Supreme Court disagreed, stating that the right to marry does not extend to same-sex couples and that Minnesota's marriage classification does not discriminate irrationally. The plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which was required to review the case under a now-defunct statute. The plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court to challenge Minnesota's refusal to recognize their marriage based on constitutional grounds. The Supreme Court summarily dismissed the appeal without opinion, setting a precedent for lower courts to follow. In the wake of the Supreme Court's summary dismissal in Baker, lower federal courts had to dismiss challenges to state same-sex marriage bans based on equal protection and due process principles. Summary dismissals are no longer binding precedent when doctrinal developments show substantial federal questions. Circuit courts are split on whether Baker requires dismissal of such claims. The Sixth Circuit precludes evaluating challenges, while the Fourth, Seventh, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits do not. The U.S. Courts of Appeals for the Fourth, Seventh, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits have held that doctrinal developments since Baker indicate that the Court now views issues raised in Baker as substantial federal questions. Romer v. Evans (1996) involved a Colorado constitutional amendment prohibiting actions to protect gay people from discrimination, which the Supreme Court found violated the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. The Supreme Court's decision in Romer v. Evans (1996) found that a Colorado amendment targeting gay individuals did not pass rational basis review, as it violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court disagreed with Colorado's argument that the amendment simply denied special protections to gay individuals, stating that it imposed a broad and undifferentiated burden on them. The Supreme Court invalidated a Colorado constitutional amendment targeting gay individuals in Romer v. Evans (1996), finding it imposed a broad disability on them without a legitimate state interest. This decision expanded gay rights under substantive due process principles, as seen in Lawrence v. Texas (2003), where the Court struck down a Texas statute criminalizing same-sex sexual contact. In Lawrence v. Texas (2003), the Supreme Court overturned Bowers v. Hardwick, ruling that gay individuals have the right to engage in private, consensual sexual conduct under substantive due process principles. This decision expanded gay rights by recognizing the liberty protections for private sexual relationships between consenting adults. The Court in Lawrence v. Texas recognized the right of gay individuals to engage in private, consensual sexual conduct, without specifying the level of scrutiny for laws prohibiting such activity. The Court suggested that the Texas statute lacked a legitimate state interest, possibly applying a form of rational basis review. This marked an advancement in gay rights. In United States v. Windsor (2013), the Supreme Court recognized that the Constitution's due process protections extend to same-sex sexual activity by striking down Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act. This decision was based on equal protection, due process, and federalism considerations, allowing for recognition of same-sex marriages legally performed in states like New York. In United States v. Windsor (2013), the Supreme Court found Section 3 of DOMA unconstitutional, citing equal protection and federalism principles. The Court emphasized states' authority to define marital relations and criticized DOMA for deviating from this historical practice. The Court in United States v. Windsor (2013) invalidated Section 3 of DOMA, citing equal protection and due process principles. It found that DOMA aimed to disadvantage and stigmatize same-sex marriages, violating basic constitutional principles applicable to the Federal Government. The Court's decision in Windsor invalidated Section 3 of DOMA based on equal protection and due process principles. Federalism's role in the decision remains unclear, with Justices Roberts and Scalia offering differing views on its impact. This ambiguity has led to varying outcomes in lower courts regarding state same-sex marriage bans. The aftermath of Windsor's decision on DOMA left lower courts to grapple with issues surrounding same-sex marriage bans, including the level of scrutiny for sexual orientation classifications and the fundamental right to marry for same-sex couples under the Constitution. Challenges to state bans made their way into federal courts, which had to determine if previous cases like Baker still applied or if newer cases like Romer, Lawrence, and Windsor rendered them non-binding. The U.S. Courts of Appeals have invalidated state same-sex marriage bans, citing doctrinal developments after Baker, such as the Supreme Court's decisions in Romer, Lawrence, and Windsor. This has led to a circuit split, with courts finding that Baker is no longer binding precedent. The Fourth Circuit, along with other circuits, has found that Baker is no longer binding precedent in light of doctrinal developments after Romer, Lawrence, and Windsor. This has led to a reevaluation of state same-sex marriage bans under the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection and due process principles. The Fourth Circuit, along with other circuits, has reevaluated state same-sex marriage bans under the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection and due process principles. The Fourth Circuit held that the fundamental right to marry includes the right of same-sex couples to marry, not restricted by individual characteristics. This interpretation is supported by Supreme Court precedent, such as in Lawrence, where the right at issue was the right of all people to make decisions regarding their sexual relationships. The Fourth Circuit and other circuits have invalidated state same-sex marriage bans, applying strict scrutiny and recognizing the fundamental right to marriage for same-sex couples. The Tenth Circuit also ruled similarly in Kitchen v. Herbert and Bishop v. Smith, emphasizing the broad right of individuals to marry. The Ninth Circuit also addressed same-sex marriage bans in Latta v. Otter. The Ninth Circuit, like the Fourth and Tenth Circuits, applied heightened scrutiny to state same-sex marriage bans in Latta v. Otter. Unlike the Fourth and Tenth Circuits, the Ninth Circuit based its decision on equal protection principles. The Seventh Circuit, in Baskin v. Bogan, did not apply heightened scrutiny and struck down state same-sex marriage bans using rational basis review. The Seventh Circuit struck down state same-sex marriage bans using rational basis review, stating that the discrimination is irrational and unconstitutional. The Sixth Circuit upheld such bans in DeBoer v. Snyder, considering the applicability of Baker and Windsor in determining the constitutionality of state same-sex marriage bans. The Sixth Circuit upheld state same-sex marriage bans, stating that Baker and Windsor are not inconsistent. The court reasoned that Windsor invalidated DOMA based on federal-state authority, while Baker upheld states' rights to define marriage. The plaintiffs argued that post-Baker developments make it non-binding, but the Sixth Circuit disagreed, stating it can only disregard Supreme Court decisions in specific circumstances. The Sixth Circuit upheld state same-sex marriage bans, stating that Baker and Windsor are not inconsistent. The court reasoned that Windsor invalidated DOMA based on federal-state authority, while Baker upheld states' rights to define marriage. The Sixth Circuit determined that state same-sex marriage bans are subject to rational basis review under the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection and due process guarantees. The court noted that classifications based on sexual orientation receive rational basis review and are not entitled to heightened scrutiny. The Sixth Circuit upheld state same-sex marriage bans, stating that classifications based on sexual orientation receive rational basis review. The court observed that governmental action motivated by animus toward a particular group cannot pass rational basis review. The state same-sex marriage bans were constitutional amendments voted on by the citizens of each state, with no animus found. The Sixth Circuit upheld state same-sex marriage bans, citing two legitimate state interests: incentivizing procreation and preserving traditional marriage norms. The Supreme Court consolidated four state same-sex marriage ban cases for review, with oral arguments scheduled for April 28, 2015. Key questions include whether the Fourteenth Amendment requires states to license and recognize same-sex marriages. The Supreme Court is set to make a final ruling on whether states must allow and recognize same-sex marriages. Justice Kennedy's vote may be crucial in the decision. The Court could potentially rule that the Fourteenth Amendment does not mandate states to permit or acknowledge same-sex marriages performed out-of-state. This could be based on the argument that state bans on same-sex marriage do not violate equal protection or due process guarantees. The Supreme Court may find that state same-sex marriage bans were not driven by animus towards gay individuals, as in the DeBoer case. This could lead to states being able to prohibit same-sex couples from marrying and refuse to recognize same-sex marriages from other states. Alternatively, the Court could rule that the Fourteenth Amendment requires states to allow and recognize same-sex marriages. The Fourteenth Amendment may require states to allow and recognize same-sex marriages, potentially subjecting laws based on sexual orientation to heightened constitutional scrutiny. This could have implications beyond just marriage rights for gay individuals. The Court may subject state same-sex marriage bans to heightened constitutional scrutiny, potentially expanding the rights of gay individuals beyond just marriage rights. Alternatively, the Court could limit its holding by requiring states to permit same-sex marriages on narrower grounds. The Court may apply a less deferential version of rational basis review to invalidate state same-sex marriage bans, potentially finding them motivated by animus. Alternatively, the Court could require states to recognize same-sex marriages lawfully formed in other states. The Supreme Court may invoke federalism principles to uphold state same-sex marriage bans or require states to recognize same-sex marriages from other states. This decision could either restrict same-sex couples from marrying in certain states or broaden gay individuals' rights by allowing same-sex marriages nationwide. The Supreme Court may expand the rights of gay individuals by legalizing same-sex marriages nationwide, granting them access to state and federal benefits."
