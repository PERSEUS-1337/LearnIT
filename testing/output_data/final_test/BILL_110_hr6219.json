The Act, titled the \"Private Property Rights Protection and Government Accountability Act\", includes findings that emphasize the importance of property rights in interstate commerce and the prohibition of public takings for private economic development. It aims to protect private property from being taken for economic purposes by State or local governments. SEC. 3 prohibits States or political subdivisions from receiving Federal economic development funds if they carry out public takings for private purposes affecting interstate commerce. SEC. 4 allows property owners to seek injunctive relief and attorney's fees for such takings. SEC. 5 provides definitions. The Act defines \"private purpose\" as the ownership, control, or use of property acquired through public taking by a private party that advances their economic interests, including economic development plans for increased tax revenue or employment. Private purpose refers to the ownership, control, or use of property by a private party for commercial, industrial, or residential development, excluding general public use or benefit. Exceptions include conveying property for public ownership or to entities like common carriers. The curr_chunk discusses various scenarios where property can be acquired or used, including for public use by carriers, eliminating harmful uses, leasing to private entities for incidental use, and acquiring abandoned property. The curr_chunk defines Federal economic development funds as funds administered by specific federal agencies and distributed to states or political subdivisions for promoting interstate commerce and improving properties. The curr_chunk defines public taking as the transfer of property rights from a private owner to another person or public ownership without the private owner's consent.
