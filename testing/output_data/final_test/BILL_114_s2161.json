    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Liberian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act of 2015\" and includes provisions for the adjustment of status. The \"Liberian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act of 2015\" allows for the adjustment of status for eligible aliens to become lawful permanent residents if they apply within one year of the enactment of the Act and meet other eligibility criteria. The \"Liberian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act of 2015\" allows eligible aliens to adjust their status to become lawful permanent residents, with certain exceptions such as convictions for aggravated felonies or crimes involving moral turpitude. The \"Liberian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act of 2015\" allows eligible aliens to apply for adjustment of status if they have been subject to an order of exclusion, deportation, or removal, regardless of the order. The \"Liberian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act of 2015\" allows eligible aliens to apply for adjustment of status without the need to file a separate motion to reopen, reconsider, or vacate the order. If the Secretary of Homeland Security approves the adjustment, the order described in subparagraph (A) will be canceled. If the adjustment is denied, the order remains effective and enforceable. The benefits of the \"Liberian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act of 2015\" apply to eligible aliens who are nationals of Liberia and have been continuously present in the United States between January 1, 2013, and the date of application. Spouses, children, or unmarried sons or daughters of eligible aliens also qualify. Absences do not break the period of continuous physical presence. The Secretary of Homeland Security can establish procedures for aliens subject to deportation to seek a stay of removal based on an application. The Secretary cannot order an alien to be removed if they are in deportation proceedings and have applied for adjustment of status. The Secretary of Homeland Security can authorize employment for aliens applying for adjustment of status under subsection (a) while their application is pending. If an application for adjustment of status under subsection (a) is pending for over 180 days without denial, the Secretary of Homeland Security must allow employment. Upon approval, a record of permanent residence is established. Applicants have the right to administrative review similar to section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The Immigration and Nationality Act allows for adjustment of status for aliens subject to removal proceedings. The Secretary of Homeland Security's determination on status adjustment is final and not subject to judicial review. Granting permanent residence status does not reduce the number of immigrant visas available. The Act's provisions apply unless specifically provided otherwise. The Immigration and Nationality Act allows for adjustment of status for aliens subject to removal proceedings. The definitions in the Act apply to this section. The Secretary of Homeland Security's authority in enforcing immigration laws is not affected by this Act. Eligibility for permanent residence status does not prevent an alien from seeking other eligible statuses under different laws."
