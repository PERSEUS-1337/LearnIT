    "content": "Regional trade agreements (RTAs) have increased worldwide since the early 1990s, with many WTO members focusing on regional or bilateral free trade agreements. Mexico, a WTO member, has a strong commitment to trade liberalization and actively pursues FTAs to promote economic growth and reduce dependence on the United States, its largest trading partner. Mexico has entered into 11 free trade agreements with 46 countries, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). The United States decided not to ratify the TPP, prompting Mexico and other countries to consider moving forward on an FTA without the U.S. Congressional interest in the trade and economic relationship with Mexico remains high. Congressional interest in the trade and economic relationship with Mexico includes issues related to NAFTA, Mexico's trade agreements, the TPP, economic conditions, the labor market, and migration to the United States. Mexico has 11 free trade agreements with 46 countries, including the TPP. Economic motivations drive countries to form FTAs. Mexico's primary motivation for entering into free trade agreements, such as NAFTA, was to improve economic conditions, attract foreign investment, and expand market access for exports. The lowering of trade barriers and predictable trade rules provided by FTAs can enhance investor confidence and attract foreign direct investment. Mexico is seeking to expand market access for its exports and reduce reliance on the United States by entering into trade agreements with other countries. FTAs offer broader market access for goods and services, allowing producers to lower unit costs by increasing production volumes. This strategy is driven by Mexico's high dependence on the US export market and the slow progress in multilateral WTO negotiations. Smaller trade arrangements are seen as \"building blocks\" towards achieving economic goals. Mexico's shift towards smaller trade arrangements may be driven by various factors, including the desire to demonstrate good governance and lock in political and economic reforms. Historically, Mexico maintained protectionist trade policies to promote domestic-led industrialization, but began to face economic challenges in the mid-1980s. This led to a shift towards seeking broader market access through trade agreements with other countries. In the mid-1980s, Mexico faced economic challenges due to the 1982 debt crisis, leading to efforts to privatize state industries and implement trade liberalization measures. This included joining GATT in 1986 and making the country competitive in nonoil exports. Mexico's trade liberalization measures led to closer ties with the United States, culminating in the NAFTA negotiations in the early 1990s. The agreement was signed on December 17, 1992, encompassing trade in services, government procurement, dispute settlement procedures, and intellectual property rights protection. Mexico's pursuit of FTAs aimed to stabilize its economy, which had faced challenges in the 1980s, including deepening poverty. Mexico pursued free trade agreements to diversify exports, attract FDI, create jobs, and reduce poverty. With 11 trade agreements involving 46 countries, including the US, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and Uruguay, Mexico aims to lessen economic dependence on the US, its main trading partner. Mexico has signed multiple free trade agreements with countries in the Western Hemisphere and beyond, including Israel, the European Union, and the European Free Trade Association. They have also expanded trade agreements with Asian countries like Singapore, Korea, and Japan, being the first Latin American country to have preferential access to these markets. Despite these efforts, Mexico's trade dependence on the United States remains significant. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has not significantly reduced Mexico's reliance on trade with the United States. NAFTA was signed in December 1992 and implemented on January 1, 1994, opening up the Mexican market to the U.S. and Canada. It eliminated tariffs, quotas, and import licenses, with some tariffs phased out over 5 to 15 years. NAFTA also included provisions for market access in goods, agriculture, and services, as well as foreign direct investment and intellectual property rights. NAFTA provisions included market access in goods, agriculture, and services; foreign direct investment; intellectual property rights protection; and elimination of nontariff barriers to agricultural trade. Mexico phased out import license requirements with tariff-rate quotas over a 10-year period, making half of U.S.-Mexico agricultural trade duty-free. The NAFTA agreement included longer phaseout schedules for sensitive products like sugar, corn, and peanuts, with sugar having the longest phaseout period of 15 years. The Mexico-Chile FTA, signed in 1998, aimed to deepen trade relations and improve investment opportunities between the two countries. The 1998 Mexico-Chile FTA replaced an earlier agreement, removing tariffs on merchandise trade. It covers national treatment, market access, rules of origin, customs procedures, investment, and more. It lacks chapters on energy, environment, and labor, but includes provisions on double taxation. The FTA is similar to NAFTA but excludes labor and environmental provisions, with additional agreements on financial services, patents, and government procurement. The Mexico-EU free trade agreement, known as the Global Agreement, was established in 2000 to expand market access for EU exports to Mexico and attract more FDI. Since then, both parties have updated provisions and are considering modernizing the agreement to align with recent agreements. In June 2015, Mexico and the European Union announced negotiations for a new FTA. Amid rising protectionist sentiment in the US, experts suggest aggressive FTA negotiations. In May 2016, negotiations began to modernize the Mexico-EU FTA, aiming to deepen trade relations. Discussions include government procurement, energy trade, IPR protection, rules of origin, and support for small- and medium-sized businesses. EU Commissioner and Mexico's Minister of Economy aim to bring trade relations into the 21st century. The Mexico-EU Global Agreement covers provisions on national treatment, market access, government procurement, IPR, investment, financial services, standards, telecommunications, agriculture, dispute settlement, and cooperation in various areas. Tariffs on industrial goods and agricultural products are phased out over time, with the EU eliminating tariffs on 82% of imports from Mexico and Mexico eliminating tariffs on 47% of imports from the EU. Tariff negotiations also include fisheries, aiming to phase out tariffs on 62% of trade within 10 years. The Mexico-EU Global Agreement includes provisions on national treatment, market access, government procurement, IPR, investment, financial services, standards, telecommunications, agriculture, dispute settlement, and cooperation. Tariffs on industrial goods and agricultural products are phased out over time, with the EU eliminating tariffs on 82% of imports from Mexico and Mexico eliminating tariffs on 47% of imports from the EU. Most nontariff barriers were removed, and Mexico agreed to phase out import restrictions on new automobiles from the EU by 2007. In services trade, the agreement provides European service operators with \"NAFTA-equivalent\" access to Mexico in various sectors. Mexico also signed a free trade agreement with the European Free Trade Association. The EFTA signed a free trade agreement with Mexico on November 27, 2000, which entered into force on July 1, 2001. The agreement includes provisions on national treatment, market access for goods, agriculture, rules of origin, safeguards, and other aspects. Over the first six years, Mexican tariffs on EFTA industrial goods were reduced from 8% to zero. Discussions have taken place to further integrate trade, including amendments on transportation and extending coverage to processed agricultural products. The Mexico-Uruguay free trade agreement, signed in 2003 and in force since 2004, eliminated tariffs on most manufactured goods, with exceptions for footwear and wool products. Automotive goods are covered under a separate agreement. In agriculture, Uruguay lowered tariffs on 240 product lines from Mexico, excluding sensitive items like corn, beans, and poultry. Tariffs on bovine meat were reduced from 10% to 7% over three years. Mexico and Japan signed the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) in 2004, Japan's second free trade deal and its most comprehensive at the time. The EPA liberalized trade in agricultural products and included regulations on labor mobility and investment. Mexico and Japan revised their Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) in 2011, expanding low-tariff import quotas for agricultural products like beef, pork, chicken, and oranges. Mexico accelerated the removal of import tariffs on auto parts and ink-jet printer paper. Tariffs on mandarin oranges were eliminated, and tariff rate quotas were established for apples and green tea. The goal was to restore the competitiveness of Japanese companies in the Mexican market, where Mexico already had free trade agreements with the US, Canada, and the EU. The revised Economic Partnership Agreement between Mexico and Japan aimed to address tariff discrepancies and exclusion of Japanese companies in Mexico. The agreement focused on increasing Japanese investment, creating jobs, expanding exports to Japan, technology transfer, and enhancing industrial competitiveness in Mexico. Key provisions included national treatment, market access, sanitary measures, rules of origin, dispute settlement, and cooperation in vocational education, agriculture, tourism, and the environment. Japan agreed to expand low-tariff import quotas for agricultural items, while Mexico accelerated tariff removal on auto parts and ink-jet printer paper. Mexico and Japan revised their Economic Partnership Agreement to address tariff discrepancies and exclusion of Japanese companies in Mexico. Japan agreed to expand low-tariff import quotas for agricultural items, while Mexico accelerated tariff removal on auto parts and ink-jet printer paper. Additionally, Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela signed a free trade agreement in 1994, with Venezuela withdrawing in 2006. Mexico and Colombia expanded their bilateral trade agreement in 2011. The Mexico-Colombia FTA was expanded in 2011, with provisions on market access, rules of origin, a trade integration committee, administrative duties, and a name change. The agreement covers various areas such as antidumping duties, dispute resolution, intellectual property rights, and market access for specific products like semitrailers, chickpeas, and crackers. The Mexico-Colombia FTA opens up the Mexican market for Colombian products like crackers, citric acid, palm oil, and pork rinds. The agreement excludes trade liberalization for coffee, plantains, sugar, tobacco, and cacao. Mexico allows limited dairy and beef exports from Colombia. Mexico and Israel signed a free trade agreement in 2000, eliminating tariffs on most products with full elimination by 2005. The agreement aimed to increase export access, FDI, and technology transfer between Mexico and Israel. The Mexico-Israel free trade agreement, signed in 2000, aimed to increase FDI and technology transfer between the two countries. The agreement covered national treatment, market access, rules of origin, customs procedures, and more. Mexico received duty-free access on 50% of exports to Israel, with tariff reductions on 12% and tariff-rate quotas on 25%. Israel received duty-free access on 72% of exports to Mexico, with tariffs gradually phased out. Additional tariff reductions occurred in 2003 and 2005. Mexico and Peru began negotiations in December 2005 to broaden and deepen their Economic Cooperation Agreement (ECA) established in 1987. After six years of negotiations, they signed the Mexico-Peru Trade Integration Agreement on April 6, 2011, which entered into force on February 1, 2012. The FTA covers 12,017 products, replacing the 1987 ECA that covered 765 products. Tariffs will be phased out over a 10-year period, and the agreement includes provisions on trade in goods and services, investment, dispute resolution, rules of origin, safeguards, and more. The Mexico-Central America Free Trade Agreement (FTA) was signed on November 22, 2011, after eight rounds of negotiations. It replaced three former FTAs and was ratified by all parties by September 1, 2013. The FTA aimed to converge existing agreements between Mexico and Central American countries into a single regional agreement. Mexico has negotiated a series of FTAs with Central American countries based on the NAFTA model. The agreements with Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and the Northern Triangle (El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras) aimed to eliminate tariffs on exports over a phased period. The Mexico-Northern Triangle FTA, also known as the Mexico-Panama FTA, was finalized in 2000 and 2015 respectively. Mexico had previous partial scope agreements with Central American countries before these FTAs. The Mexico-Panama FTA negotiations started in 2013 and were completed in 2014, allowing Panama to join the Pacific Alliance. The FTA between Mexico and Panama includes provisions on intellectual property rights, rules of origin, dispute resolution, and covers about 4,000 tariffs. Mexico has pursued further trade liberalization through agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The TPP was signed by multiple countries in 2016, but the United States later decided not to ratify it. Mexico is interested in pursuing regional trade agreements with other TPP members to reduce tariff and nontariff barriers on goods, services, and agriculture. A potential agreement similar to the TPP could enhance Mexico's trade relationships with other countries in the region. Mexico is part of the Pacific Alliance, along with Chile, Colombia, and Peru, aiming to create a regional trading bloc and strengthen economic ties with the Asia-Pacific region. The United States has observer status in the Alliance and has free trade agreements with all four countries. The Alliance was officially formed with the signing of the Lima Declaration to promote deep economic integration. Costa Rica and Panama are potential full members in the future. The Pacific Alliance aims to create deep economic integration, promote regional competitiveness, and become a platform for trade integration with the Asia-Pacific region. Membership requires free trade agreements with all member countries. The Alliance's approach is pragmatic and outwardly focused, with member countries sharing similar economic and political ideals. Member countries of the Pacific Alliance have signed agreements to share facilities and eliminate tariffs. The Alliance aims for deep economic integration and includes free movement of people and stock market integration. Mexico and Bolivia signed a comprehensive FTA in 1994, based on NAFTA. The Bolivian government terminated the previous FTA with Mexico in 2010 due to chapters deemed unconstitutional under a new constitution. A new Economic Complementation Agreement (ECA) was signed, maintaining free trade of goods without changing tariff treatment. The GSTP is an integration agreement among developing countries to promote trade with tariff preferences. It was established in 1988 and aims to expand in successive stages through negotiations. The GSTP is an integration agreement among developing countries established in the early 1990s to expand trade preferences. Mexico is a signatory to ALADI, a Latin American integration association formed in 1980. ALADI aims to develop a common market in Latin America but has made little progress towards this goal. In 1984, Mexico approved a regional tariff preference arrangement and expanded it in 1987 and 1990. Mexico is also a member of the Protocol Relating to Trade Negotiations among Developing Countries (PTN) signed in 1971. In 2016, Mexico's leading export items were passenger motor vehicles, motor vehicle parts, and automatic data process machines. Leading import items included motor vehicle parts, refined petroleum oil products, and electronic integrated circuits. Mexico's trade with the world has increased rapidly since trade liberalization. Since trade liberalization, Mexico's trade with the world has grown significantly. Exports surged by 515% from $60.8 billion in 1994 to $373.9 billion in 2016, while imports increased from $79.3 billion to $387.1 billion during the same period. Despite fluctuations, Mexico's trade balance shifted from deficits to surpluses in the mid-90s but has since remained in deficit, reaching $13.2 billion in 2016. However, its trade balance with the United States showed a surplus of $122.0 billion in 2016, indicating a consistent reliance on the US as a trade partner. Mexico's trade with the United States has remained relatively stable, with a slight decrease in exports to the US from 83% to 81% between 1996 and 2016. The share of US products in Mexico's imports decreased from 75% to 47% during the same period, while imports from non-FTA countries increased from 8% to 34%. Mexico's imports from China have also seen a significant increase despite not having an FTA with China. Imports from China to Mexico have increased significantly in recent years, reaching $69.5 billion in 2016, accounting for 18% of total imports. This surpasses imports from the European Union and Japan. Mexico's heavy reliance on the United States as an export market makes its economy vulnerable to US economic and political conditions, as seen during the 2009 global financial crisis and the aftermath of President Trump's election in 2016. Donald Trump promised in November 2016 to withdraw from NAFTA and build a border wall with Mexico. Mexico's manufacturing sector offers strategic and financial benefits for foreign companies, with advantages over China such as lower labor costs and proximity to the United States. However, Mexico faces strong competition from China and other Asian economies in the manufacturing sector. In 2003, China surpassed Mexico as the second-largest source of U.S. imports. Mexico's free trade agreements and trade liberalization policies are crucial for U.S.-Mexico trade and economic stability. The impact of Mexico's FTAs on U.S. exports is a concern for policymakers, as competition for U.S. goods in the Mexican market has increased. The Trump Administration's initial trade policies include U.S. withdrawal from NAFTA. The Trump Administration's trade policies involve U.S. withdrawal from TPP and possible renegotiation of NAFTA. Some TPP signatories are moving forward on a similar agreement without the U.S., impacting U.S. competitiveness. Mexico is open to negotiating a new agreement with the Asia-Pacific region. Potential changes in NAFTA could disrupt supply chains in North America, affecting economic conditions and jobs, especially in Mexico. Mexico's trade liberalization policy, mainly NAFTA, has brought economic and social benefits but poverty persists in some regions. Renegotiation of NAFTA could address issues like services trade, rules of origin, government procurement, intellectual property rights, labor, and the environment. Mexico is considering modernizing NAFTA and broadening negotiations to include security and immigration cooperation."
