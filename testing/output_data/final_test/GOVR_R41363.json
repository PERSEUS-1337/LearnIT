Despite progress in access to care and treatment, these diseases remain leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The Fund aims to attract additional resources for the global fight against these diseases. The Global Fund, established in 2002, aims to attract financial resources for the global fight against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria in developing countries. The Fund operates with low overhead expenses, rigorous monitoring, and evaluation requirements, transparency in decision-making, and partnerships among governments, the private sector, and civil society. Its board meets twice annually to discuss governance issues and grant approval. The Global Fund, established in 2002, aims to attract financial resources for the global fight against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria in developing countries. Donors pledged $947.2 million in 2001 and 2002 to launch the Global Fund. The Fund committed to supporting 58 programs in 43 countries with $616 million in its first round of grants. In December 2010, the Global Fund Board announced support for the 10th round of grant proposals valued at over $1.7 billion for the first two years of project implementation. The Global Fund has approved $22.6 billion to help 150 countries fight HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria, with $15 billion disbursed by mid-February 2012. It accounts for a significant portion of global spending on these diseases and estimated to have saved over 7.7 million lives by the end of 2011. Grants have provided AIDS treatment for 3.3 million HIV-positive people and anti-tuberculosis treatment for 8.6 million. The Global Fund announced the cancellation of its 11th round of funding in November 2011 due to inadequate resources from donors. A Transitional Funding Mechanism was put in place to prevent disruptions in ongoing services until new funding is available in 2014. The board adopted a new five-year strategy for 2012-2016, focusing on more aggressive management, flexibility in tailoring activities to specific country needs, and increased country ownership of programs. The Global Fund approved a Consolidated Transformation Plan to improve governance and operations, following recommendations from a 2011 report. The Executive Director announced his resignation in January 2012, leading to the creation of a new General Manager position to oversee the plan's implementation. The Global Fund aims to provide life-saving measures to the world's poorest, especially in countries with weak programmatic and oversight capacity. The Global Fund developed a performance-based system with seven main actors, including the Country Coordinating Mechanism (CCM), Principal Recipients, Sub-Recipients, Local Fund Agents, and the Secretariat, to improve governance and operations in countries with weak programmatic and oversight capacity. The Global Fund's Secretariat oversees day-to-day operations, resource mobilization, grant implementation, and reporting to the board and the public. The Technical Review Board evaluates grant proposals for technical merit, while the Global Fund Board governs the Fund. Various oversight mechanisms are in place, including internal controls by Principal Recipients, in-country verification by Local Fund Agents, audits by external bodies, monitoring by the Secretariat, investigations by the Office of the Inspector General, and oversight by the Global Fund. The Global Fund oversees grant proposals and provides resources for the first two years of programs. Subsequent financing is dependent on demonstrating results against performance targets outlined in the proposals. Performance indicators are monitored in four stages: proposal development, grant negotiation, implementation, and evaluation. The Global Fund requires legally binding contracts with time-bound targets for grant performance. Monitoring and evaluation systems are crucial, with 5%-10% of grant budgets allocated for this purpose. Performance-based disbursements are made based on regular reporting by the Principal Recipient, verified by the Local Fund Agent. The Secretariat evaluates grant performance and decides on disbursement amounts, with corrective action required for lack of progress. The Global Fund evaluates grant performance towards the end of Phase 1 to determine funding continuation, reduction, or termination based on impact and efficiency. The organization has a performance-based model and takes corrective action for inadequate performance, including grant termination or replacement of recipients. The United States has been a strong supporter of the Global Fund since its establishment. The United States has been a strong supporter of the Global Fund since its establishment, with officials from various agencies involved in its creation. The Obama Administration has expressed its commitment to continue supporting the Global Fund, linking its success to U.S. bilateral HIV/AIDS programs under PEPFAR. Ambassador Eric Goosby emphasized the importance of the Global Fund as a platform for countries without bilateral programs to contribute. The Global Fund serves as a platform for countries without bilateral programs to contribute to HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria prevention and treatment. The United States has been a key contributor, providing $300 million in the Fund's first budget period. The Fund's success is linked to U.S. bilateral HIV/AIDS programs under PEPFAR. The United States made its first multiyear pledge of $4 billion to the Global Fund in 2010. Congress historically appropriated U.S. contributions to the Fund through two appropriations bills. Congressional support for the Global Fund has been consistent, with appropriations exceeding requested levels each year, except in FY2012. In FY2011 and FY2012, appropriations for the Global Fund remained at $1.05 billion. President Obama requested an additional $250 million in FY2012 to meet his multiyear pledge to the Fund. In FY2013, the Administration requested $1.65 billion for the Global Fund, a 57% increase from FY2012-enacted levels. The Global Fund aims to evaluate and adapt its operations and grants according to changing needs and circumstances. The Global Fund's Board hired an independent team of experts to conduct a five-year evaluation of its grants to assess performance goals and adherence to founding principles. The evaluation, overseen by public health experts, assessed the efficiency and effectiveness of the Global Fund's structure, as well as its impact. The Global Fund's five-year evaluation assessed the efficiency and effectiveness of its structure, partnership system impact, and grant impact on diseases. Independent expert evaluations have inspired reforms, with the 2009 evaluation focusing on sustainability, health system strengthening, and donor coordination improvements. The Global Fund implemented changes based on the evaluation's recommendations. In 2009, the Global Fund implemented changes based on recommendations from evaluations. In September 2010, a reform agenda was established for a more efficient and effective Global Fund. The board approved the agenda at the 22nd meeting in December 2010 and established a Comprehensive Reform Working Group. Measures approved at the 23rd meeting in May 2011 included strengthening accountability, enhancing fiduciary control, and improving partnerships. The Global Fund implemented reforms in 2009 based on evaluations, with a reform agenda established in 2010 for efficiency. The reforms include strengthening partnerships, enhancing value for money, improving governance, and adapting the business model, all reaffirmed in the 2012-2016 Global Fund Strategy. The Global Fund implemented reforms in 2009 based on evaluations, with a reform agenda established in 2010 for efficiency, all reaffirmed in the 2012-2016 Global Fund Strategy. The Global Fund has been developing a common platform for funding and planning programs that strengthen health systems with GAVI and World Bank since 2009. This new platform aims to establish common funding policies, eligibility criteria, review mechanisms, technical support, and performance measurement. Expected benefits include reduced costs, increased focus on health systems strengthening, predictability of donor funding, and improved harmonization of funding and programming. The platform will be implemented in 2014. The Associated Press article in 2011 highlighted corruption in Global Fund grants to Mali, Djibouti, Mauritania, and Zambia. Critics and supporters discussed corruption in foreign aid and the Fund's response. The Global Fund has a zero-tolerance policy for corruption and has taken actions to address fraud, including freezing disbursements. The Global Fund announced measures to reinforce financial safeguards and prevent fraud in its grants, including expanding monitoring firms' mandate, strengthening grant oversight, increasing scrutiny on high-risk activities, redirecting funds for financial controls, and hiring more staff for financial management. The Global Fund implemented measures to strengthen financial safeguards and prevent fraud in its grants, including increasing staff for financial management and doubling the budget of the Inspector General. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee released a report with recommendations to enhance oversight of procurement procedures and highlighted steps taken by the Fund to prevent financial mismanagement. In April 2011, the Global Fund established a Comprehensive Reform Working Group to recommend financial reforms and released a report on safeguarding against misuse of funds. The report identified $44.2 million misused in 11 countries, with 63% in Djibouti, Mali, Mauritania, and Zambia. Further misuse of funds was found in Nigeria in October 2011. The Global Fund is seeking restitution and supporting criminal investigations. The Global Fund is seeking restitution for misused funds and supporting criminal investigations in Mali, Mauritania, and Zambia. The Office of the Inspector General proposed reconsidering the Fund's model and reevaluating the Key Performance Indicator structure to address fraud and financial misappropriation risks. The Office of the Inspector General recommended revisiting the Key Performance Indicator structure to address risks of fraud and financial misappropriation. They also suggested developing tools to measure quality product delivery and resource utilization. Additionally, they proposed enforcing policies at the country level, establishing capacity standards for Principal Recipients, and improving oversight by Country Coordinating Mechanisms. The Global Fund signed an agreement with the International Aid Transparency Initiative on June 23, 2011. The Global Fund signed an agreement with the International Aid Transparency Initiative to publicly disclose aid data. In September 2011, a report recommended improving financial oversight and grant application processes. The Global Fund Board adopted the recommendations and released a plan for implementing reforms. The Global Fund implemented reforms to increase efficiency, manage risks, and engage partners at various levels. A new policy divided resources into General Funding Pool and Targeted Funding Pool, with the majority allocated to countries with large disease burdens and limited resources. The Global Fund introduced a new policy dividing resources into General Funding Pool and Targeted Funding Pool, with predefined budget ceilings. Upper middle-income countries must demonstrate extreme disease burden to be eligible for both pools, focusing on MARPs and highest impact interventions. Counterpart Financing requirements replace the old Cost Sharing Policy. The new Counterpart Financing policy requires all recipient countries to increase government contributions to national disease programs and health annually. Countries must provide a minimum contribution based on income criteria, with a focus on highest-impact countries according to the Global Fund Strategy 2012-2016. The Global Fund Board implemented a revised application process for grant renewals in November 2011, excluding G-20 upper middle-income countries with low disease burden. In 2008, the board simplified its funding architecture by introducing Single Stream Agreements for grant funding. The Global Fund is consolidating agreements to reduce reporting burden on grant recipients and align work plans, budgets, and targets. Adherence to the new funding architecture is voluntary for round 10 and required for future rounds. The implementation of Single Stream Agreements will replace the Rolling Continuation Channel for funding. The board also decided to pilot a new grant proposal process called the National Strategy Application to align grant proposals with national health strategies and reduce transaction costs for recipient countries. The Global Fund is implementing a new funding architecture to reduce reporting burden and align work plans. Dual-track financing allows grants to be managed by two primary recipients, one representing national governments and the other civil society organizations. CSOs play key roles in global health, including advocacy and service delivery. Civil society engagement in global health plays a crucial role in advocacy, service delivery, and policy-setting. The Global Fund utilizes dual-track financing to manage grants, with 84% meeting or exceeding expectations by 2009. Debt2Health initiative allows countries to redirect debt interest payments to public health via the Global Fund, with agreements expected to channel $107 million towards disease-fighting efforts. The Affordable Medicines Facility\u2013malaria (AMFm) initiative, launched in April 2009, aims to improve access to artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) by negotiating lower treatment prices with drug manufacturers. Managed by the Global Fund, UNITAID, DFID, and other donors finance and implement the initiative separately. Through AMFm, the Global Fund anticipates ACTs supplanting cheaper, commonly used anti-malarial drugs with high drug resistance rates. Several health experts urge the Global Fund to finance rapid diagnostic tests to complement AMFm activities and prevent drug resistance to ACTs. The Global Fund launched the Voluntary Pooled Procurement (VPP) Initiative in June 2009 to decrease prices, expand access to quality medicines, and improve the reliability of drug supplies. The initiative focuses on four product categories: first-line antiretroviral treatment (ART), second-line ART, ACT drugs, and long-lasting insecticide treated nets (LLINs). The Global Fund aims to strengthen national health systems by monitoring prices, cost savings, and market shares. The Global Fund aims to strengthen national procurement systems and supply chain management by monitoring prices, cost savings, and market shares. They have procured goods in over 40 countries worth more than $500 million between June 2009 and December 2010. The United States has been a strong supporter of the Fund since 2001, with higher contributions than any other country and Congress steadily raising appropriations. Despite this support, there are laws in place that limit U.S. spending on the Fund. The 112th Congress debates U.S. spending on global health programs, including the Global Fund. Some Members question non-security foreign aid, arguing for cuts that could impact vulnerable populations. The FY2013 budget request includes a significant increase to $1.65 billion for the Global Fund, while some propose cuts in bilateral global health programs. Key questions remain on whether the Congress will approve the increase amidst ongoing debate. The 112th Congress debates U.S. spending on global health programs, including the Global Fund. The proposed increase to $1.65 billion for the Global Fund is under scrutiny, with ongoing congressional debate on limiting government spending. The focus is on whether the Fund will receive a larger share of U.S. global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria spending in FY2013. Some experts urge Congress to consider the impact of the Global Fund on all three diseases. The Global Fund committed $12 billion to HIV/AIDS programs by the end of 2010, surpassing U.S. spending levels on TB and malaria projects. It allocated three times more funding to TB and malaria activities compared to the United States, with $3.6 billion dedicated to TB programs in 2009. U.S. support for the Global Fund enables investment in TB programs, crucial for addressing HIV/TB co-infection in sub-Saharan Africa. The Global Fund has committed significant funds to malaria programs, accounting for a large portion of total donor spending. U.S. investments in global malaria programs have also increased, but are still lower than Global Fund commitments. Some experts argue that the Global Fund's grant process allows for greater country ownership and flexibility in tailoring programs. The Global Fund allows for greater country ownership and flexibility in tailoring programs, which may lead to more sustainable outcomes. However, some experts argue that the Global Fund model is more unpredictable and difficult to track compared to bilateral programs. The United States is a key donor for international malaria and TB programs, sparking debates on its leadership role in global health initiatives. Many urge Congress to increase appropriations to the Global Fund, but U.S. contributions are limited to 33% of all contributions. The contribution limit was set to encourage greater global support for the Fund, leading some to argue that the U.S. ceiling should remain. The Global Fund announced budget reductions for approved grants in round 9. Donors pledged support for the Fund's programs from 2011 to 2013, with estimates of $13 billion to $20 billion needed for maintenance and scaling-up efforts. The Global Fund announced budget reductions for approved grants in round 9, with donors pledging $11.7 billion over the next three years. The U.S. pledged $4 billion, followed by pledges from Luxembourg and Rwanda. Due to inadequate resources, the Global Fund canceled its 11th round of funding, leading to concerns about the impact on TB, malaria, and HIV/AIDS efforts. The Global Fund faces concerns about financing qualified grants from developing countries, with some urging the organization to address its own capacity before seeking increased support from Congress. The US aims to better coordinate with the Global Fund through the Global Health Initiative, emphasizing cooperation with key multilateral organizations and private sector engagement. The Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC) emphasized partnership with the Global Fund in its Five-Year Strategy report, outlining steps for long-term sustainability. Questions arise about U.S. commitment to donor coordination, with efforts to align project implementation lacking a formalized framework. The Global Fund is developing a joint funding platform for health systems strengthening with other groups, but the U.S. has limited support for this initiative. OGAC has expressed limited support for increased coordination among health system strengthening donors. Critics argue that the Global Fund's oversight mechanisms are not strong enough to prevent wasteful spending, especially in corrupt countries. Fund supporters defend its transparency through evaluations and findings on its website. The Global Fund has demonstrated commitment to reporting and monitoring its projects by providing detailed information on grant proposals, budgets, spending trends, and board meeting decisions on its website. Some advocates argue that the Fund's suspension of poor performing grants shows effective oversight. Congress has pushed for stronger oversight of Global Fund spending, with measures in FY2006 and FY2008 requiring the Secretary of State to withhold up to 20% of the U.S. contribution until reporting standards were met. In FY2009, the withholding was reduced to 10%. The Lantos-Hyde Act required the Secretary of State to withhold 20% of the U.S. contribution to the Global Fund until certain requirements were met. The FY2012 appropriations included language requiring up to 10% withholding until transparency and oversight measures were implemented. The U.S. government has not withheld funds based on whistleblower policy provisions. The Global AIDS Coordinator has signed certifications in past years. The State Department will report to Congress on FY2012 provision after September 2012. Global Fund supporters argue that withholding funds is unnecessary due to transparency in grant performance. Experts praise the Global Fund's efforts in addressing fraud and urge the U.S. to release similar information. The Global Fund's efforts in addressing fraud are praised, and there are calls for the U.S. to release similar information on its bilateral health programs. Recommendations include making U.S. contributions to the Global Fund contingent on reforms and withholding funding to UNDP until certain modifications are made. The Global Fund's Inspector General, World Bank's Inspector General, and investigative arms of multilateral organizations should have full access to audits and records. U.S. contributions to the Global Fund should be withheld until certification is received. The Government Accountability Office should study the coordination of oversight offices for global health programs. The U.S. Representative to the Global Fund should emphasize zero tolerance for fraud and ensure the Inspector General has adequate resources. The Office of the Inspector General needs resources to audit programs. Global Fund should ensure agents are trained to detect fraud. US should analyze investments in international organizations like UK did. US should collaborate with host governments on country's development. The Global Fund has made efforts to increase transparency and sustainability in its health programs, with over 1,000 projects funded in 150 countries. Despite saving millions of lives, there are concerns about the balance between U.S. support for the Global Fund and bilateral programs for HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. The Global Fund, bilateral HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs are being debated in the 112th Congress. The President's FY2013 budget proposes decreased funding for bilateral programs and increased funding for the Global Fund, sparking a debate on the distribution of U.S. support. Experts argue about the efficiency and sustainability of multilateral programs compared to bilateral ones. The President's FY2013 budget proposes decreased funding for bilateral programs and increased funding for the Global Fund, sparking a debate on the distribution of U.S. support. Despite calls for stronger collaboration with the Global Fund, the extent of such efforts remains unclear. The United States has expressed limited support for a joint funding platform for health systems strengthening, emphasizing each donor's unique mandate and role. The team of experts evaluating the Global Fund warned that recipient countries may struggle to maintain current assistance levels without investing in health systems. The Global Health Initiative aims to enhance health systems by addressing bottlenecks, improving data collection, strengthening human resources, and coordinating donors. Some experts suggest supporting national health plans and filling gaps in basic health services for HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria efforts. Questions arise about using Global Fund resources in middle-income countries. In 2010, 11 countries were considered both donors and recipients of Global Fund resources, including China, India, Malaysia, Namibia, Nigeria, Romania, Rwanda, Russia, South Africa, Thailand, and Tunisia. China, with its growing economy, has received significant attention due to the grants it has received. As a lower middle-income country, China is eligible for Global Fund grants but is expected to contribute to program costs. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee's minority report suggests that as China becomes an upper middle-income country, it should no longer receive Global Fund resources. The Global Fund approved a new policy in 2011 limiting funding for middle-income countries and requiring contributions to national health strategies. G-20 upper middle-income countries may no longer be eligible for grant renewals without an extreme disease burden. The Fund's response to corruption allegations sparked debate in the foreign aid community regarding transparency and accountability. Advocates acknowledge the Global Fund's efforts to reform fiduciary practices and reduce corruption, but some suggest withholding support until adequate safeguards are in place. Questions arise about the Fund's transparency in reporting misused funds and the potential consequences of reduced funding on life-saving aid programs."
