    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Mental Health Justice Act, also known as the Mental Health Justice Act, highlights the impact of violence on mental health, especially in underserved communities. It points out the high number of individuals with mental illness in prisons compared to treatment facilities, leading to increased spending on mental health in correctional facilities. California's prisons are facing a rising demand for mental health services, with inmates requiring treatment at higher rates. In California, the annual cost for an inmate in the general population is $51,000, while for a person with mental illness in community housing and outpatient treatment, it is $20,412. Nearly half of California prisoners are mentally ill, with a doubling in the past 15 years. Individuals with mental illnesses stay longer in prison and have a higher risk of returning. Mental health court participants have a lower recidivism rate and save costs. According to the United States Supreme Court, conditions in California prisons worsen mental health issues for offenders. Mental illness leads to higher rates of trauma, restraints, solitary confinement, and overmedication. Isolated individuals face increased risks of psychiatric injury, self-harm, and suicide. Defendant's mental illness should influence case processing and charges, with a focus on public safety and constitutional rights. California needs to expand diversion programs to steer mentally ill defendants away from prisons and towards effective mental health treatment services. CHAPTER 16. Mental Health Treatment 1425. If a defendant has a mental illness contributing to criminal conduct, evidence can be submitted before sentencing. The court must consider this evidence for sentencing and may order actions for public safety. The defendant may serve their sentence in a mental health treatment facility instead of prison or jail if deemed safe. The Department of Corrections must provide appropriate mental health care within 30 days of placement. The Department of Corrections or county jail must prepare a postrelease mental health treatment plan for defendants six months before release to parole or supervision. The plan includes mental health services, medication management, housing, and substance abuse treatment. Defendants or prosecutors can request to transfer a defendant from a mental health facility to a prison or jail for the remainder of their sentence. The defendant, prosecutor, Department of Corrections, or county jail authority can petition the court to remove the defendant from a mental health program or dismiss the requirement for a postrelease mental health treatment plan. The defendant has the right to counsel for all proceedings under this section. The defendant, after pleading guilty or being convicted of a felony or misdemeanor, can petition the court for a sentence including mental health treatment if eligible for public mental health services or Social Security Disability Insurance benefits due to a diagnosed mental illness. The burden of proof lies with the defendant to establish eligibility. The court may order the defendant's sentence to include serving in a mental health treatment facility instead of prison if it is in the public interest and the defendant meets certain criteria. This option is not available for defendants with violent felony convictions or those required to serve their entire sentence in state prison. The court may order a defendant to serve in a mental health program within the prison system, determined by mental health staff, within 30 days of sentencing, regardless of the offense. The court may order a defendant to serve in a mental health program within the prison system, determined by mental health staff, within 30 days of sentencing, regardless of the offense. Additionally, a requirement is in place for the preparation of a postrelease mental health treatment plan six months prior to the defendant's release from custody, specifying the mental health treatment services to be received post-release. The court may recall a sentence with a mental health treatment order if in the public interest, allowing for resentencing with credit for time served. The defendant has the right to counsel for all proceedings. Reimbursement for mandated costs will be made to local agencies if determined by the Commission on State Mandates."
